==Background==
Since 23 August 2017, parts of Haryana, Punjab and [[Chandigarh capital region|Chandigarh]] had been under a security lockdown as 200,000 supporters of Ram Rahim amassed in Panchkula ahead of the verdict.&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ram Rahim rape verdict LIVE: 29 killed; dera says ‘we have been wronged’|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/gurmeet-ram-rahim-rape-verdict-live-dera-sacha-sauda-chief-to-appear-in-panchkula-court-punjab-haryana-on-high-alert/story-YO4q3FLriRRV8zpaL0ZfAO.html|accessdate=25 August 2017|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy contingent of security was deployed for the verdict including 97 [[CRPF]] companies; 16 [[Rapid Action Force]]; 37 [[Sashastra Seema Bal]]; 12 [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] and 21 [[Border Security Force]] companies. Another 10 companies were kept on standby.&lt;ref name="India Today"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/live-updates-gurmeet-ram-rahim-dera-sacha-sauda-panchkula-sirsa/1/1033540.html|title=Ram Rahim guilty of rape: What happened through the day|date=25 August 2017|work=[[India Today]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities had suspended internet services for 48 hours and [[Section 144]] of the Indian Penal Code (prohibiting an assembly of more than four people) was imposed in [[Sri Ganganagar]], [[Rajasthan]] (Ram Rahim's birth-village) in light of the expected verdict. Electricity was cut in a few residential areas in Panchkula as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref name="India Today"/&gt;

On 25 August 2017, around 15:00 ([[Indian Standard Time|IST]]), a special [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) court in [[Panchkula]], Haryana, delivered its verdict in a 2002 sexual assault case of two [[sadhvi]]s (female followers) of [[Dera Sacha Sauda]] (DSS). The court found the DSS chief [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] — known as "the guru of bling"&lt;ref name="WP2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/25/indias-guru-of-bling-convicted-of-rape/|title=India’s ‘guru of bling’ is convicted of raping two followers.

The sentence was scheduled to be pronounced on 28 August 2017.&lt;ref name="ToI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="India Today"/&gt; He faced a minimum of seven years' imprisonment. Before the verdict, Ram Rahim appealed to his followers to remain calm, after having made the 250&amp;nbsp;km (156&amp;nbsp;mi) journey from the sect's headquarters in Sirsa to Panchkula in a 100-vehicle convoy.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;

Soon afterwards, Ram Rahim's '[[Z plus security status|Z+ security cover]]' was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death Toll In Haryana Violence Rises To 36, Thirteen Bodies Identified|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/08/27/death-toll-in-haryana-violence-rises-to-36-thirteen-bodies-identified_a_23186754/|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=[[Huffington Post]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only 36 people in India under that level of government-provided security cover.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news|last1=John|first1=Tara|title=What to Know About India's 'Guru of Bling' Whose Rape Conviction Sparked Riots|url=http://time.com/4915521/gurmeet-ram-rahim-singh-guru-convicted-rape/|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ram Rahim was later taken into judicial custody&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and was reportedly moved to the Western Command Headquarters in [[Chandimandir Cantonment]].&lt;ref name="India Today"/&gt; Later, he was flown by helicopter to a jail in the nearby town of [[Rohtak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jain|first1=Rishabh|title=Uneasy calm after 36 die in India riots over guru verdict|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/calm-returns-after-30-die-in-india-riots-over-guru-verdict/2017/08/25/cf068746-89fd-11e7-96a7-d178cf3524eb_story.html|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict, Ram Rahim supporters were evicted from Panchkula and Chandigarh. Police and paramilitary forces used [[tear gas]] shelling in Sector 3, Panchkula, to control Dera supporters which led to clashes.&lt;ref name="India Today"/&gt;

'''Arnold Dashefsky''', born in 1942, is a professor at the [[University of Connecticut]] who has written several books on the topics relating to [[Jewish]] [[ethnicity]], [[culture]], [[ideologies]], among others.

Dashefsky is currently director of the [[North American Jewish Data Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff  {{!}} Berman Jewish DataBank |url=https://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/staff.cfm |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Dashefsky's key theses is that [[Jewish identity]] is taken for granted in populations, such as [[Israel]] where Jews make up a majority of the population. Furthermore, he has asserted that the number of Jews in the [[United States]] is roughly the same as the number of Jews in Israel. Hence, he feels that Jewish identity should be no less strong in either nation.

{{nihongo|'''Aleph'''|アレフ|Arefu||lead=yes}}, formerly {{nihongo|'''Aum Shinrikyo'''|オウム真理教|Oumu Shinrikyō||lead=no}}, is a Japanese [[doomsday cult]] founded by [[Shoko Asahara]] in 1984. It carried out the deadly [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]] in 1995 and was found to have been responsible for [[Matsumoto sarin attack|another smaller sarin attack]] the previous year.

The group never confessed. They claim that those who carried out attacks did so secretly, without being known to other executives and ordinary believers. Asahara broadcast his singing, insisting on his innocence through a radio broadcast on a signal they purchased in Russia and directed toward [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=FAS.org|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|author=Senate Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|date=31 October 1995|url=http://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part06.htm|title=VI.

On 6 July 2018, after exhausting all appeals, Asahara and six other followers were executed by Japan, as punishment for the 1995 attacks and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Austin|last=Ramzy|url=https://nyti.ms/2KSPKGb|title=Japan Executes Cult Leader Behind 1995 Sarin Gas Subway Attack|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-executions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-asia-43395483|title=Tokyo Sarin attack: Aum Shinrikyo cult leaders executed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 July 2018|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 2018, the remaining 6 followers on death row were executed by Japan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44962581&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
Aum Shinrikyo/Aleph is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] belief system that draws upon Asahara's idiosyncratic interpretations of elements of early [[Indian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], as well as [[Hinduism]], taking [[Shiva]] as the main image of worship and incorporating [[millennialist]] ideas from the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Book of Revelation]], [[Yoga]], and the writings of [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aptitude for Destruction: Case Studies of Organizational Learning in Five Terrorist Groups|last1=Jackson|first1=Brian Anthony|first2=John C.|last2=Baker|year=2005|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|isbn=978-0-8330-3767-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious Violence in Contemporary Japan: The Case of Aum Shinrikyō|first=Ian|last=Reader|year=2000|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|isbn=978-0824823405|pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, [[Chizuo Matsumoto]], claimed that he sought to restore "original Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_SecondEdition_English.pdf|title=Aum Shinrikyo Insights Into How Terrorists Develop Biological and Chemical Weapons|first1=Richard|last1=Danzig|first2=Marc|last2=Sageman|first3=Terrance|last3=Leighton|first4=Lloyd|last4=Hough|first5=Hidemi|last5=Yuki|first6=Rui|last6=Kotani|first7=Zachary M.|last7=Hosford|year=2000|publisher=[[Center for a New American Security]]|page=10|access-date=14 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316122438/http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_SecondEdition_English.pdf|archive-date=16 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1992, Matsumoto, who had changed his name to Shoko Asahara, published a foundational book, declaring himself to be "[[Christ (title)|Christ]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deadly Cults: The Crimes of True Believers|last=Snow|first=Robert L.|year=2003|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-275-98052-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's only fully enlightened master, as well as identifying himself as the "[[Lamb of God]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Re-Enchantment of the West: Alternative Spiritualities, Sacralization, Popular Culture, and Occulture|last=Partridge|first=Christopher Hugh|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-567-04133-3|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asahara's purported mission was to take upon himself the [[sins]] of the world, and he claimed he could transfer spiritual power to his followers and ultimately take away their sins and bad deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The War on Terrorism and the Terror of God|last=Griffith|first=Lee|year=2004|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|isbn=978-0-8028-2860-6|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many discount Aum Shinrikyo's claims of Buddhist characteristics and his affiliations with [[Buddhism]], scholars often refer to it as an offshoot of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|first=Mark|last=Juergensmeyer|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|page=103|isbn=0-520-24011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was how the movement generally defined and saw itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poisonous Cocktail: Aum Shinrikyo's Path to Violence|first=Ian|last=Reader|publisher=NIAS Publications|year=1996|page=16|isbn=87-87062-55-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asahara outlined a doomsday prophecy, which included a [[World War&amp;nbsp;III|third world war]] instigated by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns|last=Cronin|first=Audrey Kurth|year=2009|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-13948-7|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Robert Jay Lifton]], an American psychiatrist and author:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Asahara] described a final conflict culminating in a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] '[[Armageddon]]', borrowing the term from the Book of Revelation {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|16:16}}"&lt;ref name=lifton&gt;{{cite book|last=Lifton|first=Robert Jay|title= Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Humanity would end, except for the elite few who joined Aum.&lt;ref name=kaplan2/&gt; Aum's mission was not only to spread the word of "[[salvation]]", but also to survive these "[[End Times]]". Asahara predicted that Armageddon would occur in 1997.&lt;ref name=kaplan2/&gt; Kaplan notes that in his lectures, Shoko Asahara referred to the United States as "[[The Beast (Revelation)|The Beast]]" from the Book of Revelation, predicting it would eventually attack Japan.&lt;ref name=kaplan2/&gt; 

Arthur Goldwag, author of a book on conspiracies and secret societies, characterizes Asahara as one who "saw dark conspiracies everywhere promulgated by [[Jews]], [[Freemasons]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], the [[British royal family]], and rival [[Religion in Japan|Japanese religions]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies: The Straight Scoop on Freemasons, the Illuminati, Skull and Bones, Black Helicopters, the New World Order, and Many, Many More|last=Goldwag|first=Arthur|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=978-0-307-39067-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Daniel A. Metraux, Aum Shinrikyo justified its violence through its own unique interpretation of Buddhist ideas and doctrines, such as the Buddhist concepts of [[Three Ages of Buddhism|''Mappō'' and ''Shōhō'']]. Aum claimed that by bringing about the end of the world, they would restore ''Shōhō''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Metraux|first=Daniel A.| work= Asian Survey| title= Religious Terrorism in Japan: The Fatal Appeal of Aum Shinrikyo| volume= 35|number=12|date=December 1995|page=1153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lifton believes, Asahara "interpreted the Tibetan Buddhist concept of ''[[Phowa|powa]]'' in order to claim that by killing someone contrary to the group's aims, they were preventing them from accumulating bad karma and thus saving them".&lt;ref name=lifton/&gt;

The name {{nihongo|"Aum Shinrikyo"|オウム真理教|Oumu Shinrikyō}}, usually rendered in English as "Aum Supreme Truth", derives from the [[Sanskrit]] syllable ''[[Om|Aum]]'', used to represent [[Universe|the universe]], followed by the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''Shinrikyo'' (meaning, roughly, "Teaching of Truth") written in [[kanji]]. (In Japanese, kanji are used to write both words that are originally Japanese as well as [[Sino-xenic]] words, but they are not usually used to transcribe those which are borrowed directly from exotic foreign languages.) 

In 2000, the organization changed its name to "Aleph" (a reference to the [[Aleph|first letter]] of the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Arabic alphabet]]s), and it also replaced its logo.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==History==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Aum Shinrikyo.jpg|thumb|The old symbol of Aum Shinrikyo. The spiritual icon ''[[Aum]]'' (ॐ) is popular used among eastern religions including [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]]]

The movement was founded by [[Shoko Asahara]] in his one-bedroom apartment in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya ward]] in 1984, starting off as a [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wolves Within the Fold: Religious Leadership and Abuses of Power|last=Shupe|first=Anson D.|year=1998|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-2489-4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as {{nihongo|''Oumu Shinsen no Kai''|オウム神仙の会|"Aum club of gods and hermits"}} and steadily grew in the following years. It gained the official status as a [[religious organization]] in 1989 and attracted a considerable number of graduates from Japan's elite universities, thus being dubbed a "religion for the elite".&lt;ref name=controversial&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversial New Religions|last=Lewis|first=James R.|author2=Jesper Aagaard Petersen|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-515683-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
Although Aum was considered controversial in Japan, it had yet to be associated with serious crimes. It was during this period that Asahara became obsessed with [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecies]]. Aum's public relations activities included publishing comics and animated cartoons that attempted to tie its religious ideas to popular [[anime]] and [[manga]] themes, including space missions, powerful weapons, world conspiracies, and quest for ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Visual Culture: Explorations in the World of Manga and Anime|last=Macwilliams|first=Mary Wheeler|year=2008|publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]]|isbn=978-0-7656-1602-9|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aum published several magazines including ''[[Vajrayana]] Sacca'' and ''Enjoy Happiness'', adopting a somewhat missionary attitude.&lt;ref name=controversial/&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s science fiction ''[[Foundation Trilogy]]'' was referenced "depicting as it does an elite group of spiritually evolved scientists forced to go underground during an age of barbarism so as to prepare themselves for the moment...when they will emerge to rebuild civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/24/alqaida.sciencefictionfantasyandhorror|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=What is the origin of the name al-Qaida?|date=24 August 2002|accessdate=25 April  2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405110855/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/aug/24/alqaida.sciencefictionfantasyandhorror|archivedate=5 April 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifton posited that Aum's publications used Christian and Buddhist ideas to impress what he considered to be the more shrewd and educated Japanese who were not attracted to boring, purely traditional [[sermon]]s.&lt;ref name=lifton/&gt;{{rp|258}}

In private, both Asahara and his top disciples reportedly continued their humble lifestyles, the only exception being the armored [[Mercedes-Benz]] gifted by a wealthy follower. In rather rare footage, Asahara is seen on the street in front of a large clown doll resembling himself, smiling happily.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Advertising and recruitment activities, dubbed the "Aum Salvation plan", included claims of curing physical illnesses with health improvement techniques, realizing life goals by improving intelligence and positive thinking, and concentrating on what was important at the expense of leisure. This was to be accomplished by practising ancient teachings, accurately translated from original [[Pali]] [[Sūtra|sutras]] (these three were referred to as "threefold salvation"). These efforts resulted in Aum becoming one of the fastest-growing religious groups in Japan's history.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

David E. Kaplan and Andrew Marshall, in their 1996 book, ''The Cult at the End of the World: The Terrifying Story of the Aum Doomsday Cult, from the Subways of Tokyo to the Nuclear Arsenals of Russia'', claim that its practices remained secret. Initiation rituals, assert the authors of the book, often involved the use of [[hallucinogens]], such as [[LSD]]. Religious practices often involved extremely ascetic practices claimed to be "yoga". These included everything from renunciants being hung upside down to being given [[electroshock therapy|shock therapy]].&lt;ref name=kaplan2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=David E.|first2=Andrew|last2=Marshall|year=1996|title=The Cult at the End of The World|place=London, UK|publisher=Hutchinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents before 1995===
The [[cult]] started attracting controversy in the late 1980s with accusations of deception of recruits, and of holding cult members against their will and forcing members to donate money; it murdered a cult member who tried to leave in February 1989.&lt;ref name=cultdeath&gt;{{cite news|title=Aum member tells of 2 deaths at compound|work=The Daily Yomiuri|publisher=The Japan News|location=Tokyo|page=1|date=24 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rearrest&gt;{{cite news|title=Asahara rearrested in 1989 cultist murder|work=The Daily Shimbun|publisher=The Japan News|page=2|date=21 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1989, the group's negotiations with [[Tsutsumi Sakamoto]], an anti-cult lawyer threatening a [[lawsuit]] against them which could potentially bankrupt the group, failed. In the same month, Sakamoto recorded an interview for a talk show on the Japanese TV station [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. The network then had the interview secretly shown to the group without notifying Sakamoto, intentionally breaking [[protection of sources]]. The group then pressured TBS to cancel the broadcast. The following month Sakamoto, his wife and his child went missing from their home in [[Yokohama]]. 

The police were unable to resolve the case at the time, although some of his colleagues publicly voiced their suspicions of the group. It was not until after the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|1995 Tokyo attack]] that they were found to have been [[Sakamoto family murder|murdered]] and their bodies dumped by cult members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Reader|title=Scholarship, Aum Shinrikyô, and Academic Integrity|work=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions|volume=3|number=2|date=April 2000|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Sect's Role in Murder Case Emerges, Prompting Outcry|first=Nicholas D.|last=Kristof|date=14 March 1996|work=New York Times|page=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan and Marshall allege in their book that Aum was also connected with such activities as [[extortion]]. The group, authors report, "commonly took patients into its hospitals and then forced them to pay exorbitant medical bills".&lt;ref name=kaplan2/&gt;

The cult is known to have considered [[assassination]]s of several individuals critical of the cult, such as the heads of Buddhist sects [[Soka Gakkai]] and [[Kofuku no Kagaku|The Institute for Research in Human Happiness]]. After cartoonist [[Yoshinori Kobayashi]] began satirizing the cult, he was included on Aum's assassination list. An assassination attempt was made on  Kobayashi in 1993.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeill|first1=David|title=Nous ne sommes pas Charlie: Voices that mock authority in Japan muzzled|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/01/26/issues/nous-ne-sommes-pas-charlie-voices-mock-authority-japan-muzzled|work=The Japan Times|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1993, cult members sprayed large amounts of liquid containing ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' spores from a cooling tower on the roof of Aum Shinrikyo´s Tokyo headquarters. However, their plan to cause an [[Anthrax|anthrax]] epidemic failed. The attack resulted in a large number of complaints about bad odors but no infections.&lt;ref name="Takahashi2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takahashi|first1=Hiroshi|title=Bacillus anthracis Bioterrorism Incident, Kameido, Tokyo, 1993|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=2004|volume=10|issue=1|pages=117–20|doi=10.3201/eid1001.030238|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1993, the cult started secretly manufacturing the nerve agent [[sarin]] and later [[VX (nerve agent)|VX gas]]. They also attempted to manufacture 1,000 [[automatic rifles]] but only managed to make one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/837000.stm|title=Japan cultists sentenced to death|date=17 July 2000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aum tested its sarin on sheep at [[Banjawarn Station]], a remote pastoral property in [[Western Australia]], killing 29 sheep. Both sarin and VX were then used in several assassinations (and attempts) over 1994–95.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On the night of 27 June 1994, the cult carried out a [[chemical weapons]] attack against civilians when they released sarin in the central Japanese city of [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]]. With the help of a converted [[refrigerator truck]], members of the cult released a cloud of sarin which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted to go against the cult. This [[Matsumoto incident]] killed eight and harmed 500 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Kyle B.|last=Olson|title=Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat?|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Research Planning, Inc.|place=Arlington, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police investigations focused only on an innocent local resident, [[Yoshiyuki Kōno (victim)|Yoshiyuki Kouno]], and failed to implicate the cult at the time. It was only after the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|Tokyo subway attack]] that Aum Shinrikyo was discovered to be behind the Matsumoto sarin attack.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In December 1994 and January 1995, Masami Tsuchiya of Aum Shinrikyo synthesized 100 to 200&amp;nbsp;grams of VX which was used to attack three persons. Two persons were injured and a 28-year-old man was killed. He is believed to be the first fully documented victim of VX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pamela|last=Zurer|title=Japanese cult used VX to slay member|work=Chemical and Engineering News|year=1998|volume=76|number=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The VX victim, whom [[Shoko Asahara]] had suspected was a spy, was attacked at 7:00 a.m. on 12 December 1994, on the street in [[Osaka]] by [[Tomomitsu Niimi]] and another Aum member, who sprinkled the nerve agent on his neck. He chased them for about {{convert|100|yd|m}} before collapsing, dying 10 days later without coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an [[organophosphate]] pesticide. But the cause of death was pinned down only after cult members arrested for the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|subway attack in Tokyo]] in March 1995 confessed to the killing. Ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid, and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio) ethylamine were later found in the body of the victim. Unlike the cases for [[sarin]] ([[Matsumoto incident]] and Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In February 1995, several cult members kidnapped Kiyoshi Kariya, a 69-year-old brother of a member who had escaped, from a Tokyo street and took him to a compound in [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] near [[Mount Fuji]], where he was killed. His corpse was destroyed in a [[microwave]]-powered incinerator and the remnants disposed of in [[Lake Kawaguchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/01/aum-shinri-kyo-fugitive|title=Aum Shinrikyo cult fugitive turns himself in after 16 years|work=[[The Guardian]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Kariya was abducted, he had been receiving threatening phone calls demanding to know the whereabouts of his sister, and he had left a note saying, "If I disappear, I was abducted by Aum Shinrikyo".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Police made plans to simultaneously raid cult facilities across Japan in March 1995.&lt;ref name=chrono&gt;{{cite news| title=Chronology: Events involving Aum Shinrikyo|work=The Nikkei Weekly|publisher=The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Incorporated|location=New York|page=Issues &amp; People, page 3|date=22 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors alleged Asahara was tipped off about this and that he ordered the Tokyo subway attack to divert police.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Tokyo subway sarin attack and related incidents===
{{main|Tokyo subway sarin attack}}
On the morning of 20 March 1995, Aum members released a [[binary chemical weapon]], most closely chemically similar to sarin, in a coordinated attack on five trains in the [[Tokyo subway]] system, killing 13 commuters, seriously injuring 54 and affecting 980 more. Some estimates claim as many as 6,000 people were injured by the sarin. It is difficult to obtain exact numbers since many victims are reluctant to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum, Philip Gabriel, ''Underground'', Vintage International, 2001.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prosecutors allege that Asahara was tipped off by an insider about planned police raids on cult facilities and ordered an attack in central Tokyo to divert police attention away from the group. The attack evidently backfired, and police conducted huge simultaneous raids on cult compounds across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Danzig|Danzig, Richard]], [[Marc Sageman]], Terrance Leighton, Lloyd Hough, Hidemi Yuki, Rui Kotani and Zachary M. Hosford, "[http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf Aum Shinrikyo:  Insights Into How Terrorists Develop Biological and Chemical Weapons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324102229/http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf|date=24 March 2012}}", ''[[Center for a New American Security]]'', July 2011; accessed 12 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next week, the full scale of Aum's activities was revealed for the first time. At the cult's headquarters in [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] on the foot of [[Mount Fuji]], police found explosives, chemical weapons, and a Russian [[Mil Mi-17]] military helicopter. While the finding of [[biological warfare]] agents such as [[anthrax]] and [[Ebola]] [[Cell cultures|cultures]] was reported, those claims now appear to have been widely exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smitheson|first1=Amy E.|title=Ataxia: The Chemical and Biological Terrorism Threat and the US Response|date=9 October 2000|page=77|url=http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/atxchapter3.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were stockpiles of chemicals that could be used for producing enough sarin to kill four million people.&lt;ref name=CT1&gt;{{cite book|last=Townshend|first=Charles|title=Terrorism: a very short introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Police also found laboratories to manufacture drugs such as [[LSD]], [[methamphetamine]], and a crude form of [[truth serum]], a safe containing millions of U.S. dollars in cash and gold, and cells, many still containing prisoners. During the raids, Aum issued statements claiming that the chemicals were for fertilizers. Over the next six weeks, over 150 cult members were arrested for a variety of offenses. The media was stationed outside Aum's Tokyo headquarters on Komazawa Dori in [[Aoyama, Tokyo|Aoyama]] for months after the attack and arrests waiting for action and to get images of the cult's other members. On March 30, 1995, Takaji Kunimatsu, chief of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], was shot four times near his house in Tokyo and was seriously wounded. While many suspected Aum involvement in the shooting, the ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' reported that [[Hiroshi Nakamura (dissident)|Hiroshi Nakamura]] is suspected of the crime, but nobody has been charged.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On 23 April 1995, [[Hideo Murai]], the head of Aum's Ministry of Science, was stabbed to death outside the cult's Tokyo headquarters amidst a crowd of about 100 reporters, in front of cameras. The man responsible, a Korean member of [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], was arrested and eventually convicted of the murder. His motive remains unknown. On the evening of 5 May, a burning paper bag was discovered in a toilet in Tokyo's busy [[Shinjuku station]]. Upon examination it was revealed that it was a [[hydrogen cyanide]] device which, had it not been extinguished in time, would have released enough gas into the ventilation system to potentially kill 10,000 commuters.&lt;ref name=chrono/&gt; On July 4, several undetonated cyanide devices were found at other locations in the Tokyo subway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/425960/HERES-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-POISON-GAS-ATTACKS-IN-JAPAN.html|title=Here's a chronology of poison gas attacks in Japan|work=[[Deseret News]]| date= July 5, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/07/04/Four-injured-by-Tokyo-station-gas-fumes/1840804830400|title= Four injured by Tokyo station gas fumes|publisher=United Press International|date=4 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Jonathan B.|title=Toxic Terror: Assessing Terrorist Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons|date=February 2000|page=219|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=MrPyPP7gkHYC|via=Google Books|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, numerous cult members were arrested for various offenses, but arrests of the most senior members on the charge of the subway gassing had not yet taken place. In June, an individual unrelated to Aum had launched a copycat attack by hijacking [[All Nippon Airways Flight 857]], a Boeing 747 bound for Hakodate from Tokyo. The hijacker claimed to be an Aum member in possession of sarin and plastic explosives, but these claims were ultimately found to be false.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Asahara was finally found hiding within a wall of a cult building known as "The 6th Satian" in the Kamikuishiki complex on 16 May and was arrested.&lt;ref name=chrono/&gt; On the same day, the cult mailed a parcel bomb to the office of [[Yukio Aoshima]], the governor of Tokyo, blowing off the fingers of his secretary's hand. Asahara was initially charged with 23 counts of murder and 16 other offenses. The trial, dubbed "the trial of the century" by the press, ruled Asahara guilty of masterminding the attack and [[Capital punishment in Japan|sentenced him to death]]. The indictment was appealed unsuccessfully. A number of senior members accused of participation, such as Masami Tsuchiya, also received death sentences.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The reasons why a small circle of mostly senior Aum members committed atrocities and the extent of personal involvement by Asahara remain unclear, although several theories have attempted to explain these events. In response to the prosecution's charge that Asahara ordered the subway attacks to distract authorities, the defense maintained that Asahara was not aware of events, pointing to his deteriorating health. Shortly after his arrest, Asahara abandoned his post as the organization's leader, and since then has maintained silence, refusing to communicate even with lawyers and family members.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===After 1995===
[[File:Anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest.JPG|thumb|300px|An anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest in Japan, 2009.]]
On 21 June 1995, Asahara acknowledged that in January 1994 he ordered the killing of a sect member, Kotaro Ochida, a pharmacist at an Aum hospital. Ochida, who tried to escape from a sect compound, was held down and strangled by another Aum member who was allegedly told that he too would be killed if he did not strangle Ochida. On 10 October 1995, Aum Shinrikyo was ordered stripped of its official status as a "religious [[Juristic person|legal entity]]" and was declared bankrupt in early 1996. However, the group continues to operate under the constitutional guarantee of [[Freedom of religion in Japan|freedom of religion]], funded by a successful computer business and donations, and under strict [[surveillance]]. Attempts to ban the group altogether under the 1952 Subversive Activities Prevention Law were rejected by the Public Security Examination Commission in January 1997.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The group underwent a number of transformations in the aftermath of Asahara's arrest and trial. For a brief time, Asahara's two preteen sons officially replaced him as guru. It re-grouped under the new name "Aleph" in February 2000. It announced a change in doctrine: religious texts related to controversial [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist doctrines and Bible were removed. The group apologized to the victims of the sarin gas attack and established a special compensation fund. Provocative publications and activities that alarmed society are no longer published.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Fumihiro Joyu]], one of the few senior leaders of the group under Asahara who did not face serious charges, became official head of the organization in 1999. [[Kōki Ishii]], a legislator who formed an anti-Aum committee in the [[National Diet]] in 1999, was murdered in 2002. In August 2003, a woman believed to be an ex-Aum Shinrikyo member took refuge in [[North Korea]] via China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/aum/aum352.html|title=Woman who fled to North Korea was government mole in Aum|publisher=Ross Institute|date=6 November 2003|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 15 years, only three fugitives were being actively sought. At 11:50 p.m. on 31 December 2011, Makoto Hirata surrendered himself to the police and was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the 1995 abduction of Kiyoshi Kariya, a non-member who had died during an Aum kidnapping and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aum Shinrikyo cult fugitive surrenders to Japan police|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16377178|accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokyo subway attack fugitive surrenders|date=1 January 2012|agency=AFP|publisher=News.com.au|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/tokyo-subway-attack-fugitive-surrenders/story-e6frfkyi-1226234294557|accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120102x1.html 16-year Aum fugitive mum on life on run]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', January 2011, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 2012, police captured Naoko Kikuchi, the second fugitive, acting on a tip from local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://japandailypress.com/additional-details-emerge-about-aum-cult-member-kikuchis-17-years-on-the-run-053368|title=Additional details emerge about Aum cult member Kikuchi's 17 years on the run|work=Japan Daily Press|date=5 June 2012|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoko Asahara's ashes will be collected by his youngest daughter according to his will. She urged her relatives and cult members to "put an end to the Aum and stop hating society". The ashes will be kept at the detention center for the time being for fears of reprisals from other elements of the cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://japantoday.com/category/crime/daughter-of-japan-sarin-attack-cult-guru-to-get-his-ashes|title=Ashes of executed Aum leader to be scattered at sea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==
According to a June 2005 report by the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], Aleph had approximately 1,650 members, of whom 650 [[communal living|lived communally]] in compounds.&lt;ref name="npa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npa.go.jp/kouhousi/biki2/sec03/sec03_04.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725105241/http://www.npa.go.jp/kouhousi/biki2/sec03/sec03_04.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 July 2011|title=オウム真理教対策（警察庁）|date=25 July 2011|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group operated 26 facilities in 17 [[prefectures]], and about 120 residential facilities. An article in the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' newspaper on 11 September 2002 showed that the Japanese public still mistrusts Aleph, and compounds are usually surrounded by protest banners from local residents.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Monitoring===
In January 2000, the group was placed under surveillance for a period of three years under an anti-Aum law, in which the group is required to submit a list of members and details of assets to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn19991117a1.htm-.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323004610/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn19991117a1.htm-.html|title=Lower House panel approves bills to crack down on Aum|work=The Japan Times|date=17 November 1999|archivedate=23 March 2005|via=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2003, Japan's [[Public Security Intelligence Agency]] received permission to extend the surveillance for another three years, as they found evidence which suggested that the group still revered Asahara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20030119a8.htm|title=Surveillance of Aum to continue on grounds it still poses threat to public|work=Japan Times|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Religious News Blog report issued in April 2004, the authorities still considered the group "a threat to society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t3.org/Aum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722040355/http://www.t3.org/Aum.html|title=A Chronology of Police Actions: Aum Shinri Kyo and the Japanese Police|date=12 January 1997|archivedate=22 July 2006|deadurl=yes|website=t3.org|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) was able to extend the surveillance for another three years. Despite the doctrinal changes and banning of [[Vajrayana]] texts, the PSIA advocates increased surveillance; it periodically expresses concerns that the Vajrayana texts remain in use and that danger remains while Asahara remains leader. Aleph leaders carefully insert passages rejecting the Vajrayana texts into almost everything they say or write, including [[karaoke]] songs, to publicly distance Aleph from Vajrayana.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On 15 September 2006, Shoko Asahara lost his final appeal against the [[Capital punishment in Japan|death penalty]]. The following day Japanese police raided the offices of Aleph in order to "prevent any illegal activities by cult members in response to the confirmation of Asahara's death sentence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5351376.stm|work=BBC News|title=Japanese police raid cult offices|date=16 September 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen cult members were eventually sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111122i1.html Last trial brings dark Aum era to end]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 22 November 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split===
On 8 March 2007, [[Fumihiro Joyu]], former Aum Shinrikyo spokesman and head of Aum's [[Moscow]] operation, formally announced a long-expected split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/17668/joyu-fumihori-group-leaves-aum-shinrikyo|title=Joyu Group Leaves AUM to Form New Organization|publisher=Religionnewsblog.com|date=8 March 2007|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyu's group, called ''[[Hikari no Wa]]'' ("The Circle of Light"), claims to be committed to uniting science and religion and creating "the new science of the human mind", having previously aimed to move the group away from its criminal history and toward its spiritual roots.&lt;ref name=cfr.org&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Holly|title=CFR Backgrounder: Aum Shinrikyo (archived)|url=http://www.cfr.org/japan/aum-shinrikyo/p9238|work=Council on Foreign Relations|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Public Security Intelligence Agency stated that Aum had about 1,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]|title=The Small Print: See Ya!|number=893|date=6–19 May 2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011 the cult reported its membership as 1,030. The group was reportedly active in trying to recruit new members via social media and proselytizing on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Jiji Press]]|title=Aum cult tops 1,000 followers|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=19 November 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hongo|first=Jun|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111121x2.html|title=Aum may be gone in name but guru still has following|work=Japan Times|date=22 November 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's Public Security Examination Commission announced in January 2015 that Aum Shinrikyo's two spinoffs would remain under surveillance for three more years starting 1 February 2015.&lt;ref name=jiji&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kyodo|first1=Jiji|title=Surveillance of Aum successor cults extended three more years|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/24/national/crime-legal/aum-successor-groups-remain-surveillance-three-years|work=Japan Times|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admirers===
In 2014, ''[[The Japan Times]]'' alleged that "good looks and commitment to a cause", demonstrated by Aleph, "inspire a new generation of admirers". Dissatisfaction with society and low degrees of success in life make them "identify with the cult" and "adore the cultists as if they were pop idols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/20/national/social-issues/aum-cultists-inspire-a-new-generation-of-admirers|title=Aum cultists inspire a new generation of admirers|first=Tomohiro|last=Osaki|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=6 July 2018| work=Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Russian crackdown===
On 5 April 2016, the [[Investigative Committee of Russia]] announced it opened a criminal case against Aum Shinrikyo followers and that its investigators, along with [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) forces, were conducting raids in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] to find them and confiscate literature, religious items and electronic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Searches underway in Moscow, St. Pete in order to expose Aum Shinrikyo followers|url=http://tass.ru/en/society/867313|newspaper=[[Russian News Agency TASS|TASS]]|location=Moscow|date=5 April 2016|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2016, the Russian government banned Aum Shinrikyo in the country, declaring it a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;[https://www.rt.com/politics/360006-russia-bans-murderous-japanese-sect Russia bans murderous Japanese sect Aum Shinrikyo as terrorist group], rt.com; accessed 12 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 Aleph raids===
In November 2017, Japanese police raided five offices of Aleph in an investigation into the group's recruiting practices after a woman paid tens of thousands of yen for study sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/11/13/national/crime-legal/offices-aum-successor-adelph-raided-recruiting-practices|title=Offices of Aum successor Aleph raided over recruiting practices|date=13 November 2017|accessdate=6 July 2018|work=Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early phase==
{{Bahá'í sidebar}}

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned [[Africa]] and were written on April 19, 1916, and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá mentions Bahá'ís traveling "…especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe"&lt;ref name="ToDP8"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan|edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-8.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 47–59 |origyear = 1916–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and " …the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL|isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-12.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 82–89 |origyear = 1916–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connections and development===
An early instance of contact between Uganda and the Bahá'í Faith came in September 1946 when Ugandan Dr. Ernest Kalibala, one of Uganda's first PhDs&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Utafiti/vol2no1/aejp002001004.pdf Professionalism and Unionism in the teaching service: The development of teacher' organizations in Uganda], by AK.

===House of Worship===
In 1958 the land for the temple had to be bought in the name of three African Ugandan Bahá'ís rather than an institution directly foreign or domestic. These Bahá'ís were Joseph Mbogo, Erisha Kiwanuka and Max Kanyerezi who held the land in trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Mother Temple of Africa |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1958 |pages=9–10 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=720 | issue = 325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Uganda, named as the Mother Temple of Africa, is situated on [[Kikaya Hill]] on the outskirts of Kampala. At the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone in 1958 Hands of the Cause [[Ruhiyyih Khanum]] and Músá Banání presented material gifts for the building - some soil from the inner-most [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] and the fortress of [[Maku, Iran|Maku]] where the [[Báb]] was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Relics Placed in Foundation |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1958 | page =10 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=721 | issue = 325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[Mason Remey]] and the green dome is made of fixed mosaic tiles from [[Italy]], the lower roof tiles are from [[Belgium]], and the colored glass in the wall panels was brought from [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="UGPulse"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Rulekere  | first = Gerald  | title = Uganda's Bahá'í Temple - The Bahai Temple: Where nature, faith and artistic beauty reign  | newspaper = UGPulse Uganda  | date = 2006-11-07  | url =http://www.ugpulse.com/articles/daily/homepage.asp?ID=491  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine massive columns, each two feet in diameter, support the great dome, itself forty-four feet in diameter at its base; while the two roofs are supported by two sets of twenty seven slightly smaller columns. The overall height is 127&amp;nbsp;ft., the internal diameter of the building is eighty four feet and the seating capacity is over 600. The inside of the dome is painted a pale blue; the rotunda, into which are set nine enormous windows and fifty-four small windows, all filled with green, amber and pale blue glass, is painted a brilliant white, while the columns and the lower walls are painted a very pale green. All this lends itself to an effect of lightness and airiness which is intensified by the large green and amber glass-filled grilles which stand on either side of the huge mvule doors.&lt;ref name="Argus"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Uganda Argus Publishes Supplement on Kampala Temple |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1961| page =4 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=05&amp;page=210| issue = 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dedication====
[[File:Bahai-uganda.jpg|thumb|Practising Baha'is]]
Festivities associated with the opening of the temple were wide-ranging through early 1961. The Ugandan government publication ''[[New Vision|Uganda Argus]]'' covered the history and description of the temple in the January 1961 issue&lt;ref name="Argus"/&gt; and interviews and stories ran on the Ugandan Broadcasting service on radio.&lt;ref name="BN361"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Hand of Cause 'Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum Dedicates Mother Temple of Africa |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1961 |pages=2–9 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=05&amp;page=220| issue = 361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events on site began on the 13th with a unity feast with Hands of the Cause Musa Banani, John Robarts, Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir and Chairman of the regional assembly Ali Nakhkajvani and vice-chairman O]oro Epyeru giving talks. The temple was dedicated on 14th led by Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum where there was a viewing of portraits of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. And the public inaugural service was held on the 15th. Over 1500 people attended.&lt;ref name="BN361"/&gt; Among the Bahá'ís were some 225 African Bahá'ís from Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Ruanda Urundi, Ethiopia, Northern Rhodesia, Swaziland, and South Africa; some 90 Persian Baha'is, sixty-two of whom flew from Tehran; the British national assembly, the mother assembly to that of Central and East Africa, sent one believer from each of its regions - England, Scotland and Wales, as well as one from Ireland; the American national assembly sent one of its members, Amos Gibson, himself a pioneer among the American Indian peoples. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga was unable to attend due to [[History of Cameroon#Cameroon after independence|political turmoil in Cameroon]] Olinga was attempting to help them with. A choir, especially selected from among Kampala's singers and directed by Peter Wingard of [[Makerere College]] sang music&lt;ref name="Argus"/&gt; and readings offered were from the Old and New Testaments and the Qur'an, plus a number of prayers and readings from the Bahá'í writings in Arabic, Persian, Ateso, Swahili, Acholi, Luganda and English. Following the public meeting a reception was held for representatives of the Governor and the [[Kabaka of Buganda]], together with the Mayor of Kampala at which Ruhiyyih Khanum shared a story that Shoghi Effendi had traveled through the region in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="BN361"/&gt; Following the dedication Ruhiyyih Khanum and chairman Nakhkajvani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bahá'ís through Uganda and Kenya including staying in their homes, dedicating two schools, ate native food, and were honored with traditional songs and dances. Khanum suggested repeatedly that the Ugandan's own folklore, their traditions and their native songs and music should not be discarded, but that in a society of unity in diversity they were to preserve and develop these as their contribution in enriching the spiritual and material life of human society as well as noting the equality of the sexes and that women should take equal part in administration of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Hand of Cause Visits African Villages |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1961 |pages=6–9 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=05&amp;page=240 | issue = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercontinental conferences===

====First conference====
In January 1958, soon after the death of Shoghi Effendi in November, another intercontinental conference was held in Kampala and attended by his widow Ruhiyyih Khanum.&lt;ref name="BN327"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Soul-Stirring Visit of Ruhiyyih Khanum Inspires Kampala Conference to Heights of Devotion to Faith |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1958 |pages=7–13 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=754 | issue = 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though sorrowful at his death, there was a call to service in honor of his service. The conference had been initially planned for less than 400 attendees and was overwhelmed as news of over 300 Persians alone were coming. Ultimately some 950 Bahá'ís, six Hands of the Cause, a member of the [[International Bahá'í Council]], sixteen Auxiliary Board members, and representatives from eleven national spiritual assemblies (including those from the four African regional assemblies, those from the other national assemblies which had participated in campaign to bring the religion to sub-Saharan Africa - Britain, India, Iraq, Persia, and the United States - and those from Arabia and Japan), 450 African members, over 300 from Persia, two [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh]] (one from the Pacific and one from the Arctic), and others from rest of the world were present at the formal convening of the conference as well as telegrams received from many other Hands of the Cause and 34 national assemblies arrived. Reportedly every hotel room was booked.&lt;ref name="BN327"/&gt; Ruhiyyih Khanum anointed most attendees with [[Rose oil|Attar of rose]] before being admitted into a viewing of relics of Bahá'u'lláh as well as a reproduction of a painting of him on the first day of the conference. Viewings were also held of a large map by Shoghi Effendi showing the progress of the religion, films of Shrines and gardens from the [[Bahá'í World Center]], as it existed then, as well as the Monument on the grave of Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref name="BN327"/&gt; Some $280,000 was raised at the conference from a segment of the attendees for donation to the progress of the religion. The foundation stone for the Mother Temple of Africa was laid and relics in silk bags made by [[Bahiyyih Khánum]] were set in place (planned to be under the wall on that side of the Temple facing out across a grassy valley towards the Bahá'í [[Qiblih]].) Ruhiyyih Khanum then spent a day among the Tseo people - speaking to school groups, receiving guests, and visiting homes. She donated money for the reconstruction of a center that had been lost.&lt;ref name="BN327"/&gt;

====Second Conference====
Six conferences held in October 1967 around the world presented a viewing of a copy of the photograph of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] on the highly significant occasion commemorating the centennial of Bahá'u'lláh's writing of the ''[[Suriy-i-Mulúk]]'' (Tablet to the Kings), which [[Shoghi Effendi]] describes as "the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh".&lt;ref name="bpg"&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a meeting in Edirne ([[Adrianople]]), Turkey, the [[Hands of the Cause]] travelled to the conferences, with each carrying a copy of the photograph of Bahá'ú'lláh.

Kolonerio Oule, chairman of the National Assembly for Uganda and Central Africa, opened the conference on the first day and Hands of the Cause `Alí-Akbar Furútan and Enoch Olinga began presentations and discussions about the history of the tablets and the range of who they were made for. The next day the new national center building on the same property as the temple was dedicated - it is a circular building having a round central auditorium surrounded by a group of offices, a library, archives, publishing, guest roams and kitchen. The third day William Masehla and speaker [[Helen Elsie Austin]] focused attention on the role of the individual in the progress of the religion.&lt;ref name="BN441"/&gt; That evening a public meeting of some 500 people was held followed by a reception for 250 people; efforts had focused invitations to government personnel, clergy, educational institutions and professional communities. [[Roger White (Bahá'í)|Roger White]] was a representative of the Canadian national Assembly which made a gift to the Bahá'ís of Uganda in the form of an illuminated tablet of the writings of the religion.&lt;ref name="BN441"/&gt;

The arts were shown in oil paintings, photographs, silverwork, and handwoven carpets and the diversity of nationalities and religious backgrounds was illustrated with photographs and slides taken during conventions, Temple dedications, and intercontinental conferences. Later that summer Ruhiyyih Khanum visited Uganda on a ten-day tour. In Kampala she was able to attend several events before driving into the countryside to visit Bahá'ís. In town events included: a reception given in her honor and that of two visiting members of the Universal House of Justice, Hushmand Fatheazam and 'Ali Nahkjavani; to deliver a public lecture in the hall of the national theater; to be interviewed for a full half hour on Radio Uganda on the "Guest of the Week" program; and attend a wedding at the temple along with fellow Hands of the Cause Enoch Olinga and Músá Bánaní before going on to Ethiopia and other countries on a four-month tour.

====Oppression, violence, and freedom====
As part of a sweep across several [[Sub-Saharan]] countries, the Bahá'í Faith was banned in the 1970s in several countries: [[Burundi]], 1974; [[Mali]] 1976; [[Uganda]] 1977; [[People's Republic of the Congo|Congo]], 1978; [[Bahá'í Faith in Niger|Niger]], 1978. Uganda had had the largest Bahá'í community in Africa at the time and Olinga had returned and sought the protection of the community during this difficult time when [[Idi Amin]]'s regime ruled Uganda.&lt;ref name="enoch"/&gt; See also [[Uganda under Idi Amin]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab countries. Since these countries were also by this time providers of development aid, this overt attack on the Baha'is was supported by covert moves such as linking the aid money to a particular country to the action that it took against the Baha'is. This was partially successful and a number of countries did ban the Baha'is for a time. However, the Baha'is were able to demonstrate to these governments that they were not agents of [[Zionism]] nor [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] and succeeded in having the ban reversed in all of these countries except Niger."&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was a period of violence from 1978.&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead,&lt;ref name="enoch"/&gt; and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin.&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town.&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again,&lt;ref name="BN585"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Hand of the Cause of God Enoch Olinga 'The Father of Victories'|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1979 |issn=0195-9212 | pages =2–3 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=81 | issue = 585}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August.&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family.&lt;ref name="enoch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BN585"/&gt; On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time,&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the kitchen to the back of the house and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in.&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to a member of the national committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued.&lt;ref name="BN590"/&gt; The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Funeral in Uganda for Hand of Cause Enoch Olinga|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1980 |issn=0195-9212 | page =7 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=181| issue = 590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] and when the ban on the religion was rescinded, Ugandan Bahá'ís re-formed their National Spiritual Assembly in 1981,&lt;ref name="sum"/&gt; though the [[Ugandan Bush War]] dragged on. In 1982 the two primary schools the Bahá'ís had founded in 1961 were again under Bahá'í administration by February 1982.&lt;ref name="BN611"/&gt; More than 200 Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís gathered in 1983 to celebrate children and a kindergarten multi-racial nursery school established by Claire Gung&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Uganda|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1983 |issn=0195-9212 | page =16 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=938| issue = 629}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rex Collison died in June 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Deeply grieved passing…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1983 |issn=0195-9212 | page =13 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=954| issue = 630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of hundreds of people joining the religion recurred in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =The World; Uganda|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1985 |issn=0195-9212 | page =12 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=11&amp;page=391| issue = 650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about February 1985 George Olinga and Benson Kariuki gave a talk at one the primary schools about the religion about the institutions of the religion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Uganda|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1985 |issn=0195-9212 | page =16 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=11&amp;page=335| issue = 647}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Claire Gung died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Deeply grieved passing…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1985 |issn=0195-9212 | page =12 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=11&amp;page=371| issue = 649}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the nursery she established was assumed by the national assembly and funds were allotted for the renovation of the primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Social/economic development - Number of projects growing rapidly (section on Uganda)|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1986 |issn=0195-9212 | page =6 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=11&amp;page=577| issue = 660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986-7 Dwight W.

==Multiplying involvements==
The Ugandan Bahá'í community has been involved in a wide range of projects many of which benefit the nation while also advancing awareness of the religion. In 1989 a Bahá'í expert and businessman in using [[appropriate technology]] from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Uganda training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = The World; Swaziland |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1989 |issn=0195-9212 | page =15 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=581 | issue = 660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 a Bahá'í Club was organized for [[Makerere University]] composed of Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = The World; Uganda |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1990 |issn=0195-9212 | page =14 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=671 | issue = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the national assembly invited members of the Department of Religious Studies at Makerere University to the Bahá'í House of Worship to familiarize staff with the religion, its institutions and how they function to contextualize the interaction between the agencies of the religion and the university while it implemented two new courses designed and taught by a Bahá'í, Dr. Tim Rost, on "Peace and Justice" and another on "Religion and Development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = The World; Uganda |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1990 |issn=0195-9212 | page =12 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=691 | issue = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Bahá'í women of [[Mbale]] took part in events organized by the National Council on Women by a multicultural children's program emphasizing good neighborliness and handicrafts of women - government administrators observed that Bahá'ís had several programs advancing diverse issues in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = The World; Uganda |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1990 |issn=0195-9212 | page =12 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=803| issue = 712}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Bahá'í Office of Social and Economic Development in Uganda established a project to train healthcare field workers for work in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = The World; Uganda |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1990 |issn=0195-9212 | page =13 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=843| issue = 714}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the national assembly added a project to develop a middle-level management training program for community level primary health care workers.

==History in the region==

===A part of the Russian Empire===
The earliest relationship between the Bahá'í Faith and Uzbekistan comes under the sphere of the country's [[History of Uzbekistan (1876–1991)|history with Russia]]. During that time, when the region was variously called Asiatic Russia or [[Russian Turkestan]] as part of the [[Russian Empire]], the history stretches back to 1847 when the Russian ambassador to [[Tehran]], Prince Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov, requested that the [[Báb]], the herald to the Bahá'í Faith who was imprisoned at [[Maku, Iran|Maku]], be moved elsewhere; he also condemned the massacres of Iranian religionists, and asked for the release of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russia"/&gt;
Within the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh the religion was established in [[Samarkand]] to which [[Mirzá Abu'l-Fadl]] later traveled.&lt;ref name="JBS0503"/&gt; While in Samarkand in 1892 Mirza Abu'l-Fadl wrote a book, ''Fassl-ul-Khitab'' (Conclusive Proof), in response to the questions of Mirza Haydar-Ali of Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =  ibn-Kalanter | first = Ish'te'a'l | title = Mirza Abdul-Fazl | journal = Star of the West | volume = 14 | issue = 19 | pages = 318–9 | publisher = | location = | date =  March 2, 1914 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rw4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA9-PA318&amp;ots=FXCOyKPeYI&amp;pg=RA9-PA318#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Samarkand, too, that he debated a Protestant preacher. In 1910 the Samarkand Bahá'í community elected its first assembly in addition to having a school, and built a center which held four meetings a week.

One tablet of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] says to the assembly of Samarkand: &lt;blockquote&gt;Do ye know in what cycle ye are created and in what age ye exist? This is the age of the Blessed Perfection and this is the time of the Greatest Name!… If we are not happy and joyous at this season, for what other season shall we wait and for what other time shall we look? This is the time for growing; the season for joyous gathering! …&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In [[Tashkand]], a community of Bahá'ís had expanded to about 1900 members, supporting a library, Persian and Russian language schools, and large meetings were being advertised with the permission of government authorities.&lt;ref name="JBS0503"/&gt; Bahá'í literature published in Tashkand included several works of `Abdu'l-Bahá. By 1938, after numerous arrests and a [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|policy of oppression]] of religion, Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were being sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad.&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Momen |first=Moojan |authorlink=Moojan Momen |title=Turkmenistan |booktitle=draft of "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" |publisher=Bahá'í Library Online |year=1994 |url=http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/turkmnst.htm |accessdate=2008-05-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509200356/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/turkmnst.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist. In Tashkent Bahá'ís were interrogated and imprisoned.

The '''Bishopric of [[Tartu|Dorpat]]''' ({{lang-et|Tartu piiskopkond}}; {{lang-nds|Bisdom Dorpat}}; {{lang-la|Ecclesia Tarbatensis}}) was a medieval [[prince-bishopric]], i;e; both a [[diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and a temporal principality ruled by the bishop of the diocese. It existed from 1224 to 1558, generally encompassing what are now [[Tartu County]], [[Põlva County]], [[Võru County]], and [[Jõgeva County]] in [[Estonia]]. The prince-bishopric was a sovereign member of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (formally from 6 Nov 1225) and part of the [[Livonian Confederation]].

== History ==
[[File:Tartu Toomkiriku varemed 2012.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tartu Cathedral]], today in ruins, was the seat of the Bishop of Dorpat ([[Tartu]]).]]
The first Bishop of Dorpat (the current [[Tartu]]) was [[Hermann of Dorpat|Hermann von Buxhövden]], the brother of [[Albert of Riga|Albert von Buxhövden]], [[Bishop of Riga]] and leader of the [[Livonian Crusade]]. The Estonian Diocese was established by the Bishop of Riga in 1211 and its first nominal seat was [[Lihula|Leal (Lihula)]] in western Estonia. In 1224, Bishop Hermann took possession of parts of what is today southeastern Estonia and chose Dorpat as his new seat. On 6 November 1225 he was enfeoffed with his principality by [[Henry VII of Germany]], [[King of the Romans]], and on 1 December Dorpat was created a [[March (territorial entity)|March]] of the Holy Roman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The principality was founded mainly on territories of the [[Ugaunia]]n tribe of ancient [[Estonia]]ns. In 1242, Bishop Hermann with his Ugaunian subjects was defeated by [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]]'s prince [[Alexander Nevsky]] in the famous [[Battle on Lake Peipus]]. 

During 1268, Fredrik, the then Bishop of Dorpat, is known to have called himself also as the "Bishop of [[Karelia]]", the background of the short-lived title remaining open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=137|title=Excerpt from sources|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051242/http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=137|archivedate=2007-09-27}}.

The Bishopric of Dorpat was an important [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] trade center. 

At the end of the 14th century, former Dietrich Damerow became the Bishop of Dorpat. He was the archenemy of the [[Livonian Order]] and made a coalition against it with [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg]],  and the [[Victual Brothers]] (notorious pirates of the [[Baltic Sea]]). He even asked King [[Richard II of England]] to take Dorpat under his protection. The Order invaded the bishopric in 1379 with no success. After settling the conflict the Livonian Order lost its right to demand that vassals of bishoprics take part in military campaigns.

During its last years, the Bishopric of Dorpat had a dispute with Russia which became later the main pretext of the [[Livonian War]]. Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] demanded that the bishopric pay a huge tribute of 40,000 talers.  Ivan insisted that the Dorpat was the ancient Russian fortress of ''Yuryev'' (referring to short-term Ruthenian rule of the area after conquest by prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], 1030–61(?)). The rulers of Dorpat tried to negotiate a smaller amount in the interest of extending the truce, but Ivan dismissed the diplomats and started the war. In 1558 Tartu was conquered by Russian troops and the Bishopric of Dorpat ceased to exist.

Beside Dorpat (Tartu) there were five more stone castles in the Bishopric:
* [[Otepää|Odenpäh]] ({{lang-et|Otepää}}) as the ancient centre of Ugandi and the first stone stronghold of bishopric;
* [[Kirumpää|Kirrumpäh]] (''Kirumpää'') and [[Vastseliina|Neuhausen]] (''Vastseliina'') by the important ancient Dorpat–Pleskau (Tartu–Pihkva) road;
* Oldentorn (Vana-Kastre) and Warbeke or Caster (Uue-Kastre) by the [[Emajõgi]] river which runs from Dorpat to [[Lake Peipus]].

There was also an outstanding [[Cistercian]] monastery, [[Kärkna Abbey]] (also Valkena or Falkenau)  near Dorpat.

== The former Bishopric today ==
The center of the bishopric was the Tartu (Dorpat) castle ({{lang-et|[[Toomemägi]]}}). The castle was damaged during the Northern War and was dismantled during the 18th century. Later (at the beginning of 19th century) an observatory was built on the site. The seat of the bishopric, [[Tartu Cathedral|Dorpat Cathedral]], was damaged during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and has been in ruins since the 17th century.

[[File:Captain Moroni by Josh Cotton.jpg|thumb|An artist's impression of Captain Moroni, commander of the Nephite forces from approximately 74–56 BC. Digital sculpture by Josh Cotton.|upright=1.5]]

{{Book of Mormon}}

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Captain Moroni''' was an important [[Nephite]] military commander and patriot who lived during the 1st century BC. He is perhaps best known for raising a "title of liberty" as a call to arms for his people to defend their country, family, freedom, peace, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=43|verse=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is first mentioned in the [[Book of Alma]] as "the chief captain over the Nephites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=43|verse=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Moroni is presented as a righteous and skilled military commander. Among his accomplishments were his extensive preparations for battle and his fierce defense of the right of the Nephites to govern themselves and worship as they saw fit.

Captain Moroni shares a name with the [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|prophet Moroni]]; the former is indexed&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/in/contents Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] edition of the Book of Mormon as '''Moroni&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.'''
==Early command==
According to the Book of Mormon, Moroni was "only twenty and five years old when he was appointed chief captain" of the Nephites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=43|verse=16|range=-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment came in response to a looming war with [[Lamanites]] and [[Zoramites]], a force which was led by [[Zerahemnah]] and included many Nephite dissenters. The Lamanite army attacked the Nephites in the land of Jershon and the battle ended on the banks of the river Sidon. In this war, Moroni set to work readying the Nephite people with [[body armor]] for the first time. He sent spies to investigate the Lamanites' weaknesses, and then he led his troops with the plan to surround those of the Lamanites. Moroni's overriding objective was to defend his people and their right to worship their God as they pleased. Ultimately, Moroni met that objective, which resulted in keeping many of the Lamanites from ever coming to combat against the Nephites again.

Moroni introduced to the Nephites revolutionary strategies in military tactics, safety, and precaution. He kept the people physically safe while he prayed, guiding and leading his armies by divine intervention. He was also known by his people for his firm ideology and integrity and his constant willingness to support the causes of personal freedom gaining the people's trust.

==Title of liberty==
[[File:Moroni - Book of Mormon.jpg|thumb|400px|Captain Moroni raises the "Title of Liberty", as found in the 1910 book ''Cities in the Sun''.]]
Moroni is associated with the "title of liberty," a standard that he raised to rally the Nephites to defend their liberties from a group of dissenters who wanted to establish their leader as a king. Moroni was so angry with [[Amalickiah]]'s dissention and wicked influence that he tore his coat and wrote upon it, "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=46|verse=10|range=-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; With those words, he rallied his people to defend their families and their freedom and drove out the armies of Amalickiah. Moroni put to death any dissenters who did not flee and would not support the cause of freedom, and his " title of liberty" was raised over every Nephite tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=46|verse=35|range=-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Book of Mormon, Moroni sought to strengthen the Nephites spiritually to be better prepared against the Lamanites, leading [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] to comment on Moroni's righteousness. &lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=48|verse=16|range=-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==King-men==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Book of Alma]] --&gt;
Years later, Moroni encountered problems with a group of men called "[[king-men]]," who were so called because they wanted to replace the chief judge and democracy with a king, an aim seen as destroying the liberty of the people. Moroni had written to [[Pahoran]] for help in the war, and the Lamanites attacked before the help could arrive. Moroni wrote again, chastising Pahoran in the process for failing to respond, even threatening to "stir up insurrections" against what he perceived to be the non-responsive government authorities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=60|verse=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahoran wrote back, saying that the king-men had driven him from the judgment seat, and he had been unable to respond to Moroni's requests for assistance. Moroni left command of his armies in the hands of his deputies and led an insurrection of the people against the king-men. The leader of the king-men, [[Pachus]], was killed and his followers were taken prisoner. Moroni and Pahoran regained control of the city of Nephihah, which they had lost, restoring the previous form of government by judges.

==Retirement==
After fortifying the Nephites' lands, Moroni transferred command of his armies to his son [[Moronihah]] and permanently retired to his own home. Four years later, in the 36th year of the reign of the judges (or approximately 56 BC), Moroni died. According to the chronology of years, listing the time from when Moroni took command of the armies at 25, he would have been approximately 45 when he died.

==Significance in modern Mormon culture==

Some Mormon authors, such as [[Nicholeen Peck]], have drawn comparisons between the lives of Captain Moroni and General [[George Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peck|first1=Nicholeen|title=“Give Me [Tree Bark], Or Give Me Death”: Liberty Yesterday And Today|url=http://ldsmag.com/article-1-8302/|website=Meridian Magazine|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peck writes, "Many many years before George Washington, Captain Moroni did the same thing George Washington did. He wrote the Title of Liberty, and put on his military uniform, to show he would fight for  his liberties if it was necessary." Mormon writer Heather Hemingway makes similar observations by noting, "Captain Moroni’s humility and valor is similar to that of George Washington during the winter of 1777-1778."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hemingway|first1=Heather|title=America and the Price of Freedom|url=http://blog.chron.com/mormonvoice/2014/06/america-and-the-price-of-freedom/|website=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=30 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229123231/http://blog.chron.com/mormonvoice/2014/06/america-and-the-price-of-freedom/|archivedate=29 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern references by anti-government activists==
In the Book of Mormon, Moroni is a military leader who takes command of an oppressed people and battles a corrupt king for their freedom.&lt;ref name="Krule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/01/05/why_ammon_bundy_calls_himself_captain_moroni.html|title=The Mormon Warrior the Bundys Revere Actually Wanted the Government to Do More|work=Slate|date=January 5, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016|first=Miriam|last=Krule}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moroni was a righteous general who among many notable accomplishments became angry with his government over its "indifference concerning the freedom of [its] country."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/heres-what-you-need-to-understand-about-mormon-history-if-yo#.xvBPKv2pj&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cliven Bundy]], an anti-government activist and a Mormon, has frequently made references to the Book of Mormon in his conflicts with the [[US government]].&lt;ref name="Krule"/&gt; According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, during the Bundy family’s 2014 occupation of federally-owned lands in Nevada, Bundy used banners quoting Moroni: "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children."&lt;ref name="Krule"/&gt;

In 2016, [[Ammon Bundy]], a son of Cliven, used much of the same language as his father, "mixing Mormon religious symbolism with a disgust of the federal government," during an [[occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]]. One member of Bundy's anti-government extremist group refused to give any other name to the press than "Captain Moroni, from Utah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/why-the-bundy-militia-mixes-mormon-symbolism-with-anti-government-sentiment/|title=Why the Bundy militia mixes Mormon symbolism with anti-government sentiment|work=PBS NewsHour|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=January 28, 2016|first=John|last=Sepulvado}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man calling himself "Captain Moroni" was later identified in media reports and  a criminal complaint as 34-year-old Dylan Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/2016/01/28/captain-moroni-arraigned-in-portland/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201063728/http://www.wweek.com/2016/01/28/captain-moroni-arraigned-in-portland/|archivedate=February 1, 2016|title=Captain Moroni Arraigned in Portland|date=January 28, 2016|work=[[Willamette Week]]|accessdate=January 30, 2016|first=Aaron|last=Mesh|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2016, the LDS Church released a statement, distancing itself from the standoff at the wildlife refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Church Responds to Inquiries Regarding Oregon Armed Occupation |url = http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-responds-to-inquiries-regarding-oregon-armed-occupation |work = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date = January 4, 2016|accessdate = January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus' '''cleansing of ten lepers''' is one of the [[Miracles of Jesus in the Gospels|miracles of Jesus]] reported in the [[Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Luke]] 17:11-19).&lt;ref&gt;''Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke'' by David C. Cook and Craig A.

According to [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke's]] account, on his way to [[Jerusalem]], [[Jesus]] encountered ten lepers. He healed them, but only one returned to thank Jesus afterward.

According to Berard Marthaler and [[Herbert Lockyer]], this miracle emphasizes the importance of faith, for Jesus did not say: "My power has saved you" but attributed the healing to the faith of the beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Berard L. Marthaler 2007 ''The Creed: The Apostolic Faith in Contemporary Theology'' {{ISBN|0-89622-537-2}} page 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert, 1988 ''All the Miracles of the Bible'' {{ISBN|0-310-28101-6}} page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Incense smoke Aarti, Ganges, Varanasi.jpg|right|thumb|Ceremonial dhunachi [[arati]] on the bank of the [[Ganges]], [[Varanasi]].  Unlike traditional earthen dhunachis, this one is made of metal.]]
'''Dhunachi''' (धुनाची,धुनाची)(ধুনুচি) is an [[India]]n incense burner (commonly used in conjunction with Indian Frankincense or "Dhuno" ("धूना")("ধুনো") for traditional ceremonies) used for one of the stages during [[aarti]], or ritualized dance worship. It is often used following the arati with the pradip (a lamp with an odd number of wicks).  

The dhunachi has a flared shape and is held by a stem with a large cavity at the top, and is traditionally made of earthenware.  When made of brass or silver, it needs a longer handle because of the heat.  It is lit by placing burning coal at the bottom, which ignites a layer of slow-burning coconut husk, on which incense (usually resin like Indian Frankincense or "Dhuno" ("धूना")("ধুনো")) is sprinkled.  

During the [[Durga puja]] in eastern India, it is common to have ''dhunuchi nritya'', or a frenzied dance with the censer, to the accompaniment of feverish [[dhak (instrument)|dhak]] rolls.  Many puja traditions also organize contests for the best dance, where some performers may go with as many as three dhunuchis - the third one held between the teeth. Dhunachi arati also known as "dhoop arati".

In [[Buddhism]], '''faith''' ({{lang-pi|saddhā|italic=yes}}, {{lang-sa|śraddhā|italic=yes}}) refers to a serene commitment to the practice of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]'s teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] or ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' (those aiming to become a Buddha). Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one in particular, such as one particular Buddha. Faith may not only be devotion to a person, but exists in relation to Buddhist concepts like the efficacy of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] and the possibility of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].

Faith in [[early Buddhism]] focused on the [[Triple Gem]], that is, the Buddha; his teaching (the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]); and finally, the community of spiritually developed followers or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the [[saṅgha]]). A faithful devotee was called an [[upasaka and Upasika|''upāsaka'' or ''upāsika'']], a status for which no formal initiation was required. Early Buddhism valued personal verification of spiritual truth highest in attaining such truth, and considered sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher less valuable sources of authority. As important as faith was, it was merely a first step on the path to [[Paññā|wisdom]] and [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and was made obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path. Early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]]. Throughout the history of Buddhism, the worship of deities, often from pre-Buddhist and [[animism|animist]] origins, was [[cultural appropriation|appropriated]] or transformed into Buddhist practices and beliefs. As part of this process, such deities were explained as subordinate to the Triple Gem, which still kept a central role.

In the later stratum of Buddhist history, especially in [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]], faith was given a much more important role. Mahāyāna developed the concept of the [[Buddha Nature]], as devotion to Buddhas and ''bodhisattvas'' residing in [[Pure Land]]s became commonplace. With the rise of the cult of the [[Lotus Sūtra]], faith gained a central role in Buddhist practice, and the development of devotion to the [[Amitābha Buddha]] in [[Pure Land Buddhism]] further amplified this trend. The Japanese form of Pure Land Buddhism, under the teachers [[Hōnen]] and [[Shinran]], believed that only [[shinjin|entrusting faith]] toward the Amitābha Buddha was a fruitful form of practice, as it dismissed celibacy, meditation and other Buddhist practices as no longer effective, or as contradicting the virtue of faith. Pure Land Buddhists defined faith as a state similar to enlightenment, with a sense of self-negation and humility. The impact of faith in Buddhist religiosity became pivotal in [[millenarianism|millenarian]] movements in several Buddhist countries, which sometimes resulted in the destruction of royal dynasties and other important political changes.

Thus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, [[Buddhist modernism]] has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia and the West, but is understood and defined differently from traditional interpretations, with modern values and [[eclecticism]] becoming more important.  The [[Dalit Buddhist movement|''Dalit'' Buddhist]] community, specifically the [[Navayāna]] movement, has interpreted Buddhist concepts in the light of the political situation of the ''Dalits'', in which there is tension between modernist rationalism and local devotion.

Scriptures have usually acted as guidance, and consensus about practices has come about through debate and discussion.{{sfn|Nakamura|1997|page=392}}

Several terms are used in Buddhism for faith, which have both cognitive and affective aspects:{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā}}
* ''Śraddhā'' ([[Sanskrit]]; {{lang-pi|saddhā|italics=yes}}; [[classical Chinese]]: ''wen-hsin'') refers to a sense of commitment to or trust in someone else, or a sense of engagement and commitment to practise.{{sfn|Gómez|2004b|p=277}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=388–9}} Traditional examples of this are the monks [[Ananda|Ānanda]],&lt;!--Conze only supports this part--&gt; the attendant of Gautama Buddha, and Vakkali, another disciple. ''Śraddhā'' is often seen as the counteragent of ill-will in the mind.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Ānanda, Pañcabala, Śraddhā}}{{sfn|Conze|2003|page=14}} The opposite of ''śraddhā'' is ''āśraddhya'', which refers to the lack of capacity to develop faith in a teacher and the teachings, and therefore being unable to develop energy on the spiritual path.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Āśraddhya}} The word ''śraddhā'' originates from the roots ''śrat'', "to have conviction", and ''dhā'', "to uphold",{{refn|group=note|Some scholars disagree with these glosses, however. Also, in the [[Veda]]s ''śraddhā'' is understood as an "attitude of mind based on truth".{{sfn|Rotman|2008|loc=Footnotes n.23}}}} and thus, according to religious studies scholar Sung-bae Park, indicates "sustaining confidence, remaining steadfast, or supporting trust, in the sense of abiding firmly".{{sfn|Park|1983|page=15}}
* ''Prasāda'' ([[Sanskrit]]; {{lang-pi|pasāda|italics=yes}}; [[classical Chinese]]: ''ching-hsin'') is more affective than ''śraddhā''. Being used with regard to rituals and ceremonies, it refers to a sense of serene acceptance of the blessings and greatness of the object of one's devotion.{{sfn|Gómez|2004b|p=278}} The word ''prasāda'' derives from the prefix ''pra'' and the root ''sād'', which mean "to sink down, to sit", and is defined by Park as "being firmly seated in a state of clearness and tranquility".{{sfn|Park|1983|page=15}} Thus, ''prasāda'' refers to the focus of the devotee's mind, its commitment and its heightened quality.{{sfn|Findly|2003|page=200}} It is described in more spontaneous terms than ''śraddhā''.{{sfn|Rotman|2008|loc=Seeing and Knowing}}

Faith is usually related to the [[Triple Gem]], that is the Buddha, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]] (his teaching) and the [[sangha|saṅgha]] (the community). Thus, faith may often have certain individuals as its object, but is different from devotion in other Indian religions (''[[bhakti]]'') in that it is connected with impersonal objects such as the working of karma and the efficacy of [[merit transfer]].{{sfn|Rotman|2008|loc=Seeing and Knowing, Getting and Giving}} It is seen to focus on or lead to a [[right view]] or understanding of the main aspects of the Buddha's teaching, such as the working of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]], [[merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā, Mūrdhan, Pañcabala, Xinxin}}{{sfn|Conze|2003|p=78}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=203}} Regarding the Triple Gem, faith focuses on and rejoices in the characteristics of the Buddha, the dharma and the saṅgha.{{sfn|Barua|1931|pages=332–3}} With regard to the working of karma, faith refers to a conviction that deeds have effects, good deeds having positive effects, and wrong deeds negative.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=205–6}} Thus, faith gives guidance in leading a life of charity, morality and religious qualities.{{sfn|Barua|1931|page=333}} Faith also covers ideas such as the nature of existence, its [[Anicca Dukkha Anatta|impermanence and conditioned nature]], and finally, the Buddha's [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or [[Nirvana]] and the path of practice leading up to Nirvana.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā, Mūrdhan, Pañcabala, Xinxin}}{{sfn|Conze|2003|p=78}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=203}} Faith entails a belief that there are people who have attained Nirvana and are able to teach it.{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|page=35}}

== History ==
[[Hajime Nakamura]] distinguishes two currents in Buddhism, which he describes as the devotional approach and the approach of "inner knowledge".{{sfn|Nakamura|1997|p=392}} Anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] discusses ''[[bhakti#Buddhism|bhakti]]'' (devotion) on the one hand and ''[[magga]]'' (the path to deliverance) on the other hand.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=34 n.6}} In Buddhism, in the development of the understanding of faith, two historical layers can be distinguished: early Buddhism and the later Mahāyāna Buddhism. Some early twentieth-century scholars, such as [[Louis de La Vallée-Poussin]], [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]] and [[Caroline Rhys Davids]], have been criticized by Sri Lankan scholars for not distinguishing the two sufficiently.{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|p=601}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=384–5}}

=== Early Buddhism ===

{{Main|Early Buddhism}}
In early Buddhist texts, such as [[Pāli]] texts, ''saddhā'' is usually translated as "faith", but with a different connotation than the English word.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=214}} It is sometimes also translated as "confidence", as in  confidence in doctrine.{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=203}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pages=69–70}} Faith in early Buddhism, in the words of scholar John Bishop, is essentially "religious without being theistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/faith/|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vADVlHDt?url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/faith/|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=no|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Winter 2016|title=Faith|date=30 March 2016|access-date=17 August 2017|first=John|last=Bishop|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]]|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not [[theocentrism|focus on a God as the centre of the religion]].{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|page=71}} As opposed to [[Vedic Brahmanism]], which preceded Buddhism, early Buddhist ideas of faith are more connected with the teachings that are learnt and practised, rather than focused on an outward deity.{{sfn|Findly|1992|p=258}} This does not mean that Buddhism's approach of reality had not been influenced by other traditions: at the time when Buddhism arose, several Indian religious communities taught a critical approach in understanding the truth.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|page=277}}

Faith is not just a mental commitment to a set of principles,{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=74–5}} but also has an affective quality.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā}}{{sfn|Werner|2013|page=45}} Scholars in early Buddhism distinguish between faith as [[Pīti|joy]] and serenity, raising the mind to a higher level;{{sfn|Werner|2013|page=45}} and
faith as an [[Vīrya|energy]] producing self-confidence,&lt;!--Buswell--&gt; required for dealing with temptations and for self-mastery.&lt;!--De Silva--&gt;{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā}}{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=216}} Because faith helps remove perplexity, it inspires and gives energy to the devotee.{{sfn|Barua|1931|page=332}}

A Buddhist thus aspires to faith in the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]] and the saṅgha, as well as the value of discipline. In early Buddhist texts, however, faith does not mean a hostile response or lack of recognition of other deities. Although the Buddha refutes the bloody sacrifice of animals, he does not in itself condemn peaceful offerings to deities, but considers those far less useful than alms offerings to the monastic saṅgha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giustarini|first=G.|year=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918115715/http://www.fupress.net/index.php/rss/article/view/2451/2286|url=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/rss/article/view/2451/2286|archive-date=18 September 2014|title=Faith and renunciation in Early Buddhism: ''saddhā'' and ''nekkhamma''|journal=Rivista di Studi Sud-Asiatici|issue=I|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=74–5}} Thus, everything is given its place in a hierarchy of usefulness, in which moral behavior is much more highly regarded than rites and rituals.{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|p=81}}

Faith is the consequence of impermanence and a wise perception of suffering (''[[dukkha]]''). Reflection on suffering and impermanence leads the devotees to a sense of [[samvega|fear and agitation]] ({{lang-pi|saṃvega|italic=yes}}), which motivates them to take refugee in the Triple Gem and cultivate faith as a result.{{sfn|Trainor|1989|pages=185–6}} Faith then leads to many other important mental qualities on the path to ''[[Nirvana]]'', such as joy, concentration and insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Harvey|first1=Peter|author-link=Peter Harvey|editor1-last=Emmanuel|editor1-first=Steven M.|encyclopedia=A companion to Buddhist philosophy|title=''Dukkha'', non-self, and the "Four Noble Truths"|date=2013|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-0-470-65877-2|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/A%20Companion%20to%20Buddhist%20Philosophy_Emmanuel.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vADr7eR4?url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/A%20Companion%20to%20Buddhist%20Philosophy_Emmanuel.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=no|pages=31, 49|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith in itself, however, is never regarded as sufficient for the attainment of ''Nirvana''.{{sfn|Thomas|1953|p=258}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=384}}

A faithful Buddhist layman or laywoman is called an ''[[upasaka and Upasika|upāsaka or upāsika]]'', respectively. To become a layperson, no formal ritual is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tremblay|first1=Xavier|editor1-last=Heirman|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Bumbacher|editor2-first=Stephan Peter|encyclopedia=The spread of Buddhism|title=The spread of Buddhism in Serindia|date=2007|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vADtlDZJ?url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/The%20Spread%20of%20Buddhism_HDO_Vol.16_2007.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=no|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158306|edition=online|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/The%20Spread%20of%20Buddhism_HDO_Vol.16_2007.pdf|page=87|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|p=247}} Some [[Pāli Canon]] passages, as well as later commentators such as [[Buddhaghosa]], state that a Buddhist layman can go to heaven only by the strength of his faith in and love for the Buddha, yet in other passages faith is listed together with other virtues, such as morality, as qualities that lead the devotee to heaven.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=215}}{{sfn|Thomas|1953|pp=56, 117}} Regardless, faith is an important part of the ideal of Buddhist laypeople, as they are described to be in the habit of seeing the saṅgha, listening to their teachings, and most importantly, providing charity for the saṅgha. ''Saddhā'' in the lay life is strongly connected with [[dana (Buddhism)|''dāna'' (generosity)]]: the faithful gift is the most spiritually important gift.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=200, 202}}

Faith is included in lists of virtues for laypeople, and is therefore described as a progressive quality for devotees, as a devotee who is new to the Buddhist religion is characterized as "young in devotion".{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=202}} Thus, there are various lists of virtues in which faith is included,{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=215}} and other early traditions have also given faith a prominent role, such as the [[Sarvāstivāda]] tradition.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā}} Moreover, early Buddhism describes faith as an important quality in [[Sotāpanna|stream-enterers]], a state preceding enlightenment.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=85, 237}}{{sfn|De Silva|2002}} In standard descriptions of people [[Pabbajja|going forth]] (taking ordination as a monk), faith is mentioned as an important motivation. Despite this role, some Indologists such as [[André Bareau]] and Lily De Silva believed early Buddhism did not assign the same value to faith as in some other religions, such as Christianity. Bareau argued that "Buddhism has no comparable [idea of] pure faith as in Christianity, ... The idea of blind faith, an absolute faith in a master's word, goes completely against the spirit of early Buddhism."{{sfn|De Silva|2002|pp=214–5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ergardt|first1=Jan T.|title=Faith and knowledge in early Buddhism : an analysis of the contextual structures of an arahant-formula in the Majjhima-Nikāya|date=1977|publisher=Brill (publisher)|location=Leiden|isbn=9004048413|doi=10.2307/2054272|page=1|quote=Der Buddhismus kennt keinen dem des Christentums vergleichbaren reinen Glauben, ...

==== Taking refuge ====

{{Main|Refuge (Buddhism)}}
[[File:Alms giving to several thousand monks, next to Central World in Bangkok on the morning of Sunday 18th March 2012.png|alt=Alms giving to several thousand monks in Bangkok, in an organized event|thumb|In the [[Pāli Canon]], the [[Buddhist monk]] is given a significant role in promoting and upholding faith among [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|laypeople]].{{sfn|Wijayaratna|1990|pages=130–1}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kuladūșaka}}]]
Since early Buddhism, devotees expressed their faith through the act of taking refuge, which is [[Three Refuges|threefold]]. In this, it centres on the authority of a Buddha as a supremely awakened being, by assenting to a role for a Buddha as a teacher of both humans and ''[[deva (Buddhism)|devās]]'' (heavenly beings). This often includes other Buddhas from the past, and Buddhas who have not yet arisen. Secondly, the taking of refuge honours the truth and efficacy of the Buddha's [[Dharma (Buddhism)|spiritual doctrine]], which includes the characteristics of [[saṅkhāra|phenomenon]] ({{lang-pi|saṅkhāra|italic=yes}}) such as their [[anicca|impermanence]] ({{lang-pi|anicca|italic=yes}}), and the path to liberation.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=245}}&lt;ref name="Kariyawasam"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kariyawasam|first=A.G.S.|year=1995|title=Buddhist Ceremonies and Rituals of Sri Lanka|series=The Wheel Publication|location=Kandy, Sri Lanka|publisher=[[Buddhist Publication Society]]|accessdate=23 October 2007|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328021534/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html|archivedate=28 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taking of refuge ends with the acceptance of worthiness of the [[sangha (Buddhism)|community of spiritually developed followers]] (the saṅgha), which is mostly defined as the monastic community, but may also include lay people and even ''devās'' provided they are [[Four stages of enlightenment|nearly or completely enlightened]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=246}}{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=43}} Early Buddhism did not include ''[[bodhisattva]]s'' in the Three Refuges, because they were considered to still be on the path to enlightenment.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Paramatthasaṅgha}}

Early texts describe the saṅgha as a "[[field of merit]]", because early Buddhists regard offerings to them as particularly karmically fruitful.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=246}} Lay devotees support and revere the saṅgha, of which they believe it will render them merit and bring them closer to enlightenment.{{sfn|Werner|2013|page=39}} At the same time, the Buddhist monk is given a significant role in promoting and upholding faith among laypeople. Although many examples in the canon are mentioned of well-behaved monks, there are also cases of monks misbehaving. In such cases, the texts describe that the Buddha responds with great sensitivity to the perceptions of the lay community. When the Buddha sets out new rules in the [[Patimokkha|monastic code]] to deal with the wrongdoings of his monastics, he usually states that such behavior should be curbed, because it would not "persuade non-believers" and "believers will turn away". He expects monks, nuns and novices to not only to lead the spiritual life for their own benefit, but also to uphold the faith of the people.&lt;!--p.130--&gt; On the other hand, they are not to take the task of inspiring faith to the extent of hypocrisy or inappropriateness,&lt;!--p.131--&gt; for example, by taking on other professions apart from being a monastic, or by courting favours by giving items to the laypeople.{{sfn|Wijayaratna|1990|pages=130–1}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kuladūșaka}}

Thus, taking refuge is a form of aspiration to lead a life with the Triple Gem at its core. Taking refuge is done by a short formula in which one names the Buddha, the dharma and the saṅgha as refuges.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=403}}{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=43}} In early Buddhist scriptures, taking refuge is an expression of determination to follow the Buddha's path, but not a relinquishing of responsibility.&lt;ref name="Kariyawasam" /&gt;

==== Through verification ====

[[File:Kesariya.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Buddhist [[stūpa]] in [[Kesaria|Kesariya]], [[Bihar]], India, erected in honour of the [[Kalama Sutta|Kalāma Sutta]]|alt=Buddhist [[stūpa]] in [[Kesaria|Kesariya]], [[Bihar]], India]]
Faith can lead practitioners to take refuge in the Triple Gem, which opens them up to new spiritual experiences previously unknown to them. This is the devotional or mystical aspect of faith. But there is also a rational aspect, in that the value of taking refuge is rooted in personal verification.{{sfn|Nakamura|1997|p=392}} In the [[sutra|discourse]] (''sutta'') called the ''[[Kalama Sutta|Kalāma Sutta]]'', the Buddha argues against following sacred authority, tradition, a doctrine of logic, or respecting teachers for the mere fact that they are one's teachers.{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|p=604}} Knowledge coming from such sources is based on [[kilesa|greed, hatred and delusion]] and Buddhist devotees should consider such knowledge impartially and not blindly. However, it should not all be refuted either. They should find out whether a teaching is true by personal verification of spiritual truth instead, distinguishing what leads to happiness and benefit, and what does not.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=390}}{{sfn|Fuller|2004|page=36}}{{refn|group=note|The discourse can be found online at [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.soma.html The Kalāma Sutta, translated by [[Soma Thera]]]}} Giving an example of such an approach, the Buddha states that the practice of abandoning greed, hatred and delusion will benefit the practitioner, regardless of whether there is such a thing as karmic retribution and rebirth.&lt;ref name="Blakkarly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blakkarly|first1=Jarni|title=The Buddhist Leap of Faith|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/11/05/4122342.htm|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=[[ABC (Australia)|ABC]]|date=5 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727125253/http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/11/05/4122342.htm|archivedate=27 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, personal experience and judgement are emphasized in accepting the Buddha and Buddhism. A person should, however, also heed the counsel of the wise.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=215}}

In the discourse called the ''Canki Sutta'', the Buddha points out that people's beliefs may turn out in two different ways: they might either be genuine, factual and not mistaken; or vain, empty and false. Thus, when a person holds a certain belief, they should not derive the conclusion "Only this is true, anything else is false," but instead "preserve the truth" with the awareness "This is my belief".{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|p=603}}{{sfn|Fuller|2004|page=36}}{{refn|group=note|The discourse can be found at:
 {{cite web|title=Canki Sutta: With Canki|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html|first=Thanissaro|last=Bhikkhu|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|access-date=2017-05-26}}}} Thus, the discourse criticizes, among others, [[divine revelation]], tradition and report, as leading to "groundless faith" and as an incomplete means of acquiring spiritual knowledge or truth.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=215}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1976|pp=27–8}} But in the ''Sandaka Sutta'', the Buddha also criticizes mere reasoning or logic as a means of attaining to truth.{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|p=603}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1976|pp=27–8}} Instead, personal and direct intuitive knowledge are required to attain the truth, when such knowledge is not affected by bias.&lt;!--p.29--&gt;{{sfn|Kalupahana|1976|pp=27–9}}{{sfn|Holder|2013|pp=225–6}} Thus, belief and faith are not considered sufficient for arriving at truth, even in spiritual matters where other religious traditions would refer to faith. The Buddha does not agree with traditions that demand blind faith in scriptures or teachers.{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|page=601}}{{sfn|Holder|2013|pp=225–6}} In one discourse, when asked on which authority the Buddha bases his teachings on, he answers that he does not base them on tradition, faith, or reason, bur rather on personal experience as a source of authority.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=169–71}}
[[File:Buddha Kopf.jpg|alt=Head of the Buddha|thumb|The Buddha states in several discourses, including the ''Vimaṁsaka Sutta'', that his disciples should investigate even him as to whether he really is enlightened and pure in conduct, by observing him for a long time.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|pp=215–6}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=390–3}}]]
In conclusion, the Buddhist devotee should verify moral judgment and truth by personal experience. This then leads to a provisional acceptance, called "preserving the truth". Faith goes hand-in-hand with an open attitude of willing to learn and try out, familiarizing oneself with the teaching. Through personal verification a person's faith deepens, ultimately changing from "preserving" to "discovering" the truth.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=215}}{{sfn|Fuller|2004|page=36}} This verification process involves ordinary experience, but also the [[yoga|yogic]] experience of cultivation of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://historiadelartecursos.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/brian-carr-indira-mahalingam-companion-encyclopedia-of-asian-philosophy.pdf|last1=Jackson|first1=Roger R.|editor1-last=Carr|editor1-first=Brian|editor2-last=Mahalingam|editor2-first=Indira|encyclopedia=Companion encyclopedia of Asian philosophy|title=Buddhism in India|date=1997|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|isbn=0-415-03535-X|page=290|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730062207/https://historiadelartecursos.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/brian-carr-indira-mahalingam-companion-encyclopedia-of-asian-philosophy.pdf|archivedate=2017-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffmann|1987|page=409}} Furthermore, the Buddha applies these criteria to his own teaching: he is qualified to teach his dharma because he has verified it for himself, not learnt it from someone else or reasoned it out.{{sfn|Holder|2013|p=227}} The Buddha states in several discourses, including the ''Vimaṁsaka Sutta'', that his disciples should investigate even him as to whether he really is enlightened and pure in conduct, by observing him for a long time.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|pp=215–6}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=390–3}} Several people are described in the Pāli Canon observing the Buddha in such way, and arriving at grounded faith.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|pp=215–6}} This does not mean, however, that the Buddha does not accept any acts of reverence to his person: he teaches that devotional acts can help to uplift the lay practitioners' minds, and help them on the path to a better rebirth and enlightenment.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pages=43–4}} Devotion is therefore a subject that requires the serious practitioner's interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tuladhar-Douglas|first1=William|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Pūjā: Buddhist pūjā|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=0-02-865980-5|page=7496|edition=2nd|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2011.pdf|volume=11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302005458/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2011.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== As initial step ====

Faith is an initial trust in the Buddha as a spiritual teacher and an initial acceptance of the Buddha's teachings. Faith is considered of great benefit to a beginning practitioner of the Buddhist teaching.{{sfn|Nakamura|1997|p=392}}{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=216}} In the ''Cula-hatthipadopama Sutta'', the Buddha describes the path of enlightenment as starting with faith in him, but continuing with the practise of virtue, meditation and wisdom, culminating in the achievement of enlightenment. Thus, the initial faith provides the confidence to continue the path up unto the final aim,{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|pp=602–3}} and for this reason, in early Buddhist teachings faith is usually listed as the first quality in progressive lists of virtues.{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=202}}

Besides ''saddhā'', another word, ''pasāda'', and its related synonyms ''pasanna'' and ''pasidati'', are sometimes also translated as 'faith', but are given a higher value than ''saddhā''.&lt;!--p=214--&gt; ''Saddhā'' deepens when someone progresses along the spiritual path, and early texts sometimes describe this as ''pasāda'',&lt;!--p=216--&gt;{{sfn|De Silva|2002|pp=214, 216}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=31}}{{sfn|Trainor|1989|page=187}} and sometimes as ''bhakti''.{{sfn|Barua|1931|page=333}} ''Pasāda'' is faith and attraction towards a teacher, but is accompanied by clarity of mind, placidity and understanding.{{sfn|Trainor|1989|page=187}} The practicing disciple develops and stabilizes his faith, basing it on spiritual insight.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=216}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=297}} This leads his faith to become "unshakeable".{{sfn|Suvimalee|2005|pp=601–2}}{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=217}}

Thus, faith is by itself not enough to attain deliverance, but is a first step on the path leading to [[paññā|wisdom]] and enlightenment.{{sfn|Findly|1992|page=265}} Many teachings in early Buddhism mention faith as the first step, whereas wisdom is mentioned as the last.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=237}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=396–7}} On the last stage of the Buddhist path, the attainment of ''arahant'', the practitioner has completely replaced faith by wisdom. At that point, the ''arahant'' no longer relies on faith at all,{{sfn|Barua|1931|p=336}}{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=384}} although at this stage sometimes a form of realized faith is described.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1987|pages=405, 409}} Therefore, the Buddha praises most of his disciples for their wisdom, rather than their faith. The exception to that, the monk Vakkali, praised by the Buddha as "the highest of those who had faith", is also taught by the Buddha to concentrate on the teaching, rather than the Buddha's person.{{sfn|De Silva|2002|p=216}}{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=384}} The Buddha is seen admonishing his disciple Ānanda in a similar way.{{sfn|Findly|1992|pp=268–9}}

In the Pāli Canon, different approaches of faith are described. Developing faith in someone's person, even the Buddha himself, is of little use when it is too much connected with superficial features—such as physical appearance—and too little with the Buddha's teaching. Such an approach to faith is said to lead to affection and anger and has other disadvantages. It is an impediment to walking in the steps of the Buddha and attaining enlightenment, such as in the case of Vakkali. Faith and devotion must always go hand-in-hand with a sense of [[upekkha|equanimity]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=28}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=388}}{{sfn|Werner|2013|page=47}}

=== Mahāyāna Buddhism ===

During the period of [[Ashoka|emperor Ashoka]] (third to second century BCE), Buddhists placed more emphasis on faith, as Ashoka helped develop Buddhism as a popular religion to unify his empire. This new trend led to an increased worship of ''stūpas'' and an increase of [[Avadāna]] faith-based literature.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=103}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swearer|first1=Donald K.|title=The Buddhist world of Southeast Asia|date=2010|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|location=Albany|isbn=978-1-4384-3251-9|page=77|edition=2nd|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/the%20buddhist%20world%20of%20southeast%20asia_swearer.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vADhQmDu?url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/The%20Buddhist%20World%20of%20Southeast%20Asia_Swearer.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second century CE, it became more common to depict the Buddha through images, and there was a shift in emphasis in [[Indian religion]] towards [[Bhakti|emotional devotionalism]].&lt;!--Smart; Harvey 105--&gt; This led to new perspectives in Buddhism, summarized by [[Buddhist studies]] scholar Peter Harvey as "compassion, faith and wisdom". These perspectives paved the way to the arising of [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhism.&lt;!--p=105--&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=103, 105}}{{sfn|Smart|1997|page=282}}

In general, the role of faith in Mahāyāna Buddhism is similar to that of Theravāda{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=31}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=34 n.6}}—in both, faith is an unavoidable part of practice.&lt;ref name="Blakkarly" /&gt; Even in present-day Theravāda Buddhism, originating from Pāli Budhism, faith is still important in traditional Buddhist societies. Theravādins see faith in the Triple Gem as a protective force in daily life, especially when combined with a [[Buddhist ethics|moral life]].{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=15m1}} However, with the rising of Mahāyāna Buddhism, the depth and range of teachings on faith intensified. A great number of ''[[bodhisattva]]s'' became focus of devotion and faith, giving Mahāyāna Buddhism a "theistic" side.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=172}}{{sfn|Leaman|2000|page=212}} In early Buddhism, there were already some passages that suggested the Buddha and other enlightened beings had a world-transcending nature. Later Theravādins believed that [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha, was waiting for them in heaven and they honoured him gradually more. Nevertheless, Mahāyānists took this idea much further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://historiadelartecursos.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/brian-carr-indira-mahalingam-companion-encyclopedia-of-asian-philosophy.pdf|last1=Werner|first1=Karel|author-link=Karel Werner|editor1-last=Carr|editor1-first=Brian|editor2-last=Mahalingam|editor2-first=Indira|encyclopedia=Companion encyclopedia of Asian philosophy|title=Non-orthodox Indian philosophies|date=1997|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|isbn=0-415-03535-X|pages=116–7|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730062207/https://historiadelartecursos.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/brian-carr-indira-mahalingam-companion-encyclopedia-of-asian-philosophy.pdf|archivedate=2017-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|Hallisey|1987|p=1064}}{{sfn|Conze|2003|p=154}} After the [[parinirvāṇa|Buddha's death]], there was a sense of regret among Buddhist communities about the absence of the Buddha in the world, and a desire to "see" the Buddha ({{lang-sa|[[Darśana#In Mahayana Buddhism|darśana]]}}) and receive his power.{{sfn|Getz|2004|page=699}}{{sfn|Barber|2004|page=707}} Mahāyānists extended the meaning of the Triple Gem to include Buddhas that reside in heavens, and later called these ''[[sambhogakāya]]'' Buddhas ('embodiment of the enjoyment of the Dharma').{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=707}}{{sfn|Smart|1997|pp=283–4}} The increased emphasis on these celestial Buddhas, manifest all the time and everywhere, started to overshadow the role of Gautama Buddha in the Buddhist faith.{{sfn|Reynolds|Hallisey|1987|p=1067}}{{sfn|Snellgrove|1987|pp=1078–9}} [[Pure Land Buddhism]] mostly focused its faith to these celestial Buddhas, especially the Buddha Amitābha.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=175}}{{sfn|Leaman|2000|p=215}}

Starting from this devotion to celestial Buddhas,{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=175}}{{sfn|Leaman|2000|p=215}} advanced ''bodhisattva'' beings, representing Mahāyāna ideals, gradually became focus of an extensive worship and cult.{{sfn|Conze|2003|p=150}} By the sixth century, depiction of ''bodhisattvas'' in [[Buddhist iconography]] had become common,{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=175}} such as the ''bodhisattva'' Avalokiteśvara representing compassion, and [[Manjusri]] wisdom.{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=210}} Accounts about the ''bodhisattvas'' and their good deeds often included actions with great stakes, and it is likely that writers meant these accounts as devotional more than exemplary.{{sfn|Derris|2005|page=1084}}

Thus, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the emphasis in Japanese Buddhism shifted from personal enlightenment to [[hongaku|connecting with the universal Buddha nature]] and the realms in which the Buddhas live.{{sfn|Bielefeldt|2004|pages=389–90}} With the development of the [[Mādhyamaka]] system of thought, the Buddha was no longer regarded as only a historical person, and the idea of essential unity in all living beings became an intrinsic part of Buddhist theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murti|first1=T.R.V.|authorlink1=Tiruppattur_R._Venkatachala_Murthi|title=The central philosophy of Buddhism: a study of the Mādhyamika system|date=2008|orig-year=1955|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|isbn=1-135-02946-6|page=6|url=https://www.academia.edu/16004454/The_Central_Philosophy_of_Buddhism_A_Study_of_Madhyamika_System_by_T.R.V._Murti|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122120355/https://www.academia.edu/16004454/The_Central_Philosophy_of_Buddhism_A_Study_of_Madhyamika_System_by_T.R.V._Murti|archivedate=2017-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development led to the devotion movement of Pure Land Buddhism, whereas in Zen Buddhism it led to the emphasis of seeking the [[Buddha Nature]] within oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiyota|first1=Minoru|title=Tathāgatagarbha Thought: A Basis of Buddhist Devotionalism in East Asia|journal=[[Japanese Journal of Religious Studies]]|date=1985|volume=12|issue=2/3|page=222|doi=10.2307/30233958|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2311|doi-broken-date=2018-01-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320232345/https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2311|archivedate=2016-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms for faith that are primarily used in Mahāyāna Buddhism are ''Xin'' (Chinese) and ''shin'' (Japanese):&lt;!--only Buswell--&gt; these terms can refer to trust, but also an unquestioned acceptance of the object of one's devotion. They are also used, as it is in [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen Buddhism]], with regard to a confidence that the Buddha nature (''tathāgatagarbha'') is hidden within one's mind, and can be found as one suspends the habits of the mind.{{sfn|Gómez|2004b|p=278}}{{sfn|Bielefeldt|2004|page=390}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Śraddhā}} As such, Chan and Zen Buddhists consider faith as one of the ''[[Three Essentials]]'' in meditation practice, together with resolve and doubt.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Sanyao, Zongmen huomen}}{{sfn|Powers|2013|loc=dai funshi ("great resolve")}} Pure Land Buddhists, on the other hand, make a distinction between the aspect of the mind which is faithful, and which is awakened by practising devotion and humility to the Buddha [[Amitābha]], known as ''xinji'' (Chinese) or ''[[shinjin]]'' (Japanese);&lt;!--all three--&gt; and the joy and confidence of being able to meet the Buddha  Amitābha, known as ''xinfa'' (Chinese) or ''shingyō'' (Japanese).&lt;!--Gomez and Buswell--&gt;{{sfn|Bielefeldt|2004|page=390}}{{sfn|Gómez|2004b|p=279}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Xinxin}} Pure Land traditions describe the awakening of faith as a transcendental experience beyond time, similar to a state preceding enlightenment.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=255}} In the teachings of the Japanese Pure Land teacher [[Shinran]], such experience of faith, which he called "the Light" (''[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: kōmyō'') involved devotees not only feeling completely assured about the Buddha Amitābha as to his determination and wisdom to save them, but also feeling fully reliant on Amitābha because of their personal incapacity.{{sfn|Dobbins|2002|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Bloom|first1=Alfred|author-link=Alfred Bloom (Buddhist)|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Shinran|date=1987|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=0-02-865981-3|edition=2nd|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2012.pdf|volume=12|p=8355|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302052813/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the important developments that took place in the arising of Mahayana Buddhism, it would be simplistic to state that no devotional movement existed before Mahāyāna. Devotionalism had become common in texts and practices in the same period that the [[Abhidhamma]] texts were compiled, even before Mahāyāna developed.{{sfn|Schopen|2004|p=496}} Furthermore, later Theravāda Buddhism started emphasizing hagiographical accounts of the Buddha and ''bodhisattva'' more,&lt;!--p=1085--&gt; and in many accounts the Buddha played a major role in other people's enlightenment.&lt;!--pp=1085, 7--&gt;{{sfn|Derris|2005|pp=1085, 1087}}

The [[Lotus Sūtra]], one of the most worshiped texts ({{lang-sa|sūtra|script=Latn}}) in Southeast Asia ,&lt;!--p.512--&gt;{{sfn|Shields|2013|p=512}} embraces the ideal of faith.{{sfn|Shields|2013|pp=512, 514}}
In medieval China and Japan, many miraculous legends were related to the Lotus Sūtra, contributing to its popularity. Scholars have suggested that the ''sūtra's'' emphasis on the Buddha as a father has helped make the ''sūtra'' popular.&lt;!--p.515--&gt;{{sfn|Shields|2013|pp=512, 514–5}}

The Lotus Sūtra was composed in the first two centuries of the [[Common Era]].&lt;!--p=471--&gt; Part of the "[[Cult of the Book]]", Mahāyānists honoured and worshiped the Lotus Sūtra just like many other Mahāyāna sutras, similar to the worship of ''stūpas'' before the arising of Mahāyāna Buddhism. They worshiped the Lotus Sūtra more than most ''sūtras''. The ''sūtra'' itself describes different types of devotion to it—receiving and keeping, reading, reciting, teaching and transcribing it—and was actually worshiped in a large variety of ways. In some copies, scribes depicted every letter similar to a Buddha, enshrined in a ''stūpa''.&lt;!--p=474--&gt;{{sfn|Stone|2004a|pp=471, 474}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Gummer|first1=Natalie|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Buddhist books and texts: Ritual uses of books|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=0-02-865997-X|edition=2nd|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|volume=2|p=1262|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the theoretical implications of the Lotus Sūtra influenced traditional scholars, the devotional practices surrounding the ''sūtra'' affected Buddhism even more.{{sfn|Stone|2004a|p=474}} The Chinese [[Tiantai]] school (6th century) and its later Japanese form, [[Tendai]], further promoted worship of the Lotus Sūtra, combined with devotion toward Amitābha Buddha.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=227}}{{sfn|Stone|2004a|p=475}} These schools believed the ''sūtra'' to be supreme among all of the Buddha's teachings,&lt;!--p=475--&gt; and leading to enlightenment in the present lifetime.&lt;!--p=476--&gt;{{sfn|Stone|2004a|pp=475–6}} Some schools of the [[Kamakura period]] (twelfth–fourteenth century), took reverence towards the Lotus Sūtra to the extent that they saw it as the [[Ekayāna|single one vehicle or path of the dharma]],&lt;!--p.514, 519--&gt; and they believed only this practice led society to an ideal Buddha land.&lt;!--p.521--&gt;{{sfn|Shields|2013|pp=514, 519, 521}}

For example, the Japanese teacher [[Nichiren]] (1222–82) promoted faith in and worship of the ''sūtra'' for this reason, criticizing other schools and types of worship sharply.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=233–4}}{{sfn|Araki|1987|p=1244}} Seeing the ''sutra'' as a prophecy of the mission of his own movement,{{sfn|Stone|2004a|p=476}}{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=366}} Nichiren believed that through devotion to the ''sutra'' a [[Pure Land]] on earth could be realized,&lt;!--Stone--&gt; a land which is a depiction of the ideal of enlightenment in Māhayāna Buddhism.{{sfn|Stone|2004a|p=477}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Kotatsu|translator-first=Kenneth K.|translator-last=Tanaka|first1=Fujita|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Pure and Impure Lands|date=1987|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=0-02-865743-8|page=7502|edition=2nd|url=http://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2011.pdf|volume=11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302005458/http://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2011.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that worship of the ''sūtra'' led the practitioner to unite with the [[Eternal Buddha|primordial Buddha]], of whom he believed all Buddhas are manifestations.{{sfn|Stone|2004a|p=474}} Nichiren promoted the invocation of the sutra title based "on faith alone".{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=123}} Despite this great devotion to the Lotus Sūtra, Nichiren de-emphasized the study of the sutra, believing that chanting the [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō|title of the sutra]], was the most effective practice for people living in the [[mappō|"Age of Dharma Decline"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Cabezón|first1=José Ignacio|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Scripture|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|page=757|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614204648/http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See below|Pure Land Buddhism}}

It is perhaps in the "Pure Land" ''sūtras'' that faith and devotion reach a pinnacle of [[soteriological]] importance. When devotion to celestial Buddhas developed in Mahāyāna Buddhism, the idea arose that these Buddhas were able to create 'Buddha-fields' {{lang-sa|buddha-kṣetra|italic=yes}}), or Pure Lands ({{lang-sa|sukhāvatī|italic=yes}}).{{sfn|Smart|1997|p=282}} In Pure Land Buddhism, it is one's faith in the salvific compassion of the Buddha Amitābha,{{sfn|Green|2013|p=122}} coupled with the earnest wish to enter his Pure Land that is said to bring deliverance there. This Pure Land  prepares the devotee for entry into awakening and Nirvana.{{sfn|Hsieh|2009|pp=236–7}}{{sfn|Green|2013|p=123}} Pure Land Buddhism differed in many ways from most forms of Buddhism at the time, which were based on personal effort and techniques of self-mastery.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=394}}

Mahāyānist Buddhists considered Amitābha ([[Sanskrit]], 'limitless light') as one of the celestial Buddhas.{{sfn|Smart|1997|page=282}}{{sfn|Gómez|2004a|p=14}} The [[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]] describes the Buddha Amitābha as a monk who, practicing under a Buddha in a previous age, vowed to create a land through his spiritual powers. Through this ideal land he would easily be able to guide many [[sentient beings (Buddhism)|living beings]] to final enlightenment.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=173}} He therefore vowed that once he had attained [[Buddhahood]], just calling his name would be enough for living beings to be born in this Pure Land.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Dharmākara}} Widespread in Japan, Korea, China and Tibet,&lt;!--Smart--&gt; devotion to the Buddha Amitābha arose in India around the beginning of the Common Era.&lt;!--Gomez--&gt;{{sfn|Gómez|2004a|p=14}}{{sfn|Smart|1997|page=284}} Central to Pure Land Buddhism is the idea that the current age humans live in is the Age of Dharma Decline (''[[Chinese language|Chinese:]] mofa'', ''[[Japanese language|Japanese:]] mappō''), the final stage of the [[Gautama Buddha|current Buddha]]'s dispensation.{{sfn|Hsieh|2009|pp=236–7}}{{sfn|Green|2013|p=123}} Pure Land Buddhists believe that in this period people are severely limited in their own capability for attaining salvation. They must therefore rely on external power (the Buddha Amitābha) to find salvation, and delay their attainment of Nirvana to another life (during their rebirth in the Pure Land).{{sfn|Hsieh|2009|pp=236–7}}{{sfn|Green|2013|p=123}} This shared sentiment may have been due to the violent civil conflicts, famines, fires and decay of monastic institutions.{{sfn|Andrews|1987|p=4119}} But the idea of reliance on an external power might also have been a consequence of the Mahāyāna teachings on the nature of the Buddha, which made the distance between the unenlightened and [[Buddhahood]] much greater.{{sfn|Williams|2008|page=247}}
[[File:Two Patriarchs - Shandao (Otani University Museum).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Painting of the Chinese priest and writer [[Shandao]]|alt=Painting of the Chinese priest and writer Shandao]]

Pure Land Buddhism was established as an institution by the teacher [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] (334–416 CE) on [[Mount Lu]] with the founding of the [[White Lotus Society]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=707}} [[Shandao]] (613–681) started emphasizing reciting mantras in honour of Amitābha Buddha (''[[Chinese language|Chinese]]'': ''[[nianfo]]''; ''[[Japanese language|Japanese]]'': ''[[nembutsu]]''), combined with several other practices.{{sfn|Getz|2004|page=701}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=255}} There seems to have been a paradox in Pure Land faith from the start, in that two ideals were advocated simultaneously: on the one hand, Pure Land teachers taught that the ''bodhisattvas'' who created their Pure Lands were exemplary in their own efforts to make merits as an energy to create the Pure Land from, inspiring the devotee to follow this example. On the other hand, it was taught that practitioners should solely rely on their devotion to the Buddhas in the Pure Land, in particular Amitābha, who would come to their rescue. In Japanese Pure Land Buddhism, the latter ideal became prevalent.{{sfn|Getz|2004|pages=698–9}} But even in Japan, there was much debate as to what emphasis to give to [[Jiriki|the {{em|active}} efforts of the devotee]] on the one hand, and the [[tariki|{{em|passive}} reliance]] on Amitābha Buddha and his vow on the other hand.&lt;ref name="Hirota"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-pure-land/|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vAEpCKMW?url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-pure-land/|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=no|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Winter 2016|title=Japanese Pure Land Philosophy|date=19 November 2012|access-date=18 August 2017|first=Dennis|last=Hirota|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]]|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dobbins|2002|page=19}}{{refn|group=note|Religious studies scholar Allan A.

Pure Land Buddhism is currently still one of the most popular forms of religion in East Asia,&lt;!--all refs--&gt; and is practised by most East Asian monks.&lt;!--Welch, Hudson--&gt;{{sfn|Hsieh|2009|p=236}}{{sfn|Welch|1967|p=396}}{{sfn|Hudson|2005|page=1293}} As of the 1990s, the older generation of Chinese people still used the Amitābha mantra in common everyday greetings.{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|page=198}}

===== Japan =====
The Tendai scholar [[Genshin]] (942–1017), Tendai priest [[Hōnen]] (1133–1212) and his student Shinran (1173–1262) applied Shandao's teachings in Japan, creating Pure Land Buddhism there as a separate school for the first time.{{sfn|Abe|1997|page=689}}{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=708}}{{sfn|Andrews|1987|p=4119}} They believed and taught that mindfully reciting the ''nembutsu'' would be enough to secure the faithful person's entrance into the Western Paradise.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=229}}{{sfn|Green|2013|pp=121–3}} Although Hōnen had initially stated that {{em|often}} repeating the mantra would make salvation more certain, Shinran later said that {{em|one}} utterance would be enough for salvation (''[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ichinengi'').{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, in some texts [[Shinran]] argued that the number of times the ''[[nembutsu]]'' was recited, whether once or many, did not provide a complete answer to the question of salvation.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Ichinengi}}}} Subsequent repetitions would be mere expressions of gratitude to the Buddha Amitābha, which also held for other religious routines and practices. Deep understanding of the Buddha's teachings, moral practice and meditation were not necessary, Shinran concluded,{{sfn|Green|2013|pp=122–3}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=230, 255}} even considering some practices such as meditation as detrimental to reliance on Amitābha Buddha.{{sfn|Hudson|2005|page=1294}}

The concept of faith that Shinran adopted originated with Shandao:{{sfn|Williams|2008|page=262}} firstly, a sincere belief in the person of Amitābha Buddha; secondly, a deep trust in the vow that Amitābha Buddha had taken, and a conviction one's own low nature, and finally, a desire to dedicate the merits accrued from doing good deeds to be born in the Pure Land where Amitābha Buddha was believed to live.&lt;!--both--&gt; These three were together known as 'singleness of heart' (''[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: isshin'').&lt;!--only Dobbins--&gt;{{sfn|Conze|2003|p=158}}{{sfn|Dobbins|2002|pp=34–5}} Shinran further taught that such full faith would make people equal to [[Maitreya]], the coming Buddha, because their full enlightenment would be irreversibly assured.{{sfn|Dobbins|2002|pp=42–3}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=264}}

Shinran took Hōnen's teaching to the extreme: since he was convinced that he was destined to fall in hell without the help of the Buddha Amitābha, devotion to the Buddha Amitābha and trust in his vow was the single way to salvation.{{sfn|Abe|1997|p=692}}{{sfn|Porcu|2008|page=17}} Whereas Hōnen had emphasized mostly devotion to the Buddha Amitābha, he did not do so exclusively: Shinran, on the other hand, taught a path of devotion to only the Buddha Amitābha.{{sfn|Irons|2008|page=258}} Thus, Shinran's Pure Land Buddhism focused on a limited set of practices, in contrast to the many practices of Tendai Buddhism. Characteristic of this period in Japanese Buddhism was the selective nature of faith: Japanese Pure Land teachers such as Shinran taught that Pure Land was the {{em|only}} form of Buddhism that was the right path;&lt;!--both refs--&gt; other forms of Buddhism were criticized as ineffective for the Age of Dharma Decline. (This development of 'selective Buddhism', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:''senchaku bukkyō'', would also affect Nichiren Buddhism.&lt;!--Bielefeldt--&gt;{{sfn|Bielefeldt|2004|pages=388–9}}{{sfn|Dobbins|2004a|page=412}}) Thirdly, although early Buddhism already emphasized letting-go of self-conceit by practicing the dharma, in the later Pure Land tradition this was drawn further by stating that people should give up all "self-power" and let the healing power of Amitābha do the work of attaining salvation for them.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=230}}{{sfn|Conze|2003|p=159}} This power was even believed to transcend the law of karma.&lt;!--4934--&gt; Moreover, whereas Honen had taught faith could be built up by the ''nembutsu'' practice, Shinran stated that faith needed to {{em|precede}} practice, and could not be built up through it.&lt;!--4935--&gt;{{sfn|Shōto|1987|page=4934–5}} A fourth characteristic of the movement was its democratic nature:{{sfn|Andrews|1987|p=4119}}{{sfn|Abe|1997|page=689}} in some passages Shinran stated that "wicked" people have just as much chance of attaining to the Pure Land as "good" people, an idea similar to the Christian concept of "[[salvation of sinners]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/142060/An_Introduction_to_Buddhist_Ethics.pdf|last1=Harvey|first1=Peter|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|date=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|However, some scholars have downplayed the role of new movements like Pure Land Buddhism in the [[Kamakura period]], stating that reform also took place in old Buddhist schools, and that some of the new movements only gained significance much later.{{sfn|Dobbins|2004a|page=414}}}}

The old Buddhist orders highly condemned the movement, for starting a new school, distorting Buddhist teachings, and reviling Gautama Buddha. When the emperor felt that some of Honen's monastics acted inappropriately, Hōnen was banished to a remote province for four years.{{sfn|Abe|1997|pp=691–2}}{{sfn|Andrews|1987|p=4120}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=namu Amidabutsu}} When Shinran started to teach against the custom of celibacy, stating it indicated a lack of trust in Amitābha Buddha, he was banished as well.{{sfn|Abe|1997|pp=691–2}}{{sfn|Dobbins|2004a|page=413}} Apart from Shinran, other priests that emphasized faith in their interpretations were also banished, as their teachings were often embraced by a following which did not accept the authority of the aristocrats in power.{{sfn|Dobbins|2002|page=19}}

In the fifteenth century, [[Rennyo]] (1415–99), a disciple of Shinran considered the second founder of Shinran's [[Jōdo Shinshu]] school, tried to reform the school. He opposed Shinran's idea that morality was not required to enter the Pure Land and meet Amitābha Buddha. He believed that morality should go hand-in-hand with faith, and was a way to express gratitude to Amitābha.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=234}}{{sfn|Porcu|2008|page=18}} Jōdo Shinshu is still the most popular and largest Buddhist sect in Japan today,{{sfn|Green|2013|p=121}}{{sfn|Abe|1997|p=694}}{{sfn|Shōto|1987|page=4933}} surviving as the [[Hongan-ji#Nishi Hongan-ji|Nishi Hongwanji]] and the [[Hongan-ji#Higashi Hongan-ji|Higashi Hongwanji]] traditions.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=268}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Jodo Shinshu}}

[[File:DogenP2.JPG|thumb|Painting of [[Dōgen]], a Japanese [[Zen]] teacher|alt=Painting of Dōgen, a Japanese Zen teacher]]
Just like in Jōdo Shinshu, some forms of Zen Buddhism arose as a reaction to Tendai Buddhism. Just like Pure Land Buddhism, faith also played a role here, that is, in [[Sōtō Zen]]. This form of Zen, also known as "farmer's Zen" because of its popularity in agrarian society, was developed by [[Dōgen]] (1200–53).&lt;!--p=231--&gt; Apart from the focus on meditation practice which was common in Zen Buddhism, Dōgen led a revival of interest in the study of the ''sūtras'', which he taught would inspire to a faith based on understanding. Inspired by Chinese [[Chan Buddhism]], Dōgen was attracted to a return of the simple life as exemplified by the Buddha in the ''sūtras''. He further believed that sitting meditation was not only the path to enlightenment, but also a way to {{em|express}} the Buddha nature within. The practitioner should have the faith that the Buddha nature is already within, Dōgen taught, although Dōgen did not believe this was in the form of a [[Ātman (Buddhism)|permanent self]].&lt;!--p=232--&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=231–2}} Dōgen believed enlightenment was possible in this life—even the secular life—and he did not believe in the idea of the Age of Dharma Decline.{{sfn|Araki|1987|p=1245}}

In East Asian Buddhism, there has been a strong focus on worship of the ''bodhisattva'' Avalokiteśvara. His cult originated in the northern borders of India, but he has been honoured for his compassion in many countries, such as China, Tibet, Japan, Sri Lanka and other parts of Southeast Asia, and among diverse levels of society.{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=29}}{{sfn|Birnbaum|1987|p=704}}

The text called the ''Avalokiteśvara Sūtra'' states that Avalokiteśvara will help anyone who speaks his name with faith, fulfilling many kinds of wishes, and awakening people to their compassionate Buddha nature.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=250–1, 253}}{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=98}} Avalokiteśvara is strongly connected to the Buddha Amitābha, as it has been believed he lives in the same Pure Land, and will come to the rescue of those who invoke the name of the Buddha Amitābha.{{sfn|Gómez|2004a|p=15}}{{sfn|Birnbaum|1987|p=705}} Focusing on both mundane benefits and salvation,&lt;!--Ford--&gt; devotion to Avalokiteśvara was promoted through the spread of the Lotus Sūtra, which includes a chapter about him,&lt;!--Stone and Birnbaum--&gt;{{sfn|Stone|2004a|p=474}}{{sfn|Birnbaum|1987|p=705}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ACnfqhZUgXYC|last=Ford|first=J.L.|year=2006|title=Jōkei and Buddhist Devotion in Early Medieval Japan|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=90|isbn=978-0-19-972004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as through the [[Prajnaparamita|Perfection of Wisdom]] ''sūtras''.{{sfn|Powers|2013|loc=Avalokiteśvara}} Avalokiteśvara's devotees often depict him as a female, and in this female form she is known as [[Guanyin]] in China,&lt;!--all refs--&gt; originating from an association with the female Buddhist deity [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]].&lt;!--Snellgrove--&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=250–1, 253}}{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Snellgrove|1987|p=1079}} Presently, Avalokiteśvara and his female form Guanyin are among the most depicted figures in Buddhism, and Guanyin is also worshiped by [[Daoist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Irons|first1=Edward A.|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=J.

=== Other historical developments ===
==== Deities ====

{{Main|Buddhist deities}}
In Buddhism, Buddhas and other enlightened beings are the main focus of honour, comparable to that of gods in other religions. Although Buddhism does recognize the existence of deities, Buddhas and other enlightened beings are considered to be different, in that they are seen as outside of the [[samsara|cycle of existence]].&lt;!--p=465--&gt; This does not mean that worship of deities did not exist in Buddhism. However, worship of deities has often been considered a form of superstition or a form of [[skillful means]] to guide the unenlightened to a better life, and not much more than that.&lt;!--p=466--&gt;{{sfn|Rambelli|2004|pages=465–6}}

In the history of the diffusion of Buddhism, the relation between Buddhism and local deities was an important aspect of success, but Buddhists have often denied this because of local movements for orthodoxy. Furthermore, scholars have paid little interest to the role of local deities, since it is not covered by any of the standard academic disciplines studying Buddhism, such as Buddhist studies or anthropology. Nevertheless, deities had a role in Buddhist cosmology from early onward. Buddhist traditions saw them, however, as subordinate to the Buddha, and related many stories of them embracing the Buddhist teaching and even becoming protectors of it. When Buddhist teachers adopted existing cosmologies, but placed the Buddha on top of these systems, a [[Buddhist cosmology]] arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Glassman|first1=Hank|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Sexuality|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|page=762|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614204648/http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rambelli|2004|page=466}} Part of this process was depicting these deities as violent and disorganized, as opposed to Buddhism and its practitioners—this was not far from the truth, as Buddhist missionaries often came from more ordered and less violent cultures. In this way snake-like deities (''[[nāga]]''), [[garuda|bird-like deities]] and [[yaksha|violent spirits]] which previously were the focus of pre-Buddhist cults became guardians of the Buddhist teaching.{{sfn|Rambelli|2004|page=467}} This process of adopting deities as part of Buddhism often occurred when Buddhist devotees or monks did not fully renounce their former devotions when embracing Buddhism.{{sfn|Snellgrove|1987|p=1076}} In the early Pāli scriptures, as well as in some customs in traditional Buddhist societies, traces can still be found of the period that Buddhism competed with ''nāga'' worship and assimilated some of its features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Richard F.|authorlink1=Richard F. Gombrich|title=How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings|date=2006|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|isbn=0-415-37123-6|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.6690&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|pages=72–5|edition=2nd|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122123610/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.6690&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archivedate=2017-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Buddhist countries like Japan, a perspective arose of the human world as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the macrocosmic realms of the Buddhas. This allowed for an increased tolerance of local traditions and [[folk religion]], which were seen as connected with this macrocosmos, and thus part of Buddhism.{{sfn|Bielefeldt|2004|p=390}} All of these developments led Buddhism to include many deities into its system of faith, but each deity was given his place and role, subordinate to the Buddha.{{sfn|Rambelli|2004|pages=465–7}}{{sfn|Swearer|1987|page=3154}} Even the exclusive Jōdo Shinshu taught not to denigrate the worship of [[Shinto]] deities called ''[[kami]]'', though the school did not allow the worship either.{{sfn|Dobbins|2002|pp=39, 58}} Furthermore, in many Buddhist countries ritual specialists of pre-Buddhist traditions were given a duty besides Buddhist monks.&lt;!--p=467--&gt; These specialists were usually laypeople, who performed these functions besides their normal lay life.&lt;!--p=468--&gt;{{sfn|Rambelli|2004|pages=467–8}}&lt;ref name="Kariyawasam" /&gt;

Buddhism did not only [[cultural appropriation|appropriate]] deities into the religion, but also adapted its own teachings. According to religious studies scholar Donald Swearer, ''bodhisattvas'', relic worship and hagiographies of Buddhist masters were ways for Buddhism to adapt to pre-Buddhist deities and [[animism|animistic]] beliefs, by fitting these into the Buddhist thought system. East Asian Buddhist movements like the Chinese White Lotus were transformations of such animistic beliefs. Such transformation of pre-Buddhist beliefs also explains the popularity of movements like Japanese Pure Land Buddhism under Hōnen and Shinran, even though in their teachings they opposed animism.{{sfn|Swearer|1987|page=3155–6}}

In Buddhism, the growth and decline of the world is believed to come in [[kalpa (aeon)|cycles]], and the declining period is believed to end with the arising of the ''[[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|cakravartin]]'' and finally, the coming of the future Buddha who will start a new prosperous period. Devotion to such a [[messianism|messianic]] Buddha figure has been part of almost every Buddhist tradition.&lt;!--p=538--&gt;{{sfn|DuBois|2004|pp=537–8}} Millenarian movements are typically a form of cultural defiance of the dominant culture, resisting "the attempt to put reason and logic over faith", according to political scientist William Miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miles|first1=W.

East Asian traditions especially associated the end of the world with the coming of the future Buddha, that is Maitreya.&lt;!--p=537, p=66--&gt; The early Pāli texts only briefly mention him, but he features prominently in later Sanskrit traditions such as the [[Mahāsāṃghika]].

But the nineteenth century had not been the first century in which millenarian beliefs sparked political changes: during most of China's history, faith in and worship of Maitreya Buddha often inspired rebellions to change society for the better, to await Maitreya.{{sfn|DuBois|2004|pp=537, 539}}{{sfn|Lazich|2000|pp=67–8}} Some of these rebellions led to powerful revolutions and the destruction of royal dynasties.&lt;ref name="Landes" /&gt; Nevertheless, faith in the coming of a new era of Maitreya was not just political propaganda to incite rebellion, but was, in the words of Chinese Studies scholar Daniel Overmyer, "rooted in continuously existing cultic life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Overmyer|first1=Daniel L.|title=Folk Buddhist Religion: Dissenting Sects in Late Traditional China|date=2013|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-674-18316-2|pages=83–4|url=http://booksc.org/dl/44859454/58bb3f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, millenarian trends can be observed in the idea of the Age of Dharma Decline, which was most prominent in Nichiren Buddhism. However, more full-fledged forms of millenarianism developed from the nineteenth century onward, with the arising of [[Japanese new religions|new religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Reader|first1=Ian|editor1-last=Landes|editor1-first=Richard A.|editor1-link=Richard Landes|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Millennialism and Millennial Movements|title=Japan|date=2000|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=Hoboken|isbn=0-203-00943-6|url=http://www.encyclopedias.biz/dw/Encyclopedia%20of%20Millennialism%20and%20Millennial%20Movements.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vAExhb2K?url=http://www.encyclopedias.biz/dw/Encyclopedia%20of%20Millennialism%20and%20Millennial%20Movements.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=no|pages=350–1|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern developments ===
==== Buddhist modernism ====
{{Main|Buddhist modernism}}
Although in pre-modern times some schools of Buddhism de-emphasized faith in Buddhist practice,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Baotang zong}} the role of faith really was only criticized widely in modern times. During the eighteenth century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], western intellectuals came to see religion as culturally relative, as opposed to the single truth of reason. By the end of the nineteenth century, this view on religion had informed how the West responded to Buddhism. Western writers such as [[Edwin Arnold]] began to present Buddhism as the answer to the contradiction between science and religion, as a rational religion devoid of culture.

In Japan, from the [[Meiji period]] onward, the Japanese heavily attacked Buddhism as a foreign and superstitious belief system. In response to this, Buddhist schools such as Zen developed a movement called "New Buddhism" (''Japanese: [[D. T. Suzuki#New Buddhism|shin bukkyo]]''), emphasizing rationalism, modernism and warrior ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Ahn|first1=Juhn|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Popular conceptions of Zen|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|page=924|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614204648/http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in Japanese Buddhism, in the twentieth century, a critical response to traditional Buddhism arose, led by the two academics Hakamaya Noriaki and Matsumoto Shirō, called [[Critical Buddhism]]. Noriaki and Shirō's school of thought has criticized Chinese and Japanese Buddhist ideas for undermining critical thinking, promoting blind faith and laxity to improve society. [[East Asian Studies]] scholar Peter Gregory comments, however, that the attempt of Critical Buddhists at finding a pure, unadulterated Buddhism, ironically, reeks with the very same essentialism it criticizes.&lt;ref name="Dennis 2005"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Dennis|first1=Mark|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Buddhism, Schools of: East Asian Buddhism|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=0-02-865997-X|page=1250|edition=2nd|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|volume=2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gregory|first=P.N.|year=1997|title=Is Critical Buddhism Really Critical?|encyclopedia=Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism|pages=passim|nopp=yes|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/Critical_Buddhism_Gregory.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817164907/http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/Critical_Buddhism_Gregory.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have made similar arguments. Critical Buddhism criticizes blind faith and a belief in the Buddha Nature, but it does reserve a place for faith: Buddhist faith, states Noriaki, is the uncompromising critical capacity to distinguish between true and false Buddhism, and to commit to what is true Buddhism. Noriaki contrasts such true faith with [[Wa (Japanese culture)|the Japanese ideal of harmony]] (''wa''), which he believes goes hand-in-hand with uncritical acceptance of non-Buddhist ideals, including violence.{{sfn|Swanson|1993|pages=133–4}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=324 n.61}}

Despite these widespread modernist trends in Asia, scholars have also observed decline of rationalism and resurfacing of pre-modern religious teachings and practices: From the 1980s onward, they observed that in Sri Lankan Buddhism devotional religiosity, magical practices, honouring deities as well as moral ambiguity had become more widespread, as the effects of Protestant Buddhism were becoming weaker. Richard Gombrich and anthropologist [[Gananath Obeyesekere]] have therefore spoken of ''{{dfn|post-protestant Buddhism}}'' to describe this trend.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=384}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/1417358/Aspects_of_Esoteric_Southern_Buddhism|url-access=registration|last=Cousins|first=L.S.|year=1997|title=Aspects of Esoteric Southern Buddhism|editor1-last=Connolly|editor1-first=P.|editor2-last=Hamilton|editor2-first=S.|encyclopedia=Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakti: Papers from the Annual Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions|publisher=Luzac Oriental|page=188|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122131255/https://www.academia.edu/1417358/Aspects_of_Esoteric_Southern_Buddhism|archivedate=2017-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Richard|last2=Obeyesekere|first2=Gananath|authorlink1=Richard Gombrich|authorlink2=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Buddhism transformed: religious change in Sri Lanka|date=1990|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|location=Dehli|isbn=8120807022|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpN9atSFua0C|pages=415–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Twentieth-century Buddhism in the West ====
[[File:Bhikku Bodhi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]|alt=Bhikkhu Bodhi]]
With the spread of Buddhism to the West in the twentieth century, devotional practices still played an important role among Asian ethnic communities, though much less so in Western "convert" communities. The influence of Buddhist modernism could also be felt in the West, where lay-led organizations often offered meditation courses without much emphasis on devotion. Writers like [[D. T. Suzuki]] described meditation as a trans-cultural and non-religious practise, which greatly appealed to westerners.{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=303}}{{refn|group=note|In reality, [[D. T. Suzuki]] made a point in some of his writings that [[Zen]] could not be separated from Buddhism.{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=303}}}} Thus, in Western, [[secular Buddhism]], meditation was more emphasized than in traditional Buddhist communities, and faith or devotion less.{{sfn|McMahan|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=429, 444}} Just like in modern Asia, the rational and intellectual aspects of Buddhism were mostly emphasized in the West, as Buddhism was often favourably compared with Christianity.{{sfn|Baumann|1987|page=1189}} The author and Buddhist teacher [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]] has endeavoured to advocate a form of Buddhism which he believes to be original, ancient Buddhism, as it was before it became "institutionalized as a religion".{{sfn|McMahan|2008|page=244}}

In contrast to these typical modernist trends, it has also been observed that some western Buddhist communities show great commitment to their practice and belief, and for that reason are more traditional religious than most forms of [[New Age]] spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Tim|last2=Aarons|first2=Haydn|title=Choosing Buddhism in Australia: towards a traditional style of reflexive spiritual engagement|journal=[[The British Journal of Sociology]]|date=June 2005|volume=56|issue=2|page=228|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00056.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several Buddhist teachers have spoken out against interpretations of Buddhism that do away with all faith and devotion, including translator and monastic [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]. Bhikkhu Bodhi argues that many Westerners have misunderstood the ''[[Kalama Sutta|Kalāma Sutta]]'' {{see above|Verification|mid=yes}}, as Buddhism teaches that faith and personal verification should go hand-in-hand, and faith should not be discarded.{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=248}}

The latter part of the twentieth century has seen a unique situation arising with regard to Buddhism in the West: for the first time since Buddhism left India many Buddhist traditions are able to communicate in the same language. This has led to an increased [[eclecticism]] between the different traditions.{{sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=307}} Furthermore, with the increase of scientific research in meditation methods, prominent Buddhist authors are pointing to scientific evidence to verify whether Buddhist practice is really effective or not, rather than referring to scriptural or monastic authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/zygo.12391|title='The New Science of Health and Happiness': Investigating Buddhist Engagements with the Scientific Study Of Meditation|first=Jeff|last=Wilson|journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]]|volume=53|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Navayāna ====
{{Main|Navayāna|Dalit Buddhist movement}}
In 1956, the Indian ''[[dalit]]'' (untouchable) and icon [[Babasaheb Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] (1891–1956) led a mass conversion to Buddhism, starting a [[navayana|new Buddhist movement]] (''Navayāna''). This new movement led to a pattern of mass conversions, some of them reaching up to 500,000 people, simultaneously converting. ''Dalits'' that were dissatisfied with the Indian [[caste system]] took refuge in Buddhism as a way out. In the 2010s, violent incidents affecting ''dalits'' led to a revival of mass conversions in [[Gujarat]] and other states. Some converts admit that the conversion is a political choice to reorganize themselves, as conversion could help them to no longer be classified by the Hindu caste system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dore|first1=Bhavya|title=Rising caste-related violence pushes many Indians to new faith|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/houston-belief/article/Rising-caste-related-violence-pushes-many-Indians-9523647.php|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|agency=[[Hearst Newspapers]]|publisher=[[Religion News Service]]|date=1 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924045746/http://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/houston-belief/article/Rising-caste-related-violence-pushes-many-Indians-9523647.php|archivedate=24 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have described [[Ambedkarism|Ambedkar's perspective on Buddhism]] as secular and modernist rather than religious, as he emphasized [[Buddhist atheism|the atheist aspects of Buddhism]] and rationality, and rejected [[Hindu soteriology]] and hierarchy.{{sfn|Ganguly|2006|pags=54}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Contursi|first1=Janet A.|title=Militant Hindus and Buddhist Dalits: Hegemony and Resistance in an Indian Slum|journal=[[American Ethnologist]]|date=1989|volume=16|issue=3|page=448|jstor=645267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have interpreted Ambedkarism as a form of critical traditionalism, in which Ambedkar reinterprets traditional Hindu concepts rather than rejecting them altogether.&lt;!--p=54--&gt; Specifically, scholar {{ill|Gauri Vishwanathan|de}} states that Ambedkar's ''Dalit'' conversions give belief a more central, worldly role than it had before.&lt;!--p=55--&gt; Cross-cultural researcher Ganguly Debjani, however, points at  religious elements in Ambedkar's description of the Buddha's life and teaching,&lt;!--pp=56-7--&gt; and states that Ambedkar [[deification|deifies]] the Buddha as the "fount of Rationality".&lt;!--p=57--&gt; Several scholars have argued that the Buddha and Ambedkar are honoured by his followers through traditional devotional practices ({{lang-sa|bhakti|script=Latn}}), such as story-telling, songs and poetry, festivals, and images, despite Ambedkar's rejection of such practices.&lt;!--pp=59-60; Gokhale--&gt;{{sfn|Ganguly|2006|pages=54–7, 59–60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="Bhakti" or "Vidroha": Continuity and Change in Dalit Sahitya |last=Gokhale-Tuerner|first=J.B.|year=1980|journal=[[Journal of Asian and African Studies]]|volume=15|issue=1|pp=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Faith Versus Fact: Why Science and Religion are Incompatible''''' is a 2015 book by biologist [[Jerry Coyne]] concerning the relationship between science and religion. Coyne argues that religion and science are incompatible, by surveying the history of science and stating that both religion and science make claims about the universe, yet only science is open to the fact that it may be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tayler|first1=Jeffrey|title=Can Religion and Science Coexist?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/religion-science-coexist-faith-versus-fact-coyne/396362/|website=TheAtlantic.Com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyne was astonished that after having published his book, ''Why Evolution is True'', the proportion of creationists in America still remained between 40-46%. He felt that [[faith]] was the reason that kept them from accepting the facts and [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]].&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faith Versus Fact|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jerry-a-coyne/faith-versus-fact/|website=www.kirkusreviews.com|publisher=Viking|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Coyne defines science as "a collection of methods" which yield knowledge which may be rejected or confirmed via testing. With this definition in hand, he went on to argue that religion and science were inherently incompatible "because they have different methods of getting knowledge about reality, different ways of assessing the reliability of that knowledge, and, in the end, arrive at conflicting conclusions about the universe."&lt;ref name="FvF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coyne|first1=Jerry|title=Faith versus Fact: Why Science are Incompatible|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780698195516|page=64}}{{rp|64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that theistic religions make claims which conflict with science in three ways: methodology, outcomes, and philosophy.&lt;ref name="FvF" /&gt;
A substantial portion of his book criticizes [[theistic evolution]], arguing that if [[God]] were to use evolution as a method of creation the evolutionary process should show signs of directionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey|title='Faith vs. Fact:' why religion and science are mutually incompatible|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/science-and-theology/2015/08/03/77136504-19ca-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html|website=TheWashingtonPost|publisher=WashingtonPost|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Kirkus Reviews]] lauded the book as "important...[it] deserves an open-minded readership." They add, "although he makes a clear and cogent argument, he may find that, once again, he is preaching to his own choir."&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt;

Rau Olson of ''Booklist Online'' wrote, "none of [the New atheists] makes the case for the final divorce of religion and science, with permanent restraining orders against harassment and stalking of science by religion, better than Coyne".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Ray|title=Faith vs. Fact: Why Science and Religion Are Incompatible.|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Faith-vs-Fact-Why-Science-and-Religion-Are-Incompatible-Jerry-A-Coyne/pid=7446785|website=www.booklistonline.com|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers felt the book did not make a very strong case for why religion and science could not co-exist. Biologist Austin L. Hughes wrote for conservative magazine ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'': "what Coyne is attempting in Faith Versus Fact falls under the general heading of philosophy. But his philosophical training seems inadequate to the task, since he fails to develop a consistent terminology and to construct arguments with any degree of rigor." He feels that Coyne's arguments attempting to show that doubt is necessary, or endemic, to science eventually fall on themselves, writing, "but if we push our doubt far enough, won't we eventually end up doubting even science?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Austin L.|title=Faith, Fact, and False Dichotomies|journal=The New Atlantis|date=2015|volume=45|pages=111–117|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/faith-fact-and-false-dichotomies|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[John Horgan]] wrote a highly critical review of the book in [[Scientific American]] stating that, "Mr. Coyne repeatedly reminds us that science, unlike religion, promotes self-criticism, but he is remarkably lacking in this virtue himself. He rejects complaints that some modern scientists are guilty of 'scientism,' which I would define as excessive trust—faith!—in science. Actually, ''Faith vs. Fact'' serves as a splendid specimen of scientism. Mr. Coyne disparages not only religion but also other human ways of engaging with reality. The arts, he argues, 'cannot ascertain truth or knowledge,' and the humanities do so only to the extent that they emulate the sciences. This sort of arrogance and certitude is the essence of scientism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horgan|first1=John|title=Book by Biologist Jerry Coyne Goes Too Far in Denouncing Religion, Defending Science|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/book-by-biologist-jerry-coyne-goes-too-far-in-denouncing-religion-defending-science/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myanmar]] has been under the rule of repressive authoritarian military regimes since 1962. After the 1974 Socialist constitution was suspended in 1988, constitutional protection of religious freedom has not existed, after the bloody suppression of the [[8888 Uprising]]. The authorities generally permitted most adherents of registered religious groups to worship as they choose; however, the government imposed restrictions on certain religious activities and is accused of abusing the right to [[freedom of religion]].

==Basic facts==

Myanmar has a population of 54 million (2009 est.), of which 90% profess [[Theravada Buddhism]] (roughly 48 million), 4% [[Christianity]] (1.65 million [[Baptists]] and 550,000 [[Roman Catholics]]), 4% [[Islam]] (2.2 million), 1% [[Hinduism]] (550,000), and the remaining 1% consists of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and [[Animism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tygEnlqv?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |archivedate=4 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations==

The government is accused of actively promoting Theravada Buddhism (practiced by 90% of the population) over other religions, particularly among members of ethnic minorities. Christian and Islamic groups continued to have trouble obtaining permission to repair existing places of worship or build new ones. Anti-Muslim violence continued, as did the close monitoring of [[Muslim]] activities. Although there were no new reports of [[forced conversion]]s of non-Buddhists, the government applied pressure on students and poor youth to convert to Buddhism. Adherence or conversion to Buddhism is generally a prerequisite for promotion to senior government and military ranks.

[[Evangelism]] is banned, although [[Sunday schools]] and church activities are not affected.

==Religious demography==
{{StateDept|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90131.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2007}}
{{Main|Religion in Burma}}

The popular form of Buddhism in Myanmar is Theravada Buddhism with a mixture of [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], and veneration of indigenous pre-Buddhist era deities called "[[nat (spirit)|nats]]". Buddhist [[monks]], including novices, number more than 400,000 and depend on the laity for their material needs, including clothing and daily donations of food. A small population of Buddhist [[nuns]] also exist. The principal minority religious groups include Christian groups (mostly Baptists (~70%) and Roman Catholics (~25%), and a small number of [[Anglican]]s, and an array of other [[Protestant]] denominations), Muslims (mostly [[Sunni]]), [[Hindus]], and practitioners of traditional Chinese and indigenous religions. According to official statistics, almost 90 percent of the population practice Buddhism, 6 percent practice Christianity, and 4 percent practice Islam. The US government claims that the numbers might be distorted in favour of Buddhists, however, this cannot be verified. There is also a tiny [[Jewish]] community in [[Yangon]], of about 25 adherents and a synagogue, but there is no resident [[rabbi]] to conduct services.

The country is ethnically diverse, with some correlation between ethnicity and religion. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion among the majority Burman ethnic group and among the [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]], and [[Mon people|Mon]] ethnic minorities of the eastern, western, and southern regions. Christianity is the dominant religion among the [[Chin]] ethnic group of the Western region and has some adherents amongst the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] and [[Naga people|Naga]] ethnic groups, whom continue to practice traditional indigenous religions. Christianity is also practised widely among the [[Karen people|Karen]] and [[Karenni]] ethnic groups of the southern and eastern regions, although many Karen and Karenni are Buddhist. In addition, some ethnic Indians are Christian. Hinduism is practised chiefly by Burmese of Indian origin, who are concentrated in major cities and in the south central region. Islam is practised widely in [[Rakhine State]], where it is the dominant religion of the [[Rohingya]] minority, and in [[Yangon Region|Rangoon]], [[Ayeyarwady Region|Ayeyarwady]], [[Magway Region|Magway]], and [[Mandalay Region|Mandalay]] Divisions. Some Burmans, Indians, and ethnic [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] also practice Islam. Chinese ethnic minorities generally practice [[traditional Chinese religions]]. Traditional indigenous beliefs are practised widely among smaller ethnic groups in the highland regions. Practices drawn from those indigenous beliefs persist widely in popular Buddhist rituals, especially in rural areas.

The current military government, the [[State Peace and Development Council]] (SPDC), has governed without a constitution or legislature since 1988. Most adherents of religious groups that register with the authorities generally are allowed to worship as they choose; however, the Government imposes restrictions on certain religious activities and frequently abuses the right to religious freedom.

Although about 90% of the populace adhere to Theravada Buddhism and another 1% to [[Mahayana Buddhism]], there is no official state religion. However, since independence, successive governments, both civilian and military, have supported and associated themselves conspicuously with Buddhism.
Most famous of all would be the first prime minister of independent Myanmar, [[U Nu]]. In 1961 the Government's push to make Buddhism the state religion failed due to protests by religious minorities. The [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Burma)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] includes a [[Department for the Promotion and Propagation of Sasana]] (Buddhist teaching).

State-controlled news media frequently depict or describe government officials paying homage to Buddhist monks, making donations at pagodas throughout the country, officiating at ceremonies to open, improve, restore, or maintain [[pagoda]]s, and organising ostensibly voluntary "people's donations" of money, food, and uncompensated labour to build or refurbish Buddhist religious shrines throughout the country. State-owned newspapers routinely feature front-page banner slogans quoting from Buddhist scriptures. The Government has published books of Buddhist religious instruction.

The Department for the Perpetuation and Propagation of the Sasana handles the Government's relations with Buddhist monks and Buddhist schools. The Government continues to fund two state Sangha universities in [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] to train Buddhist monks under the control of the state-sponsored [[State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee|State Monk Coordination Committee]] ("Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee" or SMNC). The state-sponsored [[International Theravada Buddhist Missionary University]] (ITBMU) in Yangon, was opened in 1998 to "share the country's knowledge of Buddhism with the people of the world." The main language of instruction is English. The University also teaches non-citizens about Theravada Buddhism.

Since the 1960s Christian and Islamic groups have had difficulty importing religious literature into the country. All publications, religious and secular, remain subjected to control and censorship. It is illegal to import translations of the Bible in indigenous languages. Officials have occasionally allowed local printing or photocopying of limited copies of religious materials, including the [[Qur'an]] (with the notation that they were for internal use only) in indigenous languages without prior approval by government censors.

Virtually all organisations, religious or otherwise, must register with the Government. A government directive exempts "genuine" religious organisations from official registration; however, in practice only registered organisations can buy or sell property or open bank accounts. These requirements lead most religious organisations to seek registration. Religious organisations register with the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Myanmar)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] with the endorsement of the Ministry for Religious Affairs. Leaders of registered religious groups have more freedom to travel than leaders of unrecognised organizations and members of their congregations.

Religious affiliation is indicated on government-issued identification cards that citizens have. Citizens are also required to indicate their religion on official application forms, such as passports.

Muslims in Rakhine State, on the western coast, and particularly those of the Rohingya minority group, continued to experience the severest forms of legal, economic, educational, and social discrimination. The Government denies citizenship status to Rohingyas because their ancestors allegedly did not reside in the country at the start of British colonial rule, as required by the country's citizenship law. The Muslims assert that their presence in the area predates the British arrival by several centuries. On 2 April 2007, five [[U.N. Special Rapporteur]]s and an Independent Expert called on the Government to repeal or amend its 1982 [[Citizenship Law]] to insure compliance with international human rights obligations. Without citizenship status, Rohingyas do not have access to secondary education in state-run schools because the Government reserves secondary education for citizens only,

Official public holidays include numerous Buddhist holy days in accordance to the Buddhist majority, as well as some Christian, Hindu, and Islamic holy days.

The Government made some efforts to promote mutual understanding among practitioners of different religious groups.

In October 2006 Minister of Religious Affairs Brigadier General Thura Myint Maung, invited leaders from the four main religious groups (Buddhist, Muslim, Christian and Hindu) to a meeting in which the Minister denounced the [[2006 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom]]. He told the religious leaders they knew there was freedom of religion in the country and claimed the Government always granted permits for religious gatherings and permitted renovations of mosques and churches. The Muslim leaders reportedly asked the Minister to unseal mosques in the central region that the Government closed following communal riots in earlier years and for permission to complete [[madrassah]]s that were under construction. The leaders reportedly were required to sign statements that they enjoyed religious freedom and were requested to write a letter stating that their religious communities were allowed to practice their faith freely in the country, which the ministry would display on its official website. During a discussion that followed, the representatives of the [[Islamic Religious Affairs Council]] (IRAC) stated that while there had been progress on some religious matters, there was room for further improvement. The Minister reportedly stopped further discussion and adjourned the meeting abruptly.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
{{Examplefarm|date=January 2018}}
The Government continued to show preference for Theravada Buddhism while controlling the organisation and restricting the activities and expression of the Buddhist clergy ([[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]), although some monks have resisted such control. Based on the [[1990 Sangha Organization Law]], the Government banned any organisation of Buddhist monks other than the nine state-recognized monastic orders. These nine orders submit to the authority of the SMNC, the members of which are indirectly elected by monks. Violations of this ban are punishable by immediate public defrocking, and often by criminal penalties.

According to state-owned media reports, the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA), a government-sponsored mass organisation in which participation often is compulsory, organised courses in Buddhist culture attended by millions of persons. It was not possible to verify this claim independently.

There are reports that the ITBMU, while in principle open to the public, accepted only candidates who were approved by government authorities or recommended by a senior, progovernment [[Buddhist abbot]].

The Government infiltrated or monitored the meetings and activities of virtually all organisations, including religious organisations. The meetings and activities of religious groups were also subject to broad government restrictions on freedom of expression and association. The Government subjected all media, including religious publications, and on occasion sermons, to control and censorship.

During the reporting period, the Government harassed a group of Buddhist worshippers who visited the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in Rangoon every Tuesday, the day of the week that [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] was born, to pray at the Tuesday pillar for her release and the release of all political prisoners in the country. Authorities sometimes used the pro-regime USDA to block the group from entering the pagoda grounds and make them pray outside the entrance or to shout and clap loudly to drown out their prayers. After [[Naw Ohn Hla]], the spokesperson for the worshippers, protested to the pagoda authorities and wrote letters to regime leaders, local authorities again allowed the group access to the pagoda to pray; however, authorities ordered the pagoda janitors to throw buckets of water on the platform around the Tuesday pillar so that the worshippers would have to kneel in water. They also played music through loudspeakers at full volume to drown out the sound of the group's prayers. Despite official harassment, including physical and verbal abuse by the pro-regime USDA and the [[People's Militia (Myanmar)]], the worshippers continued to pray every Tuesday during the reporting period. In May 2007 many more groups began praying at different pagodas on Tuesdays for Aung San Suu Kyi's release upon expiration of her detention order on 27 May.

Authorities frequently refused to approve requests for gatherings to celebrate traditional Christian and Islamic holidays and restricted the number of Muslims that could gather in one place. For instance, in satellite towns surrounding Rangoon, Muslims are only allowed to gather for worship and religious training during the major Muslim holidays. In late 2006 a prominent Muslim religious organisation planned to hold a [[golden jubilee]] in [[Mawlamyine]], [[Mon State]], to celebrate the founding of their organisation. After they requested permission to hold the event, the local Division Commander, Brigadier General [[Thet Naing Win]], called representatives of all non-Buddhist religious organisations in the area to a meeting. He informed them that permission would not be granted to hold any religious functions or ceremonies due to security reasons. The Muslim organisation then altered its plans and held a low-profile ceremony to honour pilgrims who had been granted official permission by the Ministry of Religious Affairs to attend the [[Hajj]].

On 22 March 2007, authorities detained [[Htin Kyaw]], when he publicly protested the denial of his religious freedom to become a monk. Htin Kyaw had participated in earlier demonstrations against deteriorating economic and social conditions. Rangoon authorities then enforced a 1995 prohibition against any opposition political party member from being ordained as a monk or religious leader and forbade the abbot of a monastery in [[North Okkalapa]] in Rangoon to ordain Htin Kyaw.

On 23 January 2007, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]] (CSW) released a report that documented the Government's restrictions, discrimination, and persecution against Christians in the country for more than a decade. Subsequently, the Ministry of Religious Affairs pressured religious organisations in the country to publish statements in government-controlled media denying they had any connection with CSW or to condemn the report, and to reject the idea that religious discrimination existed in the country.

The Government continued to discriminate against members of minority religious groups, restricting their educational, proselytising, and church-building activities.

Government authorities continued to prohibit Christian clergy from [[proselytising]] in some areas. Christian groups reported that several times during the period covered by this report, local authorities denied applications for residency permits of known Christian ministers attempting to move into a new [[township]]. The groups indicated this was not a widespread practice, but depended on the individual community and local council. In some instances, local authorities reportedly confiscated National Identity Cards of new converts to Christianity. Despite this, Christian groups reported that church membership grew, even in predominantly Buddhist regions of the country.

During the reporting period, authorities in the Rangoon area closed several [[house church]]es because they did not have proper authorisation to hold religious meetings. Other Rangoon home churches remained operational only after paying bribes to local officials. At the same time, the authorities made it difficult, although not impossible, to obtain approval for the construction of "authorized" churches.

On 1 October 2006, the [[Agape Zomi Baptist Church]], with more than 1,000 members, had to stop its weekly services at [[Asia Plaza Hotel]] in Rangoon after the hotel management refused to continue renting them a conference room. The hotel management claimed the township authorities had ordered them to stop renting its facility to the group, which had worshipped at the hotel for approximately one year.

In August 2006 [[NaSaKa]], the Government's border security force, ordered eight [[Rohingya]] Muslim communities in [[Rathedaung Township]], [[Rakhine State]] to close their religious centres, including 5 mosques, 4 madrassahs, 18 [[moqtob]]s (premadrassahs), and 3 [[hafez khana]]s (Qur'an reciting centres). Later, local authorities allowed two madrassahs to reopen. NaSaKa ordered the closures because it stated that the institutions were not officially registered. According to Muslim sources, government officials have not allowed any madrassahs to register officially. Muslim religious organisations are appealing the closures.

On 19 August 2006, government officials prohibited a Baptist church in Rangoon from conducting a literacy workshop for its youth. The authorities stated that the church must seek advance permission to hold such programs, although the church had held similar programs for the past four years without needing permission. Authorities also reportedly censored the same Baptist church's weekly order of service.

In February 2006 [[Insein Township]] authorities also ordered a Chin evangelist to stop holding worship services in his house church in [[Aung San ward]]. In November 2005 authorities in Insein Township, Rangoon, pressured evangelical Christians of the 20-year-old [[Phawkkan Evangelical Church]] to sign "no worship" agreements. Some signed the agreements out of fear, but others refused. In February 2006 the authorities issued an order banning worship at the church.

The Religious Affairs Ministry has stipulated in the past that permission to construct new religious buildings "depends upon the population of the location;" however, there appeared to be no correlation between the construction of pagodas and the demand for additional places of Buddhist worship. In most regions of the country, Christian and Islamic groups that sought to build small places of worship on side streets or other inconspicuous locations were able to do so only with informal approval from local authorities; however, informal approval from local authorities created a tenuous legal situation. When local authorities or conditions have changed, informal approvals for construction have been rescinded abruptly and construction halted. In some cases, authorities demolished existing church buildings.

Christian groups continued to have trouble obtaining permission to buy land or build new churches in most regions. Sometimes the authorities refused because they claimed the churches did not possess proper property deeds, but access to official land titles was extremely difficult due to the country's complex land laws and government title to most land. In some areas, permission to repair existing places of worship was easier to acquire. Muslims reported that the authorities banned them from constructing new mosques anywhere in the country, and they had great difficulty obtaining permission to repair or expand their existing structures. Historical mosques in [[Mawlamyine]], Mon State, [[Sittwe]], Rakhine State, and other areas of the country continued to deteriorate because authorities would not allow routine maintenance. Some authorities reportedly destroyed informal houses of worship or unauthorised religious construction they discovered. In early 2007, Muslims in Northern Rakhine State, repaired a mosque that had been severely damaged in a storm. When the authorities discovered this, they destroyed the repairs that had been made to the mosque. Buddhist groups have not experienced similar difficulties in obtaining permission to build new pagodas, monasteries, or community religious halls.

During the reporting period, the [[Catholic Church]] established new dioceses in [[Kachin State|Kachin]] and [[Shan State|Shan]] states. The bishop of the new diocese in [[Pekon Township|Pekon]], Shan State, decided to build his residence on a plot of land long owned by the church. Brigadier General [[Myo Lwin]], commander of Military Operation Command Seven at Pekon, ordered the partially built structure demolished, confiscated the land, and extended his own compound fence to enclose the church property. Despite appeals to higher authorities, the Church has not recovered its property.

The [[Myanmar Institute of Theology]] (MIT) in Insein Township, Rangoon is the premier seminary for Baptists throughout the country. To accommodate a rapidly increasing enrolment, MIT raised funds to build a new classroom building and purchase building supplies. At the last minute, government officials refused to grant a building permit. Four years later, piles of construction materials still litter the campus where they gather mildew and rust. In contrast, the Government openly supports Buddhist seminaries and permits them to build large campuses.

Some Christians in Chin State claimed that the authorities have not authorised the construction of any new churches since 1997. However, newly built churches are evident in several parts of the state. A Christian leader in Chin State stated that to obtain permission to repair or build a church he first had to obtain permission from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the [[Ministry of Progress of Border Areas and National Races and Development Affairs]] ([[NaTaLa]]), the Immigration Department and the [[Township Peace and Development Committee]]. In Rangoon, Mandalay, and elsewhere, authorities allowed construction of new community centres by various Christian groups only if they agreed not to hold services there or erect Christian signs.

It remained extremely difficult for Muslims to get permission to repair existing mosques, although internal renovations were allowed in some cases. In some parts of Rakhine State, authorities cordoned off mosques and forbade Muslims to worship in them.

State censorship authorities continued to enforce special restrictions on local publication of the Bible, the Qur'an, and Christian and Islamic publications in general. The most onerous restriction was a list of more than 100 prohibited words that the censors would not allow in Christian or Islamic literature because they are "indigenous terms" or derived from the [[Pali language]] long used in Buddhist literature. Many of these words have been used and accepted by some of the country's Christian and Islamic groups since the colonial period. Organizations that translate and publish non-Buddhist religious texts were appealing these restrictions. In addition, censors have sometimes objected to passages of the [[Old Testament]] and the Qur'an that they believe approve the use of violence against nonbelievers. There have been no reports of arrests or prosecutions for possession of any traditional religious literature in recent years.

Authorities also restricted the quantity of bibles and Qur'ans brought into the country. During the reporting period, however, individuals continued to carry Bibles and Qur'ans into the country in small quantities for personal use. There were no reports that authorities intercepted or confiscated Qur'ans at border entry points, but religious leaders complained that postal workers steal them to sell on the black market.

In general, the Government has not allowed permanent foreign religious missions to operate in the country since the mid-1960s, when it expelled nearly all foreign missionaries and nationalised all private schools and hospitals, which were extensive and affiliated mostly with Christian religious organisations. The Government is not known to have paid any compensation in connection with these extensive confiscations. Christian groups, including Catholics and Protestants, have brought in foreign clergy and religious workers for visits as tourists, but they have been careful to ensure that the Government did not perceive their activities as proselytising. Some Christian theological [[seminaries]] also continued to operate, as did several Bible schools and madrassahs. The Government has allowed some members of foreign religious groups, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), to enter the country to provide humanitarian assistance or English language training to government officials. Some of these groups did not register with the [[Myanmar Council of Churches]], but were able to conduct religious services without government interference.

The Government allowed members of all religious groups to establish and maintain links with coreligionists in other countries and to travel abroad for religious purposes, subject to the country's restrictive passport and visa issuance practices, [[foreign exchange controls]], and government monitoring, which extended to all international activities by all citizens regardless of religion. The Government sometimes expedited its burdensome passport issuance procedures for Muslims making the Hajj or Buddhists going on pilgrimage to [[Bodhgaya]], India, although it limited the number of pilgrims. In 2006 government officials allowed approximately 3,000 Muslims to participate in the Hajj. The procedure reportedly became more cumbersome in 2006 due to the relocation of most government offices from Rangoon to Nay Pyi Taw. Observers speculate that had this not been the case, more Muslims would have gone. During the period covered by this report, immigration and passport officials continued to use the occasion of the Hajj to extort bribes from would-be travellers. Government and private travel agencies processed approximately 2,500 Buddhist pilgrims to travel to Bodhgaya in India.

Non-Buddhists continued to experience employment discrimination at upper levels of the public sector. Few have ever been promoted to the level of Director General or higher. There were no non-Buddhists who held flag rank in the armed forces, although a few Christians reportedly achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. The [[Executive committee|Central Executive Committee]] of the largest opposition group—the [[National League for Democracy]]—also included no non-Buddhists, although individual members from most religious groups in the country supported the party. The Government discouraged Muslims from enlisting in the military, and Christian or Muslim military officers who aspired for promotion beyond the rank of major were encouraged by their superiors to convert to Buddhism. Some Muslims who wished to join the military reportedly had to list "Buddhist" as their religion on their application, though they were not required to convert.

Rohingya Muslims, although essentially treated as illegal foreigners, were not issued [[Foreigner Registration Card]]s. Instead, the Government gave some of them "[[Temporary Registration Card]]s" (TRC). UNHCR estimated that only 650,000 of the approximately 800,000 Rohingyas possessed TRCs. Authorities have insisted that Muslim men applying for TRCs submit photos without beards. The authorities did not allow government employees of the Islamic faith, including village headmen, to grow beards, and dismissed some who already had beards. The authorities also did not consider many non-Rohingya Muslims to be citizens. In order for these Muslims to receive National Registration Cards and passports, they must pay large bribes. Ethnic Burman Muslims pay less than Muslims from ethnic minority groups (primary those of Indian or Bengali descent).

In 2006 a prominent Muslim religious organisation asked the [[Rakhine State Peace and Development Council]] Chairman, the Regional Military Commander, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs to lift marriage restrictions for Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. At the end of the reporting period, they had yet to receive a response.

In Rangoon, Muslims can usually obtain birth certificates for newborns, but local authorities refused to allow them to place the names of the babies on their household registers.

Authorities generally did not grant permission to Rohingya or Muslim Arakanese to travel from their hometowns for any purpose; however, permission was sometimes obtainable through bribery. Non-Arakanese Muslims were given more freedom to travel; however, they were also required to seek permission, which was usually granted after a bribe is paid. Muslims residing in Rangoon could visit beach resort areas in [[Thandwe]], Rakhine State, but could not return to Rangoon without the signature of the Regional Military Commander. Those with money were able to bribe local officials to return. Muslims residing outside of Rakhine State often were barred from return travel to their homes if they visit other parts of Rakhine State.

Rohingyas did not have access to state-run schools beyond primary education and were unable to obtain employment in any civil service positions. Muslim students from Rakhine State who completed high school were not granted permits to travel outside the state to attend college or university. In lieu of a diploma, Rohingya high school graduates received a sheet of paper that stated they would receive a diploma upon presentation of a citizenship card; however, Rohingyas can never obtain such a card.

Many of the approximately 25,000 Rohingya Muslims remaining in refugee camps in [[Bangladesh]] refused to return because they feared human rights abuses, including religious persecution.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the opposition [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), has been in prison or house arrest since 2003, when forces allied with the Government attacked her and her convoy, which included several NLD-allied monks, while travelling in [[Sagaing Division]] in the northwestern region of the country. The Government reportedly used criminals dressed in monks' robes in the ambush. On 15 May, authorities detained more than 30 worshippers in Rangoon when they approached separate pagodas to pray for Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners. At the end of the reporting period, the worshippers were still detained. The next day USDA members, claiming to represent "the people," detained another 15 worshippers after they prayed at a pagoda in [[Mingladon Township]], but the authorities let them go the same day. On 25 May 2007, the Government extended Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest for an additional year.

In February 2007 the [[Burmese Army]] arrested a monk who was allegedly trading [[Buddha]] images to Buddhists in Bangladesh illegally. The army forced the monk to disrobe in contravention to Buddhist precepts that require a monk to have his robes removed at a ceremony in a monastery. Laypersons, regardless of status, may not demote a monk to become a layperson.

On 2 July 2006, authorities from Thandwe, Rakhine State arrested Abbot [[Wila Tha]] and his assistant [[Than Kakesa]] from the Buddhist monastery of [[U Shwe Maw]] village, [[Taungup Township]], closed the monastery, and forced 59 monks and novices to leave. Local sources claimed that the reason for the arrest was that the abbot refused to accept donations from or conduct religious ceremonies for the authorities. The authorities also claimed the abbot was endangering local stability by talking to the monks and novices about democracy, that he was a supporter of the NLD (National League for Democracy), and that he had supported the visit of Aung San Suu Kyi (pro-democracy activist and leader of the NLD) when she visited the area several years earlier. The exile-based [[Assistance Association for Political Prisoners]] (AAPP) estimated there were 86 Buddhist monks in prison for various charges. It was not possible to verify the AAPP estimate. The number of non-Buddhists in prison for their religious beliefs was unknown. Authorities usually defrocked monks when they arrested them and treated them like ordinary prisoners, including using torture. The prison authorities disrespectfully addressed the monks by their given names, not their religious titles.

Local civilian and military authorities continued to take actions against Christian groups: arresting clergy, closing home churches, and prohibiting religious services.

In February 2006, police at [[Hpa-an]], Karen State, arrested [[Yeh Zaw]], a member of the [[Phawkkan Evangelical Church]]. Yeh Zaw had earlier written a letter to the regime leader urging him to end the persecution of his church that Rangoon authorities closed earlier in 2006, banning members from worshipping there. Police charged him with travelling without an identity card.

In 2005 local authorities in the Chin State capital of [[Hakha]] notified Baptist leaders that they would be forced to relocate an active, historic cemetery from church property to a remote location outside of town. Religious leaders reported that authorities continued to forcefully relocate cemeteries in many parts of the country.

In the past, pagodas or government buildings often have been built on confiscated Muslim land.

In Kachin State, authorities have constructed Buddhist shrines in Christian communities where few or no Buddhists reside and have tried to coerce Christians into forced labour to carry bricks and other supplies for the shrine's construction. In September 2006 government officials inaugurated a pagoda near the [[Kachin Independence Organization]]'s headquarters at [[Laiza]], Kachin State. Kachin sources reported there were no Buddhists living in the community. In northern Rakhine State, authorities frequently forced Rohingyas to help construct Buddhist shrines, even though Buddhists there account for approximately 2 percent of the population.

In January 2006 Muslim Rohingyas from at least ten surrounding villages claimed the military forced them to carry building supplies for three model villages at [[Padauk Myin]], [[Mala Myin]] and [[Thaza Myin]] in [[Rathedaung Township]]. Certain townships in the Rakhine State, such as Thandwe, [[Gwa, Burma|Gwa]], and [[Taungup]], were declared "Muslim-free zones" by government decree in 1983.

Authorities have attempted to prevent Chin Christians from practising their religion. In 2005 the military commander in [[Matupi Township]], Chin State, ordered the destruction of a 30-foot cross erected on a hillside with government permission in 1999. A more senior military official subsequently told local church authorities that they could get permission to reconstruct the cross; however, the local pastors have thus far refused to ask for such authorisation. In the past, these crosses often have been replaced with pagodas, sometimes built with forced labour.

SPDC authorities continued to "dilute" ethnic minority populations by encouraging, or even forcing, Buddhist Burmans to relocate to ethnic areas. In predominantly Muslim northern Rakhine State, authorities established "model villages" to relocate released ethnic Burman criminals from other parts of the country.

There continued to be credible reports from diverse regions of the country that government officials compelled persons, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, especially in rural areas, to contribute money, food, or materials to state-sponsored projects to build, renovate, or maintain Buddhist religious shrines or monuments. The Government denied that it used coercion and called these contributions "voluntary donations" consistent with Buddhist ideas of making merit. In April 2006 authorities in [[Lashio]] reportedly tried to coerce merchants to contribute large sums to construct a Buddhist shrine. Christian merchants refused to participate and the funds raised were well below the authorities' target.

===Forced religious conversion===
Muslim and Christian community leaders reported that during the period covered by this report, authorities had moved away from a campaign of forced conversion to Buddhism and instead focused on enticing non-Buddhists to convert to Buddhism by offering charity or bribery. Conversion of non-Buddhists, coerced or otherwise, is part of a longstanding government campaign to "Burmanize" ethnic minority regions. This campaign has coincided with increased military presence and pressure. In 2005 there was a single, unverified report of forced conversion at gunpoint in Chin State; however, Christian groups reported that such violent cases were less frequent than in earlier years. In September 2006 Chin sources reported that 15 students withdrew from a government-operated hostel for girls in Matupi, Chin State, after formerly voluntary Buddhist evening prayers became compulsory for all the hostel residents. Although the girls received free school fees, food, and accommodation, they complained they felt pressured to become Buddhist. Also in many state schools of Burma, students are to pray in Buddhist every morning. In [[Kanpetlet]], Chin State, NaTaLa operated a school exclusively for Buddhist students and guaranteed them government jobs after graduation. Christian children had to agree to convert to Buddhism if they wanted to attend this school.

There were no reports of forced religious conversion of minor US citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to return to the United States.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
{{See also|Societal abuse|Religious discrimination}}
Preferential treatment for Buddhists and widespread [[prejudice]] against ethnic Indians, particularly ethnic Rohingya Muslims, were key sources of social tensions between the Buddhist majority and Christian and Muslim minorities.

In February 2006, violent clashes broke out between Muslims and Buddhists in [[Magway Division]] in response to rumours that Muslim men had raped a Burman woman. Ethnic Burmans attacked and torched Muslim and ethnic Indian homes, shops, and mosques. Rioting and looting spread to surrounding towns, including [[Chauk]] and [[Salin, Myanmar|Salin]]. Local security forces did not intervene at first, but as violence spread authorities imposed a strict curfew in several towns. Reliable sources stated that the authorities arrested 17 people in Sinbyukyun and another 55 persons in Chauk, mostly Muslims. Unofficial sources claimed that 3 people died and another 10 were injured in the riots. Three mosques in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Saku were reportedly destroyed in the violence. At the end of the reporting period, the mosques remained sealed and authorities would not permit Muslims to rebuild them, nor did authorities conduct inquiries into the attacks. Christians reported that an entire Muslim village fled to the monastery of a trusted Buddhist abbot near [[Shwe Settaw]] to seek refuge during the riots.

These attacks follow earlier communal violence in [[Kyauk Pyu]], Rakhine State, in 2005. During several days of violence, two Muslims were killed and one Buddhist monk was severely injured. Some Islamic groups blamed the Government for trying to increase tensions between Buddhists and Muslims as part of a "divide and rule" strategy.

Since 1994, when Buddhist members split away from the KNU ([[Karen National Union]]) to organise the pro-government Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), there have been armed conflicts between the DKBA and the predominantly Christian antigovernment KNU. Although the DKBA reportedly includes some Christians and there are some Buddhists in the KNU, the armed conflict between the two Karen groups has had strong religious overtones. There were also unverified reports that DKBA authorities continued to expel villagers who converted to Christianity.

During the reporting period, a Burmese language document surfaced titled, "[[Program to Eliminate Christianity]]." The document suggested 17 points for countering Christianity in the country; however, the source of the document was unknown and several grammatical errors raised questions about its authenticity. There was no definite evidence to link the document to the Government.

The '''Gajapatis''' were a [[Medieval India|medieval]] [[Hindu]] dynasty from the [[Indian subcontinent]], which originated in the region of Odradesh(historical region ruled by samrat Odra) (most of present-day [[Odisha]] and [[Uttarandhra|Northern coastal Andhra]]) from 1434 to 1541 CE. Under [[Kapilendradeva|Kapilendra Deva]], Gajapatis became an empire stretching from the lower [[Ganga]] in the north to the [[Kaveri]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Majumdar |editor1-first=Ramesh Chandra |editor1-link=R.

The Gajapati dynasty was established by Emperor Kapilendra Deva (1434–66 CE) in 1434. During the reign of Kapilendra Deva, the borders of the empire were expanded immensely; from large parts of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]], and the eastern and central parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Jharkhand]]. The king took the title of ''Sri Sri ... (108 times) Gajapati Gaudesvara Nava Koti Karnata Kalvargesvara''. This title is still used by the kings of [[Puri]] during the Ratha Yatra. The significant rulers of this dynasty were [[Purushottama Deva]] (1466–1497) and [[Prataparudra Deva]] (1497–1540). The last ruler Kakharua Deva was killed by [[Govinda Vidyadhara]] in 1541, who founded the [[Bhoi dynasty]].

== Etymology==
In [[Odia language|Odia]], "Gaja" means elephant and "Pati" means ''master'' or ''husband''. As such, Gajapati etymologically means ''a king with an army of elephants''.

==History==
{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
The region known as Kalinga (present-day Odisha) was controlled by the [[Odia people|Odia]] rulers [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Gangas]] of the [[Vasistha]] gotra. The early Eastern Gangas ruled from Kalinga-nagara (Mukhalingam near [[Srikakulam]], Andhra Pradesh). They shifted their capital to Puri in the 12th century. Religious leader [[Ramanujacharya]] had a great influence on the Raja Choda Ganga Deva, who renovated the temple at [[Puri]]. Narasimha Deva built the [[Sun Temple]] at [[Konark]]. The Gangas were succeeded by the Gajapati rulers. Two copper plates of the early Pallava dynasty have been found in the Kolleru Lake, traced to Gajapati Langula Narasimha Deva, an Oriya ruler(Odiya Raju). According to legend, the Gajapati fort was located at Kolleti Kota on one of the eastern islands of the lake, which protected the [[Odia people|Odia]] forces. The enemy general encamped at Chiguru Kota located on the shores and tried to excavate a channel in the modern-day Upputeru, so that the water of the lake would empty into the sea and allow an attack on the Gajapathi fort.

The [[Suryavansha|Suryavansi]] Gajapatis of Odisha, at the height of their power in the 15th century, ruled over an empire extending from the [[Ganges]] in the north near [[Hooghly district|Hoogly]] to the [[Cauvery]] in the south under Gajapati Kapilendra Deva. But by the early 16th century, the Gajapatis lost great portions of their southern dominion to [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] and [[Golconda]]. This period was marked by the influence of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and by the expansion of Jaganatha temple across the length and breadth of the empire. One of the causes of the reduction in militarism of the population has been attested to the Bhakti movement initiated by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who arrived in the empire at the time of Emperor Prataparudra and stayed for 18 long years at Puri. Emperor Prataparudra was highly influenced by the works of Chaitanya and gave up the military tradition of the Odia emperors. He retired himself into the life of an ascetic leaving the future of the empire uncertain. The traitor Govinda Vidyadhara took the opportunity to murder the sons of the emperor and usurped the throne himself and carved out the destruction of the once mighty empire.

==Cultural contributions==
Their rule in eastern India is associated with a high point in the growth of regional culture and architecture. Sarala Mahabharata by [[Sarala Dasa]], a [[transcreation]] of the original Sanskrit one was written during this period. Similarly transcreation of the Ramayana and Bhagvata Purana were written. They constitute the best examples of ancient Odia literature.

[[File:2nd Ganden Tripa.jpg|thumb|317x317px|2nd Ganden Tripa Gyaltsab Je (1364-1432)]]
The '''Ganden Tripa''' or '''Gaden Tripa''' ({{bo|w=dga’ ldan khri pa}} "Holder of the Ganden Throne") is the title of the spiritual leader of the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the school that controlled central [[Tibet]] from the mid-17th century until the 1950s. The 103rd Ganden Tripa, [[Jetsun Lobsang Tenzin]] died in office on 21 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=103rd Gaden Tripa Kyabje Jetsun Lobsang Tenzin Rinpoche Passes Away|url=http://tibet.net/2017/04/103rd-gaden-tripa-h-e-jetsun-lobsang-tenzin-rinpoche-passes-away/|publisher=Central Tibetan Administration|date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jangtse Choejey Kyabje Jetsun Lobsang Tenzin Palsangpo is the current Ganden Tripa. 

The head of the Gelugpa order is the Ganden Tripa and not, as is often misunderstood, the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John. "Gelukpa Tibetan Buddhism" entry in Melton, J. Gordon, and Martin Baumann. 2002. ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''.

Ganden has two abbots, the abbot of Ganden Shartse and the abbot of Ganden Jangtse, and neither of them can be the Ganden Tripa unless they have also served as abbot of Gyumay or Gyuto tantric colleges. See 'Mode of Appointment' below.

The Ganden Tripa is an appointed office, not a [[reincarnation]] lineage.  It is awarded on the basis of merit which is the basis of his [[Ganden Tripa#Mode of Appointment|hierarchical progression]].  Since the position is held for only a 7-year term,&lt;ref name="BerzinBriefHistory"&gt;{{cite web

[[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357&amp;ndash;1419), who founded the Gelug is the first Ganden Tripa. After Tsongkhapa's passing, his teachings were held and kept by Gyaltsab Je and Khedrub Je who were the next abbots of Ganden monastery. The lineage has been held by the Ganden Tripas.

In January 2003, the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] announced the nomination of the 101st Ganden Tripa.  An excerpt from that press release gives his background:{{quote|The 101st Ganden Tripa, [[Khensur Lungri Namgyel]] [[Rinpoche]] was born in 1927 in [[Kham]] (eastern Tibet). Ordained at eight years old, after fifty years of meditative practices and studies he was elevated by the Dalai-lama as successively [[abbot]] of [[Gyuto Order|Gyutö]] Tantric College (in 1983), and as abbot of Ganden Shartse Monastic University (in 1992). In 1986 he was the special envoy of the Dalai-lama to the [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] meetings of [[Assisi]] in [[Italy]] convened by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He is a [[France|French]] national and has been living in [[Paris]], France for more than 20 years.

==Mode of appointment==
[[File:6th ganden tripa.jpg|thumb|391x391px|6th ganden tripa Chokyi Gyeltsen (1402–1473)]]
The Ganden Tripa is nominated or appointed on the basis of a hierarchical progression based on merit,&lt;ref name=melong &gt;{{cite journal|title=Window on Tibetan Culture: Different ways to select a leader|journal=Me-Long published by Norbulingka Institute|issue=November, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the appointee does not necessarily have to have any direct connection with Ganden Monastery, although if he started as a Ganden monk he could have obtained his higher Geshe degree there and risen to be its abbot.&lt;ref name=BHGG&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexander Berzin|title=A Brief History of Gyumay and Gyuto Lower and Upper Tantric Colleges|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/study/history_buddhism/buddhism_tibet/gelug/brief_history_gyumay_gyuto_tantric_college.html|website=Study Buddhism|date=September 2003|quote=The Jangtsey and Shartsey Chojeys alternate in becoming the Ganden Tripa (dGa’-ldan Khri-pa, Ganden Throne-holder), the head of the Gelug Tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a traditional Tibetan saying: “If a beggar’s child has the ability, there is no stopping him becoming the Throne Holder of Ganden.” It means the post is obtained on merit alone, rather than by recognition as the incarnation of a teacher, or other means.&lt;ref name="melong" /&gt;

This, and the hierarchy through which any [[Gelugpa]] monk can rise up through the ranks on merit to become the Ganden Tripa is briefly described in the November 2011 edition of Me-Long,&lt;ref name="melong" /&gt; a journal published by the [[Norbulingka Institute]], which is dedicated to the preservation of the Tibetan culture, and in full detail on "Study Buddhism".&lt;ref name="BHGG" /&gt; The progression can be summarised as follows: first of all, a monk of any Gelugpa monastery, who, after usually 15 to 20 years of study, achieves a ''Tsorampa'' or ''Lharampa'' (higher) Geshe degree, is obliged to enter either the [[Gyuto]] Tantric College or the Gyume Tantric College, depending on his place of origin in Tibet, to continue his studies. If, after one or two years further study he then qualifies as ''Ngagrampa'' Geshe, he can rise on merit to become a ''Geko'' or disciplinarian, then to become vice-abbot (tenure 3 years); then he can be chosen and appointed by the Dalai Lama as abbot of his respective college, with a tenure of a further 3 years.&lt;ref name=BHGG /&gt;

On retirement as Abbot of Gyume or Gyuto, he becomes eligible to become, eventually, for former Gyume abbots the ''Jangtsey Chojey'' ("Dharma Master of the Northern Peak of Ganden Hill"), or for former Gyuto abbots the ''Sharpa Chojey'' ("Dharma Master of the Eastern Peak of Ganden Hill"). These are more elevated positions, above abbots and retired abbots, which are automatically accorded only to the senior-most surviving retired abbot, one from each respective college, with a tenure of 7 years.&lt;ref name=BHGG /&gt;

The Ganden Tripa is an automatic appointment occurring once every 7 years, from one or the other of these two ''Chojeys'' or Dharma Masters, on an alternating basis. The incumbent Ganden Tripa stands down, and one of the two ''Chojeys'' is elevated. If the retiring Ganden Tripa is a former abbot of Gyume Tantric College, and thus a former ''Jangtsey Chojey'', his replacement will be a former abbot of Gyuto Tantric College and thus the current ''Sharpa Chojey'' (and vice versa).&lt;ref name=BHGG /&gt;

This appointment is automatic but is apparently confirmed by the Dalai Lama who, being the pre-eminent spiritual leader, publicly announces the appointment or nomination at the time of changeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination of the 101st Ganden Tripa, supreme head of the Gelugpa lineage |url=http://www.phayul.com/mobile/?page=view&amp;c=1&amp;id=3663 |publisher=Phayul.com |location=Paris, France |date=January 23, 2003 |quote=the Dalai-lama announced in BodhGaya at the conclusion of the Kalachakra empowerment the appointment of Khensur Lungri Namgyel Rinpoche as the 101st Ganden Tripa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083014/http://www.phayul.com/mobile/?page=view&amp;c=1&amp;id=3663 |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 102nd Ganden Tripa is Rizong Sre Rinpoche and has previously served as the abbot of both Gyume Tantric College and Drepung Loseling Monastery, currently he serves as the patron of the Lam Rim Centres http://www.lamrim.org.uk/group/en/1/patrons.html and is a touring Lama of The FPMT http://fpmt.org/teachers/touring/

Bussell has written, "my wife and I were involved with an Evangelical youth mission based in Switzerland. We were with the group only six weeks, but it was almost seven years before I had overcome the psychological damage caused by their cult-like control and spiritualization....Questioning a leader was considered an act of rebellion against God and His [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]."

The '''history of Wicca''' documents the rise of the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] and related witchcraft-based Neopagan religions.{{refn|The definition of which witchcraft-based Neopagan groups can be considered to be forms of "Wicca" is debatable.|group=nb}} Wicca originated in the early twentieth century, when it developed amongst secretive [[coven]]s in England who were basing their religious beliefs and practices upon what they read of the historical [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]] in the works of such writers as [[Margaret Murray]]. It was subsequently popularised in the 1950s by a number of figures, in particular [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who claimed to have been initiated into the Craft – as Wicca is often known – by the [[New Forest coven]] in 1939. Gardner's form of Wicca, the [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian tradition]], was spread by both him and his followers like the High Priestesses [[Doreen Valiente]], [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]] and [[Eleanor Bone]] into other parts of the British Isles, and also into other, predominantly English-speaking, countries across the world. In the 1960s, new figures arose in Britain who popularised their own forms of the religion, including [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], [[Sybil Leek]] and [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], and organisations began to be formed to propagate it, such as the [[Witchcraft Research Association]]. It was during this decade that the faith was transported to the United States, where it was further adapted into new traditions such as [[Feri]], [[1734 tradition|1734]] and [[Dianic Wicca]] in the ensuing decades, and where organisations such as the [[Covenant of the Goddess]] were formed.

From the 1970s onward, books began to be published by such figures as [[Paul Huson]], [[Scott Cunningham]], and [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]] and [[Janet Farrar]] which encouraged self-initiation into the Craft, leading to a boost in the number of adherents and the development of traditions. With the rising popularity of Wicca, it was used as a partial basis for [[witchcraft]]-based American films and television shows, further increasing its profile, particularly amongst younger people, in the 1990s.

Since the early 1990s, historians have published studies and research into the history of Wicca, including the American [[Aidan Kelly]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kel91|Kelly 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kel07|Kelly 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Britons [[Ronald Hutton]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philip Heselton]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes00|Heselton 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes03|Heselton 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In the 16th and 17th centuries, something known as the [[witch hunt]] took place across Europe and the American colonies, during which somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people were killed. These people had been accused of being [[witches]], who, according to their persecutors, worshipped the [[Devil]], and committed acts of diabolism that included the [[cannibalism]] of children and desecration of the [[Eucharist]]. Most scholars since have agreed that these were the victims of isolated incidents of hysteria in remote, peasant communities, and that there was no religion being practised by these witches.

However this was not the only view; one, which originated with [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]] in 1828, and which was expanded upon (most notably) by [[Jules Michelet]] in the 1860s and [[Margaret Murray]] in the early 20th century, known as the [[Witch-cult hypothesis]], claimed that the witches had been members of a pan-European [[pagan]] religion which had pre-dated Christianity and had been persecuted by the Christian Church as a rival religion.

Many Wiccans, particularly those of the early decades, believed that their religion was a continuation of this pagan Witch-Cult. It was only in the 1980s and 1990s that some Wiccans began to see the idea of the Witch-Cult as a [[creation myth]] rather than as historical fact.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Wiccan Jenny Gibbons stated that:

{{quote|We Neopagans now face a crisis. As new data appeared, historians altered their theories to account for it. We have not. Therefore an enormous gap has opened between the academic and the "average" Pagan view of witchcraft.

===The New Forest coven===
In 1954, [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], a retired English civil servant who had spent most of his life in the far east, published ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' in which he made the claim to have encountered members of the Witch-Cult. At the same time he propagated his religion to new adherents, largely through the [[Bricket Wood coven]] (which is described further below). Gardner claimed that he had been initiated into a practising coven of the cult in September 1939, a group that has become known as the [[New Forest coven]].

Gardner claimed that this group had met in the [[New Forest]] in southern England, and that he had met some of their members initially through the occultic [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]]. He mentioned two of their members, a local worthy called "[[Dorothy Clutterbuck|Old Dorothy]]", in whose house he claimed to have been initiated, and "[[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]]", who became a friend of his and would remain so for many years.

====An ancient witch-cult?====
{{main|Witch Cult}}
The idea of primitive [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] religions, which derived from the work of the Swiss lawyer [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]], was popular in Gardner's day, both among academics (e.g., [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]], [[Margaret Murray]]) and amateurs (e.g. [[Robert Graves]]). Later scholars (e.g. [[Carl Jung]] and [[Marija Gimbutas]]) continued research in this area, and later still [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Ashley Montagu]] and others became admirers of Gimbutas' theories of matriarchies in ancient Europe. Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate. Some academics carry on research in this area (such as the 2003 World Congress on Matriarchal Studies). Critics argue that such matriarchal societies never actually existed and are an invention of researchers such as [[Margaret Murray]]. This is disputed by documentaries such as ''Blossoms of Fire'' (about contemporary Zapotec society).

The idea of a supreme [[Mother Goddess]] was common in Victorian and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] literature: the concept of a [[Horned God]]&amp;nbsp;– especially related to the gods [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] or Faunus&amp;nbsp;– was less common, but still significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 33-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these ideas were widely accepted in academic literature and the popular press at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 151-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In search of the New Forest Coven====
[[Doreen Valiente]] undertook research into the identity of "Old Dorothy", whose surname was Clutterbuck. She refuted the claims of those who had suggested that Dorothy had been the product of Gardner's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]] (1984). ''The Search For Old Dorothy''. In Farrar, J. &amp; Farrar, S. ''The Witches' Way.'' London: Hale.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been doubted (notably by [[Ronald Hutton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Hutton|title = The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft|publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1999|location = New York|isbn = 0-19-285449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) whether the historical Dorothy Clutterbuck, who was outwardly an observant Christian and a pillar of the local community, really was involved in occultic activities. In this view, Gardner used her name as a joke and/or as a subterfuge to conceal the identity of Dafo or some other individual. Such doubts have been vigorously contested by other researchers (notably [[Philip Heselton]]).

Valiente assumed that Clutterbuck was the same individual as Dafo. More recently, it has become clear that they were different people.&lt;ref name=CauldronInspiration&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |year=2003 |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |publisher=Capall Bann Publishing |location=Somerset |isbn=1-86163-164-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dafo seems to have been a teacher of music and elocution named [[Edith Woodford-Grimes]], and there have been persistent suggestions that she and Gardner were lovers.

The work of [[Philip Heselton]] has gone a considerable way towards illuminating the composition and activities of the New Forest Coven, and several candidates for its membership aside from Dorothy and Dafo emerge from his work.

====Sources for Wicca====
The ritual format of Wicca shows the influence of late [[Victorian era]] occultism (even co-founder [[Doreen Valiente]] admitted seeing influence from [[Aleister Crowley]]), and there is very little in the ritual that cannot be shown to have come from earlier extant sources.&lt;ref&gt;See Nevill Drury. "Why Does Aleister Crowley Still Matter?" Richard Metzger, ed. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult.''  Disinformation Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion's spiritual content, however, is inspired by older Pagan faiths (for example, in the veneration of historical pagan deities), with [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] influences (e.g. in the Wiccan doctrine of [[reincarnation]]).

It has been posited by authors such as [[Aidan Kelly]] and [[Francis X. King]] that Gardner himself created the religion that he claimed to have discovered, rewriting the rituals of an older witchcraft tradition according to his own whim,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly believed that the New Forest coven's rituals were identical with those of [[Rhiannon Ryall]] before Gardner rewrote them (''Crafting the Art of Magic'' p. 41-2); King states "Louis Wilkinson went on to tell me various interesting details of the practices of these Hampshire witches&amp;nbsp;– details which, I felt sure, made it certain that the group was not simply derived from the jaded tastes of middle-class intellectuals who adhered to the theories of Margaret Murray" (''The Rites of Modern Occult Magic'' p. 178).&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporating elements from the thesis of [[Margaret Murray|Dr. Margaret Murray]], sources such as ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' by [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]&lt;ref name="Aradia"&gt;{{cite book| last=Leland| first=Charles G. |authorlink=Charles Godfrey Leland |year=1998 |origyear=1899 |title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches |publisher=Phoenix Publishing |location=Blaine, Washington |isbn=0-919345-34-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practices of [[ceremonial magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Kelly's theories have been critiqued in detail by Donald Hudson Frew (1991): [http://www.wildideas.net/temple/library/frew.html Crafting the Art of Magic: A Critical Review].&lt;/ref&gt;

The original material in the rituals brought to light by Gardner is not cohesive, and mostly takes the form of substitutions or expansions within unoriginal material. Roger Dearnaley, in ''An Annotated Chronology and Bibliography of the Early Gardnerian Craft'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Dearnaley |first = Roger |title = An Annotated Chronology and Bibliography of the Early Gardnerian Craft |publisher = Kou Ra Productions |accessdate = 9 December 2005 |url = http://www.cyprian.org/Articles/gardchron.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes it as a "patchwork". One element that is apparently distinctive is the use of ritual scourging and binding as a method of attaining an ecstatic trance for magical working. Hutton argues strongly that this practice in Wicca does not reflect sado-masochistic sexuality (he refers in this connection to Gardner's own collection of very mild, quasi-[[pornography|pornographic]] material, which showed no traces of such interests), but is simply a practical method of work alternative to drugs or other more strenuous methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Hutton|title = The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft|publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1999|location = New York|page = 235|isbn = 0-19-285449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heselton, writing in ''Wiccan Roots'' and later in ''Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration'',&lt;ref name="CauldronInspiration"/&gt; argues that Gardner was not the author of the Wiccan rituals but received them in good faith from an unknown source. ([[Doreen Valiente]] makes this claim regarding the "basic skeleton of the rituals," as [[Margot Adler]] puts it in ''Drawing Down the Moon''.) He notes that all the Crowley material that is found in the Wiccan rituals can be found in a single book, ''The Equinox vol 3 no. 1'' or ''Blue Equinox'' (1919). Gardner is not known to have owned or had access to a copy of this book, although he met with Crowley towards the end of the latter's life. Gardner admitted that "the rituals he received from Old Dorothy's coven were very fragmentary, and in order to make them workable, he had to supplement them with other material."&lt;ref&gt;Julia Phillips, "History of Wicca in England: 1939 – present day." Lecture at the Wiccan Conference in Canberra, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early 20th century revival====
Some, such as [[Isaac Bonewits]], have argued that Valiente and Heselton's evidence points to an early 20th-century revival predating Gardner (by the New Forest Coven, perhaps), rather than an intact old Pagan religion. The argument points to historical claims of Gardner's that agree with scholarship of a certain time period and contradict later scholarship. Bonewits writes, "Somewhere between 1920 and 1925 in England some folklorists appear to have gotten together with some Golden Dawn Rosicrucians and a few supposed Fam-Trads to produce the first modern covens in England; grabbing eclectically from any source they could find in order to try and reconstruct the shards of their Pagan past."

====Order of Woodcraft Chivalry====
It has been proposed, originally in the Druidic journal ''Aisling''&lt;ref&gt;Steve Wilson "Woodcrafting the Art of Magic", ''Aisling''8 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; that Gardner's New Forest coven was the pagan section of the [[Order of Woodcraft Chivalry]]; this order performed rituals in the New Forest in the early 1920s and its pagan section honoured a moon goddess and a horned god, and believed in ritual nakedness. One of [[Ronald Hutton]]'s informants reports that Gardner was familiar with this order at least by the 1950s. A major difficulty with identifying this group with the New Forest coven is that it does not appear to have met in the New Forest between 1934 and 1945. Gardner records a working by the coven in the New Forest in 1940 against the projected Nazi invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====George Pickingill's coven====
A theory advanced by Bill Liddell is that the New Forest coven derived from a set of covens created by the nineteenth century [[cunning folk|cunning man]] [[George Pickingill]], who lived in the [[Essex]] village of [[Canewdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liddell |first=William|year=1994 |title= The Pickingill Papers |publisher=Capall Bann Publishing |location=UK |isbn=1-898307-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is not widely accepted, although it does focus attention on the well documented and widespread "cunning folk" and their contribution to the history of British witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Hutton|title = The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft|publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1999|page = 293| location = New York|isbn = 0-19-285449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Wicca==

===Gardnerian Wicca and the Bricket Wood coven (1946–1963)===
[[File:The Witches' Cottage.JPG|right|thumb|The witches' cottage, located on the grounds of Fiveacres nudist club, where the [[Bricket Wood coven]] met.]][[File:Witches Hut 2006 side view.JPG|thumb|The Witches Hut in 2006.]]
Gardner, claiming to be fearful that the Witch-Cult religion would die out, began to propagate it through forming the [[Bricket Wood coven]] in Hertfordshire in circa 1946. He acted as the High Priest for the coven, and [[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]], who had also been a member of the New Forest coven, acted as High Priestess. However, she became concerned that Gardner's attempts to gain publicity would lead to a public backlash against her, and so she left his coven in 1952,&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999 }} Chapter 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt; albeit remaining his friend.

In 1953 Gardner initiated a young woman, [[Doreen Valiente]], into the craft, and she soon went on to become the High Priestess of his Bricket Wood coven. Around the same time, Gardner invented the [[Book of Shadows]], a workbook of rituals, although he claimed it was of ancient origins. Valiente helped Gardner rewrite the Book, cutting out what she saw as "[[Aleister Crowley|Crowleyanity]]", and writing sections such as the [[Charge of the Goddess]] in poetic verse.&lt;ref name="Valiente"&gt;{{cite book | first=Doreen | last=Valiente | authorlink=Doreen Valiente | title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft| publisher = Hale| year=1989|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valiente and Gardner later fell out, however, when she got fed up with his constant attempts to gain publicity and when he tried to impose the [[Wiccan Laws]] upon the coven, something which he claimed were used by the Witch-Cult, but which Valiente believed he had simply made up. She, and several other members of the coven, left, and founded their own. However, the Bricket Wood coven continued, with members that included [[Jack Bracelin]], [[Dayonis]], [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]] and [[Lois Bourne]].

Gardner also propagated his witchcraft tradition, which had begun to be referred to as "[[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]]",&lt;ref name="Valiente2"&gt;{{cite book | first=Doreen | last=Valiente | authorlink=Doreen Valiente | title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft| publisher = Hale| year=1989 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside of his Bricket Wood coven; he initiated [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]], [[Eleanor Bone|Eleanor Rae Bone]] and [[Monique Wilson (Wiccan)|Monique Wilson]], all of whom went on to propagate Gardnerian Witchcraft through their own covens. Various other initiates began to spread the craft around Britain, for instance [[Charles Clark (Wiccan)|Charles Clark]] took the religion to England's northern neighbour, [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewica.co.uk/Charles%20Clark%20Article.htm The Wica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner referred to members of his craft as "the Wica", although he called the religion itself "Witchcraft", and never used the term "Wicca" in the sense as it is now known.&lt;ref name="Blogspot.com"&gt;[http://kell1744.blogspot.com/2008/03/use-of-wica-by-gerald-gardner.html Blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Gardner tried to get more publicity for his religion; he gave interviews to several newspapers, some of which were positive, although others turned very negative, one even declaring "Witches Devil-Worship in London!". He also published a second non-fiction book on the subject, ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'', in 1959, as well as running the [[Museum of Magic and Witchcraft]] on the [[Isle of Man]] up until his death in 1964.

===Hereditary Witchcraft (1950s)===
Gardner was not the only person claiming to be a member of a surviving remnant of the witch-cult; several others also emerged in the 1950s making this claim. They included [[Sybil Leek]], [[Charles Cardell]], [[Raymond Howard (Wiccan)|Raymond Howard]], [[Rolla Nordic]] and [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]]. They claimed to have been initiated into the cult by their ancestors, and described themselves as following "Hereditary" or "Traditional" forms of Witchcraft,&lt;ref name="Hutton2"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Gardner, some said, was propagating a modern, and invalid form. Their beliefs and practices however, were similar to those of Gardner, and some of their modern followers describe their faith as being a form of [[Wicca]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1734.us/ "1734 Traditional Wicca"]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others insist it is different and call it "Traditional Witchcraft".

The terms "Wicca" and "Wiccen" were first used by Charles Cardell, not to refer purely to Gardnerians, but to refer to all followers of the Witch-Cult religion. In his notebooks he used the term "Wicca" to refer to the religion, and he called it the "Craft of the Wiccens" in a 1958 article in ''Light'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Blogspot.com"/&gt;

Initially there was an attempt to reconcile and unite all of these traditions claiming to be Witch-Cult remnants, for instance the [[Witchcraft Research Association]], which was founded in 1964 by Sybil Leek. After Leek emigrated to the United States, Doreen Valiente took over presidency, and began publication of a magazine, ''Pentagram''.&lt;ref name="Hutton3"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999 }} Chapter 16, The Man in Black&lt;/ref&gt; However both the magazine and the organisation collapsed amongst infighting by the various traditions, with Cochrane consistently insulting, and even calling for a "[[Night of the Long Knives]]", against Gardnerians.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

===Wicca across the world (1960s)===

Within a few years of Gardner's propagation of the craft, Wicca had spread from England into neighbouring Scotland and Ireland. However, in the 1960s, it also began to spread much further abroad, most notably in the English-speaking nations of Australia and the United States.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book |title=A New History of Witchcraft|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location= |author=Alexander, Brooks |author2=Russell, Jeffrey |page=171 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Wicca "found a receptive social environment because of the long-standing presence and familiarity of Aboriginal culture with its 'pagan' (i.e. 'non-Christian') beliefs and practices".&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Gardnerian Wicca came to the United States through an Englishman who had recently emigrated to the USA, named [[Raymond Buckland]], and his wife, Rosemary. Raymond, working for [[British Airways]], regularly returned to England, and he began to correspond with Gardner. In 1963, both Bucklands were initiated into the Gardnerian craft by Monique Wilson in a ceremony in Britain. The couple returned to America where they founded the [[Long Island coven]] in [[New York state]], basing their practice upon the Gardnerian [[Book of Shadows]]. The coven was later taken over by a couple known only as Theos and Phoenix, who enlarged the Book of Shadows, adding further degrees of initiation which were required before members could found their own covens. Interest outstripped the ability of the mostly British-based covens to train and propagate members; the beliefs of the religion spread faster by the printed word or word of mouth than the initiatory system was prepared to handle.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of would-be Wiccans who compiled rituals out of published sources together with their own imaginative reconstructions, without formal initiations, appear in [[Hans Holzer]]'s ''The New Pagans'' (Doubleday, New York: 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1960s, non-Gardnerian forms of Witchcraft (which are sometimes viewed as Wicca, or sometimes as "Traditional Witchcraft") made their way to the USA. The American [[Joseph Bearwalker Wilson]] corresponded with the English Robert Cochrane prior to Cochrane's ritual suicide in 1966, and from this he founded the [[1734 Tradition]]. [[Sybil Leek]] too, an English witch from the [[New Forest]], emigrated to California, where she continued to practice her craft, and teach others.  In 1968 [[Gavin Frost|Gavin]] and [[Yvonne Frost]] established the [[Church and School of Wicca]]; which in 1972 became the first Federally recognised [[Wiccan church]].

It would be in the 2000s that Wicca would begin to gain a foothold in other nations; for instance, [[Ipsita Roy Chakraverti]] began to publicise it in [[India]], and it also has a number of adherents in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Vos"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dancing Under an African Moon: Paganism and Wicca in South Africa|publisher=Struik Publishers |location= |author=Vos, Donna Darkwolf|page=|year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexandrian Wicca (1963–1973)===
In the 1960s, an Englishman called [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] emerged, appearing in various newspapers. He claimed to be a hereditary witch, having been initiated into the craft by his grandmother. Later researchers, such as [[Ronald Hutton]], have shown that he actually had been initiated into a Gardnerian coven, although Hutton notes that Sanders' grandmother was in fact "skilled in [[cunning man|cunning craft]]". Sanders had previously practised as a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] healer.&lt;ref name="HuttononSanders"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999 }} Chapter 17, "Royalty from the North"&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation in the tabloids increased when he married the much younger [[Maxine Sanders]] in a [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony, and subsequently the duo began to refer to themselves as the "King and Queen of the Witches", at one point claiming to have the allegiance of 1,623 witches, and 127 northern covens. His tradition, which was later coined as "[[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian]]" by [[Stewart Farrar]], an initiate of Sanders, incorporated aspects from [[ceremonial magic]] and the [[Qabalah]], as well as Judeo-Christian iconography. Sanders justified this by claiming that his version of Wicca and Christianity were both forces for good, battling against the forces of darkness which were practised by [[Satanism|Satanists]] and [[black magic]]ians.

Several Gardnerians, including Patricia Crowther and [[Eleanor Bone|Ray Bone]], tried to denounce Sanders as a charlatan, but he simply responded by accusing them of being the charlatans, and as being practitioners of [[black magic]] who abused their initiates.

In 1973, Alex and Maxine separated, but both continued to practice the craft. One of the key reasons for their separation was that neither would compromise on Alex's [[bisexuality]]. After the divorce, Alex focused on formulating Wicca so that it could be followed by homosexual men, who had been partially prevented from involvement previously because of the religions' focus on gender polarity. He also initiated a number of people from continental Europe, who then spread the faith there. In 1979, Sanders issued an apology for his "past hurts" and "many public stupidities" and tried to encorouge co-operation between Gardnerians and Alexandrians. He died in 1988.

===Algard and Seax (1972–1974)===
In the United States, several forms of Wicca formed in the 1970s, based upon the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions, but with certain differences. These traditions were actually formed by those who had previously been initiated into Gardnerian or Alexandrian crafts, and so can still be traced to Gardner, and thereby are often considered to be forms of [[British Traditional Wicca]].

The first of these was [[Algard Wicca]], founded in 1972 by Mary Nesnick, who had been initiated into both of the aforementioned traditions. Algard attempted to fuse the two together, thereby trying to prevent the arguments that were going on between the two.&lt;ref name="Rabinovitch"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;id=xuvLRbKvyGEC&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;pg=PA95&amp;sig=XGGTFUOOrBOlalf5J7h3ArphKXY |publisher=Citadel Press |location=New York City |first=Shelley |last=Rabinovitch |author2=Lewis, James R |pages=5–6 |year=2004 |isbn=0-8065-2407-3 |oclc=59262630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, in 1973, [[Raymond Buckland]], who had brought the Gardnerian craft to the USA originally, ceased to practice it, and formed a new tradition, known as [[Seax-Wica]]. Seax used the structure of traditional Gardnerian covens, but used the iconography of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], so the God and the Goddess were represented not as the traditional [[Horned God]] and [[Mother Goddess]], but as [[Woden]] and [[Freya]]. Seax was virtually unique amongst Wicca at the time as it did not work on an initiatory basis of covens; Buckland deliberately published all its rites and rituals in a book, ''The Tree'', so that anyone could practice them.&lt;ref name="Alexander2"&gt;{{cite book |title=A New History of Witchcraft|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location= |author=Alexander, Brooks |author2=Russell, Jeffrey |page=172 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dianic Wicca and the feminist movement (1971–1979)===
In 1971, a Hungarian-American named [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]], who had no connection to any Gardnerian or Alexandrian covens, mixed Wiccan practices with [[feminist]] politics, forming [[Dianic Witchcraft]] (although now it is better known as "Dianic Wicca"). She began this with a coven in Los Angeles, that she named the [[Susan B. Anthony]] Coven Number One.&lt;ref name="Alexander2"/&gt;

Dianic Wicca focused almost exclusively upon the [[Goddess]], and largely, and in some covens completely, ignoring the [[Horned God]]. Most covens were women-only, and some were designed specifically for lesbians. Like Seax-Wica, which developed around the same time, the rituals of Dianic Wicca were published by its creator so that any woman could practice it, without having the need of a specific initiation into a lineage. Indeed, Budapest believed that it was every woman's right to be able to practice the religion, and she referred to it as being "women's spirituality".&lt;ref name="Alexander2"/&gt;

Dianic Wicca was criticised by many Gardnerians at the time for having an almost [[monotheism|monotheistic]] view of theology, in contrast with Wicca's traditional duotheism. One Gardnerian even declared "spare us [[Jahweh]] in drag!" in response to the focus on the one Goddess.&lt;ref name="Alexander2"/&gt;

One Gardnerian, who went under the [[craft name]] of [[Starhawk]], started practising Dianic Wicca, and tried to reconcile the two, writing the 1979 book ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'' on the subject. The tradition she founded became known as [[Reclaiming (neopaganism)|Reclaiming]], and mixed Wicca with other forms of [[Neopaganism]] such as [[Feri]], along with strong principles of environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Alexander2"/&gt;

===Solitaries and the "Wicca or Witchcraft" debate (1970–)===
In traditional Gardnerian and Alexandrian craft, initiates took an oath of secrecy never to reveal the rituals of it to outsiders. Despite this, both Gardner and Sanders sought publicity, and allowed reporters to witness their practices. Initiates such as Valiente and Buckland had been annoyed at this, the first commenting that "by speaking to the press, Gardner was compromising the security of the group and the sincerity of his own teachings".&lt;ref name="Valiente"/&gt; However, the key rituals of the Gardnerians (which were the basis for most of the Alexandrian ones) were made public in the 1960s when [[Charles Cardell]], in an act of spite against the recently deceased Gardner, published the Gardnerian [[Book of Shadows]].&lt;ref name="HuttononSCardell"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, [[Paul Huson]] published ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]]'' [[Mastering Witchcraft]]: A Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; a book purportedly based upon non-Wiccan traditional British witchcraft, and the first do-it-yourself manual for the would-be witch, which became one of the basic instruction books for a large number of covens.&lt;ref&gt;Luhrmann, T.M. ''Persuasions of the Witch's Craft'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989, p.261 "Core Texts in Magical Practice"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan A. ''Crafting the Art of Magic: A History of Modern Witchcraft'', Minnesota: Llewellyn, 1991, p.61, on "the First Degree Initiation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S. ''The Paganism Reader'', New York: Routledge, 2004 p.4 "Revival and diversification texts", pp. 170 – 185, "Paul Huson: Preliminary Preparations"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witchesworkshop.com/Circle/workshop_books.html Witches Workshop Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Lady Sheba (Jessie Wicker Bell, 1920–2002), the Kentucky-born self-styled "Queen of the American Witches", published what she claimed was her family's centuries-old [[grimoire]], but which in fact contained material substantially plagiarised from the Gardnerian ''Book of Shadows'', and also included poetry by [[Doreen Valiente]] that was, and is, still under copyright.

Doreen Valiente also published information on the subject of pagan Witchcraft, such as the 1973 book ''An ABC of Witchcraft'', which contained a self-initiation ritual for solitary practitioners.

Following this, other Wiccans decided that it would be better to simply reveal the Wiccan mysteries to the public in their true form. These included [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]] and [[Janet Farrar]], two Alexandrian initiates. Stewart, prior to his marriage, had already published information on Wiccan rituals (with Sanders' blessing), in his 1971 book ''[[What Witches Do]]''. Together they published further works on the subjects, such ''Eight Sabbats for Witches'' (1981) and ''The Witches' Way'' (1984).

From these published writings, many other practitioners began to follow the Witchcraft religion, working either as solitary Witches or in non-lineaged covens. Valiente herself considered all of these such people to be "Witches", and she reserved the term "Wiccan" to refer solely to Gardnerians. Despite this, most of the newer followers used the term "Wiccan" to describe themselves, and in the United States, it became the norm to refer to any Neopagan witchcraft as "Wicca", and so Gardnerians, Alexandrians and Algards, wishing to emphasise their lineage that stretched back to Gardner, began referring to themselves as followers of "[[British Traditional Wicca]]".

==Contemporary Wicca==

===Pop-culture Wicca (1996–)===
In the 1990s and 2000s, Wicca began to become ingrained in popular culture. Aspects of Wicca were incorporated into the [[New Age]] movement, and many Wiccans took on New Age beliefs and practices. Wicca was also taken up by popular entertainment; in 1996, the American film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released about four witches who are corrupted by their power. The same year the television series ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' appeared, which was followed the following year by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and in 1998 by the series ''[[Charmed]]'' and the film ''[[Practical Magic]]''. Whilst these were heavily criticised by many Wiccans ([[Margot Adler]] called ''The Craft'' "the worst movie ever made!"), they did encourage many teenagers and young adults to investigate more about the religion. Most covens and Neopagan groups refused to allow under 18s into their ranks, and so many teenagers turned to books to find out more. In turn, several books were published to cater for them, including [[Silver RavenWolf]]'s ''Teen Witch: Wicca for a New Generation'' and [[Scott Cunningham]]'s ''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner''.&lt;ref name="Alexander3"&gt;{{cite book |title=A New History of Witchcraft|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location= |author=Alexander, Brooks |author2=Russell, Jeffrey |pages=178–185 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped to bring about the ''Teen Wicca'' movement, and it has been suggested that the reason why so many young adults are attracted to the faith can "be attributed to the fact that it tackles issues that teenagers are interested in&amp;nbsp;– in a way that other religions do not."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/paganism/subdivisions/teenwitches.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Wicca amongst teens has also brought problems; in 2001, a 12-year-old American schoolgirl named Tempest Smith committed suicide after being bullied for her faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Far From Devil Worship And 'Harry Potter,' Young Witches Explain What They're Really About|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584096/far-from-devil-worship-and-harry-potter-young-witches-explain-what-theyre-really-about/|accessdate=19 March 2017|work=MTV News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the rise of this teenage-focused, New Age, pop-culture Wicca has been highly criticised by traditionalists, many of whom refuse to accept it as Wicca, instead using terms like "wicca-lite". The historians Brooks Alexander and Jeffrey Russell commented that "pop-culture witchcraft is sufficiently vague in structure and content to qualify more as a 'lifestyle' than a 'religion'."&lt;ref name="Alexander3"/&gt;

The rise of the internet also had an effect on Wicca. Previously, solitary Wiccans around the world had little way of communicating amongst one another, however, the internet allowed them to do so. Websites such as Witchvox.com were set up. Historian Brooks Alexander commented that this was a form of "minority empowerment".&lt;ref name="Alexander3"/&gt;

===Gaining recognition===
For a long time, Wicca was seen as being simply a minor sect, or cult. However, with the rise of solitary practitioners describing themselves as Wiccans, the faith went from becoming simply a [[mystery cult]] to becoming a public religion.

Groups were formed to represent the Wiccan community, such as the [[Covenant of the Goddess]], which was founded in 1975. Wiccans began to appear on various British television documentaries, including ''[[The Heaven &amp; Earth Show]]'' and ''[[Desperately Seeking Something]]''.

In the USA, the court case of [[Dettmer v. Landon]] in 1986 established that Wicca was a religion, and therefore should be treated as such under the eyes of the law.

The first Wiccan wedding to be legally recognised in the UK (by the [[General Register Office for Scotland|Registrars of Scotland]]) was performed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Wiccan celebrant [[George Cameron (Wiccan)|George Cameron]] ("The Hermit"), Grand Master of the ''Source Coven'' said: ''This is the most important event since the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1951. I am delighted because I have been trying to make this happen for many years. It is the biggest thing to hit pagan witchcraft for years. This is very significant as the ceremony is classed as a religious ceremony, which gives credence to the Craft and recognises it as a religious faith.'' (''A nice day for a witch wedding'', ''[[The Scotsman|The Scotsman Evening News]]'', 16 September 2004.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">'''Irreligion in the Maldives''' is a social taboo, and [[irreligion|irreligious]] people are systematically socially and legally discriminated against.

== Law ==
The [[Constitution of the Maldives|Constitution]] of the [[Maldives]] designates [[Islam]] as the official [[state religion]], and the government and many citizens at all levels interpret this provision to impose a requirement that all citizens must be Muslims. The Constitution states the president must be a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]. There is no [[freedom of religion]] [[freedom of thought|or belief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/asia-southern-asia/maldives/ |title=Maldives |work=Freedom of Thought Report |publisher=[[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation leads to institutionally sanctioned religious oppression against non-Muslims and [[ex-Muslims]] who currently reside in the country.

On 27 April 2014, the Maldives ratified a new regulation that revived the [[death penalty]] (abolished in 1953, when the last execution took place) for a number of ''[[hudud]]'' offences, including apostasy for persons from the age of 7 and older. The new regulation was strongly criticised by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]], pointing out that they violated the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which the Maldives have ratified, that ban the execution of anyone for offences committed before the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/04/maldives-enacts-regulation-death-penalty-2014430214541593659.html |title=Maldives enacts regulation for death penalty |work=Al Jazeera English |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47680#.WgeIfWjWyUl |title=Maldives should repeal new regulation providing for death penalty, says UN rights office |work=UN News Centre |publisher=United Nations |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==

===Mohammed Nazim===
During a question-and-answer session at one of Indian Muslim orator [[Zakir Naik]]'s lectures May 29, 2010 on the [[Maldives]], a 37-year-old Maldivian citizen named Mohamed Nazim stood up and announced that he was struggling to believe in any religion and did not consider himself to be a Muslim, Nazim further asked what his verdict would be under Islam and in the Maldives.&lt;ref name=apostat3&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xz8Z6KqR3w Maldivian man asks Naik about what the verdict is to be regarding his lack of faith] Youtube 2010-06-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apostat4&gt;[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30855 Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60kifXA19?url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30855 |date=2011-08-07 }} Haveeru Daily (English Ed.) 2010-05-30&lt;/ref&gt; Zakir responded that he considers the punishment for apostasy not necessarily to mean death since [[Muhammed]] was reported in the Hadith scriptures to on some occasion to have shown [[clemency]] towards apostates, but added that if a Muslim apostate speaks and propagates against Islam under Islamic Shari’a rule then the apostate should be put to death.&lt;ref name="apostat3"/&gt;

Mohamed Nazim was reported to have been arrested and put in [[protective custody]] by the Maldivian Police. He later publicly reverted to Islam in custody after receiving two days of counseling by two Islamic scholars, but was held awaiting possible charges.&lt;ref name=apostat5&gt;[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30892 What will happen to the Maldivian who renounced Islam?] Haveeru Daily (English Ed.) 2010-05-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apostat6&gt;[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30901 Maldivian who renounced Islam reverts back] Haveeru Daily (English Ed.) 2010-06-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apostat7&gt;[http://minivannews.com/politics/islamic-foundation-calls-for-death-sentence-if-apostate-fails-to-repent-7606 Islamic Foundation calls for death sentence if apostate fails to repent] Minivan News 2010-05-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ismail Mohammed Didi===
On July 14, 2010, Maldivian news site Minivan News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minivannews.com/society/hanged-air-traffic-controller-sought-asylum-for-fear-of-religious-persecution-9381|title = Hanged air traffic controller sought asylum for fear of religious persecution|author = JJ Robinson|publisher = Minivan News|date = July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that 25-year-old air traffic controller Ismail Mohamed Didi had sent two e-mails, dated June 25, to international human rights organisations declaring that he was an atheist ex-Muslim and that he desired help with his asylum application (directed to the United Kingdom) due to increased repression from family and colleague shunning and anonymous death threats via phone. The same day that the report was posted, Didi was found hanged in the aircraft control tower at [[Malé International Airport]] in an apparent suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south+asia-10644685|title = Maldives atheist who felt persecuted 'hangs himself'|author = Charles Haviland|publisher = BBC News|date =15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam in [[Angola]]''' is a minority [[religion in Angola|religion]]. Most sources estimate the population at 90,000,&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; although some give a higher figure. Most [[Muslim]]s in [[Angola]] are [[Sunni]]. They are generally foreign migrants from [[West Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], although a few are local [[Conversion to Islam|converts]]. There exist several Islamic organizations that run mosques, schools and community centers. The Association of the Development of Islam in Angola is the primary proselytizing organization. Muslim Angolans are represented by the [[Supreme Council of Angolan Muslims]] of [[Luanda]].&lt;ref name="customs"&gt;Oyebade, Adebayo O. ''Culture And Customs of Angola'', 2006. Pages 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of late 2013, the Angolan government does not legally recognize any Muslim organizations; as a result, mosques in the country have faced restrictions and many have been shut down by the government.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/28/angola-accused-banning-islam-mosques|title=Angola accused of 'banning' Islam as mosques closed &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Guardian|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The [[Constitution of Angola#2010 constitution|2010 Angolan Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]] to all of its citizens. In late 2016, however, messages spread that the Angolan government had banned Islam and closed down all mosques in the country. stating that it clashed with the state's Christian values. The US State Department's 2013 report into global religious freedom counted 194 different religious groups that were denied legal recognition, the large majority of which were Christian organisations, and this included Islam. The US report does say a mosque was destroyed - including one in Luanda's Zango neighbourhood - though, while it says two mosques were shut down, 52 churches were closed in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37316749|title=The persistent myth that Islam was banned in Angola|publisher=BBC News|date=18 October 2016|access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian20131124&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/11/islam-banned-in-angola/ |title=Islam Banned in Angola |publisher=Las Vegas Guardian Express |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government requires religious groups to petition for legal status. Upon recognition, these groups are allowed to build schools and places of worship. In order to be recognized, a group must have more than 100,000 and be present in 12 out of 18 provinces.&lt;ref name=IRFR2012/&gt; The population of Muslims, however, is estimated at only 90,000.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; While the government has given legal status to 83 religious groups (all of them Christian&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;), it has not given legal status to any Muslim groups.&lt;ref name=IRFR2012/&gt; The president of the [[Islamic Community of Angola]] has criticized Angola's threshold for recognition by stating, "You need 100,000 to be recognised as a religion or officially you cannot pray".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|author=Aristides Cabeche and David Smith|title=Angola accused of 'banning' Islam as mosques closed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/28/angola-accused-banning-islam-mosques|date=2013-11-28|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US State Department]] reports that the government often permits non-registered groups to exist and function, but notes of instances of Angolan authorities shutting down mosques (see [[Islam in Angola#Restrictions on mosques|section below]]).&lt;ref name=IRFR2012/&gt;

In November 2013, Angolan foreign minister [[Georges Chikoti]] said that there were eight Islamic denominations in Angola, but none met the legal requirements for registration, and "so they can't practice their faith until concluding the process". Chikoti states that some Muslim groups had not registered their mosques officially, but did not specify which legal requirements they had not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angola defends barring Islamic groups, denies persecution|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/29/angola-islam-idUSL5N0JE2EU20131129|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Historically, Angola did not have a significant Muslim population. During the 21st century, Angola's Muslim community has grown. Most Muslims in Angola are businessmen and migrants from [[West Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], especially Lebanon.&lt;ref name=statedept&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108352.htm|title=2008 Report on International Religious Freedom - Angola|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few Angolans have converted to Islam as a result of Muslim [[missionary]] activity in Angola. Most of these conversions occurred during the [[Angolan Civil War]], when many Angolans fled to countries with a significant Muslim presence and came into contact with Islam there.&lt;ref name="customs"/&gt;

Adebayo Oyebade estimates that Muslims make up 1 to 2.5 percent of Angola's population.&lt;ref name="customs"/&gt; The [[US State Department]] states that the estimated Muslim population is 80,000-90,000, but notes that some sources put the population size closer to 500,000.,&lt;ref name=IRFR2012/&gt; which appears to be highly unrealistic. Around 1% of the Muslim population of Angola adheres to [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Estimated Percentage Range of Shia by Country|url = http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Orphan_Migrated_Content/Shiarange.pdf|publisher = Pew forum|accessdate = 2013-07-30|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120801221118/http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Orphan_Migrated_Content/Shiarange.pdf|archivedate = 2012-08-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|International Religious Freedom Report]] stated that the Angolan government selectively shut down mosques, schools and community centres.&lt;ref name=IRFR2012&gt;{{cite web|title=ANGOLA 2012 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/208328.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angolan officials denied that a government had a policy to close mosques, there were reports of local authorities closing mosques or preventing their construction on several occasions.

In July 2010, unidentified arsonists set fire to a mosque in [[Huambo]], causing extensive damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angola: Fire in Huambo Mosque Destroys Documents|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201007080603.html|agency=[[Angola News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Muslim leader later said the mosque was burned "a day after authorities had warned us that we should not have  built the mosque where we had and that it had to be built somewhere else."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

On September 4, 2010, authorities closed a mosque in [[Cazenga]] without prior notice or justification. The mosque reopened a month later.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010JD&gt;{{cite web|title=ANGOLA July-December, 2010 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171599.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Angolan authorities tore down a structure being used as a mosque in [[Cacuaco]] without notice and without a written order of violation.&lt;ref name=IRFR2011/&gt; In December 2011, a Muslim group in the [[Malanje Province]] purchased some land, and applied to obtain permission to build a mosque. The Muslim group repeatedly asked the authorities to either grant or deny the application, but received no response. After waiting several months, when the Muslim group began construction, Angolan authorities arrived and destroyed the mosque foundation. The authorities did not provide either a denial of the application, or a citation for offense.&lt;ref name=IRFR2011&gt;{{cite web|title=ANGOLA 2011 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192890.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the Angolan government prevented Muslims from building a mosque in [[Dundo]], [[Lunda Norte Province]], even though the Muslim group had a license to do so. In May 2012, the police chained the doors of a building used by Muslims as a mosque and told them to cease praying there. Muslim leaders wrote letters in response, but received no response.&lt;ref name=IRFR2012/&gt;

According to the [[Islamic Community of Angola]], a total of 60 mosques, mostly outside of [[Luanda]], have been shut down in 2013. Voice of America reported seeing a video that showed the demolition of a mosque in [[Saurimo]].&lt;ref name= VOA/&gt; Muslims are currently de facto are denied the permit to pray in or build mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/28/angola-accused-banning-islam-mosques|title=Angola accused of 'banning' Islam as mosques closed|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angolan Minister of Culture said "The legalisation of Islam has not been approved...their mosques will be closed until further notice."&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; The Angolan Embassy in the United States said it was not aware of this remark.&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian20131124/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibt1&gt;{{cite web| title=Angola Denies It Banned Islam, Destroyed Mosques| url=http://www.ibtimes.com/angola-denies-it-banned-islam-destroyed-mosques-1484898| work=International Business Times| date=2013-11-25| accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the Angolan police said that he was unaware of any government order to shut down mosques. However, Voice of America found a government document telling an official to demolish the "Zango 1" mosque in Viana Luanda province.&lt;ref name= VOA&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim Leader Says Angolan Authorities Destroying Mosques|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/muslim-leader-says-angolan-authorities-destroying-mosques/1798289.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Ban on Islam" controversy==
In November 2013, some media sources reported that Islam and other belief systems deemed to be contrary to the country's culture had been outlawed in Angola.&lt;ref name=guardian20131124/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=19 November 2013 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311200767.html |title=Angola: Minister Guarantees Efforts to Fight Illegal Churches |publisher=[[allAfrica.com]] |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ireneu Mujoco |url=http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?id=1929&amp;det=35025 |title=Islão já tem 60 mesquitas encerradas - Política - O País - O Jornal da Nova Angola |publisher=O País (Angola) |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[International Business Times]]'' said that Angola was seeking to shut down all mosques.&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite news|author=Vasudevan  Sriradhan|title=Angola Bans Islam and Shuts Down All Mosques|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/524955/20131125/angola-islam-ban-muslim-allah-mohammed-africa.htm|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the reports were later denied by the government&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian20131124/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibt1"/&gt; The Ministry of Culture stated, "There is no war in Angola against Islam or any other religion."&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/angola-denies-banning-islam-outcry-204531643.html|title=Angola denies banning Islam after outcry|date=Nov 26, 2013|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, [[Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu]], Secretary-General of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), said that his organisation would send a fact-finding team to Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OIC Probes Facts About Angola Muslims|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/global/466433-oic-probes-facts-about-angola-muslims.html|date=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
In 2004 Constantino Vitiaka, the head of information of Angola's national intelligence services, claimed in a radio interview that the extremist [[Islamic terrorism|terror network]] [[al-Qaeda]] had tried to enter the country through Muslim [[Non-Governmental Organization]]s.&lt;ref name="news1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Al-Qaeda-tries-to-enter-Angola-20041021 |title=Al-Qaeda tries to enter Angola |publisher=[[News24]] |date=2004-10-22 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam''' is the state religion of '''[[Saudi Arabia]]'''. The connection between Islam and Saudi Arabia (or at least the western [[Hejaz]] region of the country) is uniquely strong. The kingdom, which sometimes is called the "home of Islam",&lt;ref name=bradley-expo-145&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=John R.|title=Saudi Arabia Exposed : Inside a Kingdom in Crisis|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave

The official title of the [[King of Saudi Arabia]] is "[[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]]"—the two being [[Al-Masjid al-Haram]] in Mecca and [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] in Medina—which are considered the holiest in Islam.&lt;ref name=nyrob-only&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unloved in Arabia (Book Review)|last=Rodenbeck|first=Max|journal=The New York Review of Books|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17477|volume=51 |number=16 |date=October 21, 2004|quote=This is, after all, the birthplace of Muhammad and of the Arabic language, the locus of Muslim holy cities, the root of tribal Arab trees, and also, historically, a last redoubt against foreign incursions into Arab and Muslim lands. The kingdom is in many ways a unique experiment. It is the only modern Muslim state to have been created by jihad,[10] the only one to claim the Koran as its constitution, and [the only Arab-]Muslim countries to have escaped European imperialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, a pact between Islamic preacher [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] and a regional emir, [[Muhammad bin Saud]], brought a fiercely puritanical strain of [[Sunni Islam]] first to the [[Najd]] region and then to the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Referred to by supporters as "[[Salafism]]" and by others as "[[Wahhabism]]", this interpretation of Islam became the state religion and interpretation of Islam espoused by Muhammad bin Saud and his successors (the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] family), who eventually created the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.  The Saudi government has spent tens of billions of dollars of its petroleum export revenue throughout the Islamic world and elsewhere on building mosques, publishing books, giving scholarships and fellowships,&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles (2002). ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam''. trans. Anthony F. Roberts, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; hosting international Islamic organisations, and promoting its form of Islam, sometimes referred to as "petro-Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kepel|2002|pp=69–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether Salafis/Wahhabis are a majority in Saudi Arabia is disputed, with one estimate putting their number at only 22.9% of the native population (concentrated in Najd).&lt;ref name=demo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/GulfReligionGeneral_lg.png|title=Demography of Religion in the Gulf|work=[[Mehrdad Izady]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wahhabi mission has been dominant in [[Najd]] for two hundred years, but in most other parts of the country—Hejaz, the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], [[Najran]]—it has dominated only since 1913-1925.&lt;ref name=commins-77&gt;{{cite book|last=Commins |first=David |title=The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2009 |page=77|quote=The region had been part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries and consequently its religious culture was pluralistic, with the four Sunni legal schools, various Sufi orders and a tiny Shia community around Medina. ...

Proselytizing by non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia, including the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials (such as the [[Bible]]), is illegal.

==History==
{{See also|History of Saudi Arabia}}
The [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], was born in [[Mecca]] in about 571. From the early 7th century, Muhammad united the [[Tribes of Arabia|various tribes of the peninsula]] and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]]. Although Arabia soon became a politically peripheral region as the focus shifted to the [[Caliphate|more developed conquered lands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Daily life in the medieval Islamic world |last=Lindsay |first=James E. |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32270-8 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mecca and [[Medina]] remained the spiritually most important places in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Qur'an]] requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the [[five pillars of Islam]], to make a pilgrimage, or [[Hajj]], to [[Mecca]] during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] at least once in his or her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Caesar (1994). Islam: Beliefs and Observances (5th ed.), pp.145–147 {{ISBN|978-0-8120-1853-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th century, a number of Shia sects developed particularly in the eastern part of Arabia. These included the [[Qarmatians]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] sect led by [[Abū-Tāhir Al-Jannābī]] who attacked and sacked Mecca in 930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0832430.html |title=Mecca |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Saud and ibn Abd al-Wahhab===
In 1744, in the desert region of [[Nejd]], [[Muhammad bin Saud]], founder of the Al Saud dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The history of Saudi Arabia |last=Bowen |first=Wayne H. |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-313-34012-3 |pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was the founder of the [[Wahhabi]] movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Religions: A World Guide |last=Harris |first=Ian |author2=Mews, Stuart |author3=Morris, Paul |author4= Shepherd, John  |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-582-08695-1 |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of Islam in the Middle East |last=Faksh |first=Mahmud A. |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-275-95128-3 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first "Saudi state" established in 1744 in the area around [[Riyadh]], rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/art/nypost-dg6apr03.htm "Reining in Riyadh"] by D. Gold, 6 April 2003, NYpost (JCPA)&lt;/ref&gt; but was destroyed by 1818 by the Ottoman viceroy of [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam]". Library of Congress Country Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, a much smaller second "Saudi state", located mainly in Nejd, was established in 1824, but by 1891 its Al Saud rulers were driven into exile in Kuwait.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia |title=History of Arabia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, a third attempt was made to conquer this territory by another Al-Saud, Abdulaziz [[Ibn Saud]]. He gained the support of the [[Ikhwan]], a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by [[Sultan bin Najad|Sultan ibn Bijad]] and [[Faisal Al-Dawish]], which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam in Revolution: Fundamentalism in the Arab World |last=Dekmejian |first=R. Hrair |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-8156-2635-0 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured [[Al-Hasa|Hasa]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1913.

Ibn Saud defeated a rival ruling family and took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921.
By this time the Ottomans had been defeated in [[World War I]], and Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia was no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Arab Peoples |last=Hourani |first=Albert |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-571-22664-1 |pages=315–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Brief History of Saudi Arabia |last=Wynbrandt |first=James |author2=Gerges, Fawaz A. |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8160-7876-9 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this victory however the Ikhwan clashed with Ibn Saud. He opposed their raiding the British protectorates of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], Iraq and Kuwait, to expand of the Wahhabist realm, and they opposed his policies of allowing some modernization and some non-Muslim foreigners in the country.  The Ikhwan were defeated and their leaders executed in 1930 after a two-year struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Kingdom |last=Lacey |first=Robert |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-09-953905-6 |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the ''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;

=== Era of oil exports ===
Oil was discovered in the Persian Gulf region of Saudi Arabia in 1938, and oil wells eventually revealing the largest source of [[crude oil]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/80days/380303.html|work=Time|title=80 Days That Changed The World}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the king, oil revenues became a crucial source of wealth since he no longer had to rely on receipts from pilgrimages to [[Mecca]]. This discovery would alter [[Middle East]]ern political relations forever.

During the 1960s and '70s, religious authorities allowed some practices that had previously been forbidden (haram). At the urging of the government and after vigorous debate, religious authorities allowed the use of paper money in 1951, abolished slavery in 1962, permitted the education of females in 1964, and use of television in 1965.&lt;ref name=rodenbeck&gt;{{cite journal|url=  http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/oct/21/unloved-in-arabia-2/?pagination=false |title=Unloved in Arabia |author=Max Rodenbeck|journal=New York Review of Books|date=October 21, 2004| volume=51|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, as a result of oil wealth and government modernization policies, economic and social development progressed at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country;&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed.&lt;ref name="Al-Rasheed 136-137"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Saudi Arabia |last=Al-Rasheed |first=Madawi |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-74754-7 |pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By 1976 Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Resources Development in Saudi Arabia: Multinationals and Saudization |last=Viola |first=Joy Winkie |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-88746-070-8 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power of the ulema was in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia in the oil era: regime and elites: conflict and collaboration|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|year=1987|isbn=978-0-7099-5129-2|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, this trend was reversed.  In 1979, the modernizing monarch of Iran,  despite his oil revenues and apparently formidable security apparatus, was overthrown by an [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]].&lt;ref name=lacey-islamism&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom : Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia|year=2009|publisher=Viking|page=47|quote=An apparently impregnable, westernizing autocrat, smiled on by America, with a huge army, an efficient secret police, and burgeoning oil revenues, had been brought down without a serious shot being fired -- all the Shah's modernization had proved helpless against the supposedly outmoded power of religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The new revolutionary Islamic Republic was across the Persian Gulf from Saudi oil fields and across from where most of Saudi Arabia's [[Shia Islam in Saudi Arabia|minority Shiites]]—co-religionists of Iran who also often worked in the oil industry—lived.  There were several anti-government uprisings in the region in [[1979 Qatif Uprising|1979 and 1980]].

Also alarming to the government was the [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists]].&lt;ref name= Abir21&gt;{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia: government, society, and the Gulf crisis|last=Abir |first=Mordechai|year=1993|isbn=978-0-415-09325-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government, proclaimed the return of the [[Mahdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Desert Kingdom: How Oil and Water Forged Modern Saudi Arabia |last=Jones |first=Toby Craig |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-674-04985-7 |pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The takeover and siege of the mosque lasted for nearly two weeks, during which the mosque was severely damaged and several hundred militants, soldiers, and hostages were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=House, Karen Elliott|title=On Saudi Arabia : Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future| publisher=Knopf|year=2012|page=20|quote=This incident [Mecca Grand Mosque takeover which lasted] for nearly two weeks, severely damaging the mosque  ... claimed at least 1000 lives.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response the royal family enforced much stricter observances of traditional religious and social norms in the country and gave the [[Ulema]] a greater role in government.&lt;ref name= Hegghammer24&gt;{{cite book |title=Jihad in Saudi Arabia: Violence and Pan-Islamism Since 1979 |last=Hegghammer |first=Thomas |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-73236-9 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First photographs of women in newspapers were banned, then women on television. Cinemas and music shops were shut down. School curriculum was changed to provide many more hours of religious studies, eliminating classes on subjects like non-Islamic history.&lt;ref name= Abir21/&gt; Gender segregation was extended "to the humblest coffee shop". The religious police became more assertive.&lt;ref name= Hegghammer24/&gt;&lt;ref name=lacey-&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom : Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia|year=2009|publisher=Viking|pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wahhabism===
{{Main|Wahhabism}}
{{See also|Salafi}}
Many of the strict and unique practices in Saudi Arabia mentioned above come from Wahhabism, the official and dominant form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia, named after the preacher and scholar [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]].  Proponents consider the name derogatory, preferring the term [[Salafism|Salafiyya]], after the early Muslims known as the [[Salaf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=121904#axzz17dQMsZEu The Daily Star] Lamine Chikhi. 27 11 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is often described as 'puritanical', 'intolerant' or 'ultra-conservative', however proponents believe its teachings seek to purify the practise of Islam of any innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh-century teachings of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and his companions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21695.pdf 'The Islamic Traditions of Wahhabism and Salafiyya'], US Congressional Research Service Report, 2008, by Christopher M. Blanchard available from the Federation of American Scientists website.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one anti-Wahhabi source ([[Stephen Suleyman Schwartz|Stephen Schwartz]]), "no more than" 40% of Saudi nationals consider themselves Wahhabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/immigration/schwartz.htm|title=Q&amp;A with Stephen Schwartz on Wahhabism on National Review Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The message of the school was the essential oneness of God (''tawhid''). The movement is therefore known by its adherents as ''ad dawa lil tawhid'' (the call to unity), and those who follow the call are known as ''ahl at tawhid'' (the people of unity) or ''muwahhidun'' (unitarians).&lt;ref name=LofC&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia.

In the 1990s, Saudi leadership did not emphasize its identity as inheritor of the Wahhabi legacy as such, nor did the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, the Al ash Shaykh, continue to hold the highest posts in the religious bureaucracy. Wahhabi influence in Saudi Arabia, however, remained tangible in the physical conformity in dress, in public deportment, and in public prayer. Most significantly, the Wahhabi legacy was manifest in the social ethos that presumed government responsibility for the collective moral ordering of society, from the behavior of individuals, to institutions, to businesses, to the government itself.&lt;ref name=LofC/&gt;

Local zoning rules even banned them from building dens or basement areas beneath their homes, for fear they might use them as secret husayniyas for subversive worship and for their alleged sexual congresses.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern provinces of Saudi Arabia there are Shia courts who deal with cases such as marriage, divorce and inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Arabia, Precarious Justice: Volume 20 - Page 133, Human Rights Watch - 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Shia demonstrations in Qatif have sometimes led to conflict with Sunni Saudi religious authorities who disapprove of Shia commemorations marking the [[Battle of Karbala|martyrdom]] of [[Hussein ibn Ali]] by the Sunni [[Umayyad Caliph|Caliph]] [[Yazid I]].

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main|Ahmadiyya in Saudi Arabia}}
[[Ahmadiyya]] is a small persecuted [[Islam]]ic cult in [[Saudi Arabia]]. There are "no accurate figures" for the number of Ahmadi in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="hrw2014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/05/15/saudi-arabia-2-years-behind-bars-apostasy-accusation | title=Saudi Arabia: 2 Years Behind Bars on Apostasy Accusation | date=May 15, 2014 | publisher= Human Rights Watch | accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadis are officially banned from entering the country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tuVhBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HnHzVPqLM8HOaNvugfgB&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The State as an Actor in Religion Policy: Policy Cycle and Governance | author=Maria Grazia Martino | accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are barred from performing the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]].

From the very early history of the Ahmadiyya Movement in the 19th century, Ahmadis have had contact with the region in what were then a number of [[Ottoman Arabia|Ottoman provinces]] in the Arabian peninsula, primarily due to their spiritual connection to the two holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The Hajj, or pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], occurs annually between the first and tenth days of the last month of the [[Islamic calendar|Muslim year]], Dhul Hajj. The Hajj represents the culmination of the Muslim's spiritual life. For many, it is a lifelong ambition. From the time of embarking on the journey to make the Hajj, pilgrims often experience a spirit of exaltation and excitement; the meeting of so many Muslims of all races, cultures, and stations in life in harmony and equality moves many people deeply. Certain rites of pilgrimage may be performed any time, and although meritorious, these constitute a lesser pilgrimage, known as [[umrah]].

[[Image:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]].]]
The Ministry of Pilgrimage Affairs and Religious Trusts handles the immense logistical and administrative problems generated by such a huge international gathering. The government issues special pilgrimage visas that permit the pilgrim to visit Mecca and to make the customary excursion to [[Medina]] to visit the Prophet's tomb. Care is taken to assure that pilgrims do not remain in the kingdom after the Hajj to search for work.

An elaborate guild of specialists assists the Hajjis. Guides (mutawwifs) who speak the pilgrim's language make the necessary arrangements in Mecca and instruct the pilgrim in the proper performance of rituals; assistants (wakils) provide subsidiary services. Separate groups of specialists take care of pilgrims in Medina and Jiddah. Water drawers (zamzamis) provide water drawn from the sacred well.

Since the late 1980s, the Saudis have been particularly energetic in catering to the needs of pilgrims. In 1988, a US$l5 billion traffic improvement scheme for the holy sites was launched. The improvement initiative resulted partly from [[Iran]]ian charges that the Saudi government was incompetent to guard the holy sites after a 1987 clash between demonstrating Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police left 400 people dead. A further disaster occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated or were crushed to death in one of the new air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels built to shield pilgrims from the heat. The incident resulted from the panic that erupted in the overcrowded and inadequately ventilated tunnel, and further fueled Iranian claims that the Saudis did not deserve to be in sole charge of the holy places. In 1992, however, 114,000 Iranian pilgrims, close to the usual level, participated in the Hajj.

==Islam and politics==
===Islamic legitimacy===
The religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, led by the [[Al ash-Sheikh]], which influences almost every aspect of social life, is deeply involved in politics. It has long been fractured into at least two distinct groups, with the senior ulema closely tied to the political agenda of the House of Saud. A younger generation of ulema, who are less firmly established and more radical in tone, have openly criticized the senior ulema and the government in the past.&lt;ref name="stratfor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stratfor.com/saudi_arabia_grand_mufti_defends_legitimacy |title=Saudi Arabia: Grand Mufti Defends Legitimacy|work=Stratfor}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Fractures between the government and this younger generation deepened in May 2003, when Riyadh fired or suspended thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stratfor.com/dissident_saudi_clerics_weaken_riyadh dead link&lt;/ref&gt; Many were to be "re-educated," while others were simply ousted from the religious establishment. The move did little to endear the government to an already frustrated and religiously radical cadre of clerics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Islamic Legitimacy of the modern Saudi state has been questioned by many groups and individuals including Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;Video: As-Sahab media, "Knowledge is for acting upon"&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia's grand [[mufti]], Sheikh [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh]], has defended the religious establishment's legitimacy in a public forum, while responding to mounting criticism of the religious leadership's close political alliance with the ruling House of Saud.&lt;ref name="stratfor.com"/&gt; During a question-and-answer session with members of the public and the media, Al Al-Sheikh denied that the government influenced fatwas (religious rulings) and said accusations to the contrary within the media were false:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Both the criticism and the public response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also among the public. It is significant that the question was asked and answered in a public forum, and then reprinted in the media -- including the Arabic and English language newspapers. Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom's religious, political and perhaps military leaderships becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.

That Al Al-Sheikh answered the question about government influence over fatwas so openly is a clear indicator that the public has growing concerns about the legitimacy of religious leaders. Also, that the statements were reprinted in the press signals that the Saudi government -- which wields enormous influence over the local press -- is moving to respond to the charges of undue influence and corruption and illegitimacy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--
Under Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]], the influence of government over religion has grown. According to scholar [[Khaled Abou El Fadl]], "hundreds of prominent" Saudi imams who have "shown even a modicum of resistance" have been imprisoned, including former imams of the Grand Mosque Sheikh Saleh al-Talib and Sheikh Bandar Bin Aziz Bilila.&lt;ref name="Misusing"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abou El Fadl |first1=Khaled M. |title=Saudi Arabia Is Misusing Mecca |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-mbs-grandmosque-mecca-politics.html |accessdate=15 November 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=12 November 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Islamist preacher [[Salman al-Ouda]] was arrested in September 2017 on 37 charges including "spreading discord and incitement against the ruler", and one year later prosecutors were reportedly seeking the death penalty for him.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia seeks death penalty for preacher Awdah - activists, family |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/saudi-arabia-seeks-death-penalty-for-preacher-awdah-activists-family-idUSKCN1LK1PE |accessdate=16 November 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=4 SEPTEMBER 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally the officially appointed imams who preach at the [[Great Mosque of Mecca]] have praised, sanctified and defended the rulers who appointed them, and in recent times they have been "watched with great reverence by millions of Muslims" via satellite.&lt;ref name="Misusing"/&gt;
However, on October 19 2018, in the wake of evidence that Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the [[Killing of Jamal Khashoggi|murder of of Jamal Khashoggi]],
Sheikh [[Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais], the officially appointed imam of the Grand Mosque and the highest religious authority in the kingdom, elevated this practice to new heights suggesting  Mohammed bin Salman was a [[mujaddid]] (a person sent by God once a century -- according to popular Muslim tradition -- to revive Islam), 
&lt;blockquote&gt; “The path of reform and modernization in this blessed land … through the care and attention from its young, ambitious, divinely inspired reformer crown prince, continues to blaze forward guided by his vision of innovation and insightful modernism, despite all the failed pressures and threats,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1590|title=Mujaddid - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and that  media rumors and innuendos of wrong doing by the prince were in fact conspiracies intended to destroy Islam.&lt;ref name="Misusing"/&gt;

'''''Juma and the Magic Jinn''''' is a children's [[picture book]] written by Joy Anderson and illustrated by [[Charles Mikolaycak]]. First published in 1986, this folktale with an African setting tells the story of a fictional, [[daydreaming]] boy named Juma who is living on the real [[Lamu Island]] just off the East coast of [[Kenya]]. Desiring to be some place where he won't have to study or behave, Juma seeks the help of a magical [[Genie|jinn]] (in English, a genie), a decision which leads Juma on misadventures. In the same year the book was published, ''Juma and the Magic Jinn'' won a [[Golden Kite Award#1986|1986 Golden Kite Award]] for Mikolaycak's illustrations. These illustrations additionally played a role in Mikolaycak receiving the 1987 Kerland Award "in recognition of singular attainments in the creation of children's literature."

==Plot==
[[File:Lamu coast.jpg|thumb|left|180px|View of the seaside on [[Lamu Island]]]]
On the [[seafaring]] Lamu Island, families traditionally keep a jinn jar at home.&lt;ref name="choices"/&gt; The jinn jar is a container that holds a supernatural being in [[Islam]] and [[Arabian mythology]] called a [[Genie|jinn]] (in English, a genie).&lt;ref name="choices"/&gt; The jinn jar is kept sealed because the owners do not know if their magic jinn is good or evil, which makes people of Lamu Island generally afraid of the jinns.&lt;ref name="choices"/&gt;

The story opens with a young student named Juma [[daydreaming]] in a school instead of doing his mathematics.&lt;ref name="choices"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connecting"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Rebecca L.|year=1996|title=Connecting Cultures: A Guide to Multicultural Literature for Children|pages=12|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=0835237605|quote=|accessdate=7 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a9RySF9cawUC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Magic+jinn%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the young Juma concentrates more on his own directions of thought rather than the lessons being taught, the teacher sends Juma home.&lt;ref name="choices"/&gt; On the way home, he comes across his mother buying fish at the shore.&lt;ref name="Juma"/&gt; His mother admonishes his daydreaming in school and suggests that Juma may be better off working with his father to cut [[Mangrove|mangrove poles]].&lt;ref name="Juma"/&gt; She instruction Juma to go home, but instructs Juma to not touch the jinn jar.&lt;ref name="Juma"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19118">'''Keren Cytter''' (born 22 August 1977) is an Israeli visual artist and writer.

==Biography==
Cytter, born [[22 August]] 1977, spent her childhood in Israel and went on to study visual arts at the [[Avni Institute of Art and Design]], [[Tel Aviv]].  After finding success in various galleries in her home country, she moved to Amsterdam on a scholarship from [[De Ateliers]] where she studied with [[Willem de Rooij]] and [[Marlene Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogagallery.com/Artists/keren-cytter/About.html ''Keren Cytter biography'']. Noga Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Her scope of work includes film, video installations, performance, drawings and photography. She is also a writer of novels, theatre plays and poetry.

==Work==

===Video Art===
Cytter is best known for her textually based video art. Her narratives, although extremely fragmented, have a tendency to embody the [[post-modern]] self-awareness of the characters in her films. Through the development and execution of Cytter's unique style, she has found herself a niche in the art world which has brought her more and more critical attention and made her one of the most renowned artists of her generation.

After graduating from De ateliers in Amsterdam, Cytter made several works which went on to be shown internationally including ''The Date Series'' (2004, a series of short narratives written, filmed and produced in the period of one year), ''The Victim'' (2006), ''Repulsion'' (2005, based on [[Polanski]]'s [[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]),  and ''The Milk Man'' (2003). Among her most famous work is ''Der Spiegel'' from 2007. In just one long shot she stages a Shakespearean drama in a stripped contemporary Berlin apartment in which a middle-aged woman is forced to confront the realities of her fading sexual attractiveness by a sadistic pair of younger women. ''Four Seasons'' (2009) is another example of essential Cytter: the absurdist low-fi mixture of a variety of film genres, from [[Film noir]] to [[Melodrama]], culminates in the iconic shot of a burning Christmas tree set to the dramatic music of [[Ferrante &amp; Teicher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://schauort.com/cytter-four-seasons.htm ''Keren Cytter - Four Seasons'']. Schau Ort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance and Theatre===
In 2008 Cytter formed a dance company called D.I.E NOW (Dance International Europe Now) consisting of 5 non-professional dancers. Their first production ''History in the Making - The True Story of John Webber'', which was based on a wide range of influences including [[Pina Bausch]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Disney on Ice]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Yvonne Rainer]] and the 1980s dance-floor filler [[Lambada]], went on an international tour and was presented in [[Tate Modern]]'s [[Turbine Hall]] in London, [[The Kitchen]] in New York City, Tramway in Glasgow and [[Hebbel am Ufer]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moussemagazine.it/articolo.mm?id=487 ''Keren Cytter on D.I.E NOW''] Mousse Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textezurkunst.de/daily/2010/mar/05/christine-regus-uber-keren-cytter-im-hau-berlin/ ''Keren Cytter at HAU Berlin''] Texte zur Kunst&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year the British magazine [[Art Review]] ran a cover story on her entitled "I just wanted to attract attention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1256764/Texts/Cytter_Art%20Review_April09.pdf ''Keren Cytter Portrait ''] Art Review&lt;/ref&gt;

She initiated her foundation APE - ''art projects era'' together with Dutch curator Maaike Gouwenberg in 2010. The aim of the organization is to develop projects (performances, exhibitions, printed matter, meetings) that cannot necessarily be realized within traditional institutional formats or frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprojectsera.org/about ''About APE'']. art projects era&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year she wrote and directed the play ''Show Real Drama'', produced by APE and partly based on the lives of its two actors, Susanne Meyer and [[Fabian Stumm]]. In the piece, which uses videos and repetitive dialogue and movements creating a fractured yet empathetic storyline, they are struggling with the demanding entertainment business while their relationship is slowly falling apart. The production met with great success, the [[Houston Chronicle]] calling it "intriguing (...) something deconstructionist architect [[Frank Gehry]] might conjure if he were a playwright; a story pulled apart at the seams then re-configured with cool wit and 21st-century angst." As of 2014, the play has been performed all around the world from London, New York City and Houston to Shanghai, Beijing and Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprojectsera.org/projects/show-real-drama ''Show Real Drama''] art projects era&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Show-Real-Drama-intrigues-at-DiverseWorks-3940661.php ''Show Real Drama Review''] Houston Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tip-berlin.de/kultur-und-freizeit-theater-und-buehne/kreative-der-krise ''Show Real Drama Review''] Tip Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010 her work was featured on the cover of the American Art Magazine [[Artforum]], which ran an extensive story on her body of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artiscontemporary.org/features_detail.php?id=116 ''True Lies - The Art of Keren Cytter''] Artis Contemporary/Artforum&lt;/ref&gt;

Her next play ''Anke is Gone'' or ''I Eat Pickles At Your Funeral'' opened in Berlin at [[Hebbel am Ufer]] in 2011 and was invited to the [[Images Festival]] Toronto in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesfestival.com/calendar.php?event_id=792&amp;month=n ''Keren Cytter''] Images Festival&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cytter collaborated with musicians Keira Fox, Charlie Feinstein and David Aird on ''Vociferous'', a fluid combination of musical concert, video work and performance which was presented at the ICA [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|Institute of Contemporary Art]], London. Adrian Searle wrote in his [[The Guardian]] review: "As a mix of live performance and video, the recent collaboration between [[Adam Curtis]] and [[Massive Attack]] at the [[Manchester International Festival]] set a standard. Vociferous is both more intimate, more alienating, and more of a mash-up (...) After a bit I gave up trying to follow anything like a story, if there was one, or to chase the projected imagery, which came and went intermittently, first on one screen, then another. I felt a bit of a berk, running through the crowd with a notebook, trying to keep up, like an undercover cop blowing my own cover. Towards the end, Fox and Feinstein take up the electronic drums, and Fox starts singing from a ragged sheet of lyrics, the music hitting such a pitch that my nostril-hairs start to vibrate in sympathy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/artist-keren-cytter-vociferous ''Keren Cytter's Vociferous''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent projects===
After six years in Berlin, Cytter relocated to New York City in 2012 where she initiated a quarterly publication focusing on art and poetry. Published by APE, it has so far featured Nora Schultz, John Kelsey and writings of Josef Strau, [[Matthew Dickman]], Roman Baembaev, Roger van Voorhees and Sylvia Mae Gorelick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprojectsera.org/publications/ ''Publications''] art projects era&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2013 solo exhibition at Pilar Corrias Gallery in London presented an ambitious new body of work called MOP (''Museum of Photography'') - a large archive of [[Polaroid film|Polaroid]] photographs documenting her life as she travelled from Berlin and London, to the United States and Israel from 2012 to 2013. Taken with her 1200i and One step 600 [[Polaroid camera]], the photographs are carefully categorised by geography and chronology and then arranged into sub-sections, titled A, B, C and D and so on, via their aesthetic. Images of friends, colleagues, curators she encountered, museums she worked in, landscapes she passed through, and her own performances are all featured. The collection consists of more than 800 polaroids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/3123/Keren_Cytter_and_her_800_Polaroids ''Keren Cytter and her 800 polaroids''] Another Mag&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
In addition to her video and performance work, Cytter is also a critically acclaimed writer. Next to her three novels ''The Man Who Climbed the Stairs of Life and Found Out They Were Cinema Seats'' (2005), ''The Seven Most Exciting Hours of Mr. Trier’s Life in Twenty-Four Chapters'' (2008) and ''The Amazing True Story of Moshe Klinberg – A Media Star'' (2009), she has published poems as well as excerpts of her diary called ''White Diaries'' in 2010. She also wrote the libretto for the [[chamber opera]] ''Le Voisin'' by Thomas Myrmel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nagel-draxler.de/artists/keren-cytter/ ''Keren Cytter Bibliography''] Nagel Draxler Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism_small}}

[[Hinduism]] is practiced and preached by many Hindu organisations, each of which follows the variants and perspectives of all or particular [[Hindu philosophy|philosophy]] propagated and transferred through generations by [[Hindu saints|saints]]. Hinduism may be more of a custom or tradition of that part of the world which the great epics of Hinduism are supposed to depict. Hinduism is based on the [[Vedas]], some of which are humanity's oldest inscriptions on life and spirituality. They differ on how to achieve life's ultimate goal – ''[[Jnana|Atma Jnana]]'' or self-realisation. Devotees can choose any path depending on their individual natures.

The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the [[Advent wreath]] is lit also indicates that [[Christmas]] has arrived.]]
'''Liturgical colours''' are those specific colours used for [[vestment]]s and [[Antependium|hangings]] within the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]]. The symbolism of [[violet (color)|violet]], white, green, red, gold, black, [[Rose (color)|rose]] and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the [[liturgical year]] or may highlight a special occasion.

There is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their [[choir dress]], which with a few exceptions does not change with the liturgical seasons.

==Roman Catholic Church==

===Current rubrics===
In the [[Roman Rite]], as reformed by [[Pope Paul VI]], the following colours are used.&lt;ref name=IGMR&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwlgrm.htm ''Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani''], no. 346; cf.

On more solemn days, i.e. festive, more precious, sacred vestments may be used, even if not of the colour of the day. Such vestments may, for instance, be made from [[cloth of gold]] or [[cloth of silver]]. Moreover, the Conference of Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations suited to the needs and culture of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.g&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour, in white, or in a festive colour. Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the season or in violet if they bear a penitential character. Votive Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the colour proper to the day or the season.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 347&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional and situational exceptions ====
Some particular variations:
*{{Color sample|#6495ed}} '''[[Marian blue|Blue]]''', a colour associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], is permitted for the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in [[Spain]] and in some dioceses in [[Portugal]], [[Mexico]], and [[South America]]. In the [[Philippines]], it is authorised for all feasts of the Virgin Mary, a practice followed in some other places without official warrant. There have also been uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent despite the fact that this practice is not authorized under liturgical law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canticanova.com/articles/xmas/art1c1.htm Cantica Nova Publications], ''Advent Blues'', editorial by Gary D. Penkala, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Color sample|white}} '''White''' or {{Color sample|#d4af37}} '''[[cloth of gold]]''' was traditionally used for [[Misa de Gallo|the Novena]] from 16 to 24 December according to a Spanish custom abolished in that country in the 1950s, but still widely observed in the [[Philippines]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. White is also used for East Asian Masses for the dead, as white is the traditional colour of mourning in many of the region's cultures. Furthermore, if not enough vestments of the proper colour are available (particularly in [[concelebration]]s), white may be used for all concelebrants.
*{{Color sample|#7f00ff}} '''Violet''' or {{Color sample|black}} '''black''' are often permitted on national holidays honoring military dead. For example in Canada, they are used on [[Remembrance Day]].
*{{Color sample|gold}} '''Gold''' or {{Color sample|silver}} '''silver''' may be worn on more solemn occasions in the dioceses of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.h in publications for use in the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-1969 rubrics===
The [[Roman Missal]], as revised by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962, was authorised for use as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by the 2007 ''[[motu proprio]]'' entitled ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Pope John XXIII's revision of the Missal incorporated changes that he had made with his ''motu proprio'' ''Rubricarum instructum'' of 29 July 1960;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'' 1962 in PDF Format]&lt;/ref&gt; these changes went into effect on January 1, 1961. The following are the differences between its rules for liturgical colours and the later rules:

[[Pope Pius X]] raised the rank of Sundays of ordinary time, so that on those that fell within octaves '''green''' was used instead of the colour of the octave, as had previously been the rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Rubricae generales Missalis: XVIII – De Coloribus Paramentorum'' in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition] of the Roman Missal omitted the phrase "exceptis Dominicis infra octavas occurrentibus, in quibus color octavarum servatur" found in earlier editions beginning with Pope Pius V's edition of 1570 (page 21 of the facsimile published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 1998 – {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on liturgical colours before the time of Pope Pius X were essentially those indicated in the edition of the Roman Missal that [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated in 1570, except for the addition of feasts not included in his Missal. The scheme of colours in his Missal reflected usage that had become fixed in Rome by the twelfth century.

==Byzantine Rite==
The [[Byzantine Rite]], which is used by all the member churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism|Byzantine Lutheran Churches]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of Byzantine Rite, does not have a universal system of colours, with the service-books of the Byzantine tradition only specifying "light" or "dark" vestments in the service books. In the Greek tradition, [[Maroon (colour)|maroon]] or [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] are common for solemn feast days, and a wide variety of colours are used at other times, the most common of which are gold and white.

Slavic-use churches and others influenced by Western traditions have adopted a cycle of liturgical colours.  The particulars may change from place to place, but generally:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"

||
*Churches dedicated to the Theotokos may use light blue for the default, instead of gold.
*In some places, blue is also used for [[Baptism of Jesus|Holy Theophany]].
*In many places, blue is used for the Dormition Fast (except from the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] to its afterfeast (August 6–13), when either gold or white is used).
|-

||

*Pascha
*[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]
*[[Theophany]]
*Other [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord
||
*Funerals (Throughout the year, even during Holy Week.)
|}

The colours would be changed before [[Vespers]] on the eve of the day being commemorated.  During Great Feasts, the colour is changed before the vespers service that begins the first day of a [[forefeast]], and remains until the apodosis (final day of the [[afterfeast]]).

Under Western influence, black is often used in the Slavic churches for funerals, weekdays of Great Lent, and Holy Week as a sign of [[penance]] and mourning, but in the second half of the 20th century, the ancient white became more common, as a sign of the hope of the Resurrection.

==Russian liturgical colours==

According to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s ''Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia, Volume 4, Moscow,1983, Translated in "The Messenger" of St. Andrew's Russian Orthodox Cathedral,Philadelphia, June, July–August, September, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; up to eight different liturgical colours may be used throughout the year.  Exact usage of these colours varies, but the following are the most common uses.

==Coptic Rite==
The [[Copts|Coptic]] tradition, followed by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], only uses white vestments, with gold and silver being considered variations of white. The only exception is during [[Passion Week]] when black is used. Nonetheless, trimmings of red, gold or blue may be found on some vestments.

==Ethiopian Rite==
The liturgical tradition of Ethiopia, followed by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]], embraces a wide variety of liturgical colours. In [[Eritrea]], similar traditions are followed.

==Lutheran churches==
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), uses the same colour scheme as that of the Anglicans and their Scandinavian Lutheran counterparts, but with the use of gold only for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday services, with Holy Week using scarlet in place of crimson.

Both the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) use a similar system, but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent (with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only), and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter (in similar practice to the Catholic Church).  In the WELS, the use of red is also done during the ''Period of End Times'', a period of the Church regarding the teachings of the Book of Revelation, culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem (corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA). In all three churches, including the ELCA, red is also worn on the last Sunday of October, in celebration of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] on October 31, when [[Martin Luther]] nailed the [[95 Theses]] onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church.

==Anglicanism==
[[Image:Lenten Array Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|Lenten Array altar frontal by [[George Pace]] at [[St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston|St Augustine's, Edgbaston]]]]
Most [[Anglican]] churches use the colours appointed in the Roman Rite, usually in its post-1969 form, with the exception of Sarum Blue replacing violet for Advent, but some use the earlier form, with, for instance, black in place of red on [[Good Friday]]. Some churches use black at Masses for the dead, but more commonly white or purple is used. For historical reasons much of the worldwide Anglican Communion takes a noticeable lead from the practice of the [[Church of England]]. Since the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]], liturgical colours have been recommended for seasons, with more detailed advice offered as part of the [[Common Worship]] series of liturgies, including colours for all Sundays and festivals printed in the 'core volume' next to collects.

The Church's published Lectionary now makes detailed suggestions for liturgical colour throughout the year, which corresponds almost exactly with the above table of Roman Rite (post-1969 usage) usage with five minor exceptions, and one more significant one:

:* there is no reference in Anglican usage to Masses of deceased popes and cardinals;
:* no liturgical colour at all is suggested for [[Holy Saturday]] (the words "hangings removed" are printed);
:* the recommendation of red for confirmation rites is extended also to ordination rites;
:* Lenten Array (unbleached linen) continues to be listed as an alternative option to purple during Lent;
:* the option exists for using red instead of green during the "Kingdom Season", the four last Sundays of the liturgical year, culminating in [[Christ the King]], as is common is some Lutheran traditions (see below);
:* finally, and more significantly, the Church of England provision suggests white throughout the Sundays after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] as a distinct "Epiphany season", with ordinary time commencing the day after [[Candlemas]].

The colour scheme suggested by the [[Church of England]] also indicates where gold vestments should be used in those churches that possess gold and white as distinct colours. The use of rose-pink vestments, as in the Roman Rite table above, was mentioned as an option in early editions of Common Worship,&lt;ref&gt;The use of rose-pink vestments is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of [[Common Worship]] of which an [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/rules/rulesyear.html on-line version may be found here].&lt;/ref&gt; and is a listed option in the annual published lectionary; however, later Common Worship publications have begun to refer to this practice as "traditional" reflecting its resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see "Common Worship - Times &amp; Seasons", added to the Common Worship series in 2006, page 50, paragraph 1: "rose-pink vestments are traditionally worn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarum Rite===
The [[Sarum Rite]] was a medieval liturgical rite used in [[England]] before the [[Reformation]] which had a distinct set of liturgical colours. After the [[Anglo-Catholic]] Revival of the 19th century, certain [[Church of England]] churches began adopting Sarum liturgical colours as an attempt to produce something that was an English expression of [[Catholicism]] rather than a Roman expression. One of the chief advocates behind this was [[Percy Dearmer]]. The exact colours used by the mediaeval Sarum rite are a matter of dispute, but colours adopted by contemporary churches claiming to use the Sarum scheme include in particular deep blue for [[Advent]], which may be popularly referred to as "Sarum blue", and unbleached linen for [[Lent]]. The Sarum rite has never received official approval in the [[Church of England]] or in [[The Episcopal Church]], but has influenced a number of cathedrals and parish churches.

==Methodist churches==
[[Methodism|Methodists]] use a colour scheme similar to those used by Lutherans and Catholics, although the practice is not universally followed. [[The United Methodist Church]], prior to the early-1990s, used red solely for Pentecost, even including the Sundays after Pentecost Sunday, with the use of green being reserved for the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which usually lasted from late August/early September until Christ the King (the last Sunday in Kingdomtide). Since the publication of the [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|1992 Book of Worship]], the UMC has followed the ELCA practice of wearing red only for Pentecost and [[Reformation Sunday]] and green for the rest of the Pentecost season.

==Reformed churches==
The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] has sanctioned the use of liturgical colours and promoted their use in the 1993 Book of Common Worship (although their use was also promoted in the church's annual Planning Calendars beginning in the 1980s). Advent and Lent are periods of preparation and repentance and are represented by the colour purple. The feasts of Christmas Day and Christmastide, Epiphany Sunday, Baptism of the Lord Sunday, Transfiguration Sunday, Easter Season, Trinity Sunday, and Christ the King Sunday are represented by white. Green is the colour for periods of Ordinary Time. Red is for Pentecost Sunday, but may also be used for ordinations, church anniversaries, and memorial services for ordained clergy. Red or purple are appropriate for Palm Sunday. During Holy Week, the church may use purple or remain bare (although a few churches will use black for Good Friday).

Similarly, the [[United Church of Christ]] includes indications of which liturgical colour to use for each Sunday in its annual calendar. The general Western pattern is followed, with either purple or blue recommended for Advent.&lt;ref&gt;''United Church of Christ Desk Calendar and Plan Book 2016,'' http://www.uccresources.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loren Me’-lash-ne Bommelyn''' (born 1956) is a tradition bearer for the [[Tolowa]] tribe. He has dedicated himself to preserving the traditional songs, language, and [[basket]]ry. He is the foremost ceremonial leader of the tribe, and its most prolific [[Basket weaving|basketweaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/fellow.php?id=2002_02 |title=LOREN BOMMELYN, Tolowa tradition bearer |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work= |publisher= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bommelyn is an enrolled member of the [[Federally recognized tribe|federally recognized]] [[Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation]] and was elected as their tribal Chairperson.&lt;ref name=srr/&gt;

==Work in linguistics and education==
Loren Bommelyn is Tolowa, [[Karuk]], and Wintu. His mother, [[Eunice Bommelyn]], was a prominent tribal [[genealogist]], Tolowa language proponent and cultural advocate.&lt;ref name=dnt&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam |last=Spencer |title=Tolowa mourn loss of a leader: Eunice Bommelyn |url=http://www.triplicate.com/News/Local-News/Family-%E2%80%9CShes-like-the-sun%E2%80%9D |work=[[Del Norte Triplicate]] |date=2012-04-28|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fluent speaker of the [[Tolowa language]] and taught for many years at [[Del Norte High School (Crescent City, California)|Del Norte High School]] in [[Crescent City, California]].&lt;ref name=bb&gt;Bibby, Brian. ''The Fine Art of California Indian Basketry.'' Sacramento: Crocker Art Museum, 1996: 51-52. {{ISBN|0-930588-87-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his master's degree in Linguistics from the [[University of Oregon]]. After years of studying with Tolowa elders, Bommelyn has published educational material about the Tolowa language. He played a role in convincing the [[University of California]] system accept Native American languages as part of its entrance requirements for world language. He has advocated the use of the Tolowa language in modern technology, including [[Facebook]] and [[texting]].&lt;ref name=dnt/&gt;

Bommelyn before retirement helped establish taughtT at Taa-'at-dvn Indian Magnet Charter School in Crescent City, with his wife, Lena Bommelyn who has retired from now. Of his work at Taa-'at-dvn, Loren says, "It's important for students to know they can move about freely in American society and that they can be open and successful. We try to provide them opportunities for expansion and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cta.org/media/publications/educator/archives/2005/200512_cal_ed_feature02.htm Native focus draw students to Tah-Ah-Dun.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070420152512/http://www.cta.org/media/publications/educator/archives/2005/200512_cal_ed_feature02.htm |date=2007-04-20 }} ''California Teachers Association.'' 2009 (retrieved 8 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, Bommelyn's son, Pyuwa Bommelyn, is studying [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Oregon]] to continue Tolowa language preservation efforts.&lt;ref name=dnt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketry==
While women make most baskets among Northern California tribes, men traditionally weave open-work baskets with entire plant shoots. This requires both extreme physical strength and dexterity. Bommelyn specializes in these open-work, utilitarian baskets, especially those made with hazel shoots. He wove his first basket at the age of 12. Today he is known particularly for his work baskets and baby cradles.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

''There's a fancy part of the basket and a realistic part. You want to strive for perfection, but at the same time you want to make it for a function... I want my baskets to be used. The old Indians say that things like to be used, that when they aren't used they get lonesome.''&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

==Awards==
Bommelyn is a recipient of a 2002 [[National Heritage Fellowship]] awarded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/2002 |title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships 2002 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recognized for his work in preserving, practicing and promoting of [[Tolowa]] cultural traditions "including its language, native regalia, ceremonial dances and songs, and basketmaking.... He is today the single most knowledgeable individual of the indigenous language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/loren-bommelyn |title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships: Loren Bommelyn |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; ||website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">'''Malachi ben Jacob ha-Kohen''' (also known as the '''Yad Malachi''') (1695/1700? – 1772) was a renowned [[Talmud]]ist, [[methodologist]], and one of the greatest [[Kaballist]]s of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's introduction to 'Yad Malachi', New York, 2001 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He was a student of the famous kabbalist Rabbi Joseph Ergas, author of the original kabbalistic text known as ''Shomer Emunim''. Born in Livorno sometime between 1695 and 1700, he passed on in the year 1772&lt;ref&gt;Although Rabbi Malachi's date of passing has widely been considered to be unknown, Rabbi Ovadia ben Avraham Halevi, eulogizing Malachi in his work ''Chazon Ovadia'' par. Nitzavim (printed in Livorno 1787) lists the date as 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered the last of the great rabbinical authorities of [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's introduction to 'Yad Malachi', ''Mishor'' New York, 2001 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Praised effusively by his contemporaries and quoted frequently by major [[halakhic]] authorities of the 18th and 19th centuries, he served as Rabbi of [[Livorno]], Italy, and apparently lived to an old age. A decision by him, dated Nisan, 1732, and referring to a civil case at Rome, is included in the responsa of Rabbi [[Isaiah Bassani]] of Reggio (''Todat Shelamim'', No. 11, 1741). During the controversy between [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] and [[Jacob Emden]] he sided with the former (letter of the rabbinate of Leghorn in "Luḥot 'Edut," p.&amp;nbsp;22). 

He is most famous for his ''Yad Mal'aki'' (1766-7), a methodological work and compilation in three parts: part one contains an alphabetical list of all the rules and technical terms found in the [[Talmud]], with explanations; part two deals with rules regarding the codifiers; part three deals with the rules relating to legal decisions, explaining certain general principles of legal [[responsa]]. Malachi wrote also a liturgical work, ''Shibḥe Todah'' (1744), containing prayers for the 22d of Shebaṭ, a fast-day instituted by the community of Leghorn. In addition to these, Malachi also wrote a ''Sefer Torah'' in his own hand which then became an authoritative reference for many details regarding the correct formation of various Hebrew letters.&lt;ref&gt;'''Hayim Palaggi''' in Chaim Bayad ch. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yad Malachi==
His major work, the 'Yad Malachi', first printed in Livorno (1766),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=מלאכי בן יעקב, הכהן |url=http://hebrewbooks.org/32530 |title=Sefer Detail: יד מלאכי - חלק א - מלאכי בן יעקב, הכהן |publisher=Hebrewbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later Berlin (1857), was praised by his contemporaries as well as halakhic authorities of later generations. Rabbi Yitzchak Shmelkes wrote that:
"Every reader of this book will be amazed by the way this living lion, the high priest.....dives in the mighty waters, the sea of the Talmud. No secret is hidden from him",&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yitzchak Shmelkes, author of 'Beis Yitzchok' in his approbation to the third edition, Premysl, 1877&lt;/ref&gt; while Rabbi [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai]] (the 'Chida') wrote:
"And after much time, the sun shone upon the land.... with the precious book 'Yad Malachi', and as the eyes of servants to the hand of their masters, I have raised my eyes and seen..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Azulai]], ''Ayin Zocher'' sec.7&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Yad Malachi' was printed again in the late 20th century, and a new edition with greatly improved fonts, format, and biographical detail was printed in Israel in 2001.

A [[multiverse]] is the concept of a plurality of [[universe]]s. Some [[Religious cosmology|religious cosmologies]] propose that our universe is not the only one that exists.

== Buddhism ==
The concept of infinite worlds is mentioned in the Apannaka [[Jataka]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Disciples," the Buddha said "nowhere between the lowest of hells below and the highest heaven above, nowhere in all the '''infinite worlds''' that stretch right and left, is there the equal, much less the superior, of a Buddha. Incalculable is the excellence which springs from obeying the Precepts and from other virtuous conduct."'' - Apannaka Jataka &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Hinduism ==
{{Main|Hindu cosmology}}
The concept of [[multiverses]] is mentioned many times in Hindu [[Puranic]] literature, such as in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Every universe is covered by seven layers — earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego — each ten times greater than the previous one. There are '''innumerable universes''' besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited'' (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.37)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Every+universe+is+covered+by+seven+layers+%E2%80%94+earth,+water,+fire,+air,+sky,+the+total+energy+and+false+ego+%E2%80%94+each+ten+times+greater+than+the+previous+one.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCuvXbhL_UAhXHMo8KHciFC28Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Every%20universe%20is%20covered%20by%20seven%20layers%20%E2%80%94%20earth%2C%20water%2C%20fire%2C%20air%2C%20sky%2C%20the%20total%20energy%20and%20false%20ego%20%E2%80%94%20each%20ten%20times%20greater%20than%20the%20previous%20one.&amp;f=false|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=137|author=Bryan E.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Analogies to describe multiple universes also exist in the Puranic literature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The '''countless universes''', each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion'' (Bhagavata Purana 10.87.41) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fritz Jahr and the Foundations of Global Bioethics: The Future of Integrative Bioethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ndw2GXCy-IsC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=Because+You+are+unlimited,+neither+the+lords+of+heaven+nor+even+You+Yourself+can+ever+reach+the+end+of+Your+glories&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxmeashr_UAhVKrI8KHXbyC-cQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Because%20You%20are%20unlimited%2C%20neither%20the%20lords%20of%20heaven%20nor%20even%20You%20Yourself%20can%20ever%20reach%20the%20end%20of%20Your%20glories&amp;f=false|page=348|author=Amir Muzur, Hans-Martin Sass|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The layers or elements covering the '''universes''' are each ten times thicker than the one before, and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination'' (Bhagavata Purana 3.11.41)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrwxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=The+layers+of+elements+covering+the+universes+are+each+ten+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6psiwy7_UAhUEL48KHXJCCz4Q6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20layers%20of%20elements%20covering%20the%20universes%20are%20each%20ten%20times&amp;f=false|title=The Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition|page=60|author=Ravi M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''And who will search through the wide infinities of space to count the '''universes''' side by side, each containing its Brahma, its Vishnu, its Shiva? Who can count the Indras in them all--those Indras side by side, who reign at once in all the '''innumerable worlds'''; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line, ascending to godly kingship, one by one, and, one by one, passing away'' (Brahma Vaivarta Purana)

== Islam ==
{{main|Islamic cosmology}}
There are seven verses in the [[Quran]] describing [[seven heavens]]. One verse says that each heaven or sky has its own order, possibly meaning laws of nature. After mentioning the seven heavens, another verse says, "and similar earths". Examples include verse (67:3) "He (God) who created the seven tournaments (heavens) one imposed over the other..." The Quranic verse [[At-Talaq|65:12]] also states, "It is [[Allah]] who has created seven heavens and of the earth, the like of them." 
  
[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (1149–1209), in dealing with his [[Physics in medieval Islam|conception of physics]] and the physical world in his ''Matalib'', "explores the notion of the existence of a [[multiverse]] in the context of his commentary" on the [[Qur'an]]ic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds." He raises the question of whether the term "[[world]]s" in this verse refers to "multiple worlds within this single [[universe]] or [[cosmos]], or to many other universes or a multiverse beyond this known universe." In volume 4 of the ''Matalib'', Al-Razi states:&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is established by evidence that there exists beyond the world a void without a terminal limit (''khala' la nihayata laha''), and it is established as well by evidence that God Most High has power over all contingent beings (''al-mumkinat''). Therefore He the Most High has the power (''qadir'') to create a thousand thousand worlds (''alfa alfi 'awalim'') beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has of the throne (''al-arsh''), the chair (''al-kursiyy''), the heavens (''al-samawat'') and the earth (''al-ard''), and the sun (''al-shams'') and the moon (''al-qamar''). The arguments of the philosophers (''dala'il al-falasifah'') for establishing that the world is one are weak, flimsy arguments founded upon feeble premises.}}

Al-Razi rejected the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] view of the impossibility of multiple universes. He pointed out what he saw as weaknesses of the main Aristotelian arguments against the existence of multiple universes. His rejection arose from his affirmation of the [[atomism]] advocated by the [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Islamic theology]]. This version of atomism has specific views about the vacant space, or [[Vacuum|void]], in which the atoms move, combine and separate. He spoke of the "void" in greater detail in volume 5 of the ''Matalib''.&lt;ref name=Setia/&gt; He argued that God can fill the [[vacuum]] with an infinite number of universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=al-Razi, Fakhr al-Din (1149-1209)|work=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|author=John Cooper|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H044.htm|accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Arabi]] (1165-1240) held that, since God is endless, consequently there can be no end of created universes.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kabbalah ==
The concept of parallel worlds is also mentioned in [[Kabbalah]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wisdom of Kabbalah|publisher=Kabbalah International|url=http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/book_1/book1eng_les06.htm|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are five worlds between the Creator and our world. Each of them consists of five Partzufim and each Partzuf of five Sefirot. In total there are 125 levels between us and the Creator. Malchut, moving through all these levels, reaches the last one, and in this way, Behina Dalet, the only creation, merges with the four previous phases."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mormonism==
{{main|Mormon cosmology}}
Because [[Mormonism]] teaches that [[Jesus]] created the universe, yet his father, [[God the Father]], once dwelt upon an earth as a mortal, it may be interpreted that Mormonism teaches the existence of a multiverse, and it is not clear if the other inhabited worlds mentioned in LDS scripture and teachings refers to planets within this universe or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk D. Hagen, [http://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V39N02_13.pdf "Eternal Progression in a Multiverse: An Explorative Mormon Cosmology"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', vol. 39, no. 2 (Summer 2006) pp. 1–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of multiple universes has been entertained by [[Mormon]] leaders since its beginnings. [[Brigham Young]] taught there is no such thing as "empty space", lending to the idea that any space beyond this universe is occupied.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Orson Pratt]] said, "We can come to no other conclusion, but that worlds, and systems of worlds, and universes of worlds existed in the boundless heights and depths of immensity…".{{cite book |year=1851 |title=First Great Cause |url=https://archive.org/details/greatfirstcauseo02prat |page=5}} Pratt also taught, "Can we get away from it? No; for it fills all the intermediate spaces between world and world, between one system and another, and between universe and universe ... and there is no space in which there is no kingdom, and there is no kingdom in which there is no space" (Mar 14, 1875) (Journal of Discourses Volume 1 the Adam-God Revelation, chapters 12:6; 25:24; 126:7).{{full|date=December 2012}}

==New Age==
The philosopher and forerunner of the [[New Age]] movement [[P. D. Ouspensky]] stated in 1934: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Our mind follows the development of possibilities always in one direction only. But in fact every moment contains a very large number of possibilities. And all of them are actualised, only we do not see it and do not know it. We always see only one of the actualisations, and in this lie the poverty and limitation of the human mind. But if we try to imagine the actualisation of all the possibilities of the present moment, then of the next moment, and so on, we shall feel the world growing infinitely, incessantly multiplying by itself and becoming immeasurably rich and utterly unlike the flat and limited world we have pictured to ourselves up to this moment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P. D. |title=A New Model of the Universe: Principles of the Psychological Method in Its Application to Problems of Science, Religion and Art |year=1934 |edition=2nd |publisher=London: Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Afterlife==
Many religions include an [[afterlife]] existence in realms, such as [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, which may be very different from the observable universe.

[[Eschatological]] scenarios may include a new different world after the [[end time]] of the current one. For example, [[Hindu cosmology]] includes the idea of an infinite cycle of births and deaths and an infinite number of universes with each cycle lasting 8.64 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan]], Placido P D'Souza (1980s). [http://www.rediff.com/news/jan/29sagan.htm Hindu cosmology's time-scale for the universe is in consonance with modern science.]; Dick Teresi (2002). ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science&amp;nbsp;– from the Babylonians to the Maya.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Soufanieh''' refers to [[Marian apparition]]s reported to have occurred in Soufanieh, a suburb of [[Damascus]] in [[Syria]].

== History ==
The apparitions reportedly occurred in December 1982, and January, February and March 1983. A flow of oil from an image of the [[Virgin Mary]] (described as miraculous), as well as oozing of oil from the face and hands of Myrna Nazzour, is said by observers to have accompanied the apparitions.&lt;ref name="Santoro2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas J. Santoro|title=Mary in Our Life: Atlas of the Names and Titles of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and Their Place in Marian Devotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXWRgP-0KBkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=12 August 2011|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4620-4021-6|pages=507–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporter Brigid Keenan wrote that the oil ostensibly produced by Nazzour has been analyzed as "100 per cent olive oil", and that hundreds of people, including some doctors and psychiatrists, have witnessed Nazzour's secretions and failed to find evidence of trickery. According to her reports, Nazzour developed [[stigmata]] wounds in the "forehead, hands, feet and side", and the Virgin appeared to her outside her own home. Nazzour said the Virgin told her that "Christians should pray for peace, love one another and pray for the unity of the Christian churches."&lt;ref name=Keenan&gt;{{cite news|last=Keenan|first=Brigid|title=Myrna and the oil: an everyday miracle: How does a woman become a modern saint?

[[File:Cotton Claudius B VII f.224 Merlin Vortigern.jpg|thumb|Manuscript illustration, Merlin with [[Vortigern]], from the ''Prophetiæ Merlini''.]]

The '''''Prophetiæ Merlini''''' is a Latin work of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] circulated, perhaps as a ''libellus'' or short work,&lt;ref name="Barber1999"/&gt; from about 1130, and by 1135.&lt;ref name="Fulton2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Fulton|title=A Companion to Arthurian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqVxhFxzPFQC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=1 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-67237-2|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper-BillHouts2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Harper-Bill|author2=Elisabeth Van Houts|title=A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeBxpPmDh9QC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=9 May 2012|year=2007|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-1-84383-341-3|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name is '''''Libellus Merlini'''''.

The work contains a number of prophecies attributed to [[Merlin]], the wizard of legend, whose mythical life is often regarded as created by Geoffrey himself although Geoffrey himself claims to have based on older [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] traditions some of which may have been oral but now lost. The ''Prophetiae'' preceded Geoffrey's larger ''[[Historia Regum Britanniæ]]'' of c. 1136, and was mostly incorporated in it, in Book VII;&lt;ref name="LambdinLambdin2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Laura C. Lambdin|author2=Robert T. Lambdin|title=Arthurian Writers: A Biographical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LBFCZY-ml8C&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=9 May 2012|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34682-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prophecies, however, were influential and widely circulated in their own right. According to Geoffrey, he was prompted by [[Alexander of Lincoln]] to produce this section of his larger work separately.&lt;ref name="Kugel1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=James L. Kugel|title=Poetry and Prophecy: The Beginnings of a Literary Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkiXKniWwjoC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=9 May 2012|year=1990|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-9568-7|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''Prophetiæ'' is in some ways dependent on the ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniæ]]'' of [[Gildas]].&lt;ref name="Barber1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Richard Barber]]|title=Arthurian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VB_u9pTDa54C&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=18 March 1999|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85991-163-4|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Gildas and [[Nennius]] Geoffrey took the figure of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who figures in the preface to the prophecies (under a variant name): there is then a confusion made between Ambrosius and Merlin, deliberately done.&lt;ref name=Spence&gt;''Libellus Merlini'' in [[Lewis Spence]], ''A Dictionary of Medieval Romance and Romance Writers'' (1913), pp. 222–3; [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmedi00spenuoft#page/222/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Geoffrey's ''Historia'' was largely translated by Wace into the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', he omitted the material on Merlin's prophecies, though he does profess knowledge of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Blacker |first=Jean |title=Where Wace Feared to Tread: Latin Commentaries on Merlin's Prophecies in the Reign of Henry II |journal=Arthuriana |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=36-52}}, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; It was still read in Latin, but was displaced for readers in French, and then English, by other political prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lesley Ann Coote|title=Prophecy and Public Affairs in Later Medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqeRXxYyCQIC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=9 May 2012|year=2000|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-903153-03-1|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work not only launched Merlin as a character of Arthurian legend: it also created a genre of prophecy. A distinctively English style of political prophecy, which has been called ''Galfridian'', was created, in which animals represent particular political figures.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Taylor, ''The Political Prophecy in England'' (1911), pp. 4–5;[https://archive.org/stream/politicalprophe00taylgoog#page/n28/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Political prophecy in this style remained popular for at least 400 years. It was subversive, and the figure of the prophetic Merlin was strongly identified with it.&lt;ref name="Es2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart Van Es|title=Spenser's Forms of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HF3tM6vjHcC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=5 December 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-924970-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and the character of Merlin==
The ''Prophetiae'' is the work that introduced the character of Merlin (Merlinus), as he later appears in [[Arthurian legend]]. He mixes pagan and Christian elements.&lt;ref name="LambdinLambdin2008"/&gt; In this work Geoffrey drew from the established bardic tradition of prophetic writing attributed to the sage [[Myrddin]], though his knowledge of Myrddin's story at this stage in his career appears to have been slight.&lt;ref&gt;Ziolkowski, Jan (1990). "The Nature of Prophecy in Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Vita Merlini''", p. 152. In Kugel, James L. (Ed.), ''Poetry and Prophecy: the Beginnings of a Literary Tradition''. Cornell.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface [[Vortigern]] asks Ambrosius (Merlin) to interpret the meaning of a vision. In it two dragons fought, one red and one white. Merlin replies that the Red Dragon meant the British race, the White Dragon the [[Saxons]]. The Saxons would be victorious. A long prophetic sequence forms the body of the work, relating mainly to the wars.&lt;ref name=Spence/&gt;

Many of its prophecies referring to historical and political events up to Geoffrey's lifetime can be identified – for example, the sinking of the [[White Ship]] in 1120, when [[William III, Duke of Normandy|William Adelin]], son of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Geoffrey of Monmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey apparently introduced the spelling "Merlin", derived from the Welsh "{{lang|cy|Myrddin}}". The Welsh scholar [[Rachel Bromwich]] observed that this "change from medial ''dd'' &gt; ''l'' is curious. It was explained by [[Gaston Paris]] as caused by the undesirable associations of the French word ''[[shit|merde]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads'', second edition [Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978], p. 472 n.1.&lt;/ref&gt;. Alternatively this may preserve the Breton or Cornish original to which he may have been referring; [[John of Cornwall (theologian)|John of Cornwall]]'s (1141-55) version is notable for its localisation in the southwestern region known to Gildas &amp; Nennius as [[Dumnonia]].

==Influence==
The first work about the prophet Myrddin in a language other than [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the ''Prophetiae'' was widely read — and believed — much as the prophecies of [[Nostradamus]] were centuries later; John Jay Parry and Robert Caldwell note that the ''Prophetiae Merlini'' "were taken most seriously, even by the learned and worldly wise, in many nations", and list examples of this credulity as late as 1445.&lt;ref&gt;John Jay Parry and Robert Caldwell. "Geoffrey of Monmouth" in ''Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages'', Roger S. Loomis (ed.), Clarendon Press, Oxford University, 1959, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ordericus Vitalis]] quoted from the ''Prophetiae'' around 1134–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Siân Echard|title=Arthurian Narrative in the Latin Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0o1NX1VoO4cC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=10 September 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62126-7|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; At much the same time, and in the same area, [[Abbot Suger]] copied some of the prophecies almost exactly in his ''Life'' of [[Louis the Fat]], for the purpose of praising [[Henry I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindy Grant, ''Abbot Suger of St-Denis: Church and State in Early Twelfth-Century France'' (1998), p. 39 and p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1140s or early 1150s [[John of Cornwall (theologian)|John of Cornwall]] produced another work collecting prophecies, that drew on the ''Prophetiae''. It contained elements from other sources, however, which predominate.&lt;ref name="Rigg1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. G. Rigg|title=A History of Anglo-Latin Literature, 1066-1422|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90F_989nsCAC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=10 December 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41594-1|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was also named ''[[Prophecy of Merlin|Prophetiae Merlini]]''. [[Gunnlaugr Leifsson]] made an Icelandic translation of the prophecies, ''Merlinús spá''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harald Kittel|author2=[[Juliane House]]|author3=Brigitte Schultze|title=Übersetzung: Ein internationales Handbuch zur Übersetzungsforschung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD0dBqGDNscC&amp;pg=PA1362|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=30 December 2007|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017145-7|page=1362}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 15th-century English manuscript commentary on Geoffrey's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Ingham|title=Sovereign Fantasies: Arthurian Romance and the Making of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e2UYlzFkGcC&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=9 May 2012|year=2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-3600-2|pages=54–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the founding legends of British history came under strong criticism, in particular from [[Polydore Vergil]]. On the other hand, they had their defenders, and there was a revival of Arthurian lore with a Protestant slant, used in particular by [[John Dee]] to develop the concept of the [[British Empire]] in the New World. By the 17th century Geoffrey's history in general, and Merlin's prophecies in particular, had become largely discredited as fabrications, for example as attacked by [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'', pp. 507–8.&lt;/ref&gt; But the politics of the [[Union of the Crowns]] of 1603 gave the prophecies a short new lease of life (see [[Jacobean debate on the Union]]). ''The Whole Prophesie of Scotland'' of that year treated Merlin's prophecies as authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James P. Carley|author2=Felicity Riddy|title=Arthurian Literature XV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mh9Uw00jD6MC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=1 August 1997|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85991-518-2|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Maxwell (scholar)|James Maxwell]], a student of prophecy who put it to political use in the reign of [[James VI and I]], distinguished between the Welsh and "Caledonian" Merlins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger A.

This [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site, which was constructed some 2500 years ago, contains [[Relics associated with Buddha|relics]] of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO843&gt;{{cite web|author=[[UNESCO]]|title=Ramagrama, the relic stupa of Lord Buddha|work=Tentative Lists|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|location=Paris|year=2014|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/843/|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ancient india.png|right|thumb|The Malla Mahajanapada]]
Gautama Buddha's parents were from two different [[mahajanapada|mahājanapadās]] (kingdoms) of the [[Suryavansha|Solar dynasty]] — his father ([[Śuddhodana]]) belonged to the [[Shakya]] kingdom, while his mother ([[Maya (mother of Buddha)|Maya]]) was from the [[Koliya]] kingdom. According to [[Buddhist texts]], after Buddha's [[Parinirvana|Mahaparinirvana]], his cremated remains were divided and distributed among the princes of eight of the sixteen mahājanapadās. Each of the princes constructed a stupa at or near his capital city, within which the respective portion of the ashes was enshrined.&lt;ref name=Shrestha1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrestha|first=SS|title=Ramagrama excavation|journal=Ancient Nepal: Journal of the Department of Archaeology|volume=142|pages=1–12|year=1999|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_142_01.pdf|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These eight stupas were located at:

Some 300 years later, Emperor [[Ashoka]] opened seven of these stupas and removed the Buddha relics (his goal was to redistribute the relics into 84,000 stupas which he planned to construct throughout the [[Maurya Empire]]). According to legend, the [[Nāga|serpent king]] was guarding the Ramagrama stupa, and prevented Ashoka from unearthing the relic.

To this day, Ramagrama stupa remains the only intact and original stupa containing relics of Lord Buddha.&lt;ref name=UNESCO843/&gt; The stupa has been an object of great reverence and pilgrimage site since its original construction.

{{Culture of the Philippines}}

The nature of [[Religion in the Philippines|religion]] in the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-colonial Philippines]] is often unclear. Religions present include [[animism]], [[Indigenous religious beliefs of the Philippines|indigenous religious beliefs]] and [[Philippine mythology|mythologies]] such as [[Anito]] and influences from [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The earliest pieces of evidence that exist are [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds including Hindu–Buddhist gold statues. The earliest written evidence comes from the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], dated to around 900 CE, which uses the Buddhist–[[Hindu lunar calendar]]. With the arrival of [[Islam]] in the 14th century, the older religions gradually disappeared, and after the arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 [[Christianity]], specifically [[Roman Catholicism]], became the dominant religion. However, some of the [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] continue to practice animism today, and many of the traditions in Anito have survived in the form of [[Folk Catholicism]].

==Animism and folk religion==
{{Main|Indigenous religious beliefs of the Philippines|Philippine mythology}}
[[File:Wodden Carvings of the Bululs.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Wooden images of ancestral spirits (''[[anito]]'') in a museum in [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Philippines]]]]
[[Animism]] was widely practiced in the pre-colonial Philippines. Today, only a handful of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous tribes]] continue to practice the old traditions. The term animism encompasses a collection of beliefs and cultural mores anchored more or less in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and supernatural entities, both good and bad, and that respect must be accorded to them through worship. These nature spirits are known as "''[[diwata]]s''", related to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Devata]]s.

Some worship specific deities, such as the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] supreme deity, [[Bathala]], and his children Adlaw, [[Mayari]], and [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]], or the [[Visayans|Visayan]] deity [[Kan-Laon]]. Others practice [[ancestor worship]]. Animistic practices vary between different [[ethnic group]]s. [[Magic and religion|Magic]], chants and prayers are often key features. Its practitioners were highly respected (and sometimes feared) in the community, as they were healers, [[midwives]] (''[[hilot]]''), [[shaman]]s, [[witch]]es and [[warlock]]s (''[[mangkukulam]]''), priests/priestesses (''[[babaylan]]/[[katalonan]]''), tribal historians and wizened elders that provided the spiritual and traditional life of the community. In the [[Visayas|Visayan]] regions, shamanistic and animistic beliefs in witchcraft (''[[barang (Philippine mythology)|barang]]'') and mythical creatures like ''[[aswang]]'' (vampires), ''[[duwende]]'' (dwarves), and ''[[bakonawa]]'' (a gigantic sea serpent) Similarly to Naga, may exist in some indigenous peoples alongside more mainstream Christian and Islamic faiths.

===Anito===
[[Anito]] is a collective name for the pre-[[Spain|Hispanic]] belief system in the [[Philippines]].  It is also used to refer to spirits, including the [[household deity|household deities]], deceased ancestors, [[nature]]-spirits, [[nymph]]s and ''[[diwata]]s'' ([[dryad]]s). Ancient Filipinos kept statues to represent these spirits, ask guidance and protection. Elders, ancestors and the environment were all highly respected. Although Anito survives to the present day, it has for the most part been Christianized and incorporated into [[Folk Catholicism]].

===Folk healers===
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'' were shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were [[medicine men]].  At the onset of the colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to syncretize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

==Buddhism==
{{see also|Buddhism in the Philippines|Buddhist Art|Vajrayana Buddhism|Mahayana Buddhism|Tara (Buddhism)}}

[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
[[File:Right side of Tabon Cave.JPG|thumb|left|Example of what Maise believes to be a cave painting depicting [[Manjusri]], in [[Tabon Caves]] in [[Palawan]].]]
Although no written record exists about early Buddhism in the Philippines, recent archaeological discoveries and a few scant references in the other nations's historical records can testify that Buddhism was present from the 9th century. These records mention the independent states that comprised the Philippine archipelago, rather one united country as the Philippines are organized today.

Early Philippine states became tributary states of the powerful Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire that controlled trade in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] from the 6th to the 13th centuries. The states' trade contacts with the empire either before or during the 9th century served as a conduit to introduce [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] to the Philippines.

In 1225, China's [[Zhao Rugua]], a [[wikt:superintendent|superintendent]] of maritime trade in [[Fujian|Fukien]] province wrote the book entitled ''Zhu Fan Zhi'' ({{zh|c=諸番志|l="Account of the Various Barbarians"}}) in which he described trade with a country called [[Ma-i]] on the island of [[Mindoro]] in [[Luzon]]. In it he said:

{{Quote|The country of Mai is to the north of [[Borneo]]. The [[natives]] live in large [[villages]] on the opposite banks of a stream and cover themselves with a cloth like a sheet or hide their bodies with a loin cloth. There are metal images of [[Buddhas]] of unknown origin scattered about in the tangled wilds.}}.&lt;ref&gt;Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] immigrants arrived in [[Palawan]], where most settlements came to be ruled by Malay chieftains. They were followed by the [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]] of the [[Majapahit Empire]] in the 13th century, and they brought with them [[Buddhism]].

Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily found in and at [[Tabon Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=239 Camperspoint: History of Palawan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115190428/http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=239 |date=January 15, 2009 }}. Accessed August 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent research conducted by Philip Maise has included the discovery of giant sculptures, has also discovered what he believes to be cave paintings within the burial chambers in the caves depicting the [[Journey to the West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Great Sphinx' Found in Tabon Caves in Palawan|url=http://metrocebu.com.ph/2015/08/great-sphinx-found-in-tabon-caves-in-palawan/|accessdate=February 9, 2016|work=MetroCebu|date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese annal [[History of Song|''Song Shih'']] recorded the first appearance of a tributary mission from [[Butuan]] (Li Yui-han 李竾罕 and Jiaminan) at the Chinese Imperial Court on March 17, 1001 AD. It described [[Butuan]] as a small maritime [[Hindu]] country with a Buddhist monarchy that had regular contact with [[Champa]] and intermittent contact with China under the [[Rajah]] named Kiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Timeline of history|url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm|accessdate=2009-10-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm|archivedate=November 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient [[Batangas Province|Batangueños]] were influenced by [[India]] as shown in the origin of most languages from [[Sanskrit]] and certain ancient potteries. A Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a [[clay]] medallion in [[bas-relief]] from the municipality of [[Calatagan]]. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in [[Siam]], [[India]], and [[Nepal]]. The pot shows [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba]] in the [[tribhanga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115234226/http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html |archivedate=January 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}  tribhanga&lt;/ref&gt; pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong [[Mahayana|Mahayanic]] orientation in the image, since the [[Boddhisattva]] [[Avalokitesvara]] was also depicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Hinduism in the Philippines|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|Golden Tara|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}

[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|The expansion of Hinduism in the Philippines.]]
The archipelagoes of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu [[Tamils|Tamil]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] and Indonesian traders through the ports of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Malay-Indonesian]] islands. Indian religions, possibly an syncretic version of Hindu-Buddhism, arrived in the Philippine archipelago in the 1st millennium AD, through the Indonesian kingdom of [[Srivijaya]] followed by [[Majapahit]]. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess of Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in [[Mindanao]] in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.&lt;ref name=govppn&gt;[http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/using-joomla/extensions/components/content-component/article-categories/78-demo/slides/80-golden-tara Golden Tara] Government of the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; The statue now sits in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of Batavia, in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a Ngandjuk image of the early Madjapahit period – except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], and fits in well with the name "[[Butuan]]" (signifying [[Lingam|"phallus"]]).|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205–374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Juan Francisco suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess [[Shakti|Sakti]] of the Siva-Buddha ([[Bhairava]]) tradition found in Java, in which the religious aspect of [[Shiva]] is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco (1963), ''A Note on the Golden Image of Agusan'', Philippine Studies vol. 11, no. 3 (1963): 390—400&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore, arts and literature===
Most fables and stories in Philippine culture are linked to Indian arts, such as the story of monkey and the turtle, the race between the deer and the snail (similar to the Western story of [[The Tortoise and the Hare]]), and the hawk and the hen. Similarly, the major epics and folk literature of the Philippines show common themes, plots, climax and ideas expressed in the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Halili (2010), Philippine History, {{ISBN|978-9712356360}}, Rex Books, 2nd Edition, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Indologist]]s [[Juan R. Francisco]] and [[Josephine Acosta Pasricha]], Hindu influences and folklore was firmly established in Philippines when the surviving inscriptions of about 9th to 10th century AD were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Mellie Leandicho Lopez (2008), A Handbook of Philippine Folklore, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-9715425148}}, pp xxiv – xxv&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maranao people|Maranao]] version is the ''Maharadia Lawana'' (King [[Rāvaṇa]] of Hindu Epic [[Ramayana]]). ''[[Biag ni Lam-Ang|Lam-Ang]]'' is the [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] version and [[Sarimanok]] (akin to the Indian [[Garuda]]) is the legendary bird of the [[Maranao people]]. In addition, many verses from the ''[[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras#The Ifugao epic Hudhud|Hud-Hud]]'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]] are derived from the Indian [[Hindu]] epics [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, E. Arsenio (1963), A Survey of Philippine Folk Epics, Asian Folklore Studies, 22, pp 1–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist-Hindu influences in culture==

The [[Singkil|Darangen]] or ''Singkil'' epic of the [[Maranao people]] hearten back to this era as the most compete local version of the [[Ramayana]]. [[Maguindanao]] at this time was also strongly Hindu, evidenced by the Ladya Lawana (Rajah [[Ravana]]) epic saga that survives to the modern day, as albeit highly [[Islamization|Islamized]] from the 17th century onwards,

===Tigmamanukan ===
{{Main|Tigmamanukan }}
The Tigmamanukan was a blue and black bird (believed to be the [[Philippine Fairy Bluebird]]) which served as a messenger&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt; of [[Bathala|Bathalang Maykapal]], in which it was also an omen. If one encountered a Tigmamanukan while traveling, they should take note of the direction of its flight. If the bird flew to the right, the traveler would not encounter any danger during their journey. If it flew to the left, the traveler would never find their way and would be lost forever.

It traces the image of the [[Tikbalang]] back 4000 years, finding its roots in [[Hinduism]] and explains how that influence evolved into the mysterious half horse creature we know today.

Natives of the ancient concept of monotheism to reduce the uncertainty of the future. This ancient belief is considered animism. They had knowledge and they thought that the world has its own consciousness. They believed that stones, trees, mountains, water, animals, sun, moon and has a hidden power quickened the spirit or 'idol'. Could be good or harm the spirit, but it is believed to control some aspects of life. 
in 1589, when the earliest days of the Spanish occupation, documented by Father Juan de Plasencia with long-term tikbalang awareness of indigenous peoples .

[[Hinduism]] began in 3000 BC in India and spread to Southeast Asia in 200 CE. Had developed several routes of trade and cultural influence spread throughout the region. Soon, there was some kind of Buddhism in Asia but remained Hindu influences. This happened before Islam and Christianity in the region, this might have to do with Tikbalang Hayagriva was the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. The worship of Hayagriva was recorded in 2000 BCE.

The images for giant flying birds, the Tikbalang, and [[Sirena]] are straight out of Hindu imagery. Influence on religion was also prevalent with the concept of a multi-layered world – Heaven and Hell.  According to the Hindu Puranas, there are fourteen worlds in the universe – the seven upper and the seven lower. The seven upper worlds are Bhuh, Bhavah, Swah, Mahah, Janah. Tapah, and Satyam; and the seven nether worlds are Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Rasatala, Talatala, Mahatala, and Patala. The region known as Bhuh is the earth where we dwell.

Began its association with Tikbalang 1860 discovery of a statue to [[Cambodia]] since the 10th century. It described the demons that [[Vadavamuka]], the more radical version of the avatar of [[Vishnu]]. Eventually, Buddhism changed the image of Hayagriva a small horse's head floated to crown fire. In China, provided the old image of [[Hayagriva]] face with horses – one of the demons keeper into the [[Hell|inferno]]. Probably has the same happened in Tikbalang adapt it to the Filipinos in their beliefs after exacting culture through trade. Nine hundred years before the Spaniards arrived, went to the Chinese merchants in the Philippines and while there they use horses. But there's just started the evolution of Tikbalang.

==Islam==

[[File:Brunei territories (1500).png|thumb|250px|right|The extent of the Bruneian Empire and the spread of [[Islam]] in Southeast Asia in the 15th century]]
The Muslim [[Bruneian Empire]], under the rule of [[Sultan]] [[Bolkiah]] (who is an ancestor of the current [[Sultan of Brunei]], [[Hassanal Bolkiah]]), subjugated the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] in 1500. Afterwards, an alliance was formed between the newly established [[Kingdom of Maynila]] (Selurong) and the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] and the Muslim Rajah Sulaiman was installed in power.

==Historiographic sources==
===Early foreign written records===
Most records concerning pre-colonial Philippine religion can be traced back through various written accounts from Chinese, Indian and Spanish sources. 
* The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (LCI)
* ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'' ({{zh|c=諸番志|l="Account of the Various Barbarians"}})
* [[Boxer Codex]]- Spanish written accounts

====LCI====
{{Main|Laguna Copperplate Inscription}}
The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (LCI) is the most significant archaeological discovery in the Philippines because it serves as the first written record of the Philippine nation. The LCI mentions a debt pardon for a person, Namwaran, and his descendants by the Rajah of Tundun (now Tondo, Manila) on the fourth day after [[Vaisakha]], in the Saka year 822, which has been estimated to correspond to April 21, 900 CE.  The LCI uses the old Buddhist-Hindu lunar calendar.

Antoon Postma, an anthropologist and an expert in ancient Javanese literature, has deciphered the LCI and he says it records a combination of [[Kawi language|old Kavi]], [[Old Tagalog]], and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Antoon Postma, "The Laguna Copperplate Inscription," Philippines Studies, 1992 40: 183–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient artifacts==
{{see also|Buddhist art|Hinduism in the Philippines|Vajrayana Buddhism|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}

The Philippines's archaeological finds include many ancient gold artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus T. Peralta, "Prehistoric Gold Ornaments CB Philippines," Arts of Asia, 1981, 
4:54–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2008/04/26/going-for-the-gold.html Art Exhibit: Philippines' 'Gold of Ancestors'] in [[Newsweek]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them have been dated to belong to the 9th century.

The artifacts reflect the iconography of the [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its influences on the Philippines's early states.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Legeza, "Tantric Elements in the Philippines PreHispanic Gold Arts," Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Some of the iconography and artifacts are exampled'''

* Ling ling-O- The artifacts's distinct features point to their production in the islands. It is probable that they were made locally because archaeologist Peter Bellwood discovered the existence of an ancient goldsmith's shop that made the 20-centuries-old ''lingling-o'', or omega-shaped gold ornaments in [[Batanes]].

* [[Buddha|Copper Buddhas of]] [[Ma-i]] (metal relics) – "The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very lfferent from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism "There are copper Buddha's" images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political and Historical Writings (Vol. 7) | publisher=National Historical Institute | author=Rizal, Jose | year=2000 | location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt; the people in [[Ma-i]] sound like newcomers [to this port] since they don't know where those metal statues in the jungle come from.".&lt;ref&gt;Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Lokesvara|Bronze Lokesvara]] – This is bronze statue of Lokesvara was found in Isla Puting Bato in [[Tondo, Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-15-1977/francisco-indian-prespanish-philippines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba bass relief]] The Ancient Batangueños were influenced by [[India]] as shown in the origin of most languages from Sanskrit and certain ancient potteries. A Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief from the municipality of Calatagan. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of [[Buddha]] in [[Siam]], India, and [[Nepal]]. The pot shows [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba]] in the [[tribhanga]]&lt;ref name="tribhanga"&gt;[http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html tribhanga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115234226/http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html |date=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong [[Mahayana|Mahayanic]] orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]] was also depicted.&lt;ref name="asj.upd.edu.ph"&gt;http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Garuda|Golden Garuda]] of Palawan- The other finds are the [[garuda]], the mythical bird that is common to Buddhism and Hinduism, Another gold artifact, from the [[Tabon Caves]] in the island of [[Palawan]], is an image of [[Garuda]], the bird who is the mount of [[Vishnu]]. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from [[Oc Eo]], in the [[Mekong Delta]] in Southern [[Vietnam]].

* [[Ganesha|Bronze Ganesha statues]] – A crude bronze statue of a Hindu Deity [[Ganesha]] has been found by [[Henry Otley Beyer]] in 1921 in an ancient site in [[Puerto Princesa]], [[Palawan]] and in [[Mactan]]. [[Cebu]] the crude bronze statue indicates of its local reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-15-1977/francisco-indian-prespanish-philippines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alokitesvara |Mactan Alokitesvara ]] – Excavated in 1921 in [[Mactan]], [[Cebu]] by [[Henry Otley Beyer|H.O.Beyer]] the statue is bronze may be a siva-buddhist blending rather than "pure Buddhist".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-15-1977/francisco-indian-prespanish-philippines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Golden Tara]] was discovered in 1918 in Esperanza, Agusan by Bilay Campos a [[Manobo]] tribeswoman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magwrite.info/2012/03/agusan-gold-image-only-in-philippines.html#.UKh1xIeA_UY Agusan Gold Image only in the Philippines].&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Tara was eventually brought to the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, Illinois in 1922.  Henry Otley Beyer, and some experts have agreed on its identity and have dated it to belong within 900–950 CE.  They can not place, however, its provenance because it has distinct features.&lt;ref&gt;Agusan Image Documents, Agusan-Surigao Historical Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;{{further|Tara (Buddhism)|Mahavidya}}

* [[Kinnara|Golden Kinnari]]- The golden-vessel [[kinnari]] was found in 1981 in [[Surigao City|Surigao]]. The kinnari exists in both Buddhist and Hindu mythology. In Buddhism, the kinnari, a half-human and half-bird creature, represents enlightened action.  The Buddhist [[Lotus Sutra]] mentions the kinnari as the celestial musician in the Himavanta realm. The kinnari takes the form of a [[centaur]], however, in India's epic poem, the [[Mahabharata]], and in the [[Veda]]'s [[Purana]] part.

* [[Padmapani]] and [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] images – Padmapani is also known as [[Avalokitesvara]], the wisdom being or Bodhisattva of Compassion. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.&lt;ref name=atnb&gt;Anna T. N. Bennett (2009), [http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072 Gold in early Southeast Asia], ArcheoSciences, Volume 33, pp 99–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dang V.T. and Vu, Q.H., 1977.

[[File:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|right|300px|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (above) found in 1989 suggests Indian cultural influence in the Philippines by the 9th century AD, likely through [[Hinduism in Indonesia]], prior to the arrival of European colonial empires in the 16th century.]] 
*[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay found a copper plate in [[Wawa, Pilar|Barangay Wawa]], [[Lumban]]. This discovery, is now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the 9th century AD, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist [[Antoon Postma]]. The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese [[Medang Kingdom]], the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before.

'''Secular paganism''' or '''humanistic paganism''' is a form of [[paganism]] in which deities are not accepted as real divine beings, but pagan virtues and principles are upheld.

==Euhemerism==
As Europe was Christianized, the [[Church Fathers]] regularly secularized pagan deities and myths through [[Euhemerism]], which is a practice where the deities are interpreted as historical figures who at some point had become worshipped as gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement of Alexandria]] summarized the approach in ''Cohortatio ad gentes'', addressing the pagans: "Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seznec (1995) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'' Princeton University Press pg 12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, "Thus Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
Some adherents of [[modern Paganism]] have developed secular or humanistic approaches, where important aspects of a pagan worldview are embraced, but the gods are not accepted as real beings. These approaches take on a variety of different forms.

Some pagan revivalists are inspired by [[Carl Jung]]'s theories about [[archetype]]s and the [[collective unconscious]]. Jung handled esoteric and mythological subjects in a secular and scientific, yet not dismissive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardell|first=Mattias|authorlink=Mattias Gardell|title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism|year=2003|publisher=Duke UP|isbn=9780822330714|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biologist [[Andreas Weber (writer)|Andreas Weber]] promotes what he calls "poetic ecology" and "poetic materialism". This has been a source of inspiration for people such as Henrik Hallgren of the [[Swedish Forn Sed Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lodyn.se/ar-du-en-poetisk-materialist/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Varg Vikernes]], a musician and pagan revivalist known for his far-right views, explained his approach to paganism in a 2011 interview. Vikernes denounced theism, and instead embraced a "modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the Pagan values and ideals: loyalty, wisdom, courage, love, discipline, honesty, intelligence, beauty, responsibility, health and strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_bards_tale08.shtml |title=Bard's Tale: part VIII: Religion or Reason |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Godless Paganism: Voices of Non-Theistic Pagans'', an American anthology edited by John Halstead, was published in 2016 and contains a number of essays on secular approaches to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;John Halstead. 2016. Godless Paganism: Voices of Non-theistic Pagans. {{ISBN|978-1-329-98849-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shahriyar IV''' ({{lang-fa|شهریار}}), also known as '''Husam al-Dawla''' ({{lang|fa|حسام الدوله}}), was the king of the [[Bavand dynasty]] of [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], ruling from 1074 to 1114.

After having succeeded his father [[Qarin II]] in 1074, Shahriyar IV immediately moved the capital to [[Sari, Iran|Sari]], which it would remain till 1210. A few decades later, he briefly waged a war against his overlords, the [[Seljuk Empire]]. Peace was made, and Shahriyar IV's son [[Qarin III]] married a daughter of the Seljuk Sultan [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]].

Shahriyar IV's rule was shortly usurped by Qarin III, who, however, eventually restored him as king. Shahriyar, old and ill, spent the rest of his reign as a figurehead, whilst Qarin III was the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the kingdom, and finally ascended the throne after Shahriyar IV's death in 1114.

==Reign==
Shahriyar was born in 1039, and in 1074, he ascended the Bavandid throne, taking the traditional title of ''[[ispahbadh]]'' of [[Mazandaran]]. He also moved the Bavand capital to [[Sari, Iran|Sari]]. Like his father, Shahriyar IV was a vassal of the [[Seljuk Empire]].

In 1106, the Seljuk Sultan [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]] conquered the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Ismaili]] fortress of Shahdiz, and ordered Shahriyar to participate in the campaign against Ismailis. Shahriyar, greatly angered and feeling offended by the message Muhammad sent him, refused to aid him against the Ismailis.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=28}} Shortly after the sultan sent an army headed by Amir Chavli into Mazandaran. Shahriyar shortly called upon the aid of his vassals, which included the [[Qarinvand dynasty|Qarinvand]] ruler [[Amir Mahdi]]. Shahriyar was also joined by his son [[Qarin III]]. He shortly defeated the army of Amir Chavli. Muhammad then sent a letter, which requested Shahriyar to send one of his sons child to the Seljuk court in [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}} He sent his son [[Ali I (Bavandid ruler)|Ali I]], who impressed Muhammad so much that he offered him his daughter in marriage, but Ali refused and told him to grant the honor to his brother and heir of the Bavand dynasty, Qarin III. Qarin III then went to Isfahan court and married her. After his return to Sari, however, he began claiming the Bavand throne for himself, and started abusing his father Shahriyar and his servants. Shahriyar then moved to [[Amol]] and later [[Rudsar]], where he built a [[Khanqah]], and devoted himself to religion. However, when he got sick, Qarin III apologized and restored him as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty.

Qarin III's refusal to submit to the Seljuk [[atabeg]] of [[Rey, Iran|Ray]], made the atabeg offer Ali an opportunity to conquer Mazandaran, to which he agreed. Shahriyar quickly sided with Qarin III and convinced Ali to withdraw. Nevertheless, the strife continued among the two brothers. Ali later went to [[Merv|Marw]] and joined the Seljuk prince [[Ahmad Sanjar]], the ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Ahmad Sanjar was preparing for an expedition to the west in order to take control of [[Gorgan]], but an attack made by Muhammad Khan on the Seljuk borders, forced Ahmad Sanjar to move east in order to repel Muhammad Khan. This allowed Qarin III to capture Gorgan while Shahriyar stayed in Tamisha. Shahriyar later fell ill and died in 1114 at Tamisha and was officially succeeded by his son [[Qarin III]], who already held power over the Bavand kingdom, while Shahriyar was a [[figurehead]].

== Offspring ==
Shahriyar IV had a least five sons;
* [[Qarin III]], Bavandid king from 1114 to 1117.
* [[Ali I (Bavandid ruler)|Ali I]], Bavandid king from 1118 to 1142.
* Rustam 
* Yazdagird 
* [[Bahram ibn Shahriyar|Bahram]], Bavandid pretender, murdered in 1121 at [[Nishapur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3465">The '''''Suaire de Saint-Josse''''', the "Shroud of [[Saint Josse]]" that is now conserved in the [[Musée du Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Sheila S. Blair and Jonathan M. Bloom, "The Mirage of Islamic Art: Reflections on the Study of an Unwieldy Field", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''85'''.1 (March 2003:152-184), p. 154, fig. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; is a rich silk  [[samite]] saddle cloth that was woven in northeastern Iran, some time before 961, when Abu Mansur Bakhtegin, the "camel-prince" for whom it was woven, was beheaded. It was brought back from the [[First Crusade]] by [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Étienne de Blois]] and dedicated as a votive gift at the [[Saint-Josse|Abbey of Saint-Josse]], near [[Caen]], Normandy.  It has been described as "the major landmark in early Islamic silk weaving".&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

This fragmentary textile with elephants woven into the design is the only known surviving example of a silk textile produced in Eastern Iran, in the royal workshops of the [[Samanid dynasty]], probably at either [[Merv]] or [[Nishapur]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Museum: "The Saint-Josse Shroud".&lt;/ref&gt; The "prince" referred to in the woven [[Kufic]] inscription, though decipherable in more than one way, is most likely to refer to the general and [[emir]] Bukhtegin, active in the service of [[Abd al-Malik I (Samanid emir)|'Abd al-Malik I]], the Samanid sultan of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], 954-61.

The cloth is now in two fragments, which are regarded as comprising about half of the original piece.  They are 52 x 94&amp;nbsp;cm and 24.5 x 62&amp;nbsp;cm respectively, the first measurement being the length.  The design was somewhat like a carpet (not that any from this date survive), with a central field containing two pairs of confronted elephants, one above the other, of which one pair survive. There is then a thin border with geometric patterns, outside which the sides have friezes of repeated camels and at least the bottom (which survives) an inscription in [[Kufic]] script. In all there are five zones of border between the elephants and the edge of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 74.  The image in Jones appears to be a photo-reconstruction, as more is shown than in the Louvre's photograph.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many trophies of foreign adventure, both in the [[Middle Ages]] and in more modern times, in its new context, the rare textile was given new meaning, for it was used to wrap the bones of [[Saint Josse]] when he was reinterred in 1134.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bernus, H. Marchal, and G. Vial, "Le Suaire de St-Josse", ''Bulletin de Liaison du Centre International d'Études des Textiles Anciens'' '''33''' (1971:1-57).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Abbey of Saint-Josse was secularised just before the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;The Abbey of Saint-Josse was closed in 1772, sold and then deismantled in 1789, leaving no traces of the monumental buildings.&lt;/ref&gt; the abbey church became the parish church of the [[French commune]] of [[Saint-Josse]];  the ''suaire'' was kept there until it was transferred to the Louvre.

'''Teyolía''' was an animic entity of the human being resided physically located in the heart according to the cosmovision of the [[Aztec|ancient Aztecs]] and in the beliefs of some modern indigenous groups from Mexico and Central America.

Together with the ''tonalli'' and the ''ihíyotl'' was one of the three strengths that brings life and health to the humans. It was the part of the human being considered as the one that trascended to [[afterlife]] to different realms according ones way of death. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] the term was assumed by Spaniard translators as equal to the word «ánima» and «alma» (soul),{{sfn|López Austin|2012a|pp=253}} which have some reminiscences in current expressions among modern indigenous.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Olson|first = Richard G.|title = Technology and Science in Ancient Civilizations|publisher= Praeger|location= Santa Barbara, California|year= 2010|url = https://www.questia.com/read/124045386/technology-and-science-in-ancient-civilizations||subscription= y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[nahuatl]] word ''teyolía'' incorporates the [[prefix]]  «te-» and the substantive «yolía». The particle «te-» is an indefinite pronominal [[prefix]] that indicates possession, so when it is placed before a noun it can be translated as «of somebody, of another, of the people, of some».&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.historicas.unam.mx/publicaciones/publicadigital/libros/gramatica/cgn_002.pdf|title = Compendio de la gramática náhuatl|author = Sullivan, Thelma D.|publisher= Instituto de Investigaciones Históricas. UNAM|year= 2014|edition= 4th.|isbn = 9786070254598|page= 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun «yolía» contains the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] «''yol''» meaning «life», consequently it can be translated as «''that what makes to live''».{{sfn|López Austin|2012a|p=254}} All together the word teyolía might be translated as «what makes to live the people». It is related etymologically with the word «yollotl», used to describe the heart.{{sfn|López Austin|2012b|p=222}}

== Description ==
According to the Aztec thought the ''teyolía'' was an animic entity that gives life to the human beings located in the heart and, therefore, inside every person's chest. Related with the half part of the cosmos.&lt;ref name="olson" /&gt; In addition to the vitality it was attributed it to be the source of knowledge, tendency, affections, passions, memory and will.&lt;ref name="Fitzsimmons"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Fitzsimmons, James L.|title= Death and the Classic Maya Kings|location= Austin, Texas|publisher= University of Texas Press|year= 2009|page= 42|url = https://www.questia.com/read/120781924/death-and-the-classic-maya-kings|subscription = y}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|López Austin|2012a|pp=254-255}}

The Aztecs believed that after dead the teyolía was the part of the man that separated from the body remained immortal. The teyolía remained some days on the surface of earth be carried afterwards to one of any different destinations in which the Aztecs believed. The final destination of the teyolía was determined by every person's way of dead.&lt;ref name="Fitzsimmons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2013|title= La muerte entre los mexicas.

Among the modern indigenous peoples the term is used  in some deformed ways as «yolía», «yolo», «teyolotl», «I:l», «yuhlu», «I:ll(or)»; or, by means of Spanish terms «alma», «ánima» or «espíritu».&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.medicinatradicionalmexicana.unam.mx/termino.php?l=1&amp;id=139|title= yolo|website= Diccionario Enciclopédico de la Medicina Tradicional Mexicana|author= UNAM|location= México|access-date= December 4, 2015|year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tharpa Publications''' (Sanskrit for "liberation" and pronounced "Tar-pa") is "a major international and multilingual publisher of Buddhist books"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutulverston.co.uk/ About Ulverston - South Lakeland Cumbria UK], retrieved 2009-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Buddhist author and scholar [[Kelsang Gyatso|Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]]. They are based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tharpa.com/us//contact.html]&lt;/ref&gt; These include basic [[Buddhist meditation]] books such as ''[[The New Meditation Handbook]]'', books on the Buddhist way of life such as ''[[Universal Compassion]]'', books on Buddhist philosophy and psychology such as ''[[Heart of Wisdom]]'', and books on [[Buddhist Tantra]]. Tharpa Publications is a non-profit corporation that has operated for 25 years and claims to have sold over a million books.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080125063058/http://www.londonbookfair.co.uk/page.cfm/action=Exhib/ExhibID=00974 London book fair 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Waterhouse adds that the books "are distributed widely and may be seen on the shelves of popular booksellers as well as in university libraries."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. pp. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kelsang Gyatso==
{{main|Kelsang Gyatso}}
To date, Tharpa has published 22 of his books, covering the entire range of [[Buddha]] [[Shakyamuni]]'s [[Sutra]] and [[Tantra]] teachings. These are in the process of being translated into German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Dutch and Croatian. According to its website, "Tharpa publishes the works of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, a contemporary Buddhist master who presents the essential practices of Buddhism in a way that is easy to understand and practise in modern everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tharpa.com/uk/ Tharpa Publications UK]&lt;/ref&gt; Biography Research Guide describes Kelsang Gyatso's books:

{{quote|A Tibetan Buddhist monk and scholar; Geshe Kelsang has written twenty books that aim to provide Western Dharma practitioners with essential Buddhist texts; some are books for beginners such as ''Transform Your Life'' and ''How to Solve Our Human Problems'', books about the [[Mahayana]] path like ''Universal Compassion'' ([[Lojong]]), and books on Vajrayana ([[Tantra]]) like ''Mahamudra Tantra''; (born 1931, in Tibet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.123exp-biographies.com/t/00034262686/ ''Kelsang Gyatso''] by Biography Research Guide, retrieved 2009-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of Kelsang Gyatso's textbooks have received favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14462619_ITM ''How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths''], reviewed by ''Publisher's Weekly'', retrieved 2009-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluck writes that "The three most popular works—''Introduction to Buddhism'', ''The New Meditation Handbook'' and ''Transform Your Life''—have sold 165,000 copies between them, showing their appeal far beyond the movement itself."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Batchelor says that Kelsang Gyatso's books are written with "considerable clarity."&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, Stephen (1994). ''The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture''. Berkeley, Calif: Parallax Press. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Braizer echoes this sentiment, saying that Kelsang  writes "excellent" books that are "an important contribution to Western understanding of Buddhism and its traditions. They can stand on their own merit."&lt;ref&gt;Brazier, David (2002). ''The New Buddhism''. New York: Palgrave. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guide to Dakini Land'' and ''Essence of Vajrayana'' have been described as "the most detailed and revealing commentary on specific tantric practices yet to be published in a Western language."&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, D.. quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book review of ''Guide to Dakini Land'', Richard Guard said:

{{quote|It is remarkable that the author has managed to give us so much information in only a few hundred pages. The editors are to be commended for their skilful efforts in conveying Geshe Kelsang’s instructions in such simple and precise language... By making this book available for [[Vajrayogini]] practitioners, Geshe Kelsang has truly brought a blessing into our lives.&lt;ref&gt;Book review ''Guide to Dakini Land: A Commentary to the Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Vajrayogini'', reviewed by Richard Guard. ''Tibetan Journal'' (Autumn 1991), pp. 81, 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The books are also highly thought of within the Tibetan establishment. Three of his published works contained forewords by previous [[Ganden Tripa]]s and the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama contributed a foreword to ''Buddhism in the Tibetan Tradition'', while [[Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso|Trijang Rinpoche]] and Ling Rinpoche (who each held the position of [[Ganden Tripa]]) also provided forewords for his books ''Meaningful to Behold'' (which was dedicated to the long life of the Dalai Lama) and ''Clear Light of Bliss'' (which was dedicated to the late Trijang Rinpoche), respectively. Kyabje Ling Rinpoche refers to Kelsang Gyatso as "this most precious Spiritual Guide," while Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche refers to him as "The excellent expounder, the great Spiritual Master Kelsang Gyatso." [[Tsem Tulku Rinpoche|Tsem Tulku]] praised Kelsang Gyatso and his publications: "The great master, the Kadampa Geshe, Kelsang Gyatso, you can see very clearly his works, his centers, his books, his pure vows, and how many thousands of people he affects."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NJkuR3pk6Q ''Karma &amp; its Relation to Vows''] (Part 2 of 2, 10:54-11:09), 2006-01-16, retrieved 2010-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Kadampa Tradition==

Tharpa Publications is part of the [[New Kadampa Tradition]] - International Kadampa Buddhist Union, which is an international Buddhist charity set up for building Buddhist temples for world peace in every major city of the world. It was established in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; in Ulverston, UK and now has affiliates in countries throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tharpa.com Tharpa Publications International - Publishers of Books on Buddhism &amp; Meditation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Je Tsongkhapa===

Tharpa Publications is devoted to the preservation of the tradition of [[Je Tsongkhapa]]:

{{quote|We are studying and practicing Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings and taking as our example what the ancient Kadampa Lamas and Geshes did. All the books that I have written are commentaries to Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings. We try our best to follow the example of the ancient Kadampa tradition and use the name Kadampa to remind people to practice purely.&lt;ref name="Gelugpas"&gt;[http://www.newkadampatruth.org/newkadampa5a.php ''Smear: NKT practitioners are not real Gelugpas''] by New Kadampa Truth, retrieved 2009-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune'' is based on Je Tsongkhapa's ''Lamrim Chenmo'' (''Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment''). Other examples include:

*''[[Universal Compassion]]'' is based on Je Tsongkhapa's ''Sunrays of Training the Mind''
*''Understanding the Mind'' is based on Je Tsongkhapa’s teachings on ''Commentary to Valid Cognition'' by [[Dharmakirti]]
*''Guide to Dakini Land'' and ''Essence of Vajrayana'' are based on ''Be dön kun säl'' (''Illuminating All Hidden Meanings'') and Je Tsongkhapa's commentary to the Heruka sadhana, ''Dö jo'' (''Wishfulfilling'')
*''Clear Light of Bliss'' is based on ''Lamp Thoroughly Illuminating the Five Stages''
*''Tantric Grounds and Paths'' is based on ''Great Exposition of the Stages of Secret Mantra''
*''Ocean of Nectar'' is based on ''Clear Illumination of the Intention: An Extensive Explanation of the Great Treatise'' ‘Guide to the Middle Way’.&lt;ref name="Gelugpas" /&gt; 
*''[[The New Meditation Handbook]]'' and ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune'' are based on Je Tsongkhapa's commentaries to Atisha's Lamrim teachings.

===Preserving the Gelugpa tradition===

The teachings in Tharpa's books are also in the Gelugpa lineage of [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo|Pabongka Rinpoche]] and [[Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso|Trijang Rinpoche]]'s teachings. For example, ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune'' is a modern equivalent of ''Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand'', written by Je Phabongkhapa and edited by Trijang Rinpoche; and ''[[The New Meditation Handbook]]'' is a concise rendition of these teachings. In the preface of ''Joyful Path'' the author writes: 

{{quote|I have received these teachings from my Spiritual Guide, Trijang Dorjechang, who was an emanation of [[Atisha]]; thus the explanations given in this book, ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune'', actually come from him and not from myself.&lt;ref&gt;''Joyful Path of Good Fortune'': The Complete Buddhist Path to Enlightenment, page xi, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-46-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Waterhouse notes that "All pictorial material produced by the NKT is carefully controlled to maintain the accuracy in the smallest detail":

{{quote|A [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] printer responsible for the production of some of the NKT's most recent publications, told me that the movement's representatives had been so particular about the reproduction of some of the illustrations in Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's ''Guide to Dakini Land'', that the whole print run had to be repeated because a moon symbol had been omitted from one of the diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 149, n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Use of Tharpa's books on Buddhist study programs worldwide===

Fourteen of Tharpa Publications classic textbooks are used as the basis of the [[New Kadampa Tradition]]'s Foundation Program and Teacher Training Program, which have tens of thousands of Buddhist students worldwide. The Foundation Program is described by Steven Heine in ''Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition'':

{{quote|The Foundation Program is meant for serious students who want a guided study at a deeper level than they can get through the series of [[Lamrim]] talks, usually all pitched to a beginner's capacity, that normally constitute the fare of Western Dharma centers.&lt;ref name="Heine"&gt;''Buddhism in the Modern World'': Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition by Steven Heine page 232, Oxford University Press, USA (January 1, 2003){{ISBN|0195146980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[New Kadampa Tradition]]'s Teacher Training Program is a rigorous "multilayered educational" study program of [[Buddha]]'s teachings of [[Sutra]] and [[Tantra]] presented in accordance with the tradition of the Tibetan master [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (AD 1357-1419), designed for those training as Buddhist teachers.&lt;ref name="Heine" /&gt;

==Finances==
Losing money each year from 1985 onwards, Tharpa Publications "broke even" for the first time in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 143, n. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Tharpa Publications claims that, since that time, the author has donated all royalties from Tharpa's books to non-profit organizations that promote Buddhism. Firstly he gave these to [[Manjushri Institute]]:

{{quote|Tharpa Publications publishes my books. They are financially independent from me and from all my Dharma Centers around the world. From the very beginning I have given Manjushri Buddhist Centre the royalties to which I am entitled as author. I have never used even one penny from this money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkadampatruth.org/geshekelsang8.php ''Smear: Geshe Kelsang has millions of pounds that have come from his disciples''] by New Kadampa Truth, retrieved 2009-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Now Tharpa says that the author donates all royalties to the International Temples' Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkadampatruth.org/geshekelsang10.php ''Smear: NKT students worship Geshe Kelsang''] by New Kadampa Truth, retrieved 2009-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Each book also contains the information: "Profits received by Tharpa Publications from the sale of this book will be donated to the NKT-International Temples Project" which is "a Buddhist Charity, Building for World Peace."

'''Museum of the Holocaust – victims of fascism, Odessa''' (Музей "Холокоста – жертв фашизма", Одесса) –  the first Museum in [[Ukraine]], which is based on the events of the genocide of the [[Jewish]] population in [[Transnistria Governorate]] (the territories which were from 1941 to 1943 under jurisdiction of [[Romania]] and occupied [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]] and part of [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia areas]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zabarko|first1=Boris|title=THE TRANSNISTRIA: THE PAIN OF OUR MEMORY|url=https://zn.ua/SOCIETY/transnistriya_bol_nashey_pamyati.html|website=ZN.UA|publisher=10 May 2002|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1995, the idea arose to create a museum of the Holocaust in Odessa. It was proposed by two former prisoners of the ghetto and concentration camps: President of the Association «Ukraine-[[Israel]]", former prisoner of the [[concentration camp]] in [[Domanyovka]] Dmitry Gutakhov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Odessa will be a Museum of memory of victims of the Holocaust|url=http://glasweb.com/news61927/|website=ГЛАS|publisher=21 September 2009|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former prisoner of fascism, Nilva Efim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nilva|first1=Efim|title=Long relay of life|url=http://dobroedelo-11.narod.ru/olderfiles/1/19.pdf|website=Good Deed|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

14 years later, by the decision of the Council of Odessa regional Association of Jews—former prisoners of ghettos and nazi concentration camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of the "Holocaust – Victims of Fascism"  Odessa Regional Association of Jews –  former prisoners of the ghetto and nazi camps|url=http://omr.gov.ua/ru/museums/24709|website=Official site of the city of Odessa|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chairman of the Association – [[Roman Shvartsman|Shvartsman Roman Markovich]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dolomanji|first1=Antonina|title=Former prisoner of the ghetto from Odessa: "Our whole world was restricted by barbed wire"|url=http://www.odessamedia.net/news/bivshii-uznik-getto-iz-odessi-ves-nash-mir-bil-ogranichen-kolyuchei-provolokoi/|website=Odessa Media|publisher=27 January 2017|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22 June 2009 the official opening of the Holocaust Museum in Odessa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holocaust Museum|url=https://www.memorialmuseums.org/eng/denkmaeler/view/1493/Holocaust-Museum|website=Information Portal to European|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Odessa, the first museum of the Holocaust was opened in Ukraine|url=https://ru.tsn.ua/ukrayina/v-odesse-otkryli-pervyi-v-ukraine-muzei-holokosta.html|website=TSN Ukraine|publisher=22 June 2009|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opening day of the Museum the head of the society "Ukraine – Israel" Dmitry Gutakhov, in his speech noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A meeting was held at the Holocaust Museum on the beginning of the Great Patriotic War|url=http://odessa-daily.com.ua/news/myzej-xolokosta-vov-miting-id15769.html|website=Odessa-Daily|publisher=23 June 2010|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"Holocaust Museum in Odessa is an important milestone on the way of memory"}}

The opening date of the Museum is symbolic. Precisely in this day, 22 June 1941 Nazi Germany attacked Soviet Union.Blitzkrieg on the eastern front was not only about instant military victory, it was also (if not mostly) about genocide and war crimes. Nazi Germany wanted to kill or enslave all of the Soviet Union's population, just like they were (trying) to do in Poland since 1st September 1939. Terrible war crimes were committed by both the SS groups just like the Wehrmacht. All Slavic,Roma, Jewish (hated the most by Nazis) and other people were considered by brainwashed Germans as subhumans, hence they didn't deserve no rights and dignity. Those who couldn't work for their "masters" from "master Aryan race" (Germans) and become their slaves were supposed to be exterminated. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cech|first1=Lera|title=Photo-report: in Odessa, the anniversary of the opening of the museum of the Holocaust was celebrated|url=http://reporter-ua.com/2010/06/23/fotoreportazh-v-odesse-otmetili-godovshchinu-otkrytiya-muzeya-holokosta|website=REPORTER|publisher=23 June 2010|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A museum of the Holocaust was opened in Odessa|url=http://dumskaya.net/news/V_Odesse_otkryt_muzej_Holokosta-001813/|website=Dumskaya|publisher=22 June 2009|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By decision of the Council of the Odessa Regional Association of Jews-former prisoners of the ghetto and nazi concentration camps, Sabulis Victor Franzevich was appointed the first director of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the museum opening|url=http://www.holocaust-odessa.org/istoriya-otkrytiya-muzeya/|website=ODESSA REGIONAL ASSOCIATION OF JEWS – THE FORMER GETTO AND CONCENTRATORS|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the opening of the museum Roman Markovich Shvartsman said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markevich|first1=Nadezhda|title=In Odessa, a museum will be created to commemorate the prisoners of the ghettos and concentration camps|url=https://www.segodnya.ua/regions/odessa/v-odecce-pojavitcja-muzej-pamjati-uznikov-hetto-i-kontslaherej.html|website=Segodnya|publisher=2 June 2008|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"We have long dreamed of creating such a museum, collecting everything that speaks about that time"}}

== Exhibits and Exposition ==
Initially in two halls of the museum about one and a half thousand exhibits were exposed: [[photos]], [[documents]], tablets and exhibits – witnesses of that time, a kind part from which is taken from private [[Private collection|collection]]s of the Odessa Jews brought by former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zabarko|first1=Boris|title=Holocaust Memory|url=http://netzulim.org/Partners/Ukr_Uzn_06-17_No32.pdf|website=Netzulim|publisher=May 2017|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant part of the exposition was transferred to the museum from Chicago [[(USA)]], now the late native of Odessa, former prisoner of the ghetto Lev Dumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashkovetsky|first1=Mikhail|title=Testament of Lev Dumer|url=http://www.migdal.org.ua/migdal/museum/16592/|website=Migdal|publisher=28 April 2008|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All exhibits are genuine, dedicated to Odessa citizens – former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos, 400 of whom were lucky enough to survive the nightmares of the Holocaust and live to this day. These are graphic images, photographs, and [[relics]], and photo documents about the horrors experienced during the Second World War by Jewish residents of Odessa and the region. Particularly painful impression the rope with which the nazis were hanged young girl. It was given to the museum by a man who, at that time, a boy, was in love with that girl…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wist|first1=Marieke|title=Odessa|url=https://bremkraine.hypotheses.org/exkursion/odessa|website=Bremkraine|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Holocaust Museum is a two-storey complex, which houses a research library, a training center and a memorial space.

=== Exhibits ===
Initially, the exhibition gives an overview of the Holocaust, and then focuses on the fate of the Jews of Odessa and [[Pridnestrovie]]. In addition to the permanent exhibition, the museum offers audio and video interviews, a library and a memorial room.

The permanent exhibition covers five halls of the Museum.

* Hall of the library, which presents literature related to the history of the Holocaust, [[historical documents]], [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s , historical and personal photos, oral and video history, personal belongings of former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos.
* Hall, which presents the history of the [[Military occupation|occupation]] of the fascists in Europe, and after the Odessa region. Here is a video card of the Transnistria, where death camps, labor camps and ghettos are marked.
* Hall, which tells the story of the typical life of the pre-war [[Jewish family]] in [[Shtetl]], so used to be called [[small town]].
* Hall of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]]. Here are photos, awards, personal belongings of the Righteous of the peoples of the world of Odessa region.
* Hall of [[Victory]]. Here are pictures of [[military officers]], sailors, heroes of the [[USSR]], who participated in the liberation of the Odessa region from the nazi invaders, during the [[Second world war]].

=== Exposition ===
The Museum also presents traveling exhibitions, where you can see [[Romania]]n,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Odessa, an exhibition about the Romanian occupation of the city|url=http://jewishnews.com.ua/culture/v-odesse-otkryilas-vyistavka-o-rumyinskoj-okkupaczii-goroda|website=Jewish News|publisher=14 October 2016|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] Jews, former prisoners of ghettos and concentration camps.

By the 75th anniversary of the occupation of Odessa during the second world war, the Holocaust museum presented the exhibition "Documents of the Romanian occupation of Odessa 1941–1944 from the state archives of Odessa region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liado|first1=Sergey|title=Documents of the period of occupation of Odessa will be made public in the museum of the Holocaust|url=http://odessa-life.od.ua/news/38029-Odesskiy-muzey-Holokosta-predstavit-dokumenty-perioda-rumynskoy-okkupacii|website=Odessa-Life|publisher=10 October 2016|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the international day of commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust saw the opening of an exhibition of photographs entitled "Holocaust in granite". The photographs presented unfailingly reveal the tragedy of the Holocaust. The exhibition is devoted to the tragic fate of the Jews of Odessa, [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina]], destroyed by the Romanian occupiers in 1941–1944 on the territory between the [[Southern Bug]] and the [[Dniester]]. Photos, which formed the basis of the exhibition, were taken from expeditions carried out in the period from 2011 to 2012. The expeditions are part of a major long-term project launched by the Odessa Holocaust Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorshkov|first1=Nikolay|title=Odessa Holocaust Museum|url=https://www.museumsassociation.org/museum-practice/new-approaches-to-volunteers/16092013-odessa-holocaust-museum|website=Museums Association|publisher=16 September 2013|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 mini-diorama "Ghetto in Transnistria"appeared in the museum's collection. [[Diorama]] depicts a Jewish ghetto in the Odessa settlement, which was established by the occupiers in 1942. In it almost 90 figures, the size of which is 35 times less than human growth. The author of this project was the Odessa master-modeler Evgeniy Kapuka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A mini-diorama "The Ghetto in Transnistria" appeared in the museum of the Holocaust in Odessa|url=http://jadvis.org.ua/category/item/2182-v-muzee-kholokosta-v-odesse-poyavilas-mini-diorama-getto-v-transnistrii|website=All-Ukrainian Jewish is glad|publisher=28 February 2017|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A mini-diorama "The Ghetto in Transnistria" appeared in the museum of the Holocaust in Odessa|url=https://lechaim.ru/news/v-muzee-holokosta-v-odesse-poyavilas-mini-diorama-getto-v-transnistrii/|website=Lechaim|publisher=28 November 2017|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the museum presented the exhibition "[[Priests]] and Holocaust", dedicated to those who opposed totalitarian regimes and mass crimes in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vygodsky|first1=Andrey|title=The Holocaust Museum exhibited the exhibition "Clergymen and the Holocaust"|url=http://www.kolocol.com/obshchestvenno-vazhnoe/3307-v-muzee-kholokosta-predstavili-vystavku-svyashchennosluzhiteli-i-kholokost.html|website=Public Surf|publisher=9 March 2018|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and objectives of the museum ==
The organizers of the museum set the main goal in the work of the museum: to collect, preserve and communicate to future generations the story of this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered, to educate a new generation of young people who will be able to resist and prevent the emergence of fascism in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Одесса Музей Холокоста|url=https://www.magnitogorsk-travels.ru/odessa-muzej-xolokosta|website=Magnitogorsk-Travels|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech, Eduard Dolinsky, Director General of the Jewish Committee of Ukraine, noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matveyev|first1=Vladimir|title=Odessa Holocaust museum dedicated|url=https://www.jta.org/2009/06/23/news-opinion/world/odessa-holocaust-museum-dedicated|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|publisher=23 June 2009|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''The main mission of the museum is to promote knowledge about the Holocaust, preserve the memory of the victims and encourage reflection of the moral and spiritual issues posed by the Holocaust, during which 6 million Jews were destroyed by the nazis''}}

Chairman of the Association of former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos Roman Shvartsman said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The museum of the Holocaust was opened in Odessa|url=http://vkurse.ua/society/muzey-kholokosta.html|website=V Kurse|publisher=11 September 2009|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To know and remember|url=http://www.holocaust-odessa.org/chtob-znali-i-pomnili/|website=ODESSA REGIONAL ASSOCIATION OF JEWS – THE FORMER GETTO AND CONCENTRATORS|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''This museum should become a school, a university for young people, so that they understand what the Holocaust is''}}

Today, the Museum presents a fairly large collection of exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ODESSA. Visit to the Holocaust Museum in memory of the victims of fascism|url=http://jewish.kiev.ua/news/8604/|website=All-Ukrainian Jewish Congress|publisher=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, since its opening, the Museum has been visited by more than 20 thousand people from around the world:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting of heads of regional organizations of Jews – former prisoners of the ghetto and nazi concentration camps|url=http://netzulim.org/R/Events/25_MOUF-13-12-16/Moskwa_UGK_13-12-2016.html|website=All-Israel Association "Survivors in concentration camps and ghettos"|publisher=13 December 2016|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ambassadors]], diplomats, heads of cities and regions, students and [[schoolchildren]], and just people who remember or want to learn about the terrible tragedy that is called the Holocaust.

'''The Very Reverend''' is a [[Style (manner of address)|style]] given to certain religious figures.

==Roman Catholic==
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the style is given, by custom, to priests who hold positions of particular note: e.g. [[vicars general]], episcopal vicars, judicial vicars, ecclesiastical judges, vicars forane (deans or archpriests), provincials of religious orders, rectors or presidents of cathedrals, seminaries or colleges/universities, priors of monasteries, [[Canon (priest)|canons]], for instance. Monsignors of the grade of [[Chaplain of His Holiness]] were formerly styled as ''The Very Reverend Monsignor'', while [[Honorary Prelate]] and [[Protonotary Apostolic]] were styled ''The Right Reverend Monsignor''. An extant example is the [https://standrewparish.net/contact-us/%20Very%20Reverend%20John%20Talamo,%20Jr. Very Reverend John Talamo, Jr]. Fr. Talamo is both the pastor of his parish and holds an exalted position in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Now, apart from legitimate custom or acquired right, most monsignors are simply styled ''The Reverend Monsignor''. The title is also accorded in the [[Dominican Order]] to holders of the title of [[Master of Sacred Theology]].

==Orthodox==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, the style is used for [[Archpriest#Byzantine Christianity|archpriests]] and unmarried parish priests, while married priests are typically styled ''The Reverend''.

==Anglican==
In the [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crockford.org.uk/faq/how-to-address-the-clergy "How to address the clergy", ''Crockford's Clerical Directory'' website.]&lt;/ref&gt; the style is used with certain senior [[priest]]s in a [[diocese]]. The senior priest of a [[cathedral]], whether a [[dean (religion)|dean]] or a [[provost (religion)|provost]], is usually styled as ''The Very Reverend'' regardless of whether the priest is also the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the cathedral [[parish]], or whether the cathedral is a [[parish church]]. In the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church USA]], the dean of a [[seminary]] or divinity school is also styled in this form, as is the priest who is either appointed by the local bishop or elected by fellow priests as the leader of a deanery, which is a geographic subdivision of a diocese. In some Episcopal dioceses convocation is used in lieu of deanery. The deans of dioceses in the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] (who do not head a cathedral chapter) and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] (who do) are also styled as ''The Very Reverend''.

==Presbyterian==
In some churches with a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] heritage, the style is used for former [[Moderator of the General Assembly|Moderators of the General Assembly]], such as:
*a former [[Moderator of the United Church of Canada]],
*a former [[Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland]]
*a former [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].

By custom, the [[Dean of the Chapel Royal]], the [[Dean of the Thistle]] and (if a Church of Scotland minister) the Principal of [[St Mary's College, St Andrews]], are also styled ''The Very Reverend''.

'''Theosophical Society Building''' is a heritage-listed [[duplex (building)|duplex]] at 355 [[Wickham Terrace]], [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was built from 1863 to 1864. It is also known as Callender House. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|14944|Theosophical Society Building|600169|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dr J Espie Dods.tiff|thumb|left|Dr J Espie Dods]]
This pair of semi-detached houses was built in late 1863 to early 1864. The building was probably erected by the first landowner [[Patrick Mayne]] (1856), or possibly for the second owner John McNab. The houses were advertised for rent on 30 January 1864, two days after registration in McNab's name, when they were described as ''"newly erected ... containing five rooms and kitchen"''.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Subsequent owners included [[Joseph Buckle]] (1885-1910), a [[Primitive Methodist]] minister, who resided there for a period. From at least 1883 the building was known as Callender House.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The property was purchased in 1910 by Dr [[Espie Dods]], who moved there from 97 Wickham Terrace. His architect brother [[Robin Dods]] renovated and extended the property for its use as a private house and consulting rooms. This reflected the medico-residential character of Wickham Terrace at the time.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1925 the property, which included adjacent land now occupied by the [[Liberal Catholic Church]], was purchased by the [[Brisbane Theosophical Society]]. Minor alterations were carried out in 1925 by architects [[Hall &amp; Prentice]]. Major conservation work was undertaken in 1986-87.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
The building comprises a pair of 1860s two-storeyed semi-detached brick houses with a 1912 timber extension to the side and rear.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The original houses are small in scale without halls or corridors, and include attic and basement. Construction is of brick, with brick-on-edge construction on walls protected by verandahs. The main roof is gabled and clad in corrugated galvanised iron, concealing earlier shingles. The main [[facade]] has a two-storeyed timber verandah, reconstructed in 1986-87 to a 1910 photograph.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The timber extension designed by Dods added new large rooms on two levels at the rear, and a single-storeyed kitchen wing. A new [[porch]] and hall gave entrance to both consulting rooms and house. The extension is clad with weatherboards, lined with timber and roofed with corrugated galvanised iron. There is no visible evidence of earlier kitchen wings. The fence in front of the extension is by Dods. Dods' enclosure of the front verandahs does not survive.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In its present form the building clearly reveals the two major stages in its development.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Theosophical Society Building was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The building is evidence of the former residential and medico-residential character of Wickham Terrace.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''

The former Callender House is one of the few remaining 1860s buildings in Brisbane and is a rare example of semi-detached housing which was relatively common in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

As an important example of the work of the architect Robin Dods, which demonstrates his skill in adapting an older building, the former Callender House is significant.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''

As an important example of the work of the architect RS Dods, which demonstrates his skill in adapting an older building, the former Callender House is significant.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''Our Lady of the Thirty-Three''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de los Treinta y Tres}}), also known as the '''Liberator of Uruguay''', is a title of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the Patroness of [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="John XXIII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sanctuary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iglesiacatolica.org.uy/santuario-virgen-de-los-treinta-y-tres/ |title=Sanctuary to the Virgin of the Thirty-Three|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher=[[Roman Catholic Church in Uruguay]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This image dates from the 18th century and is of [[Guaraní people|Guarani]] origin. It was venerated by the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] in 1825.&lt;ref name="John XXIII"/&gt; In 1857, one of them, General [[Manuel Oribe]], presented a [[Votive crown|golden crown as a gift]] to the Virgin.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocaciones.org/ame/uruguay.htm Our Lady of the Thirty-Three]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the image was solemnly crowned by bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Humberto Tonna|es}}.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt; Soon afterwards, Pope [[John XXIII]] declared her [[patron saint]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref name="John XXIII"&gt;[http://www.corazones.org/maria/america/uruguay_33.htm Virgin of the Thirty-Three] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 1930, [[Pope Pius XI]] formally declared [[Our Lady of Lujan]] as the [[Patroness]] of [[Uruguay]]. The Papal document was signed by Cardinal [[Eugenio Pacelli]], the future [[Pope Pius XII]]. &lt;ref&gt;Pius XI, Papam.  ARGENTINAE REIPUBLICAE, ITEMQUE URUGUAYANAE ET PARAGUAYANAE CAELESTIS PATRONA DECLARATUR BEATA VIRGO MARIA IMMACULATA, SUB TITULO   DE LUJAN  . PIUS PP. XI Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. — Argentinae Reipublicae intra fines in civitate Lujan nuncupata, conspicua exstat imago Beatae Mariae Virginis Immaculatae quam christifideles non modo regionis Argentinae sed finitimarum quoque de Uruguay ac de Paraguay Rerumpubücarum sub titulo Nostrae Dominae de Lujan a tribus saeculis continenti pietate devotioneque maxima venerantur. Iam Decessores Nostri, precibus Episcopi de Plata benigne concedentes, ipsam Nostram Dominam de Xtujan dioecesis de Plata principalem Patronam declararunt, eiusdemque festum cum officio et Missa propriis atque adprobatis die VII mensis Februarii quotannis celebrandum statuerunt. Hodiernus vero Episcopus de Plata nomme quoque aliorum sexdecim Antistitum seu Ordmariorum, qui in memoratis Rebuspublicis dominicum fidelium gregem moderantur, humillimis enixis que supplicationibus Nos rogat, ut eadem Beata Virgo Immaculata de Lujan, principalis tum Argentinae tum Uruguayanae tum Paraguayanae Reipublicae Patrona declaretur et constituatur. Nos autem ad magis magisque in dies fovendam et augendam earundem regionum populi venerationem ac pietatem erga Beatissimam Mariam Virginem Immaculatam de Lujan, huiusmodi votis ultro libenterque annuendum censuimus. Audito igitur dilecto filio Nostro Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinali Sacrorum Rituum Congregationi Praefecto, omnibus rei momentis sedulo studio perpensis, Litterisque attentis postulatoriis Archiepiscoporum, Episcoporum ceterorumque Antistitum Rerumpublicarum earundem, motu proprio atque ex certa scientia ac matura deliberatione Nostris deque apostolicae Nostrae potestatis plenitudine, praesentium Litterarum tenore perpetuumque in modum Beatissimam Virginem Mariam Immaculatam sub enunciato titulo de Lujan nuncupatam triplicis Argentinae, Uruguayanae et Paraguayanae Reipublicae praecipuam apud Deum Patronam declaramus et constitiumus; indulta prius pro hac benigna Nostra concessione dispensatione a consueta forma, quae per Decretum Sacrae Rituum Congregationis «De Patronis in posterum eligendis » praescripta est. Decernimus praeterea eadem Nostra auctoritate, Litterarum praesentium vi itemque in perpetuum, ut festum eiusdem Sanctissimae Patronae quotannis die VII mensis Februarii, sub Acta Pii PP. XI 157 ritu duplici primae classis cum octava communi et Officio ac Missa propriis et iam adprobatis pro dioecesi de Plata, recolatur. Haec vero mandamus atque edicimus, decernentes praesentes Litteras firmas, validas atque efficaces semper exstare ac permanere, suosque plenos atque integros effectus sortiri atque obtinere; illisque ad quos pertinent, sive pertinere poterunt, nunc et in posterum perpetuo suffragari; sicque rite iudicandum esse ac definiendum; irritumque ex nunc et inane fieri, si quidquam secus super his, a quovis, auctoritate qualibet, scienter sive ignoranter attentari contigerit. Contrariis non obstantibus quibuslibet. Datum Romae apud Sanctum Petrum, sub anulo Piscatoris, die VIII mensis Septembris anno MDCCCCXXX, Pontificatus Nostri nono. E. CARD. PACELLI, a Secretis Status.&lt;/REF&gt;

The image was consecrated by Pope [[John Paul II]] in his visit to Uruguay in 1988.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt;

==Devotion==
The [[Cathedral of Florida]] is the shrine where this image is [[venerate]]d.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt; Ever since the country's independence, there have been [[pilgrimage]]s to it, for instance, in times of [[epidemic|pest]]s. The first National Pilgrimage was in 1908.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt; A very important pilgrimage was carried out by bishop [[Miguel Paternain]] in 1945, covering almost one half of the whole country.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt;

A yearly pilgrimage is held every second Sunday of November.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"/&gt;

==Places of worship==
The Virgin of the Thirty-Three has many churches dedicated to her:
* [[Cathedral of Florida|Cathedral Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Thirty-Three]] in [[Florida, Uruguay|Florida]]
* [[Virgen de los Treinta y Tres, Maldonado|Parish Church of Our Lady of the Thirty-Three]] in [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]]

'''Vishwa Jain Sangathan''' ('''VJS''') is a religious and social service organization of [[Jainism|Jain]]s in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abhinandan Mishra |url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/sibals-wife-changes-meat-units-name-after-jains-protest |title=Sibal’s wife changes meat unit’s name after Jains protest |publisher=Sunday-guardian.com |date=2012-09-30 |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other things, it was involved in the [[Jain minority]] campaign.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jain-body-to-stage-protest-in-delhi-on-dec-18/1036402/ |title=Jain body to stage protest in Delhi on Dec 18 |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was founded in 2005 in Delhi. It organizes various conferences that revolve around Jain community issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/magazines/ahimsatimesshow.php?id=167 |title=Jainism Ahimsa News Religious Non-Violence Celebrities Literature Philosophy Matrimonial Institutions |publisher=Jainsamaj.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;

==Issues==
===Jain minority===
The organization has been involved in securing the status of an independent and minority religion for [[Jainism]] in India.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt; It submitted a petition to the Delhi Government which played a part in Jains getting declared as a minority in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patil, Bal |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=64758 |title=Article Archive &amp;#124; Jain Minority Status Delhi |publisher=Herenow4u.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has also presented memorandums to the Punjab Government for providing the status of a religious minority to Jains in Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/0.2---in-punjab-jains-seek-minority-religion-tag/1027479 |title=0.2% in Punjab, Jains seek minority religion tag |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-11-06 |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also stages protests and rallies to highlight their cause.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;

===Lucknow idol desecration===
VJS also actively protested the desecration of [[Mahavira]]'s idol in Lucknow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahimsasangh.net/delhi-protest-stern-action-against-miscreants-demanded-by-jain-samaj |title=Delhi Protest: Stern action against miscreants demanded by Jain Samaj |publisher=Ahimsa Sangh |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/news/news-updates/1137-protest-meet-against-idol-desceretion-in-lucknow |title=Protest Meet Against Idol Desceretion in Lucknow |publisher=Jainheritagecentres.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
The organization has also campaigned on a number of other issues, including the "Arihant Exports" name issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacenext.org/profiles/blogs/finally-officially-declared-arihant-exports-name-has-been-changed?xg_source=activity |title=Finally officially declared !

{{Nihongo|'''Yasaka Kōshin-dō'''|八坂庚申堂|}}, or in its full name {{Nihongo|'''Daikoku-san Kongō-ji Kōshin-dō'''|大黒山金剛寺庚申堂|''}} is a small temple located in [[Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto|Higashiyama]], [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. The temple can be found in the vicinity of [[Kiyomizu-dera]].

The temple is dedicated to {{nihongo|Kōshin-san|庚申さん}} a nickname of its main worship object {{nihongo|Shōmen Kongō|青面金剛}}, a blue, guardian warrior and to the "[[three wise monkeys]]". They represent the [[Kōshin]] faith. 

In Kōshin belief, Kōshin-san is thought to help all those who strive in their livings, with all their efforts to be good persons. He is also thought to punish the bad.

''Kukurizaru'' is the round, ball shaped talisman made of cloth, representing the good faith monkeys.

==Kukurizaru==
In many places at the temple hang color balls representing Kukurizaru, a monkey with bound feet and hands. In Kōshin belief, it represents the control of the playful and desire-driven creature everyone has inside his body.

The folk faith says that to have a wish granted, you must sacrifice one desire. If you put your desire inside one of the color balls that represent the monkey Kukurizaru, Kōshin will help you to make that desire vanish and because desires are what keep wishes from coming true, your wish will be granted and you will also become a better person.

It is also said that when you feel a desire coming you must put your hands together and recite the Buddhist sutra: ''On deiba yakisya banta banta kakakaka sowaka''. Kukurizaru and Kōshin-san will hear and will come to help you.

There are old traditions and beliefs regarding monkeys in Japan. Monkeys are considered kind spirits protecting us and our homes from evil spirits and  harmful intentions. The three monkeys in the attitude of "not hearing, not seeing, not talking" are a part of the Kōshin faith.
