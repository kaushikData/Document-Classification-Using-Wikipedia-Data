The '''2018 education workers' strikes in the United States''' began on February 22, 2018, after local activists dragged the West Virginia state leadership of the West Virginia branches of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association into holding a strike vote. The strike—which ended when teachers returned to their classrooms on March 7—inspired similar, statewide strikes in [[2018 Oklahoma teachers' strike|Oklahoma]] and [[2018 Arizona teachers' strike|Arizona]]. It also inspired smaller-scale protests by school staff in Kentucky, North Carolina, Colorado, and led to a [[2018 DeKalb County School District bus drivers' strike|school bus driver strike]] in Georgia. Additionally, around this time, [[adjunct professors]] at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in Richmond, Virginia [[VCUarts adjunct workers' protests|protested over pay]].

Motivations for the strikes include low wages for teachers and support staff, inadequate school budgets, overcrowded classrooms, and other  problems. The strikes varied in their levels of success, with West Virginia considered mostly successful, where Oklahoman teachers received relatively few concessions.

==Origins and overview==
{{update|date=June 2018}}
Discussions of a strike in West Virginia began in early 2018. In the first week of February, teachers staged "walk-ins" at schools and some protested at the West Virginia Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/371989-hundreds-of-teachers-hold-walkout-protest-in-west-virgina|title=Hundreds of teachers hold walkout, protest in West Virginia|last=Delk|first=Josh|date=2 February 2018|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike proved successful, and inspired those in other states to strike as well.&lt;ref name="Rios Mother Jones"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/educators-across-the-us-are-using-west-virginias-teachers-strike-to-inspire-their-own-battle-plans/|title=Educators Across the US Are Using the West Virginia Teachers’ Strike to Inspire Their Own Battle Plans – Mother Jones|last=Rios|first=Edwin|date=23 March 2018|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early April, Oklahoma became the [[2018 Oklahoma teachers' strike|second state to strike]], making it the first time a teacher's strike was held in the state since 1990.&lt;ref name=intercept&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/oklahoma-teacher-strike-west-virginia/|title=TEACHER UNREST SPREADS TO OKLAHOMA, WHERE EDUCATORS ARE “DESPERATE FOR A SOLUTION”|last=Cohen|first=Rachel|date=March 6, 2018|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike lasted for 10 days, from April 2-12, after teacher salaries were increased by $6,000 and support staff salaries were increased by $1,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/arizona-teachers-vote-statewide-strike-180420075924512.html|title=US: Arizona teachers vote for first-ever statewide strike|date=April 20, 2018|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April, teachers in Arizona and in Colorado went on strike. The [[2018 Colorado teachers' strike|Colorado strike]] began on April 27&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools in Arizona and Colorado set to stay closed due to teacher strike|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arizona-education/schools-in-arizona-and-colorado-set-to-stay-closed-due-to-teacher-strike-idUSKBN1I11MJ|website=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|accessdate=April 30, 2018|date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on May 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pueblo teachers reach tentative agreement with district for 2 percent pay hike|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/05/12/pueblo-teacher-strike-is-over|website=[[Denver Post]]|accessdate=November 30, 2018|date=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the [[2018 Arizona teachers' strike|Arizona Strike]] lasted from April 26 to May 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Snow |first1=Anita |last2=Tang |first2=Terry |title=Arizona teachers end walkout after governor signs off on 20 percent raise |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-arizona-teacher-protests-20180503-story.html |website=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was reported that teachers in North Carolina could be next to strike, making it the fifth state to have a teachers' strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elk|first1=Mike|title=North Carolina Teachers to Strike in May – Louisiana Teachers Could Follow – Georgia Bus Drivers Fired for Striking|url=http://paydayreport.com/north-carolina-teachers-to-strike-in-may-louisiana-teachers-could-follow-georgia-bus-drivers-fired-for-striking/|website=paydayreport.com|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the state being ranked 41st in the nation in salaries for teachers, and per pupil spending at negative 12 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Tamara|title=Report: North Carolina ranks 37th in nation for teacher pay|url=http://www.wnct.com/news/local-news/a-new-report-suggests-north-carolina-could-be-the-next-state-to-see-teacher-strikes/1151839964|website=[[WNCT-TV]]|publisher=[[Nexstar Media Group]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it was reported that teachers in North Carolina have seen a five percent decrease in salaries since 2008. Furthermore, teachers hired after January 1, 2021, will not receive health benefits, along with teachers having to pay $10,000 per year in out of pocket health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Valerie|title=Could North Carolina’s teachers be next to strike?

Because of a majority of the strikes being in predominantly Republican Party-controlled, conservative states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Deven|title=Not just a ‘red-state revolt’: The story behind the Oklahoma teacher walkout|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2018/04/12/oklahoma-teacher-walkouts-backstory/|website=brookings.edu|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strikes have been referred to as the "Red State Revolt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=Matt|title=Red-state revolt continues: Teachers strike in Oklahoma and protest in Kentucky|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-teachers-spending-20180402-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[tronc]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=Bill|title=Arizona teachers walk out of their poorly equipped classrooms|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/26/us/arizona-teacher-walkout-weir/index.html|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jamieson|first1=Dave|last2=Waldron|first2=Travis|title=The Red-State Teacher Revolt Has Been Brewing For Decades|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americas-growing-teacher-strikes-were-decades-in-the-making_us_5ac8f468e4b0337ad1e8979c|website=[[HuffPost]]|publisher=[[Oath Inc.]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has prompted several Republican politicians to concede to their demands, in the run-up to the [[United States elections, 2018|2018 mid-term elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher rebellion puts red-state Republicans on defensive|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-oklahoma-teacher-strike-20180403-story.html|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demands===

Universally, demands included raising pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://splinternews.com/oklahoma-is-the-latest-red-state-where-teachers-are-ris-1824260223|title=Oklahoma Is the Latest Red State Where Teachers Are Rising Up|last=Osberg|first=Molly|date=2 April 2018|publisher=Splinter|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizonaeducatorsunited.com/demands|title=We demand...|publisher=AEU|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oklahoma and West Virginia, respectively sources of [[Oil in Oklahoma|oil]] and [[Economy_of_West_Virginia#Energy|coal]], demands included  financing the increased spending on education through taxation focused on these industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/147266/west-virginia-teachers-strike-takes-aim-coal-gas|title=The West Virginia Teachers’ Strike Takes Aim at Coal and Gas|last=Jones|first=Sarah|date=2 March 2018|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/oklahoma-teacher-strike-education-funding|title=The Oklahoma Strike Is At a Crossroads|last=Blanc|first=Eric|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Jacobin|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anchor paper''' is a sample essay response to an [[Essay#As an educational tool|assignment or test question requiring an essay]], primarily in an educational effort. Unlike more traditional educational assessments such as [[multiple choice]], essays cannot be graded with an answer key, as no strictly correct or incorrect solution exists. The anchor paper provides an example to the person reviewing or [[Grading (education)|grading]] the assignment of a well-written response to the essay prompt. Sometimes examiners prepare a range of anchor papers, to provide examples of responses at different levels of merit.

== Purpose of Anchor Papers ==
Anchor papers are frequently used in [[standards based assessment]], [[authentic assessment]] and [[holistic grading]], where essay prompts are more common. They are especially used when grading essay responses on a mass scale, such as by graders working for the [[College Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/testing/sat-reasoning/scores/qa College Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, any particular grading project only employs a few anchor papers. Educators have commented that matching the diversity of responses against one or two papers is often difficult, resulting in inconsistencies among graders working on the same project.

In 1937, Anchor Paper collaborated with the University of Minnesota, Cargill, and Mosinee Paper Mill to engineer the first official seed germination testing paper.

A report by experts from Arizona State University stated that guidelines for scoring are adopted for quality assessment of writing samples meant for the preparation of performance evaluation. Anchor papers stand for scoring points defined in the directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popp|first=Sharon E. Osborn|last2=Ryan|first2=Joseph M.|last3=Thompson|first3=Marilyn S.|date=July 2009|title=The critical role of anchor paper selection in writing assessment|url=https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-critical-role-of-anchor-paper-selection-in-writing-assessment|journal=Applied Measurement in Education|volume=22|issue=3|pages=255–271|doi=10.1080/08957340902984026|issn=0895-7347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Tennessee, the State’s education department formulated writing policies for (2017-2018) coring student responses from the writing section of the TN Ready Assessment. The Department provided guidelines, so educators can train students for the Assessment’s writing category even if these policies were not prepared for use as instructional resources. The marked anchor papers of students show how procedures are employed as individual papers representing multiple performance levels. Anchor papers facilitate better understanding of writing rules and guide discussions regarding modifications and adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tn.gov/education/assessment/tcap-writing-rubrics.html|title=Writing Rubrics for 2017-18|website=www.tn.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the school building was on Mr. Panda's land at the north side of the Bishnupur Market and Hospital.&lt;ref name="board"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Of Secondary Education|url=http://www.bseodisha.nic.in|website=www.bseodisha.nic.in|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bommersvik''' is a '''Union college''' ({{lang-sv|italic=yes|Förbundskola}} from Förbund meaning ''union'' or ''association'' and skola meaning ''school'' or ''college'') built by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Youth League]] (SSU) and is situated outside the municipality of [[Södertälje]] in Sweden. Parts of the college grounds encompass a [[conference centre]] and recreational facilities that are extensively used by social democratic organizations both in Sweden and abroad. An art gallery can also be found on the grounds.

==Mission==
[[Image:Per Albin Hansson föreläser Bommersvik.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Per Albin Hansson]] (Prime Minister of Sweden from 1932 to 1946) delivering an outdoor lecture on Bommersvik grounds. Summer 1940]]
The college was formed because the SSU and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] planned to educate and train the next generation of trade union and [[Politician|political leaders]] by establishing an institution of higher learning with the mission to instruct these young social democrats on political matters such as trade union agreements and laws. Today it offers many popular courses each year on political science subjects. The curriculum is different from a regular [[political science]] academy in that the content of the courses is primarily focused on issues concerning the politics of the [[labour movement]].

The backgrounds of the professors teaching at the college vary and, depending on the course, lecturers can be recruited from the party and from the unions and labour movement. It is not uncommon for prime ministers or cabinet ministers to lecture on subjects of political interest. The Swedish Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]] lectured at Bommersvik as early as summer 1940.

Many foreign lecturers also visit the college from time to time, starting with the early example of [[Willy Brandt]] who lectured on 1 December 1940 about the problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi]] Germany and the occupied countries at the start of [[World War II]].

In 2010, the college began cooperating with [[Uppsala University]] so that students from the University can now attend [[rhetoric]] classes at Bommersvik.

==History==
[[Image:Bommersvik flaggor.JPG|thumb|right|200px|left|Colonel Lundeberg extracted a promise from the SSU that the [[Swedish flag]] would always be raised higher than the SSU [[Banner#Trade union banners|banner]]. This promise has been kept by the SSU ever since.]]
In 1934, ideas about creating a college for the Youth League began to form after Ivan Ohlson, one of the great leaders of the Swedish Labor movement, became inspired following a study trip to the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] and in 1936 work commenced to find an appropriate building. This was familiar territory for the SSU since the association already had gone through a similar process with another school, the Brunnsviks adult education college in Ludvika. Ivan Ohlson went on a late summer day to Bommersvik, with its beautiful natural surroundings, was sufficiently impressed with the place and recommended it as the future location for the school. His recommendation was officially adopted and in 1937 the decision was formalised. Ivan Ohlson is considered to be the founder of Bommersvik and one of the school's halls is named in his honour.

It was decided, after a search, that the school would be built on the grounds of a local farm. This property was owned by [[Colonel]] Lundeberg.

Only through a fundraising drive among the members and other organisations within the [[Labor Movement]], including the social democratic women's association, the party and trade unions etc. could the Socialist Party and the SSU find sufficient funds to buy Colonel Lundeberg's farm. The colonel, however, thought that selling the farm directly to the SSU was a sensitive matter, (since he was a military man with no association with the socialists), so, officially, Ivan Ohlson bought the farm instead, for 127,000 sek and a down payment of 20 000 which was a lot of money at that time. Colonel Lundeberg also extracted a promise from the SSU that the [[Swedish flag]] would always be raised higher than the SSU [[Banner#Trade union banners|banner]]. This promise has been kept by the SSU ever since.

The opening ceremony was held on 14 September 1937 with about 800 SSU members and party officials on the grounds. There was also high pressure on the officials involved because, among other things, of the press coverage of the event and of the political pressure by the social democrats. Algot Andersson became the first manager of the college.

Another important event took place when [[Tage Erlander]] withdrew in 1969 as party leader and Prime Minister, and his successor in both positions, [[Olof Palme]], ordered an honorary residence be built for him on the grounds of Bommersvik, in recognition of Erlander's valuable and lengthy service as Prime Minister of Sweden. The house is called even to this day "Erlandervillan" meaning ''Erlander's villa''. There, he and his wife Aina lived until his death in 1985.

==Culture and art==
[[Image:The Utøya-monument at Bommersvik (14658741627).jpg|thumb|Monument on Bommersvik of Victims of Utoya massacre in 2011.]]
[[Image:Olof Palme statsminister, tidigt 70-tal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Olof Palme]] (pictured) donated the majority of the vases from the Ming Dynasty]]
Social democratic Prime Ministers have brought, from time to time, [[work of art|objets d'art]] and other curios on their travels to the college in order to enhance its culture and [[fine art|art]] collections. For example, [[Olof Palme]] has donated to the school the majority of the vases from the [[Ming Dynasty]], the stuffed remains of a tiger and a gold statue of an [[Inca]] god. Various countries have also donated items for the school's collection. Perhaps the most controversial present was from [[North Vietnam]], namely the part of an American airplane shot down during the [[Vietnam war]]. This piece exists as a display case exhibit at the school.

In the college, students learn about [[criticism]] of society and there also exist pictures of famous artists that created fine portraits of well-known social democrats. There is a large library with books about policy and from authors that describe the workers' lives in Sweden, the so-called ''proletärförfattare,'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]:'' proletär'' meaning ''[[proletarian]]'' and ''författare'' meaning ''author,'' i.e. authors for the [[proletariat]]), such as [[Eyvind Johnson]] and [[Harry Martinson]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1974.

===Significant art exhibits===
* One of the most well-known sculptures in Bommersvik is Arne Jones's "Katedralen" (''Cathedral''), also featured on Bommervik's logo.&lt;ref name="Katedralen picture"&gt;[http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=60 Katedralen picture from the Bommersvik website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622062241/http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=60 |date=22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Torchlight processions", depicting the infamous [[Triumph of the Will|Nazi torchlight marches]], by artist Eric Johnsson. SSU received this as a present in 1937 as an indication of gratitude. Eric had among other things been forced to escape from [[Nazi Germany]]. SSU had criticized the [[Nazis]] in Germany long before the parent party did so in public.
[[Image:Bommersvik.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Bommersvik's main building: the Manor]]
* Tage Erlander and his legacy have always been important to the school and there are many portraits of him by artists such as Bo Beskow, Stig Claesson and Willem de Geer.
* The large oil painting "Proletarian fighting will" (Swedish: ''Proletär kampvilja'' the latter from ''kamp'' meaning ''fight'' and ''vilja'' meaning ''will'') by Albin Amelin that hangs in the dining room is also a gift. The Amelin family wanted it to be displayed in a prominent place where many socialist supporters and members could view it.
* A copy of Carl Elds' sculpture “[[Youth]]” is exhibited while the original is left in the National museum.
* Folke Allards' [[aquarelle]] "Bommersvik i sommarskrud" (translated as: ''Bommersvik in summer clothes'') is also a gift.
* “Light and mood” by [[Gösta Werner (painter)]] is an [[abstract painting]] and an attempt to expand artistic horizons and to depart from the tradition of [[socialist realism]].
* Sculptor [[Willy Gordon]] created "The meeting" in [[Scale model|miniature]] and the original exists in [[Östermalmstorg]] in Stockholm. ''The meeting,'' ({{lang-sv|Mötet}}), is a controversial group of two modern sculptures representing a naked male figure bearing a piece of meat on his shoulders before a recumbent female figure.
* Ely Maoz, a well-known artist from [[Chile]], painted a picture that hangs on a wall of the wing together with some SSU members' paintings. The painting is called "Freedom for all and Peace for the whole world". It was given to the school as a gesture of appreciation since the SSU criticized the [[Augusto Pinochet|dictatorship in Chile]].

==Symbolic value==
[[Image:Tage Erlander, Bommersvik 1948.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tage Erlander]] ( Prime Minister of Sweden from 1946 to 1969.) dictating a letter to his secretary Maria Nyström in the natural surroundings of Bommersvik. Summer 1948.]]
Bommersvik possesses symbolic value for social democrats worldwide, and has become something of a socialist [[Mecca]] for them. This is also true for those who choose to tie the knot in Bommersvik. For example, two famous locals, Roger Möller and Gerd married there in 1978. Roger Möller later went on to become manager of the school. Many high echelon social democratic party officials have traditionally visited the place and many important meetings were scheduled in Bommersvik. Decisions such as, for example about ATP, have been discussed and analyzed at Bommersvik.

Bommersvik is a place that is a [[sanctuary]] and a source of inspiration for many, while also providing a recreation haven for social democrats. SSU member Lotta Axelsson described Bommersvik this way: ''Bommersvik inspires new ideas, and provides possibilities for recreation and strolling in a natural setting and for rest. There is actually little discussion about socialist issues during leisure activities, as visitors long for going back to nature.''

Social democrat [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] and government ministers come to Bommersvik when they need inspiration. For example, [[Ingvar Carlsson]] went to Bommersvik after the assassination of [[Olof Palme]] in order to relax there before presenting his new cabinet and the [[speech from the throne]].

==International conferences==
After the “[[Milan]]” building with its [[:wikt:conference|conference]] and lecture halls and interpreter facilities was completed in 1978 it was natural that the [[Socialist International]] organisation would now book conferences for Bommersvik.&lt;ref name="Milan pictures"&gt;[http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68 Milan pictures from the Bommersvik website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828004622/http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68 |date=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Milan building and its facilities were inaugurated during the European Labor movement's conference in 1979, with a return engagement in 1985. Both conferences were convened by Palme, the Social Democratic Party leader. Many famous social democrats from other countries have visited Bommersvik through the years, including [[Shimon Peres]], [[Neil Kinnock]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], [[Kalevi Sorsa]], [[Mário Soares]], [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Bruno Kreisky]]. In addition, many other international conferences have also been held there, such as, for example, the [[International Union of Socialist Youth#IUSY Congresses|1989 congress]] of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] and the 2003 congress of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ([[ECOSY]]). Anders Lindberg became the first Swedish president of ECOSY when he was elected by this congress.

==The Bommersvik Declarations==
Bommersvik played a central role in [[international politics]] in 1995 and 2002 when the two conventions of the Elected [[Legislature|Representatives]] of the [[Myanmar|Union of Burma]] took place and the following two landmark declarations were issued:&lt;ref name="Burma Library"&gt;[http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199507/msg00263.html Burma Library website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landmark Declarations from Burma Lawyers' Council"&gt;[http://www.blc-burma.org/html/Declaration%20treaty%20agreements/bsdeclara2.html Burma Lawyers' Council characterizes Declarations as Landmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bommersvik Declaration I===
In 1995, during the first convention that lasted from 16–23 July, the [[National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma|Representatives]] issued the ''Bommersvik [[Declaration of independence|Declaration]] I'' with the following preamble:&lt;ref name="Bommersvik Declaration from NCGUB website"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_1995# |title=Bommersvik Declaration from NCGUB website |access-date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070916/http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_1995# |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eastern Slavic name|Vladimirovich|Volkoff}}
'''Boris Vladimirovich Volkoff''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born '''Boris Vladimirovich Baskakoff'''; April 24, 1900 – March 11, 1974) was a Canadian-Russian ballet dancer, director, choreographer and [[ballet master]]. After studying dance in [[Warsaw]] and Moscow he defected from Russia and eventually settled in [[Toronto]]. He created the Boris Volkoff School of Dance which trained ballet dancers, and the Boris Volkoff Ballet Company which is arguably considered the first [[ballet company]] in Canada. He gave his dancers and studio to the [[National Ballet of Canada]] to raise the profile of Canadian ballet. He regretted this decision and attempted to revive his company which ended in failure. He was appointed as a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1973, one year before his death.

== Early life and dance career ==

Volkoff, birth name Boris Vladimirovich Baskakoff, was born on April 24, 1900, in Schepotievo, Russia.&lt;ref name=CEBV&gt;{{cite web | last =Crabb | first =Michael | title = Boris Vladimirovich Volkoff | website = The Canadian Encyclopedia| publisher =Historica Canada | date =January 28, 2014 | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/boris-vladimirovich-volkoff/ | accessdate = June 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was nine Volkoff joined his brother Igor in [[Warsaw]] to dance and perform for the Russian Army. He alternated between using this birth name and performing using the last name Volkoff, his mother's family name.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt;

Volkoff attended the [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography]] and later danced with Mordkin Ballet&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt; and the Moscow State Youth Ballet.&lt;ref name=ArtsAlive&gt;{{cite web | title = Boris Volkoff | website = Arts Alive| publisher =National Arts Centre | url = http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=77 | accessdate = June 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a Siberian tour Volkoff defected from Russia and went to Shanghai.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt; He joined the Shanghai Variety Ballet&lt;ref name=ArtsAlive /&gt; and toured with Russian expatriates to various Asian countries and the United States. He danced with [[Adolph Bolm]]'s company until his visa expired and Volkoff was smuggled into Canada in 1929. He became [[ballet master]] at Jack Arthur's Uptown Theatre in [[Toronto]] and choreographed short dances that were performed between films. It was during this time that he decided to use Volkoff as his stage name.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt;

== Choreographic works in Toronto ==

In 1930 Volkoff opened the Boris Volkoff School of Dance, which operated until 1974.&lt;ref name=Passion&gt;{{cite book | last =Neufeld | first =James | title =Passion to Dance: The National Ballet of Canada | publisher =Dundurn | date =2011 | location =Toronto | pages = | url =https://books.google.ca/books?id=9Eq7mIUeOh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn =1-4597-0122-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 he created ice ballet versions of [[Swan Lake]] and [[Prince Igor]] with the [[Toronto Skating Club]].&lt;ref name=ArtsAlive /&gt; He continued creating works for the club for fourteen seasons.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt;

Volkoff brought his dance troupe to the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] to compete in an international dance competition.&lt;ref name=Eyes&gt;{{cite book | last =MacDonald | first =David B. | last2=DeCoste | first2=Mary-Michelle | title =Europe in Its Own Eyes, Europe in the Eyes of the Other | publisher =Wilfrid Laurier University Press | date =April 23, 2014 | location = | pages =322 | url =https://books.google.ca/books?id=16fmAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover| isbn =1-55458-867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His company performed two new ballets called ''Mon-Ka-Ta'' and ''Mala'', both based on [[Inuit]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] legends.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt; The pieces were given five "honourable mentions".&lt;ref name=ArtsAlive /&gt;

In 1938 the troupe that traveled to [[Berlin]] became the Volkoff Canadian Ballet, and later the Boris Volkoff Ballet Company. This company is sometimes considered the first Canadian ballet company.&lt;ref name=ArtsAlive /&gt; The company performed in many notable venues such as [[Massey Hall]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt; Volkoff co-founded the [[Canadian Ballet Festival]] with [[Gweneth Lloyd]] in 1948 to showcase the talent of Canadian ballet dancers&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;{{cite web | last =Duggan | first =Brittany | title = Father of Canadian ballet commemorated with historic plaque| website = The Dance Current | date =January 7, 2010 | url = http://www.thedancecurrent.com/news-article/father-canadian-ballet-commemorated-historic-plaque| accessdate = May 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkoff Canadian Ballet was one of three companies to perform at its inaugural event.&lt;ref name=ArtsAlive /&gt;

On March 2, 1949, Volkoff premiered ''The Red Ear of Corn,'' a ballet in two acts. The name refers to red ears of corn found in northern [[Quebec]] by huskers. The piece was inspired by Native American and [[French-Canadian music|French Canadian dance music]]. The musical score was composed by [[John Weinzweig]].&lt;ref name=CERed&gt;{{cite web | last =Morey | first =Carl | title = Red Ear of Corn | website = The Canadian Encyclopedia| publisher =Historica Canada | date =November 13, 2012 | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/red-ear-of-corn-emc/ | accessdate = June 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Ballet of Canada ==

Unable to secure stable funding for the Volkoff Canadian Ballet&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt; Volkoff worked with other Canadian ballet enthusiasts to create the [[National Ballet of Canada]]. Volkoff and [[Gweneth Lloyd]] both wanted to run the new company but they reached a compromise by bringing [[Celia Franca]] to be its new artistic director. Volkoff became the company's first resident choreographer.&lt;ref name=Passion /&gt;

Volkoff gave his studio and dancers to the National Ballet and taught the male dancers of the company.&lt;ref name=Passion /&gt; He regretted this decision as he disliked [[Celia Franca]]'s "English" dancing style and believed ballet should be performed in the Russian style.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt;

In 1952 Volkoff and [[David Adams (dancer)|David Adams]] created Toronto Theatre Ballet and became co-artistic directors. The company featured many of the founding members of the National Ballet.&lt;ref name=Passion /&gt; He attempted to revive his company in 1953 and 1967 but these ended in failure.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt;

== Personal life ==

Volkoff married Janet Baldwin, a student at his ballet studio. She became his business associate in the operation of his studio.&lt;ref name=Passion /&gt;

== Death ==

Volkoff died March 11, 1974, in Toronto.&lt;ref name=CEBV /&gt;

== Awards ==

Volkoff was appointed as a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=2343&amp;t=12&amp;ln=Volkoff|title=Order of Canada citation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Heritage Toronto]] unveiled a plaque commemorating Volkoff. It was installed at the site of Volkoff's studio at 771 Yonge Street.&lt;ref name=Heritage /&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">'''Designated Special Character schools''' were created under the [[New Zealand]] Education Act of 1989&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM175959.html Education Act 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]] to establish two types of special character schools under Sections 155 and 156 of the act. The Ministry of Education [https://www.education.govt.nz/school/running-a-school/managing-the-network-of-schools/changing-your-school-structure/becoming-a-section-156-designated-character-school/ defines a Designated Special Character School] as "a state school that has a particular character which sets it apart from ordinary state schools and kura kaupapa Māori. The only students who may enrol at a designated character school are those whose parents accept the particular character of the school."

==Section 155 schools==
[[Kura Kaupapa Māori]] ([[Māori language|Māori-language]] immersion schools), where the principal language of instruction is [[Māori language|Māori]]. Kura Kaupapa Māori differ from the earlier [[Kohanga reo]] in that Kohanga reo are [[Language Immersion|immersion]] [[kindergartens]] whereas Kura Kaupapa Māori are immersion schools.

* [[Te Kura o Waikare]]
* [[Nga Taiatea Wharekura]]
* [[Te Kura o Hirangi]]
* [[Te Kura o Torere]]
* [[Te Kura Toitu o Te Whaiti-nui-a-Toi]]
* [[Te Kura Kaupapa Motuhake o Tawhiuau]]
* [[Mana Tamariki]]
* [[Te Kura o Te Whakatupuranga Rua Mano]]
* [[Te Kura Maori o Porirua]]

In 2018, some of New Zealand's twelve approved Partnership Schools (a version of charter school) successfully applied to become designated special character schools after the newly formed coalition government set about removing legislation from the New Zealand Education Act allowing for charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1809/S00211/all-charter-schools-now-approved.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Section 156 schools==
These are identified as ''Designated Character Schools'', under Section 156.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverylearning.co.nz/setting-up-state-school.html#156|title=Setting up a State School|last=unattributed|date=n.d.|publisher=unidentified|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special character of schools established under this section is not specified in the Act, and parents may propose any desirable special character as long as no other local school is already delivering an education reflecting the same special character.

'''Docsity''' is an online [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]] network for worldwide students and professionals. Originally launched in 2010 exclusively for [[Italy|Italian]] students, it became an international website in mid-2012 by opening to worldwide students. It is advertisement-free and user-generated. Its features include document sharing, networking, news and blogs, video sharing, and a question and answer section.

Docsity provides targeted content and user experience adaptations to users coming from Italy, United States, United Kingdom, [[Balkans]], Spain, [[South America]], Russia, [[Brazil]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] speaking countries.

==History==

Docsity started as an initiative by two boys from [[Turin, Italy]] who were displeased by the amount of time a student had to spend on finding the correct study notes for any course. This was a very common issue with university and college students. Trying to address the problem, they started Docsity.com where students could share and view notes for free and also could discuss them with one another. The idea was greatly appreciated by the education community in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facoltà DI CLICCARE|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2010-06-10/facolta-cliccare-081400.shtml?uuid=AYA7IPxB&amp;fromSearch|work=Il Sole 24 Ore|publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore|author=Marco Ferrando|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[La Stampa]] called Docsity the fastest growing social network of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web mistress|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2011/09/16/torinosette/rubriche/web-mistress/web-mistress-PmNGIm2HWH7fdHCkxcOIhN/pagina.html|work=La Stampa|publisher=LaStampa|author=Alessandra C|location=Italy|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success in Italy it launched worldwide in June 2012.

==Features==

* Document sharing: students can share their study notes and all their university-related documents for other students to search, view and download.
* Networking: it help students to meet with other students through friendships, have fun studying, interact on each other's walls and get notifications on friends' activities.  
* News and Blogs: students can read various articles on everyday student life and become authors by submitting blog posts.
* Video sharing: students can share and catalog academic videos from [[YouTube]] or upload their own videos for other students to view.
* Q &amp; A section: students from around the world can interact and help one another by answering questions and voting others contributions.

Docsity has around 300,000+ study notes shared by students, 400,000+ Questions and Answers, 500+ published articles, 2,000+ academic videos and 500,000+ university students&lt;sup&gt;(Unofficial figures)&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Technology==

Docsity allows its users to upload, download and share notes (including .doc, .pdf, .ppt and popular image formats). Its question and answer section allows students to ask and answer questions, and to vote, rate and comment on the answers. The video section offers videos catalogued or uploaded by students and can be searched by subject, course and type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Videos :Docsity.com|url=http://www.docsity.com/en/all-videos|work=Docsity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news and blog section contains news articles by university students on numerous topics related to education and everyday student life.

The website offers a star rating and comments feature on all its content for the users for their feedback. These ratings are used to rank the content in the charts.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} Docsity allows users to post on walls, reply to comments, request friendships, search users from specific universities and areas of interest.

==History==
State-funded schools in the United States use [[content-control software]] to restrict their students' access to pornographic websites, in accordance with the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref name="fcc"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act |title = Children's Internet Protection Act |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 2014-07-16 |website = FCC.gov |publisher = [[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The products most commonly used to do this filtering treat websites that offer information about [[LGBT]] topics and organizations as pornography, even though these websites do not contain sexually explicit content.&lt;ref name="dfm"/&gt; One such commonly filtered website is [[The Trevor Project]],&lt;ref name="makessense"&gt;{{cite news |last = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |first =  |title = ACLU's 'Don't Filter Me' campaign makes sense |newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] |location = Los Angeles |date = 2011-09-08 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/08/opinion/la-ed-gaysites-20110908 |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a website devoted to suicide prevention among at-risk LGBT youths.  The [[White House]] publicly praised the Trevor Project in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Ring |first = Trudy |title = Trevor Project Honored at White House |newspaper = The Advocate |date = 2011-08-25 |url = http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2011/08/25/trevor-project-honored-white-house |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Trevor Project |publisher = whitehouse.gov |date = 2011-08-25 |url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/suicide-prevention/the-trevor-project |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sites that are commonly blocked include [[GLAAD]],&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; [[PFLAG]] (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), the [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (also honored by the White House),&lt;ref name="makessense"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Ring |first = Trudy |title = White House Honors GLSEN |newspaper = The Advocate |date = 2011-08-31 |url = http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2011/08/31/white-house-honors-glsen |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network |publisher = whitehouse.gov |date = 2011-08-31 |url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/suicide-prevention/GLSEN |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Matthew Shepard Foundation]], [[DignityUSA]],&lt;ref name="judgeslaps"&gt;{{cite news |last = Harris |first = Joe |title = Judge Slaps School for Blocking Gay Websites |newspaper = Courthouse News Service |date = 2012-02-21 |url = http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/02/21/44029.htm |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Day of Silence]],&lt;ref name="eschool"/&gt; [[Campus Pride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Berger |first = Judson |title = ACLU Sues Missouri School System for Censoring Gay Advocacy Websites |newspaper = [[Fox News Channel]] |date = 2011-08-16 |url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/16/aclu-sues-missouri-school-system-for-censoring-gay-advocacy-websites/ |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Human Rights Campaign]] (the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Fenston |first = Jacob |title = ACLU Targets Camdenton Over LGBT Sites |newspaper = [[KBIA]] |date = 2011-09-26 |url = http://kbia.org/post/aclu-targets-camdenton-over-lgbt-sites |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A student attempting to access these sites is usually confronted by a page warning, "You have been denied access as it is characterized as LBGT. Your Internet usage is monitored and logged."&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt;

Some [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] are supportive of blocks on these and similar websites since they consider them to be promoting the so-called "[[homosexual agenda]]".&lt;ref name="makessense"/&gt;

Filtering tools prevent that students from accessing websites related to positive LGBT organizations often permit access to sites that promote an anti-LGBT viewpoint, sites aimed at convincing LGBT people to change their sexual orientation, or sites that can be considered [[hate speech]] against LGBT people.  Websites not generally blocked by this kind of filtering include the [[Family Research Council]] (an American conservative Christian group and lobbying organization), and the [[National Organization for Marriage]] (a political organization dedicated to working against the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States),&lt;ref name="makessense"/&gt; [[Exodus International]], and [[People Can Change]] (both of which advocate [[conversion therapy]] to help gays change their sexual orientation).&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last = Winerip |first = Michael |title = School District Told to Replace Web Filter Blocking Pro-Gay Sites |newspaper = [[New York Times]] |location = New York City |date = 2012-03-26 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/education/missouri-school-district-questioned-over-anti-gay-web-filter.html |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither the [[American Psychiatric Association]] or the [[American Psychological Association]] consider [[conversion therapy]] a legitimate medical practice or homosexuality to be a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights |last = Yoshino |date = 2011-11-02 |publisher = Random House |isbn = 978-0375760211 |chapter = Gay Conversion |quote = Today, conversion therapy grows scarce.

Companies that filter content for schools often include anti-LGBT content in their "religion" category.&lt;ref name="judgeslaps"/&gt;  

Filtering software can also block content beyond the websites themselves. Students would, for example, be permitted to read [[Bowers v. Hardwick]], the 1986 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that upheld a Georgia law to criminalize sodomy, while prevented from reading [[Lawrence v. Texas]], the 2003 Supreme Court ruling that asserted [[sodomy law]]s were unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] contends that this filtering is discriminatory and violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of students in public schools.&lt;ref name="dfm"/&gt;

In February 2011, the ACLU launched the ''Don't Filter Me'' project, to combat this censorship and discrimination in viewpoint that was happening in state-funded schools.&lt;ref name="dfm"/&gt;

==Response==
Because of the Don't Filter Me project's efforts, some software providers who sell these filters implemented changes in their products. Companies such as [[Lightspeed Systems]] and [[Fortinet]] took action on their own and changed how their products categorize the websites in question.&lt;ref name="eschool"&gt;{{cite news |last = Zwang |first = Jenna |title = Companies respond to ACLU’s ‘Don’t Filter Me’ campaign |newspaper = eSchool News |date = 2011-06-16 |url = http://www.eschoolnews.com/2011/06/16/companies-respond-to-aclus-dont-filter-me-campaign/ |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of school districts took steps to unblock LGBT-themed content that is not sexually explicit. The [[Rowland Unified School District]] and [[Oroville Union High School District]] were among the first to take action because of the work of the Don't Filter Me project.&lt;ref name="makessense"/&gt;

Many other school districts followed suit and updated their filtering software to allow LGBT sites to be accessed from school computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Quillen |first = Ian |title = ACLU Puts Pressure on Districts to Ease Internet Filtering |newspaper = [[Education Week]] |date = 2011-10-17 |url = http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2011/10/19/01filter.h05.html |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Christian groups like [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] urged school districts not to comply with the ACLU's requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Wetzstein |first = Cheryl |title = ACLU battles schools over gay websites |newspaper = [[Washington Times]] |location = Washington, DC |date = 2011-08-29 |url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/29/aclu-battles-schools-over-gay-websites/ |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 the ACLU sued the Camdenton R-III School District of [[Camden County, Missouri]], which had refused to change its filtering software, or the filtering behavior that that software created. This led a federal judge to issue a [[preliminary injunction]] to the district, ordering it to stop using software produced by the company [http://urlblacklist.com/ URL Blacklist] that blocks access to sites discussing LGBT issues. In her decision, Judge [[Nanette Kay Laughrey]] wrote "URL Blacklist systematically allows access to websites expressing a negative viewpoint toward LGBT individuals by categorizing them as 'religion', but filters out positive viewpoints toward LGBT issues by categorizing them as 'sexuality'."&lt;ref name="judgeslaps"/&gt; The school district later settled, and agreed to stop blocking the sites in question, to be monitored for 18 months, and to pay $125,000 in fines and court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = KRMS News |title = ACLU: “Surprised” Camdenton Schools Agreed to Settle |newspaper = [[KRMS]] |date = 2012-03-29 |url = http://www.krmsradio.com/aclu-suprised-camdenton-school-districts-agreed-to-settle/ |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Associated Press |title = Camdenton school district agrees to settlement with ACLU |newspaper = [[KBIA]] |date = 2012-03-29 |url = http://kbia.org/post/camdenton-school-district-agrees-settlement-aclu |accessdate = 2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Duality_(CoP).png|thumb|300px|Adaptation of the taichi symbol for [[Yin and yang]] by {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.]]

In the context of a [[community of practice]], the notion of a '''duality''' is used to capture the idea of the tension between two opposing forces which become a driving force for change and creativity.  Wenger {{Harv|Wenger|1998}} uses the concept of dualities to examine the forces that create and sustain a community of practice.  He describes a duality as "a single conceptual unit that is formed by two inseparable and mutually constitutive elements whose inherent tensions and complementarity give the concept richness and dynamism" {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=66}}.  

Some compare the concept of a duality to that of [[yin and yang]], i.e. two mutually defining opposites.

The opposing entities in a duality need to be viewed from a perspective of balance rather than opposition.  The term implies a dynamism, continual change and mutual adjustment as the tensions that are inherent in dualities can be both creative and constraining. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}} identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice: participation–reification, designed–emergent, identification–negotiability and local–global.

== Participation and reification ==
The ''participation–reification'' duality is concerned with meaning.  Meaning is created through participation and active involvement in some practice.  Reification is a way of making an abstract and concise representation of what is often a complex and frequently messy practice, thus making it easier to share within the community.  Because of its obvious links to [[knowledge management]], the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest in this field {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.

== Designed and emergent ==
The ''designed–emergent'' duality focuses on time and captures the tension between pre-planned and emergent activities.  Designers can plan an activity that is designed to achieve a particular purpose however, some activities emerge through interaction and participation of the community; these are unplanned and may be contrary to what the designers intended.  These give participants the opportunity to (re)negotiate existing meaning.  The designed–emergent duality is often mentioned in relation to the design of on-line learning environments e.g. {{Harv|Barab|MaKinster|Scheckler|2003}}.

== Identification and negotiability ==
The ''identification–negotiability'' duality is concerned with "how the power to define, adapt, or interpret the design is distributed" {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=235}}.  Identification is the process through which individuals build their identities.  This can include not only how individuals perceive themselves but also their right to contribute to and shape the direction of a community as a whole.  Thus, this duality serves to combine both power and belonging in the shaping of the community.

== Local and global ==
The ''local–global'' duality concerns how one CoP relates to another.  The challenge is to share local knowledge that meets the needs of a particular domain in a way that will be of relevance to others who are not involved in it.  Wenger uses the notion of a [[boundary object]], [[brokerage]] {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=106}} and boundary encounters {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002|p=84}} to explain how individuals can establish relationships and learn from other communities.

It arises from a deficit within the [[phoneme]]-to-[[grapheme]] conversion process in a [[Cognition|cognitive]] function specialized in the conversion of the voicing feature of phonemes into graphemes – a distinct function within the phoneme-to-grapheme conversion route. This deficit does not result from impairments in [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory processing]] or in [[Speech disorder|speech production]]. It can occur with completely intact graphemic buffer, phonological output [[lexicon]], phonological output buffer, and allographic stage – the function that processes the voicing feature for writing may be selectively impaired without deficits in other functions of the conversion route. Dyscravia may or may not be accompanied by a parallel [[reading disability]] (i.e. a [[dyslexia]] in which letters denoting [[voiceless]] consonants are pronounced as voiced and vice versa).

'''Educate Girls''' is a [[non-profit organization]] in [[India]] that aims to tackle issues at the root cause of [[gender inequality]] in India’s education system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2011/06/26/stories/2011062663840900.htm, Novel project may improve prospects of girl child education] [[The Hindu]], Jun 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2007, the non-governmental organization has its management and outreach office in [[Mumbai]] and operations in 10 districts across [[Rajasthan]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Since 2007, Educate Girls has worked with over 12,000 government schools, and the introduction of creative learning and teaching techniques in classrooms has consistently shown increased learning outcomes every year.&lt;ref name="Educate Girls Official Website"&gt;[http://www.educategirls.in/educate/What-We-Do.aspx#impact Educate Girls: Official Impact Numbers] Educate Girls, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its inception in 2007, the organization has reached over 3.8 million total beneficiaries, and enrolled close to 120,000 out-of-school girls in school &lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/when-girls-returned-to-the-classroom/1/405279.html, When Girls Returned to the Classroom] India Today, December 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Educate Girls was founded by [[Safeena Husain]].

==Executive summary==
Educate Girls involves and empowers various stakeholders to create a system that promotes and supports girls’ education.

Educate Girls creates [[community ownership]] to help communities to prioritize girls' education.  The model includes the following elements:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educategirls.in/educate/what-we-do.aspx Educate Girls:  What We Do]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Team Balika'''

Team Balika consists of over 8000 community volunteers who work as champions for girls’ education and catalysts for school reform. Team Balika members work in the schools as well as village communities spreading awareness on girl education. They boost enrollment, retention and learning outcomes for all girls. Team Balika is trained in community mobilization &amp; outreach, CLT techniques, leadership, and motivation.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

''''''Community - Led''' Enrollment Plans'''

After identifying out-of-school girls in the area, village meetings are organized to prepare community-led enrollment plans.  Responsibility is distributed between the village leaders, elders, school administrations, Team Balika (Community Volunteers) and Educate Girls' staff to bring the girls back to school.

'''School Management Committees'''

At village meetings, a 12-15 member council is elected for a School Management Committee (SMC).  This consists of parents, teachers and village leaders and is responsible for school governance and administrations.  Educate Girls trains the SMC and provides them with the support to prepare and execute School Improvement Plans (SIPs) and conduct school assessments

'''Creative Learning and Teaching Techniques &amp; Classroom Support'''

Educate Girls trains one teacher per school in Creative Learning &amp; Teaching (CLT) techniques. Tests are conducted before and after training to assess learning levels.  Classroom hand-holding support is provided by Educate Girls staff and trained Team Balika.  As a result of Educate Girls' CLT interventions, over the past 9 years of operations average learning gains of 25-40% have been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://educategirls.ngo/pdf/CLT%20Impact%20Report%202014-15.pdf Educate Girls CLT Report 2014-15]

[[Center for Education Innovations]], April 30, 2013
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creation of Girl Leaders'''

Educate Girls facilitates the election of [[Bal Sabha]]s (Girls' Councils) in every upper primary school.  This 13-member council gives girls a leadership position within the school and training in [[life skills]] to boost communication, leadership and problem solving skills.

==History==

A small local team, led by Safeena Husain, conducted the initial test project in 50 schools of Pali and [[Jalore district]]s in [[Rajasthan]]. This 50-school project was launched under the umbrella of the Rajasthan Education Initiative (REI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educationinnovations.org/research-and-evidence/review-rajasthan-education-initiative-rei | title=A Review of the Rajasthan Education Initiative (REI) | publisher=EducationInnovations.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rajshiksha.gov.in/REIMain.htm Rajasthan Education Initiative] Government of [[Rajasthan]] Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

After successful completion of the test phase, the organization was independently registered in 2007 and won government approval to start a pilot project in 500 schools in 2008, working with 70,000 children in the Bali, Sumerpur and Rani blocks of Pali district with the cooperation and support extended by partners like [[UNICEF]], [[Pratham]] Rajasthan, SERVE and Dream Catchers Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://educategirls.in/index.php/who-we-are/history Educate Girls: History]&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|reason=citation is the company's website, there must be more objective sources for this|date=February 2013}}

An '''exercise book''' or '''composition book''' is a [[notebook]] that is used in [[school]]s to copy down schoolwork and notes.  A student will usually have a different exercise book for each separate [[lesson]] or [[School subject|subject]].

The exercise book format is different for some subjects: for the majority of subjects, the exercise book will contain [[ruled paper|lined paper]] with a [[Margin (typography)|margin]], but for other subjects such as [[mathematics education|mathematics]], the exercise book will contain [[graph paper|squared paper]] to aid in the drawing of graphs, tables or other diagrams.

Exercise books may act as a primary record of students' learning efforts.  For younger pupils, books are often collected at the end of each lesson for review, scoring or grading.  Loose worksheets may be pasted into the book so that they are bound with other work.

In some schools, exercise books may be colour-coded depending on the subject. For example, Biology might be green and Algebra blue.

The exercise book was also called ''version book'' historically, and is called ''khata'' in [[India]], ''scribbler'' in [[Canada]], and ''copy book'' in [[Ireland]].{{citation needed|reason=Please discuss on talk page|date=December 2015}}  The US equivalent is ''composition book'', which traditionally has a distinctive cover pattern.

==Size==

=== Australia ===
The traditional size of a school exercise book in Australia is {{convert|7x9|in|mm}}, which may be approximated by [[Paper size#B series|B5]] (176 × 250&amp;nbsp;mm).  Larger A4 (previously foolscap) notebooks are also used.

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
Exercise books manufactured in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] are labeled by three digit codes that encode their size, number of pages and ruling.

The first numeral stands for the size:
* 4 for [[A4 paper]]
* 5 for [[A5 paper]]
* 6 for [[A6 paper]]
The second numeral stands for the number of pages:
* 1 for 10 pages
* 2 for 20 pages
* 4 for 40 pages
* 6 for 60 pages
* 8 for 80 pages
The third numeral stands for the ruling:
* 0 for blank exercise book
* 1 for lined paper—lines at 20&amp;nbsp;mm
* 2 for lined paper—lines at 16&amp;nbsp;mm
* 3 for lined paper—lines at 12&amp;nbsp;mm
* 4 for lined paper—lines at 8&amp;nbsp;mm
* 5 for squared paper—squares are 5 x 5&amp;nbsp;mm
* 10 for squared paper—squares are 10 x 10&amp;nbsp;mm

=== Ireland ===
''Copy books'' sold in [[Ireland]] usually come with 32, 40, 88, or 120 pages. The pages can be blank, [[Ruled paper|ruled]], or [[Graph paper|squared]].

=== New Zealand ===
{{main|New Zealand standard for school stationery}}

School exercise books in New Zealand generally conform to standard NZS 8132:1984 (Specification for school stationery). An alphanumeric code is used to describe the exercise book's binding, format and size.

The first numerals(s) refer to the binding:
* 1 for soft cover
* 2 for hard cover
* 8 for spiral bound
The letter refers to the format:
* A for unruled
* B for 7&amp;nbsp;mm ruled
* I for 9&amp;nbsp;mm ruled
* F for 12&amp;nbsp;mm ruled
* L for alternating pages unruled and 7&amp;nbsp;mm ruled
* J for 5&amp;nbsp;mm quad
* E for 7&amp;nbsp;mm quad
* H for 10&amp;nbsp;mm quad
The last numeral refers to the size:
* 4 for {{convert|230|x|180|mm|abbr=on}}
* 5 for {{convert|255|x|205|mm|abbr=on}}
* 8 for {{convert|297|x|210|mm|abbr=on}} (A4 size)


=== Russia ===
The most common [[Russia]]n exercise notebooks, codified in the Russian industry standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://protect.gost.ru/v.aspx?control=7&amp;id=180083 |title=Exercise notebook, basic technical requirements |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* A "thin" notebook ({{lang-ru|школьная тетрадь}}, ''school notebook'') with 12, 18, or 24 sheets, having size 170 x 205&amp;nbsp;mm. They are [[Staple (fastener)#Paper staples|staple]]d [[Bookbinding#Stitched or sewn binding|through the fold]], which, aided by their thinness, allows to open them completely flat, simplifying writing on the left side. These notebooks are used for daily work in primary school like teaching [[penmanship]] and [[arithmetic]], and are often collected for review and grading. These notebooks are called ''copybooks'' at English language lessons in Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babla.ru/%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9/%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%8C |title=copybook (in Russian) |accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "thick" notebook ({{lang-ru|общая тетрадь}}, ''general-use notebook'') with more than 24 sheets and up to 96 sheets, having width at least 144&amp;nbsp;mm and height no more than 297&amp;nbsp;mm (same height as A4 paper size). These notebooks are intended for usage in middle and high school for tasks like lesson notes, long-term projects, essays, laboratory experiments, etc.
Other sizes and number of sheets are permitted. The preferable sizes are (in mm): 210 x 297 (A4), 203 x 288, 203 x 275, 170 x 203, 148 x 210 (A5), 144 x 203.

"Thin" notebooks must be either ruled with 8&amp;nbsp;mm spacing between the lines, or graph-ruled with 5&amp;nbsp;mm or 7&amp;nbsp;mm squares. "Thick" notebooks must be either ruled with 6&amp;nbsp;mm, 7&amp;nbsp;mm, 8&amp;nbsp;mm, 9&amp;nbsp;mm spacing between the lines, or graph-ruled with 3&amp;nbsp;mm, 4&amp;nbsp;mm, 5&amp;nbsp;mm, 6&amp;nbsp;mm, or 7&amp;nbsp;mm squares.

The paper for cursive writing uses pairs of lines 4&amp;nbsp;mm apart, with 8&amp;nbsp;mm between the pairs. They may also have angled lines at 65 degrees to vertical to provide additional guidance.

The lines can have gray, blue, green or purple color. The vertical margin line must have red or orange color. Vertical margin is optional for graph-ruled notebooks.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], A5 is the common small size, with A4 the larger size.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], exercise books used by writers and students are known as ''composition books''. Typically, they have dimensions of {{convert|7+1/2x9+3/4|in|mm}} and 80 to 100 sheets with some variation. Although available in several colors, the original marbled black-and-white cover, with its generic label on the front, is the most common.

Composition books can be [[Ruled paper|ruled]] or [[Graph paper|graphed]].

The papers in a composition book often have the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] and [[cap line]] printed in blue to aid writing, with a (sometimes red) vertical line for a [[Margin (typography)|margin]] on the left hand of every page. Traditionally, the inside back cover contains a table of the weights and measures of the English ([[Imperial System|imperial]]) system printed for reference; however, this feature has become less common in countries that have adopted the [[metric system]]. Sometimes a [[multiplication table]], or [[grammar]] or [[punctuation]] tips, are also found on the inside back cover. The inside front cover typically has a place to put one's weekly class schedule.

Composition books are traditionally [[Bookbinding#Stitched or sewn binding|bound through the fold]]&amp;mdash;that is, the pages are folded, and stitched vertically along the fold. This allows to open them completely flat, simplifying writing on the left side, and also makes them significantly more durable than [[loose leaf]] pads or [[spiral notebook]]s.

Exercise books with fewer number of sheets, such as [[Examination book|Blue book]]s, are used in many [[Higher education|post-secondary schools]] during [[Test (student assessment)|assessement test]]s.

'''Family literacy''' is a method of [[education]]. Relatively new, family literacy is being put into practice in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[South Africa]].

==Philosophy==
The roots of family literacy as an educational method come from the belief that “the parent is the child’s first teacher.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salisbury University - May Literacy Centre|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/seidel/mayliteracycenter/FamilyLit.html|publisher=Salisbury.edu|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that adults who have a higher level of education tend to not only become productive citizens with enhanced social and economic capacity in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Howard|title=Investment in Learning. The Individual and Social Value of American Higher Education|year=1997|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0-8018-5530-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their children are more likely to be successful in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woessmann|first=Ludger|title=How Equal are Educational Opportunities? Family Background and Student Achievement in Europe and the US|date=March 2004|volume=1162|series=CESifo Working Paper Series|ssrn=528209}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literate parents are better able to support the learning of their children.&lt;ref name="Centre for Family Literacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Family Literacy - Logic Model|url=http://www.famlit.ca/resources/logicmodel.shtml|publisher=Famlit.ca|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Establishing family literacy programs is the most effective strategy to increase parental involvement and literacy development. The purpose of parental literacy curriculum is to increase students’ academic achievement. When family literacy programs are established parents become advocates for their child’s literacy. Simultaneously students’ literacy excels as parents become empowered. When parents are empowered they become active lifelong participants in their child’s education &lt;ref name="familyliteracyprogram1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familyliteracyprogram.org/ |title=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Family Literacy Program&amp;nbsp; |publisher=Familyliteracyprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717193539/http://www.familyliteracyprogram.org/ |archive-date=2015-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Comprehensive family [[literacy]] services provide a [[holism|holistic]], fully integrated, family-focused approach, providing parents and children most in need of improving their literacy skills with intensive, frequent, and long-term educational and non-educational services. Family literacy services make sustainable changes in a family by integrating all of the following activities:
* [[Adult Education]]: designed to extend basic academic level, think critically and creatively, solve problems, set and achieve goals, and acquire successful workplace and interpersonal skills.
* Childhood Education: designed to promote the growth and development of young children and to engage parents in their child’s educational program in order to foster meaningful involvement that will be maintained throughout the child’s educational career.
* Parent Education: provides instruction on how children grow, develop, and learn. It addresses issues critical to family well-being, connects parents with community resources, and provides opportunities for parents to network and develop mutual support systems.
* Interactive Parent/Child Activities: provides parents and children the opportunity to share their newly developed literacy experiences. Parents and children interact together, enriching their relationship through reciprocal learning that takes place, enabling them to become true partners in education.

==Examples==
*Adult Education:  The goal of educating parents is to empower and provide resources to parents who are a child's first teacher. Adult Education helps to rebuild relationships between parents and the school's faculty and staff. Some classes and activities provided for parents at the Prairie State College Family Literacy Project are [[English as Second Language]] classes, Adult Basic Education classes, General Education Development certifications, and vocational training.
*Building Family: The Leadership Program’s nationally recognized Building Family program invites parents into school communities with workshops that are hands-on, informative, and fun. These successful workshops meet a wide variety of parent needs and interests: from personal health and professional growth to nurturing the creative spirit and parenting strategies for promoting children’s academic achievement. Backed by The Leadership Program’s decades of experience facilitating more than 2,000 Building Family workshops for over 20,000 public school parents, this inspiring guidebook includes thirty-three complete workshops with convenient step-by-step instructions. Use it to lead dynamic experiences that will inspire enduring parent engagement in your own school community.
*Childhood Education: Helping to involve parents can be done in a child's learning through play groups, sharing stories and books together, and child-directed play time that all help the child to bond with their parents.
*Parent Education: The family literacy program developed in [[Illinois]] at the Prairie State Family Literacy Program provides parental support about health issues, good nutrition, discipline, and takes parents and children on field trips to purchase books for children to read at home.
*Interactive Parent/Child Activities: The Prairie State Family Literacy Program has developed a special time for interactive activities that they call "P.A.C.T." time. During this P.A.C.T. time there are play groups that involve both parents and their children working together. They are separated by age groups to help guide the interaction and activities.
*Greenman Elementary in [[Illinois]] established the first family literacy project called P.A.L. Parents Advocating Literacy in district 129. Since 2010 over 100 parents have become members of  P.A.L. (Parents Advocating Literacy.) P.A.L. is a family literacy project that teaches parents strategies that teachers use in the classroom every day. Establishing P.A.L. is the most effective approach to increase parental involvement in reading development. The purpose of family literacy curriculum is to increase students’ achievement by connecting school and home. When family literacy is established parents become advocates for their child’s literacy. Through P.A.L. parents become empowered and become lifelong supporters of their child’s education. P.A.L. was implemented district wide in 2013. P.A.L. is also in other districts throughout Illinois.&lt;ref name="familyliteracyprogram1"/&gt;
*F.R.E.D.:Fathers Reading Every Day is a family literacy program developed at Texas A&amp;M University.  In this program, fathers or father figures such as grandparents, uncles, or family friends are encouraged to read to their children every day for four weeks.

The '''Foreign Language and Area Studies''' (FLAS) fellowships are federally funded academic [[scholarship]]s designed to provide support and funding to graduate and undergraduate students studying the languages and cultures of specific foreign countries, in particular those in the strategic interest of the [[United States]].  

Prior to the 1970s, the fellowships were called '''National Defence Foreign Language Fellowships''', funded by the [[National Defense Education Act]]. American universities are allotted funds from the federal government, and then the individual schools hold their own competitions to determine the recipients for both summer and year-long grants. FLAS fellowships cover tuition, school fees, medical insurance, and provide an additional living [[stipend]].  The stipends for 2009-2010 were $15,000 for an academic-year award and $2,500 for summer. Eligibility for year-long grants is limited to graduate students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Undergraduates may receive summer funding.

As part of the program, fellows are required to take one language class and another academic class in their FLAS area. A language evaluation is given at the beginning and end of the program. Additionally, fellows are expected to write a summary of their FLAS achievements at the end of the fellowship period.

The '''International Dunhuang Project''' (IDP) is an international collaborative effort to conserve, catalogue and [[Digital preservation|digitise]] manuscripts, printed texts, paintings, textiles and artefacts from [[Dunhuang]] and various other archaeological sites at the eastern end of the [[Silk Road]].  The project was established by the [[British Library]] in 1994,&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-8"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Perkins|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now includes twenty-two institutions in twelve countries.  {{As of|2016|03|01}} the online IDP database comprised 137,812 catalogue entries and 483,721 images.&lt;ref name="idp-stats"&gt;{{Cite web | title=IDP Statistics | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/about_stats.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2012-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the manuscripts in the IDP database are texts written in [[Chinese character|Chinese]], but more than fifteen different [[Writing system|scripts]] and languages are represented,&lt;ref name="bbc-news-2002"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Silk Road treasures united on the web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2420983.stm | date=11 November 2002 | accessdate=2011-02-08 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]], [[Kharosthi]], [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Tangut script|Tangut]], [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]], [[Tocharian script|Tocharian]] and [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Old Uyghur]].&lt;ref name="idp-stats"/&gt;

[[Victor H. Mair]], Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], has noted that there are many advantages of the IDP providing high resolution digital images of Dunhuang manuscripts online for access to all.  Whereas in years gone by scholars often needed to travel long distances to access the original manuscripts, or could only access them by means of low quality reproductions, now anyone can access images from the convenience of their computer, wherever they are in the world.  This not only makes research into these manuscripts easier, but helps in their conservation as there is far less need for them to be handled in person.  Moreover, the high quality images provided by the IDP often show up details that would be difficult to see with the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mair | first=Victor H. | authorlink=Victor H. Mair | title=The Impact of IDP on Dunhuang Studies | journal=IDP News | issue=36–37 | year=2010–2011 | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | issn=1354-5914 | pages=4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[File:Digitisation of a Dunhuang manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Digitisation at the British Library of the ''Rabbit Garden Imperial Book Repository'' 兔園策府, a Tang dynasty manuscript from Dunhuang]]
The main activities of the IDP are the conserving, cataloguing, and digitising of manuscripts, woodblock prints, paintings, photographs and other artefacts in the collections material from Dunhuang and other Eastern Silk Road sites held by participating institutions.  Digitised images of the items in the IDP database are made available to the public on the IDP website.  The digital images are intended to be at least as legible as the original manuscripts, and allow scholars to access the material from anywhere in the world without causing any more damage to the fragile items themselves.&lt;ref name="bbc-news-2002"/&gt;

The central core of the project is the online database of catalogue records and images.  This is intended to serve three main purposes:
* to act as a replacement for tools previously used by institutions to manage their collections;
* to act as a replacement for the offline catalogues previously used by scholars to access the collections;
* to provide additional functionality that will make the database an important scholarly tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|Shaw|Prescott|1998|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Lynne Brindley]], Chief Executive Officer of the British Library, put forward the International Dunhuang Project as a good example of the sort of complex, collaborative, and international digitisation projects that the British Library was increasingly engaged in.  She explained that none of the individual institutions participating in the project had the resources or facilities to allow scholars full access to all of the manuscripts in their collections, but by joining together and sharing knowledge and resources the institutions would be able to offer access to the combined collections of all the institutions by means of high-quality digital images.  She noted that a digitisation project such as the IDP benefits both the institutions involved, who are often able to obtain more substantial funding than they would for an internal project, and also the scholarly community, who are given access through the digital images to fragile and often inaccessible items that might previously have been difficult or impossible to view.&lt;ref name="brindley-2002-31-32"&gt;{{harvnb|Brindley|2002|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cataloguing ===
Catalogue records are stored in [[XML]] format on a [[relational database]] using the [[4th Dimension (software)|4th Dimension]] database management tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Whitfield | first=Susan | authorlink=Susan Whitfield | title=The IDP Database | url=http://idp.bl.uk/downloads/IDPDatabase.pdf | accessdate=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Records can be searched for by means of an online search form that allows users to restrict the search on the basis of a number of different criteria, such as type of artefact, holding institute, archaeological site, and language or script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Advanced Search | url=http://idp.bl.uk/database/database_search.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The database was updated to support [[Unicode]] in 2010, and the IDP website is now fully encoded using [[UTF-8]], allowing [[Character (computing)|characters]] from most of the ancient and modern scripts found in the manuscripts to be added to the catalogue records.&lt;ref name="idp-news-35"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=IDP UK | journal=IDP News | issue=35 | date=Spring–Summer 2010 | issn=1354-5914 | url=http://idp.bl.uk/downloads/newsletters/IDPNews35.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each online catalogue record incorporates a physical description of the item, catalogue records from existing print sources, translations if available, and bibliographic references.  The IDP also encourages scholarly users to submit their own catalogue entries and research results on individual items for addition to the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=IDP Technical Resources | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/technical_resources.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate the locating of items on the IDP database the project has also digitised a large number of catalogues and bibliographic sources, and made them available online, with links from the original catalogue entries to the corresponding online catalogue entry in the IDP database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=IDP Show Catalogues | url=http://idp.bl.uk/database/catalogue_search.a4d | accessdate=2011-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation ===
In order to better understand how to conserve the fragile materials that most of the items in the IDP database are made from (paper, textile, and wood), the IDP has supported a number of conservation projects (such as the analysis of paper and textile fibres), and has organised regular conferences on conservation issues at venues across the world.&lt;ref name="idp-conservation"&gt;{{Cite web | title=IDP Conservation Projects | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/conservation_projects.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to developing techniques for the conservation and preservation of documents and artefacts, the IDP hopes to foster good conservation practices and common standards amongst participating institutes, ensuring that artefacts are stored under the most suitable conditions, and are handled as little as possible.&lt;ref name="idp-activities"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Activities | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/about_activities.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digitisation ===
The IDP centre at the British Library set up a digitisation studio in 2001, and now similar studios have been established at IDP centres across Europe and Asia.  In addition to making high-quality digital images of items, [[infrared photography]] is used for manuscripts with faded ink or which are otherwise hard to read in normal light.&lt;ref name="idp-activities"/&gt;

=== Education ===
The IDP also engages in various educational activities, organising exhibitions, workshops, and educational events for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=IDP Education | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/education_teachers.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the IDP organised a major exhibition entitled "The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith", which was held at the British Library.&lt;ref name=Whitfield2004 &gt;{{cite book |last=Whitfield |first=Susan |year=2004 |title=The silk road: trade, travel, war and faith |publisher=British Library |isbn=978-0-7123-4866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the most successful exhibition ever held at the British Library, and attracted 155,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="idp-timeline"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dunhuang star map.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Detail of the [[Dunhuang Star Chart]] showing the North Polar region ({{IDP|Or.8210/S.3326|British Library}})]]
The foundations for the project were laid in October 1993 when an international conference on [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Cave 17]] was held at [[Sussex University]].&lt;ref name="idp-news-01"&gt;{{Cite journal | title='Cave 17' Conference | journal=IDP News | issue=1 | date=16 May 1994 | issn=1354-5914 | url=http://idp.bl.uk/archives/news01/idpnews_01.a4d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conference brought together curators and conservators from across the world, including the British Library, the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], and the [[National Library of China]], and in its aftermath an IDP Steering Group was set up by Graham Shaw (Deputy Director of the Oriental &amp; India Office Collection at the British Library), [[Frances Wood]] (Head of the Chinese Section at the British Library), and Peter Lawson (Conservator at the British Library).  [[Susan Whitfield]] was appointed to edit the newsletter.  The first meeting of the IDP steering group was held on 11 April 1994, when the name ''International Dunhuang Project'' was adopted.&lt;ref name="idp-news-01"/&gt;  The first newsletter was published on 16 May 1994.

The IDP was initially founded with 3-year grant from the [[Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation]],&lt;ref name=Day1998 &gt;{{citation | last=Day | first=Alan Edwin | year=1998 | title=Inside the British Library | publisher=Library Association Pub. | isbn=978-1-85604-280-2  | page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had only one member of staff.&lt;ref name="idp-timeline"&gt;{{Cite web | title=IDP Timeline | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/archives_timeline.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year the IDP database was designed and implemented, and in 1996 a grant from the [[British Academy]] allowed the hiring of a part-time research assistant to input catalogue data into the database.&lt;ref name="idp-timeline"/&gt;

In 1997, with funding of £148,000 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],&lt;ref name=Day1998/&gt; the IDP started to digitise manuscripts held at the British Library, and in 1998 the database went online with an initial 20,000 catalogue entries and about 1,000 images of digitised manuscripts.&lt;ref name="idp-timeline"/&gt;

In 2001, with substantial support from the [[Mellon Foundation]], work started on the digitisation of manuscripts held at collections in Paris and Beijing,&lt;ref name="brindley-2002-31-32"/&gt; and in 2003 digital images of Dunhuang paintings held at the [[British Museum]] were added to the database.&lt;ref name="idp-timeline"/&gt;  By 2004 the IDP database included images of some 50,000 manuscripts, paintings, artefacts, and historical photographs.&lt;ref name="idp-ten-years"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=IDP 10 Years On | journal=IDP News | issue=24 | date=Autumn 2004 | issn=1354-5914 | url=http://idp.bl.uk/archives/news24/idpnews_24.a4d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDP Centres were opened in Beijing in 2001, in St. Petersburg and Kyoto in 2004, in Berlin in 2005, in Dunhuang in 2007, in Paris in 2008, and in [[Seoul]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="idp-timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idp-about"/&gt;

The first director of the IDP was Susan Whitfield, who retired from the position in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Whitfield | first=Susan | authorlink=Susan Whitfield | title=Farewell from the IDP Director | journal=IDP News | issue=49–50 | year=2017 | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | issn=1354-5914 | page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IDP Centres ==
The International Dunhuang Project has centres in seven countries.&lt;ref name="idp-about"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Online Silk Road Reaches Korea | url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/Online-Silk-Road-Reaches-Korea-475.aspx | publisher=[[British Library]] | date=2 December 2010 | accessdate=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The London centre, based at the British Library, acts as the directorate for the IDP, and is responsible for maintaining the IDP database and the main English-language website.  The other centres maintain local-language versions of the IDP website, currently [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korea]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].  Each centre is responsible for the conservation, cataloguing, and digitisation of [[Central Asia]]n manuscripts in its country.  The staff at these centres help train participating institutions in the use of digitisation equipment and computer software, as well as providing training in conservation and research techniques.

In addition to these centres, it is planned to open an IDP centre in Sweden, and digitise the Central Asian collections held in Swedish institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=IDP Wordwide News | journal=IDP News | issue=36–37 | year=2010–2011 | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | issn=1354-5914 | page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
The IDP database includes material from a number of important collections held by participating institutions of the IDP.

=== The Stein Collections ===
[[File:Jiucenglou of Mogao Caves.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mogao Caves]] at [[Dunhuang]].]]
[[Aurel Stein]] (1862–1943) made four expeditions to Central Asia (1900–1901, 1906–1908, 1913–1916, and 1930–1931), during which he collected a vast amount of material, including a large number of manuscripts that he acquired from the 'Library Cave' (Cave 17) of the [[Mogao Caves]] at Dunhuang during his second expedition.&lt;ref name="whitfield-farrer-1990-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|Farrer|1990|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the material that he collected, including murals, paintings, artefacts and manuscripts, was sent to India as his first three expeditions had been sponsored by the Indian government. Most of this material is now held at the [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum of India]] in [[New Delhi]], but a small amount of the material from his first expedition is held at the [[Indian Museum]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], and at [[Lahore Museum]] in Pakistan.  The rest of the material collected by Stein was taken to England, and is now shared between the British Library, British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum.&lt;ref name="british-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=British Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_en.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Library holds over 45,000 items collected by Stein, mostly comprising manuscripts, printed texts, and inscribed pieces of wood, written in a wide variety of scripts and languages, including [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Tangut script|Tangut]], [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]], [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]], [[Old Turkic script|Turkic]] and [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]]:&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-3-4"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Perkins|2008|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* about 14,000 scrolls and paper fragments in Chinese from Dunhuang Cave 17
* about 5,000 paper fragments and 4,000 woodlsips in Chinese from sites other than Dunhuang
* about 3,100 scrolls and pages in Tibetan from Dunhuang

The British Library Stein Collection also includes some artefacts such as textile fragments, sutra wrappers and paste brushes, as well as over 10,000 photographs, negatives and [[lantern slides]] taken by Stein.&lt;ref name="british-collections"/&gt;

The British Museum holds a collection of over 1,500 archaeological artefacts collected from various Silk Road sites by Stein, as well as non-literary items from Dunhuang Cave 17, comprising more than 240 paintings on silk or paper, 200 textiles, and about 30 woodblock prints.&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-10"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Perkins|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum also holds over 4,000 coins collected by Stein, about three quarters of which are Chinese, and most of the rest are Islamic.&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Perkins|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Images of all of the paintings and some of the artefacts are now included in the IDP database,&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-8" /&gt; and the coins may be added at a future date.&lt;ref name="british-collections"/&gt;

The Victoria and Albert Museum holds a collection of more than 650 textiles collected by Stein from various Silk Road sites,&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-26"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Perkins|2008|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have now been added to the IDP database.&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-8" /&gt;

Many of Stein's personal papers and diaries are held at the Western Manuscript Department of the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-29"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Perkins|2008|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of personal papers and photographs held at the library of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] have been added to the IDP database.&lt;ref name="british-collections"/&gt;

The removal by Stein of so much cultural and archaeological material from China has caused anger in China, and there have been calls for the texts and artefacts collected by Stein from Dunhuang that are now in the British Museum and British Library to be repatriated to China.  Although the Chinese government has not formally requested their return, in 2003 an official at the Chinese Embassy in London stated that "[l]ittle by little, we will expect to see the return of items taken from Dunhuang — they should go back to their original place".&lt;ref name="bbc-news-2003"&gt;{{Cite news | last=George | first=Marcus | title=The original Chinese takeaway | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3190360.stm | date=22 October 2003 | accessdate=2011-02-08 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Hoernle Collection ===
The Hoernle Collection, named after [[Augustus Hoernle]] (1841–1918), is a collection of Central Asian manuscripts collected by the Indian government.  22 consignments were sent to Hoernle in Calcutta between 1895 and 1899, and these were sent to the British Museum in 1902.  A further ten consignments were sent to Hoernle in London after his retirement in 1899.  The Hoernle Collection, which comprises over 2,000 Sanskrit manuscripts, 1,200 Tocharian manuscripts, and about 250 Khotanese manuscripts, as well as a few Chinese, Persian and Uyghur manuscripts, is now held by the British Library.&lt;ref name="wang-perkins-2008-3-4" /&gt;

=== The Pelliot Collection ===
[[File:Pelliot cave163.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Paul Pelliot]] examining manuscripts in the 'Library Cave' ([[Mogao Caves|Cave 17]]) at Dunhuang in 1908]]
[[Paul Pelliot]] (1878–1945) led an expedition to [[Kucha]] and Dunhuang from 1906–1908.  In Kucha and elsewhere in [[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]] he collected hundreds of woodslips with inscriptions in Sanskrit and Tocharian, whilst at Dunhuang, arriving a year after Stein, he acquired thousands of manuscripts from the 'Library Cave' (Cave 17).&lt;ref name="whitfield-whitfield-2000-45"&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|Whitfield|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The items collected by Pelliot are held at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], and are divided into the following sub-collections:&lt;ref name="french-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=French Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_fr.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pelliot Tibetan : 4,174 manuscripts and woodblock prints in Tibetan
* Pelliot Chinese : about 3,000 scrolls, booklets, paintings and woodblock prints, and around 700 fragments, in Chinese
* Pelliot Sanskrit : about 4,000 fragments in Sanskrit
* Pelliot Kuchean : about 2,000 woodslips and paper fragments in Tocharian
* Pelliot Sogdian : about 40 Sogdian manuscripts
* Pelliot Uighur : about 20 Uyghur manuscripts
* Pelliot Khotanais : Khotanese manuscripts
* Pelliot Xixia : several hundred items in the [[Tangut script]], mostly woodblock prints
* Pelliot divers : miscellaneous items

=== The Kozlov Collection ===
[[Pyotr Kozlov]] (1863–1935) made an expedition to the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] fortress city of [[Khara-Khoto]] during 1907–1909.  The city had been abandoned in the late 14th century,&lt;ref name="idp-news-02"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Khara-Khoto — The Black City | journal=IDP News | issue=2 | date=January 1995 | issn=1354-5914 | url=http://idp.bl.uk/archives/news02/idpnews_02.a4d }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been largely buried in sand for several hundred years.  Kozlov unearthed thousands of manuscripts and woodblock prints, mostly written in the dead [[Tangut language]], which had been preserved beneath the sands of Khara-Khoto.  The collection of Tangut texts that Kozlov brought back from Khara-Khoto were originally housed in the museum of [[Alexander III of Russia]] in St Petersburg, but were transferred to the Asiatic Museum in 1911.  They are now held at the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Manuscripts]] in St Petersburg.  In addition to the several thousand Tangut texts, the Kozlov Collection includes about 660 manuscripts and printed books in Chinese, mostly Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="russian-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Russian Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_ru.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of Khara-Khoto was excavated by Aurel Stein in 1917, during his third expedition, and several thousand Tangut manuscript fragments recovered by Stein are in the Stein Collection of the British Library.&lt;ref name="russian-collections"/&gt;

=== The Oldenburg Collections ===
[[Sergey Oldenburg]] (1863–1934), who was the first director of the Institute of Oriental Studies (formerly the Asiatic Museum) in St Petersburg, made two expeditions to Central Asia (1909–1910 and 1914–1915), which were to become known as the 'Russian Turkestan expeditions'.  During the first expedition Oldenburg explored a number of sites around [[Turpan]], including [[Qigexing Buddhist Temple Ruins|Shikchin]], [[Jiaohe Ruins|Yarkhoto]] and [[Kucha]], and collected murals, paintings, terracottas, and about one hundred manuscripts, mostly fragments written in the Brahmi script.  During his second expedition Oldenburg surveyed the [[Mogao Caves]] at Dunhuang, and revisited some of the sites in Turpan that he had visited during his first expedition.  He found a large number of artefacts and manuscript fragments (nearly 20,000 fragments, some of them tiny) at Dunhuang, and also purchased about 300 scrolls from local people.&lt;ref name="russian-collections"/&gt;

Oldenburg's collections are shared between the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Manuscripts]] and the [[Hermitage Museum]].  The Institute of Oriental Manuscripts holds the more than 19,000 manuscript fragments and 365 manuscript scrolls collected from Dunhuang by Oldenburg, as well as about thirty manuscripts collected by [[Sergey Malov]] during an expedition to [[Khotan]] during 1909–1910, and some 183 Uyghur manuscripts collected by N. N. Krotkov, the Russian Consul in [[Urumqi]] and [[Ghulja]].&lt;ref name="russian-collections"/&gt;

The Hermitage Museum holds artefacts from both of Oldenburg's expeditions, including 66 Buddhist banners and banner-tops, 137 fragments of Buddhist silk paintings, 43 fragments of Buddhist paintings on paper, 24 murals, 38 pieces of textile, and eight manuscript fragments.  Oldenburg's personal papers, diaries, maps and photographs relating to the two expeditions are also held at the Hermitage.&lt;ref name="russian-collections"/&gt;

=== Dunhuang Collections at the National Library of China ===
During 1907–1908 Stein and Pelliot had visited Dunhuang, and had both purchased large quantities of manuscripts from [[Wang Yuanlu]] (c.1849–1931), a [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest and self-proclaimed guardian of the Mogao Caves.  News of the discovery of these manuscripts was brought to the attention of Chinese scholars when Pelliot visited Beijing in 1909, and the renowned scholar and antiquarian [[Luo Zhenyu]] (1866–1940) persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the 8,000 or so remaining manuscripts.  In 1910 Fu Baoshu 傅寶書 was dispatched to Dunhuang to bring the remaining manuscripts back to Beijing, although he left the Tibetan manuscripts behind.  Some of the manuscripts were stolen by the minister Li Shengduo 李盛鐸 shortly after they had arrived at the Ministry of Education, but soon after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911 the manuscripts were deposited in the newly founded Metropolitan Library (later to become the [[National Library of China]]).&lt;ref name="chinese-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Chinese Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_ch.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8,697 manuscripts that Fu Baoshu brought back from Dunhuang form the core of the Dunhuang collection in the National Library of China, but they have since been augmented by various purchases and donations over the years, so that the library collection now amounts to some 16,000 items, including 4,000 small manuscript fragments.&lt;ref name="chinese-collections"/&gt;

=== The Ōtani Collections ===
[[Ōtani Kōzui]] (1876–1948) was a hereditary Buddhist abbot from [[Kyoto]], Japan, but he had studied in London, and after meeting the explorers Aurel Stein and [[Sven Hedin]] (1865–1952) he decided to explore [[Central Asia]] himself from a Buddhist perspective.  In 1902 he left England to return to Japan overland via St Petersburg, and together with four other returning Japanese students he made his way to [[Kashgar]].  From Kashgar the expedition divided into two groups, Ōtani and two others travelling to [[Srinagar]] and India, before returning to Japan; and the two others exploring the region of [[Khotan]] and [[Turpan]], and excavating the previously unexplored site of [[Kucha]], before returning to Japan in 1904.  Ōtani became abbot of the [[Nishi Honganji]] Monastery in Kyoto on his father's death in 1903, and so was unable to personally take part in any further expeditions, but he financed further expeditions to [[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]] in 1908–1909 and 1910–1914.  The final expedition excavated the [[Astana Graves|tombs of Astana]] outside the ancient city of [[Gaochang]], taking back to Japan nine [[mummies]] and many [[grave goods]] and funerary texts.&lt;ref name="japanese-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Japanese Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_jp.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three Ōtani expeditions produced a large collection of manuscripts (especially Buddhist [[Sūtra|sutras]]), woodslips, murals, sculptures, textiles, coins, and seals.  These items were originally deposited in the Nishi Honganji Monastery, and later at Ōtani's residence, Villa Niraku in [[Kobe]], but in 1914 Ōtani resigned as abbot due to a bribery scandal, and much of his collection was moved to Ōtani's villa in [[Dalian|Lüshun]], China.  His collection was later dispersed to various libraries, museums and collections across Japan, Korea, and China.&lt;ref name="japanese-collections"/&gt;

* The Omiya Library at [[Ryukoku University]], Kyoto holds 8,000 miscellaneous items found in two wooden chests at Villa Niraku after Ōtani's death.  These include manuscript scrolls, manuscript booklets, printed texts, wooden slips, silk paintings, textiles, plant specimens, coins, and rubbings.  As well as Chinese texts, the collection includes documents written in 15 different languages and 13 different scripts, covering secular subjects as well as [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Buddhist scriptures and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christian texts.
* [[Tokyo National Museum]] holds various items from the Ōtani expeditions, including Chinese and Uyghur manuscripts and woodslips from Turpan, Dunhuang and elsewhere, as well as paintings from Dunhuang and Turpan.
* [[Kyoto National Museum]] holds a number of items from Ōtani's collection.
* [[Otani University]], Kyoto holds 38 Dunhuang manuscripts, including 34 from Ōtani's collection.
* The Lüshun Museum in [[Dalian]], China holds 16,035 Buddhist manuscript fragments from Turpan, as well as documents written in Brahmi, Sogdian, Tibetan, Tangut, and Uyghur.
* The National Library of China in Beijing holds 621 Dunhuang scrolls transferred from the Lüshun Museum.
* The [[National Museum of Korea]] in [[Seoul]] holds about 1,700 artefacts and 60 fragments of murals from the [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves|Bezeklik Caves]] that derived from Villa Niraku.&lt;ref name="korean-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Korean Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_ko.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Berlin Turpan Collections ===
Four German expeditions to [[Turpan]] were made in the years 1902–1903, 1904–1905, 1905–1907, and 1913–1914, the first and third expeditions led by [[Albert Grünwedel]] (1856–1935), and the second and fourth expeditions led by [[Albert von Le Coq]] (1860–1930).  These expeditions brought back to Berlin a huge amount of material, including murals and other artefacts, as well as about 40,000 manuscript and woodblock fragments written in more than twenty different scripts and languages.  The items collected during these four expeditions are now divided between two institutions in Berlin.&lt;ref name="german-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=German Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_de.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] holds about 6,000 Old Uyghur fragments, about 1,600 Chinese and Old Uyghur fragments, 800 [[Middle Persian]] and [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] fragments (formerly in the collection of the Mainz Academy of Sciences and Literature), 3,500 Manichaean fragments in various languages (primarily Middle Persian, [[Parthian language|Parthian]], Old Turkic and Sogdian), about 1,000 [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and Chinese/Sogdian fragments, and about 300 Sogdian fragments in the [[Nestorian script]].
* The Oriental Department of the [[Berlin State Library]] holds about 6,000 Chinese fragments, about 100 [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] fragments, about 300 Syriac fragments, about 200 Tibetan fragments, about 4,000 Tocharian fragments, and about 8,000 Sanskrit fragments.

The IDP has digitised over 14,000 items from these collection, mostly the Chinese, Brahmi and Sanskrit fragments.  The Middle Persian, Old Turkic and Mongolian fragments have been digitised as part of the [[Digital Turfan Archive]] hosted by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and the Tocharian fragments have been digitised as part of the [[TITUS (project)|TITUS project]] of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]].

{{nihongo|'''Asahi'''|朝日|Morning Sun}} was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself, the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom. Shortly after her arrival in Japan, she became [[flagship]] of the Standing Fleet, the IJN's primary combat fleet. She participated in every major naval battle of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05 and was lightly damaged during the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. ''Asahi'' saw no combat during World War I, although the ship participated in the [[Siberian Intervention]] in 1918.

Reclassified as a [[coastal defence ship]] in 1921, ''Asahi'' was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], after which she served as a [[training ship|training]] and [[submarine depot ship]]. She was modified into a submarine [[marine salvage|salvage]] and rescue ship before being placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1928. ''Asahi'' was recommissioned in late 1937, after the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and used to transport Japanese troops. In 1938, she was converted into a [[repair ship]] and based first at Japanese-occupied [[Shanghai]], China, and then [[Cam Ranh Bay]], [[French Indochina]], from late 1938 to 1941. The ship was transferred to occupied [[Singapore]] in early 1942 to repair a damaged [[light cruiser]] and ordered to return home in May. She was sunk en route by the American submarine {{USS|Salmon|SS-182|6}}, although most of her crew survived.

==Background==
Combat experience in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the [[Jeune École]] naval philosophy, which emphasized [[torpedo boat]]s and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships. Therefore, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up in early 1896, to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations, with the construction of six battleships and six [[armoured cruiser]]s at its core.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Peattie, p. 15, 57–60&lt;/ref&gt; These ships were paid for from the £30,000,000 [[indemnity]] paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. As with the earlier {{sclass-|Fuji|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Shikishima|battleship|4}}es, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme.&lt;ref name=b5&gt;Brook, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asahi'', the fifth Japanese battleship to be built in Britain, was ordered from the [[Clydebank Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Company]] shipyard in [[Clydebank]], Scotland&lt;ref name=hk&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1897 annual naval programme.&lt;ref name=l0/&gt;

==Design and description==
[[File:Asahi&amp;ShikishimaDrawing.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and plan of the ''Shikishima''-class battleships and the battleship ''Asahi'' from [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1915. Unlike the drawing, ''Asahi'' had only two funnels.]]
''Asahi''{{'}}s design was a modified version of the {{sclass-|Formidable|battleship|2}}s of the [[Royal Navy]], with two additional {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns.&lt;ref name=p9&gt;Preston, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|425|ft|3|in|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|75|ft|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|15200|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load.&lt;ref name=j8&gt;Jentschura, Jung &amp; Mickel, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asahi'' had a complete double bottom with 55 watertight compartments. Her hull was also subdivided into 223 watertight compartments. She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about 773 officers and enlisted men, including the admiral's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer 2009, pp. 26, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] built by [[Humphrys, Tennant]], each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 25 [[Belleville boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|17.03|bar|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer 2008, pp. 22, 24, 26&lt;/ref&gt; The engines were rated at {{convert|15000|ihp|lk=in}}, using [[forced draught]], and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn}}&lt;ref name=j8/&gt; although ''Asahi'' reached {{convert|18.3|kn}} from {{convert|16335|ihp}} during her [[sea trial]]s on 23 March 1900.&lt;ref name=l7&gt;Lengerer 2008, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|2000|LT|t|0}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|9000|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=j8/&gt; The ship was fitted with three steam-driven {{convert|4.8|kW|adj=on}} [[dynamo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

''Asahi''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of the same four [[Elswick Ordnance Company]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Armstrong Whitworth 12 inch naval gun|twelve-inch guns]] used in all of Japan's preceding battleships. They were mounted in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. The hydraulically powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse, at a fixed elevation of +13.5°.&lt;ref name=b6&gt;Brook, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Each mount could traverse a total of 240 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer 2009, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; They fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 270–71&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of fourteen 40-calibre [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun|{{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}}]] [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) guns]] mounted in [[casemate]]s. Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure. They fired {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 275–76&lt;/ref&gt; Protection against torpedo-boat attacks was provided by twenty [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12 cwt]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; guns.&lt;ref name=ck2&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; The 12-pounders fired {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}, {{convert|12.5|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2359|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter guns consisted of eight {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|three-pounder Hotchkiss guns]] and four 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting tops]].&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The three-pounder gun fired {{convert|3.19|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1927|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, while the 2.5-pounder fired {{convert|2.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1420|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also equipped with four submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]].&lt;ref name=p9/&gt;

The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] of ''Asahi'' consisted of [[Harvey armour]] {{convert|2.44|m|ft|0|order=flip}} high, of which {{convert|1.11|m|ftin|0|order=flip}} was above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} for the middle {{convert|68.28|m|ft|0|order=flip}} of the ship. It was only {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch [[strake]] of armour that ran between the [[barbette]]s.&lt;ref name=l7/&gt; The barbettes were {{convert|14|in|mm|0}} thick, but only {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} behind the upper armour strake.&lt;ref name=c7&gt;Campbell, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The barbette hoods were protected by 10 inches of armour on their face while their sides were 6 inches thick and the roof was {{convert|1.5|in}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer 2009, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Diagonal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s connecting the barbettes to the side armour were 12–14 inches thick, but only 6 inches thick at the lower deck level.&lt;ref name=l7/&gt; The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also 6 inches thick with the rear protected by {{convert|2|in|mm|0|adj=on}} armour plates. The flat portion of the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armour was {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0}} thick and {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship. The [[conning tower]] was protected by 14 inches of armour.&lt;ref name=c7/&gt;

''Asahi'', like all the other Japanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four [[Barr and Stroud]] FA3 [[coincidence rangefinder]]s that had an effective range of {{convert|7300|m|yd|order=flip}}. The ships were also fitted with 24-power [[magnification]] telescopic [[gunsight]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
[[File:Asahi on the stocks.png|thumb|''Asahi'' shortly before her launch]]
''Asahi'', meaning "rising sun", a poetic name for Japan from a stanza of [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{lang|ja|敷島の やまと心を 人問わば 朝日ににほう 山ざくら花}} ''{{transl|ja|Shikishima-no Yamatogokoro-wo Hito-Towaba '''Asahi'''-ni-niwou Yamazakurabana}}'' by [[Motoori Norinaga]].&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Keel|laid down]] on 1 August 1898 in [[Clydebank]], Scotland, by the Clydebank Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co. and completed by [[John Brown &amp; Company]], which purchased the firm before ''Asahi'' was completed.&lt;ref name=s6&gt;Silverstone, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900. Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running [[aground]] off [[Southsea]] following sea trials. The ship departed England, after repairs in [[Portsmouth]], on the day of her completion,&lt;ref name=l0&gt;Lengerer 2008, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], Japan, on 23 October 1900.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; ''Asahi'' became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the [[1st Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Fleet]] when the [[Combined Fleet]] was re-formed on 28 December 1903.&lt;ref name=l0/&gt;

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, ''Asahi'', commanded by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Hikohachi Yamada, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. She participated in the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]] led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Squadron]] anchored just outside [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]]. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Boyarin|1901|2}}, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17, while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged. ''Asahi'' was not hit during the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, pp. 24, 41–44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Асахи.jpg|thumb|left|''Asahi'' on completion in 1900]]

The ship participated in the action of 13 April, when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including [[Vice Admiral]] [[Stepan Makarov]]'s [[flagship]], the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1894|2}}. When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and ''Petropavlovsk'' struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, Tōgō resumed long-range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two Japanese battleships the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, ''Asahi'', now commanded by Captain Tsunaakira Nomoto, was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships, behind ''Mikasa'', and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was only hit by a single 12-inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft 12-inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships {{ship|Russian battleship|Poltava|1894|2}} and {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}} although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her 12-inch shells struck the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] of ''Tsesarevich'', killing the Russian squadron commander, Vice Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], two of his staff officers and the ship's [[quartermaster]]. The ship's wheel was jammed to [[Port and starboard|port]] by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion. The second-in-command, [[Rear Admiral]] Prince [[Pavel Ukhtomsky]], eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly more than two months later, on 26 October, ''Asahi'' struck a [[naval mine|mine]] off Port Arthur while on [[blockade]] duty. Severely damaged, she was under repair at [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] from November 1904 to April 1905. Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the [[Baltic Fleet]] that did not arrive until May.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

===Battle of Tsushima===
{{main|Battle of Tsushima}}
At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, ''Asahi'' again followed the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}} into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons. ''Mikasa'' opened fire at the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Knyaz Suvorov||2}}, the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by ''Asahi'' and the armoured cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Azuma||2}} shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]], knocked out her rear 12-inch gun turret, and jammed ''Knyaz Suvorov''{{'}}s steering so that she fell out of formation. The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on ''Mikasa'' during the early part of the battle and ''Asahi'' was not damaged during this time. Tōgō was able to [[Crossing the T|cross the T]] of the Russian squadrons. ''Knyaz Suvorov''{{'}}s steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged. ''Asahi'' seems to have mostly engaged the battleships {{ship|Russian battleship|Borodino||2}} and {{ship|Russian battleship|Oryol||2}} in the late stages of the battle, although {{ship|Japanese battleship|Fuji||2}} fired the shots that caused the ''Borodino''{{'}}s magazines to explode and sink her. ''Asahi'' fired more twelve-inch shells, 142, than any other ship during the battle. In total, the ship was hit six times during the battle, but none of them damaged her significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 128–35, 260, 262&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Asahi''{{'}}s casualties are not precisely known, the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle. The battle was a total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the IJN.&lt;ref&gt;Warner &amp; Warner, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[William Pakenham (Royal Navy officer)|W. C. Pakenham]], the Royal Navy's official military observer under the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], took notes of the battle's progress from a deck chair on ''Asahi''{{'}}s exposed [[quarterdeck]]. His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Japanese repair and depot ship Asahi off Shanghai in the late 1930s.jpeg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of a warship with a small amount of smoke coming out of its funnel. Several smaller ships are moored near the warship, and land is visible in the background.|''Asahi'' off Shanghai in the late 1930s]]
In 1908, ''Asahi'' was part of the Japanese fleet that escorted the American [[Great White Fleet]] through Japanese waters during its round-the-globe voyage.&lt;ref name=j8/&gt; The ship was assigned to the 1st Fleet in 1908 and 1910–11.&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; ''Asahi'' became a gunnery training ship in 1914, and was re-armed in 1917 with Japanese guns replacing her original British-made guns. The same year, she was assigned to the 5th Division of the [[Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|3rd Fleet]].&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; In 1918, ''Asahi'' became flagship of her division and participated in the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia|Japanese intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]. She escorted troop convoys to the [[Russian Far East]] and was [[guard ship]] at [[Kamchatka]] from January to August 1918. ''Asahi'' was reclassified as a first-class coastal defence ship on 1 September 1921,&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; and began disarmament in 1922 at Yokosuka in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on 1 April 1923 and her disarmament was completed in July of that same year. Her displacement dropped to {{convert|11441|LT|t}} with the loss of her armour and guns, and her speed was limited to {{convert|12|kn}}.&lt;ref name=j8/&gt;

The navy decided to convert ''Asahi'' into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925.&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; From 1926 to October 1927, the ship's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Type RO boilers at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]]. One of her two [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] was also removed,&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; and two large lifting frames were installed&lt;ref name=j8/&gt; as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old [[Imperial German Navy|German]] submarine ''0-1'' (ex-{{SMU|U-125||2}}). In May 1928, ''Asahi'' was fitted with a {{convert|62|ft|4|in|m|adj=on|0}} compressed-air [[aircraft catapult]] on her [[forecastle]] and successfully launched an [[Nakajima E2N|E2N1]] Type 15 [[seaplane]]. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by [[gunpowder]]. On the completion of testing in 1928, ''Asahi'' was placed in reserve.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

Reclassified as a repair ship on 16 August 1937,&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; ''Asahi'' was taken out of reserve in November, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] that started the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was used as a transport to land troops in an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] at [[Hangzhou Bay]]. Afterwards she began conversion at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], Japan, into a repair ship; this was completed on 18 December 1938. ''Asahi'' was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in [[Shanghai]] on 29 December. In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940. She was transferred to Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from Kure to Camranh Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

From 13 March 1942, ''Asahi'' was stationed at Singapore, and in April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}}, which had been [[torpedo]]ed by the submarine {{USS|Seawolf|SS-197|6}} off [[Christmas Island]]. Departing Singapore for Kure on 22 May, escorted by the [[subchaser]] ''CH-9'', ''Asahi'' was sighted by the submarine {{USS|Salmon|SS-182|6}} on the night of 25/26 May 1942, {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of [[Cape Padaran]], Indochina.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Now Mũi Dinh {{coord|11|22|0|N|109|1|0|E|region:VN_type:waterbody}}, Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt; Of ''Salmon''{{'}}s four torpedoes, two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces. At 01:03, moments after being hit, ''Asahi'' sank at {{coord|10|00|N|110|00|E|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; Sixteen men were killed in the attack; the ship's captain and 582 crewmen were rescued by ''CH-9''.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Sander &amp; Cundall&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''language laboratory''' is an audio or audio-visual installation used as an aid in [[modern language]] teaching. They can be found, amongst other places, in [[schools]], [[universities]], and academies. Perhaps the first lab was at the University of Grenoble in 1908.&lt;ref name="prl"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Léon, P.R.|year=1962|title=Laboratoire de langues et correction phonétique.|publisher=Paris: Didier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wbr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roby, W.B.|year=2004|title=Technology in the service of foreign language teaching: The case of the language laboratory. In D. Jonassen (ed.), Handbook of Research on Educational Communications and Technology, 523-541, 2nd ed.|accessdate=2010-01-30|url=http://www.aect.org/edtech/19.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s up until the 1990s, they were [[Compact Cassette|tape]]-based systems using [[reel to reel]] or (latterly) [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]. Current installations are generally multimedia [[Personal computer|PCs]]. The original language labs are now very outdated. They allowed a teacher to listen to and manage student audio via a hard-wired analogue tape deck based systems with 'sound booths' in fixed locations.

==Appearance and configuration==
The 'traditional' system generally comprises a master console (teacher position) which is electrically connected to a number of rows of student booths (US: carrels), typically containing a student tape recorder and [[Headset (audio)|headset]] with a boom arm [[microphone]].

The teacher console is usually fitted with master playback source equipment (tape recorder), some means of monitoring of each booth in the class via the teacher headset and an intercom 
facility offering 2-way communication between teacher and student.

All but the most simple or first generation laboratories allow the teacher to remotely control 
the tape transport controls of the student booths (record, stop, rewind etc.) from the master 
desk. This allows for easy distribution of the master programme material, which is often copied at high speed onto the student positions for later use by the students at their own pace.

Better tape laboratories housed the tape machine behind a protective plate (leaving only a 
control panel accessible to the students) or locked the cassette door. This kept the expensive 
and sensitive decks free from student misuse and dust etc.

==Operation==
Once the master program had been transferred onto the student recorders, the teacher would then hand over control of the decks to the students. By pressing the record key in the booth, the student would simultaneously hear the playback of the program whilst being able to record his or her voice in the pauses, using the microphone. This is known as an audio active-comparative system. From a technological point of view, this [[overdubbing]] was made possible by use of a two-channel tape recorder

==Problems==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0422-0004, Langenstein, Russischunterricht für Lehrlinge.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white picture of two students wearing headphones. One student's booth is numbered "17", and the other's is numbered "18".|Russian language class in an East German language laboratory (1975)]]

Language laboratories in the 1970s and 1980s received a bad reputation due to breakdowns. Common problems stem from the limitations and relative complexity of the [[reel to reel]] tape system in use at that time. Design played a part too; the simplest language laboratories had no electronic systems in place for the teacher to remotely control the tape decks, relying on the students to operate the decks correctly. Many had no way to stop the tape running off the reel in fast rewind or forward wind, which meant time wasting and greater chances of failure through misuse.

The [[tape recorders]] in use after the early 1970s in the language laboratory were more complex than those in the home, being capable of multitracking and electronic remote control. As a result, they often had several motors and [[relays]], complex [[transistor]]ised circuitry and needed a variety of voltages to run. They had lots of [[rubber]] parts such as idlers and drive belts which would perish and wear out. [[Bulbs]] in the control panels were also in continual need of replacement. Since the student booth tapes were not normally changed from one class to the next but were recorded over each time, these would eventually wear, and shed their oxide on the tape heads leading to poor sound and tangling.

The installations were usually maintained under contract by service engineers, but these often served a county or similar wide area, and would only call at 3-monthly intervals. This meant that if several booths malfunctioned, then for much of that time the laboratory was out of action.

==Change of media==
[[File:Japanese High school Language Lab3.JPG|thumb|alt=A large desk curved round in a semicircle housing five computer monitors and audio equipment.|A modern language laboratory control center]]

The demise of the traditional language laboratory came in the 1980s, with the falling out of favour of the [[audio-lingual method]] commonly in place in 1960s teaching methodology, and the expensive repairs needed to the open reel tape machines due to student misuse, neglect, or wear and tear. Many schools transformed their old language labs into computer suites.  However, the advent of affordable [[multimedia]] capable [[Personal computer|PCs]] in the late 1990s led to a resurgence and transformation of the language laboratory with software and [[hard drives]] in place of reels of analogue [[Magnetic tape|tape]].

In the 1990s new digital, hybrid PC based systems allowed extended functionality, in terms of better "management' of student / teacher audio with some levels of internet and video formats.

Media is 'managed' on these hybrid systems by language lab providers creating a supplementary network over and above the existing PC network for audio connections and communications in fixed locations. These hybrid systems are not without problems, mainly associated with hardware issues  as the manufacturers of these hybrid systems have to replace parts and separate cabling. This both adds to the complexity of the product and has a cost implication via manufacturer annual ‘service’ fees.

==Present day==
[[File:Japanese High school Language Lab4.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A close-up of the space between two student terminals. There are two computers embedded into the desk, and flat-screen monitors sit on top of the desk. The students' headphones are hanging on hooks below the desk.|Student terminals and headphones]]

Today all the major manufacturers say they have a ‘digital’ or a ‘just software’ solution. However, in many cases they still rely on proprietary networks or expensive sound cards to successfully deliver their media. There are very few truly software only solutions that just rely on installing designated language lab software onto a network and then directing just the original network to manage the media between teacher and student, student and student or student back to teacher. In the past the quality of school, or university networks may have meant that the speed that the media could be delivered on ‘software only’ labs would have meant a ‘lag’ in the audio feed. These days all professionally run networks are able to work with these ‘software only’ language lab solutions and deliver media synchronously.

Software only systems can be easily installed onto an existing PC based network, making them both multi locational in their access and much more feature rich in how and what media they manage.

The content that is now used in the new language labs is much richer and self authored or free: now not just audio, but video, flash based games, internet etc. and the speed and variety of the delivery of media from teacher to student, student to teacher, is much quicker and therefore much more engaging for both teacher and student.

Further developments in language labs are now apparent as access moves from a fixed network and related Microsoft operating systems to online and browsers. Students can now access and work from these new 'cloud' labs from their own devices at any time and anywhere. Students can interrogate and record audio and video files and be marked and assessed by their teachers remotely.

==Digital language labs==
The principle of a language lab essentially has not changed. They are still a teacher-controlled system connected to a number of student booths, containing a student's control mechanism and a headset with a microphone. Digital language labs have the same principle. A software-only language lab changes the concept of where and what a language lab is. Software can be installed and accessed on any networked PC anywhere on a school, college, or university campus. Software-only systems can be located in one room, from room-to-room or campus-to-campus.

==Functionality==
The levels of functionality of current language labs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. All labs will have a level of teacher control to manage student licenses / desktops. The more sophisticated ‘software only’ labs have a higher level of teacher management and control over the student desktop. One of the key differences with the ‘high end’ ‘software only’ products is their ability to work ‘live’ with the students as they record and work with media. So instead of waiting to correct student recordings after they have been recorded and collected back it is now possible for a teacher to work synchronously and ‘live’ with students on their own, in pairs and in groups, thus enhancing the immediacy of the teaching and learning experience.

The next generation digital language labs allow teachers to monitor, control, deliver, group, display, review and collect, audio, video and web based multimedia content. The student player is linked to the teacher console and can play audio, video and web based formats. Students can rewind, stop, start, go back to last silence, record, fast forward, repeat phrase and bookmark.

== Advantages ==
There are different features of language lab, which make the students to have interactive session.  It provides equal opportunity to all the students to hear the instructor irrespective of place where they are seated. There will be less miscommunication because of direct nature of the sound transmission. It also provides the privacy that encourages the shy students to speak without any hesitation. In addition instructor can speak to individual or group of students in privacy without interrupting rest of class. Language labs motivate students to talk freely and lose the shyness when talking in front of their friends. Attention on subject is increased resulting in better retention of the concepts. Furthermore, it develops the listening and communication skills, since they hear correct pronunciation through their headphones. Learner will show more enthusiasm and excitement in learning lesson because of learning lab system.
Teacher can look after each student, which is not possible in case of the regular classroom. In a lab instructor can communicate with many students by pressing a mouse key in order to talk with students. Efficient use of time and learning efficiency is much more than usual classroom learning. This set up fosters more interactive session between students and teacher. The language lab brings variety in teaching learning process instead of boring verbal centered teaching. The student’s progress can also be monitored regularly so that teacher can provide feedback based on individual pace and ability. Finally, the students can learn the lesson at their own pace thus allowing the classroom as student-centered approach.&lt;ref&gt;•	http://download.ascdirect-usa.com/lab%20benefits/benefits%20and%20advantages.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
It is very expensive to set up the language lab in country like India.Because There is no lab syllabus and usually language classes are conducted as theory. Moreover, the lab can engage maximum of 60 students hence space is also difficult for school.  These days student does not have enough patience to listen to pronunciation and practice them so the recording of pronunciation is useless. As the teacher listens to students randomly the response can be unorganized and ineffective as there are many students to attend to.  The teacher should be well trained in executing the language lab effectively. Given the nature of teaching, a language teacher may need an assistant in taking care of the technological part while teacher attends to the instructional components. As technology changes rapidly, there should be a provision for an upgrade in the medium of instructions, which can be burden for school in terms of finances. The ministry of education should consider allocating funds to set up as well as maintenance of language lab. If all these basic problems can be solved only then we can think of implementing language lab in our curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=singh|first1=S|title=Language Laboratory: Purposes and Shortcomings|journal=journal of Technology for ELT|date=2013|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of language ==
In the current digital age, we are all connected regardless of the geographic distance. Advancement in technology has metaphorically brought the world into our living room in the form of TV or internet which allow us to watch events happening in other countries or talk to friends and family living in another continents via internet. As a result, we are exposed to different languages, cultures and traditions of people from all over the world. As we live in multilingual and multicultural world, language lab can greatly help students to learn language of their choice, as it will allow students to learn at their own pace. They can record and assess their performance to make sure that they are paying attention to all aspects of phonetics such as pronunciation, accents and stress etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hmoud|first1=SNA Al|title=The Effectiveness of using English Lab on English Language Students` Pronunciation|journal=Journal of Scientific Research|date=2014|volume=1|pages=84–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language lab provides access to native-speakers via audio-video aids so that they learn correctly. Given large number of students pursue higher studies outside their home country; language lab would help them in studying the language of the country where they are planning to pursue their higher education. For example, non-native English speaking students are required to give TOEFL/IELTS if they plan to study in North America. While there are several benefits to language resource center, there should be proper safeguard in place to regulate and monitor the use of technologies employed in the teaching learning process so that students do not misuse them. It is also important that the lay out of the lab is conducive for effective communication and monitoring of the students. As strong communication skills are essential in almost all of the professional careers, language lab can help in acquiring this important skill.

'''Lauretta Vinciarelli''' (1943 – August 3, 2011) was an artist, architect, and professor of architecture at the collegiate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNight|first1=Jenna, M.|title=In Remberance|url=http://www.architecturalrecord.com|publisher=Architectural Record|date=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lauretta Vinciarelli: Biography|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Lauretta_Vinciarelli|website=www.sfmoma.org|publisher=San Francisco Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and education ==
Born in [[Arbe]], [[Italy]], Lauretta Vinciarelli was the daughter of Alberto and Annunciata Cencioni Vinciarelli. The family moved to Rome where she grew up, and her father was an organist in the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican, and her mother was a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amateau|first1=Albert|title=Lauretta Vinciarelli, 68, a painter emphasizing horizon, light, and color, as well as A architecture professor|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_435/lauretta.html|website=The Villager|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinciarelli studied architecture at [[Sapienza University of Rome]], and was accepted to the Ordine degli Architetti di Roma e del Lazio (the Italian Board of Architects). She practiced architecture in [[Rome]] before emigrating to the U.S. in 1968. In 1993, she married Peter Rowe, a distinguished professor of architecture at [[Harvard University]].

== Career ==

=== Education ===
After moving to the U.S., Vinciarelli taught architecture design studio for many years in many schools, including [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]], Texas, [[University of Illinois]], [[Pratt Institute]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Columbia University]], City College, and The Open Atelier of Design and Architecture (OADA), a non-accredited design school founded by Giuseppe Zambonini in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biographical information on contributors|journal=Oz: Journal of the College of Architecture, Planning &amp; Design of Kansas State University|date=1995|volume=17|issue=10|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4148/2378-5853.1276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amateau|first1=Albert|title=Lauretta Vinciarelli, 68, a painter as well as architecture professor|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_435/lauretta.html|website=The Villager|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larson|first1=Jen|title=The Open Atelier: "I was told he was a designer and a poet…"|url=http://newschoolarchives.org|publisher=The New School Archives|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
During the 1980s, Vinciarelli worked with [[Minimalist]] artist [[Donald Judd]] in [[New York City]] and in the American Southwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerup|first1=Lars|title=After The City|date=October 1, 2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262621576|pages=208|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Marfa, Texas|Marfa]], [[Texas]]. Marfa quickly became a research site for theoretical postmodern architectural proposals such as ''Marfa II Project, Marfa,'' l978 and ''untitled drawings 1981.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ian|first1=Fraser|title=Envision Architecture: An Analysis of Drawing|date=November 15, 1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471284793|pages=208|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kice|first1=Karen|title=Chatter: Architecture Talks Back|date=June 23, 2015|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0300210639|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinciarelli used a rigorously inductive methodology to define and integrate fundamental architecture and design components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Matilda McQuaid ; with an introduction by Terence|title=Envisioning architecture : drawings from the Museum of Modern Art|date=2002|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|location=New York|isbn=0870700111|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinciarelli|first1=Lauretta|title=7 Courtyard Studies for South West texas|journal=Art &amp; Architecture|issue=Winter 1981|pages=36–37|url=http://www.artsandarchitecture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of the Marfa "hangar and courthouse" study, Vinciarelli stated her aim was ''"to form a fabric."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Ross|title=Reading Architectural Writing : Drawings of Unbuilt Projects Reveal Two Unique Approaches|journal=Residential Interiors|date=July 1980|pages=76–77, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Vinciarelli and Judd entered the winning entry for the Kennedy Square [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], competition. Their project drew upon Vinciarelli's earlier work, including her [[landscape architecture]] proposal of 1977 for a system of urban gardens, commissioned by the Regional Administration of [[Apulia]], in southern [[Italy]]. In 1986, Vinciarelli was awarded an Artists Fellowship in Architecture by the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYFA Directory of Artists Fellows 1985-2013|url=https://www.nyfa.org/|website=New York Foundation for the Arts|publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
From the early 1980s until the end of her life, Vinciarelli created evanescent watercolor-and-ink studies of hypothetical architectural spaces. Her work has been analyzed by scholars and critics, including [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] and [[K. Michael Hays]] in ''Not Architecture But Evidence That It Exists.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxtable|first1=Ada Louise|title=On Architecture: Collected Reflections on a Century of Change|date=2008|publisher=Walker Books|isbn=0802717071|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hays|first1=K. Michael|title=Not Architecture but Evidence That It Exists: A Note on Lauretta Vinciarelli's Watercolors|journal=Assemblage|date=April 1999|issue=38|pages=48|doi=10.2307/3171247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinciarelli belonged to an esteemed and influential group of contemporary '''paper architects,''' which included, among others, [[Raimund Abraham]], [[John Hejduk]], [[Gaetano Pesce]], [[Lebbeus Woods]], and [[Aldo Rossi]]. Vinciarelli created powerful and inspiring, hand-crafted imagery of [[topological space]], on paper, which is a distillation of traditional, historical, and imaginal references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karen D.|first1=Stein|title=Imagined Spaces|journal=Architectural Record|date=September 1993|volume=181|issue=9|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her use of water elements extend the ''essence of architecture'' through transparency and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filler|first1=Martin|title=Building with Paper and Water|journal=Design Quarterly|date=October 1992|volume=57|page=15|url=http://www.walkerart.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About her artwork, Vinciarelli said, ''The architectural space I have painted since 1987 does not portray solutions to specific demands of use, it is not the space of a project; at least not a project as the rational answer to a program.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinciarelli|first1=Lauretta|title=Red Rooms, Water Enclosures, and Other Unfolding Space|journal=Oz: Journal of the College of Architecture, Planning and Design, Kansas State University|date=1995|volume=17|url=http://newprairiepress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''leishu''''' ({{zh|t=類書|l=category books}}) is a genre of [[Reference work|reference books]] historically compiled in China and other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]]. The term is generally translated as "encyclopedia", although the ''leishu'' are quite different from the modern notion of [[encyclopedia]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

== Overview ==

The ''leishu'' are composed of sometimes lengthy citations from other works,{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} and often contain copies of entire works, not just excerpts.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The works are classified by a systematic set of categories, which are further divided into subcategories.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} ''Leishu'' may be considered [[anthologies]], but are encyclopedic in the sense that they may comprise the entire realm of knowledge at the time of compilation.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}}

Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled from the early third century until the eighteenth century, of which 200 have survived.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=603}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled was the 1408 ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', containing 370 million [[Chinese characters]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} and the largest ever printed was the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

==History==
[[File:Yongle Dadian Encyclopedia 1403.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled]]

The genre first appeared in the early third century. The earliest known was the ''[[Huanglan]]'' ("Emperor's mirror"{{efn|Compare the later "[[speculum literature]]" in the Western tradition.}}). Sponsored by the emperor of [[Cao Wei]], it was compiled around 220, but has since [[Lost works|been lost]].{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} However, the term ''leishu'' was not used until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

In later imperial China dynasties, such as the [[Ming]] and [[Qing]], emperors sponsored monumental projects to compile all known human knowledge into a single ''leishu'', in which entire works, rather than excerpts, were copied and classified by category.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled, on the order of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of Ming, was the ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'' containing a total of 370 million [[Chinese characters]]. The project involved 2,169 scholars, who worked for four years under general editor [[Yao Guangxiao]]. It was completed in 1408, but never printed, as the imperial treasury had run out of money.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}}

The ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (Imperially approved synthesis of books and illustrations past and present) is by far the largest ''leishu'' ever printed, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}} It was compiled by a team of scholars led by [[Chen Menglei]], and printed between 1726 and 1728, during the Qing dynasty.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

The ''riyong leishu'' (encyclopedias for daily use), containing practical information for people who were literate but below the [[Confucian]] elite, were also compiled in the later imperial era. Today, they provide scholars with valuable information on non-elite culture and attitudes.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

According to [[Jean-Pierre Diény]], the [[Jiaqing Emperor|Jiaqing reign]] (1796–1820) of the Qing dynasty saw the end of the publication of ''leishu''.{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==In other countries==
[[File:Sancai Tuhui World Map.jpg|thumb|The world map entitled [[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]], from the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', an illustrated ''leishu'']]

Other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]] also adopted the genre of ''leishu''. In 1712, the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', a richly illustrated ''leishu'' compiled by Ming scholar Wang Qi (王圻) in the early 17th century, was printed in Japan as ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]''. The Japanese version was edited by Terajima Ryōan (寺島良安), a physician born in [[Osaka]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==Importance==
The ''leishu'' have played an important role in the preservation of ancient works, many of which have been lost, only preserved completely or partially as part of a ''leishu'' compilation. The 7th-century ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' is especially valuable. It contains excerpts from 1,400 pre-7th century works, 90% of which have been otherwise lost. Even though the ''Yongle Dadian'' is itself largely lost, the remnants still contain 385 complete books that have been otherwise lost.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}} The ''leishu'' also provide a unique view of the transmission of knowledge and education, and an easy way to locate traditional materials on any given subject.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

==Major compilations==
Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled, from the Cao Wei period (early third century) until the 18th century, of which 200 have survived. Among the most important, in chronological order, are:{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=603–5}}

*''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' (Collection of literature arranged by categories), compiled by [[Ouyang Xun]]
*''[[Beitang Shuchao]]'' (Excerpts from books in the Northern Hall), compiled by [[Yu Shinan]] ca. 630
*''[[Chuxue Ji]]'' (Writings for elementary instruction), compiled by Xu Jian et al. between 713 and 742
*''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' (''Taiping Imperial Reader''), compiled by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] et al., published 984
*''[[Cefu Yuangui]]'' (Outstanding models from the storehouse of literature), compiled by [[Wang Qinruo]] et al., completed in 1013
*''[[Yuhai]]'' (Ocean of jade), compiled by [[Wang Yinglin]] 1330–40
*''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', completed 1408, the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled
*''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', 1726–28, the largest ''leishu'' ever printed

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10610">An '''education ministry''' is a national or subnational [[government agency]] politically responsible for education. Various other names are commonly used to identify such agencies, such as '''Ministry of Education''', '''Department of Education''', '''Ministry of Public Education''', and so forth, and the head of such an agency may be a '''Minister of Education''' or '''Secretary of Education'''. Such agencies typically address educational concerns such as the quality of schools or standardization of curriculum. The first such ministry ever is considered to be the [[Commission of National Education]] ({{lang-pl|Komisja Edukacji Narodowej}}, {{lang-lt|Edukacinė komisija}}) founded in 1773 in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Following is a list of education ministries by country:

'''''Micro Live''''' was a [[BBC Two|BBC2]] TV series that was produced by David Allen as part of the BBC's Computer Literacy Project, and followed on from earlier series such as ''[[The Computer Programme]]'', ''[[Computers In Control]]'', and ''[[Making the Most of the Micro]]''.  As the name implies, the series was broadcast live (so causing its own problems such as the infamous incident of the hacked email account).

The first programme was a one-off two-hour-long special, broadcast on Sunday 2 October 1983 as ''Making the Most of the Micro Live''.&lt;ref name="writeover"&gt;This was the name as featured in the title sequence, with ''Live'' being drawn across its predecessor's original title text.&lt;/ref&gt; A second one-hour special was broadcast in the summer of 1984, during which it was announced that ''Micro Live'' would be back on BBC2 as a regular monthly one-hour series starting in October of that year. A second season of ''Micro Live'' launched in 1985 as a weekly half-hour programme and was followed by a third series of weekly half-hour shows in 1986. The series broadcast its last programme on 28 March 1987.

The scope of the programme was much wider than the preceding computer series and had a less formal feel due to its live nature. Not only did it cover more subject areas but it also featured more microcomputers instead of its main focus being the [[BBC Micro]]. It regularly included stories from the United States and recorded various small but significant milestones, such as the first on-air transatlantic mobile phone call, made in a snowstorm from the top of a New York skyscraper to Lesley Judd sitting in a [[Sinclair C5]] outside Television Centre.

==Presenters==
[[Ian McNaught-Davis]] was once again the anchorman and he was joined over the course of the series by regulars [[Lesley Judd]], [[Fred Harris (presenter)|Fred Harris]] and [[Connor Freff Cochran]], an American journalist who did live broadcast and filmed reports from the USA.

==BBC Software for Schools Competition==
The joint winners of this competition held in 1984 were [[Trevor Inns]] from [[Drayton Manor High School]] and Simon Harriss and David Eldridge of William Howard School, Brampton.

==Hacking incident==
The first one-off special was the subject of a memorable hacking incident. [[Ian McNaught-Davis]] and [[John Coll]] logged into the programme's BT Gold email account to demonstrate the features of the then relatively new idea of email, only to find that the account had been hacked. Shortly before air, the floor manager had informed Ian McNaught-Davis the password for the account, unfortunately while his microphone was live. Visiting computer guests, who were in the [[Green Room]], overheard this information and immediately telephoned a friendly hacker, who proceeded to use the information to get into the account.

The following text was displayed once [[John Coll]] had logged in:

:Computer Security Error. Illegal access.
:I hope your Television PROGRAMME runs
:as smoothly as my PROGRAM worked out
:your passwords! Nothing is secure!

:        '''Hackers' Song.'''

:"Put another password in,
:Bomb it out and try again,
:Try to get past logging in,
:we're Hacking, Hacking, Hacking.

:Try his first wife's maiden name,
:This is more than just a game,
:It's real fun, but just the same,
:It's Hacking, Hacking, Hacking."

:The NutCracker
: ( Hackers' UK )

HI THERE, OWLETS, FROM OZ AND YUG
(OLIVER AND GUY)

After that John Coll was able to read his email and continue the demonstration as no damage had been done to the account (although ''Oz and Yug'' had sent a few emails).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">The '''National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard''' ('''NIMAS''') helps facilitate timely access to alternate formats of [[instructional materials]] for students with [[visual impairments]] or other [[print disabilities]]. NIMAS (pronounced NYE-mas) outlines a set of consistent and valid [[XML]]-based source files created by [[K-12]] [[curriculum]] [[publishers]] or other content producers. These well-structured source files can be used to create [[accessible]] specialized formats (i.e., [[braille]], audio, [[e-text]], [[large print]], etc.) of print instructional materials. The full set of files includes XML content files, a package file, [[image]]s, and a [[PDF]] file of the title page (or whichever page contains [[ISBN]] and [[copyright]] information).

In a significant step forward for students with disabilities, the [[U.S. Congress]] adopted NIMAS as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, a reauthorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].

[[File:Aleksandria raamatukogu IMG 0119.JPG |thumb|upright=1.2|Outside view of the planetarium dome]]

The '''Planetarium Science Center''' is a department in the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. It promotes the concept of science centers as an educational tool.

== The Sections of the PSC ==
=== The Planetarium ===

A planetarium may be defined as:
*A building housing, an instrument for projecting the position of celestial bodies onto a domed celling.
*An optical device for projecting images of celestial bodies and astronpmical phenomena onto the inner surface of a hemispherical dome.

The Bibliotheca Alexandrina's Planetarium Shows:
* Solarmax (IMAX 40min.)
* Star Show (Live Show 45min.)
* Oasis in Space (Panorama 25 min.)
* Ring of fire (IMAX 40 min.)
* Human Body (IMAX 40 min.)

=== ALEXPloratorium ===

It is located next to the Planetarium, where visitors are able to interact with its exhibits which cover various scientific topics, with emphasis on Physics and Astronomy.

=== Listen and Discover ===

Short and simple scientific documentary films are displayed according to a predefined schedule. The films are of a lively nature that attract audience and help them understand scientific issues in an appealing, simple yet interesting manner.

== Programs in the PSC ==
=== Hands-on Workshops ===

*[[Time measurement]]

===Remote Sensing Workshop ===
This program introduces the scientific participles of remote sensing. and offers hands-on applications. Participants are introduced to the impact of natural events through history using a series of satellites images, as well as the analysis of recent images to comprehend the current situation. They are also exposed to other environmental issues that are related to the workshop theme.

===Zoom Earth Program===
This program comprises different kinds of educational activities, such as series of lectures, workshops and field trips. The program mainly tackles topics such as irrigation, meteorology, volcanoes and earthquakes. 

===Discover your Environment Camp ===
A winter camp, Discover your Environment allows students to interact with various fields of science through entertaining activities in the courses of an amazing journey to the Siwa desert organized by the PSC. 

===RoboAlex Center===
The RoboAlex Center at the Alexploratorium offers hands-on robotic challenges guided by animators. The participating groups design, program, and test robots on a special playing field to accomplish certain missions.

===Science Club===
Science Club implements educational and science programs at schools; they aim to "simulate curiosity, interest and enjoyment in science and its methods of inquiry, to develop experiment and investigative abilities and develop children's abilities and skills." 

===Super Science Show===
The Super Science Show gets participating children involved in hands-on experiment. The show includes experiments in the fields of physics, biology, and chemistry.

===Alexploratorium Contest===
The Alexploratorium Contest familiarize students of different age groups with essential topics in science like IQ tests and teamwork; it also tackles important scientific discoveries.

== Important Events in the PSC ==
===Eratosthenes===
Eratosthenes is a traditional annual Festival that the Bibliotheca Alexandrina organizes with the aim of promoting science and heritage among school students. The Festivities of 2003-2008 evolved around measuring the Earth's circumference, following the footsteps of [[Eratosthenes]].

===First-Lego League in Egypt Competition Finale===
The result of an alliance between '''FIRST'''(For Inspiration and Recogenition of Science and Technology) and '''[[LEGO]]''', First Lego League (FLL) is an international hands-on, sport-like robotics program for children 9-14. 
Guided by mentors, FLL student solve actual engineering challenges.

===Intel BASEF===
The Planetarium Science Center (PSC), in collaboration with Intel Co. organizes the [https://www.bibalex.org/psc/intelbasef/staticpage/staticpage_en.aspx?page=2 Intel Bibliotheca Alexandrina Science and Engineering Fair] (Intel BASEF) hosted by the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) in March. Intel BASEF brings together students in grades 9–12; 14-18 years of age; from Alexandria and neighboring governorates to train, research, innovate, compete, and winning.
The winning projects, one team project and two individual projects, will represent Egypt in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) that takes place in the United States of America.
===World Water Day===
On the occasion of the international celebration of [[World Water Day]], the PSC organizes one-day festival.

===World Environmental Day===
Commemorated each year on 5 June, World Environmental Day (or simply [[Earth Day]]) is one of the vehicles through which the [[United Nations]] stimulates worldwide awareness of the environment and enhances political attention and action. The Slogan for 2008 was '''"CO2 Kick the habit"''': Towards a low-carbon Economy.

== The Planetarium's Revamp ==
The Bibliotheca Alexandrina reopened its planetarium doors after having equipped itself with a newly installed state of the art dome projection system and a set of stunning shows to go along with it.

With the new system running, the sea-side Bibliotheca and the Planetarium Science Center (PSC, the library's affiliate nonprofit educational center) are now ready to jointly host the 20th International Planetarium Society conference in June, 2010.

===Digistar 3===
The planetarium describes its new system which is known as Digistar 3 as a "cutting-edge full-dome projection system with a rich set of real-time 3D astronomy features and a wide database of celestial bodies that enables the audience to explore the universe as never before."

===Stunning Shows===

"Stars of the Pharaohs" is one of the shows currently displayed at the PSC which is centered on Ancient Egyptian astronomy. It answers questions like how much truth is there to claims that the Pharaohs' monuments were observatories, possessed magical powers or were even built by aliens? How did the Egyptians see and use the stars, and what is their legacy to us?

"New Horizons" on the other hand is a show focusing on modern astronomical discoveries and insights. The show promises to take the viewer on an "expedition through the Solar System and into the realm of comets." Its focus is one of exploration.

Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency.  In both the public and private sectors, [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While ''program evaluation'' first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are ''unintended'' outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3060080|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluators help to answer these questions, but the best way to answer the questions is for the evaluation to be a joint project between evaluators and stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hints for Conducting Strong Evaluations|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eval/strongevaluations/index.htm|work=Program Evaluation|publisher=CDC - Office of the Associate Director for Program - Program Evaluation|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of evaluation is considered to be a relatively recent phenomenon. However, planned social evaluation has been documented as dating as far back as 2200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shadish, W. R., Cook, T. D., &amp; Leviton, L. C.|title=Foundations of program evaluation: Theories of practice.|year=1991|publisher=Sage.|location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaluation became particularly relevant in the U.S. in the 1960s during the period of the [[Great Society]] social programs associated with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/dolchp06.htm|title=U.S. Department of Labor -- Brief History of DOL - Eras of the New Frontier and the Great Society, 1961-1969|publisher=dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/051.html National Archives, Records of the Office of Management and Budget (1995) ''51.8.8 Records of the Office of Program Evaluation'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extraordinary sums were invested in social programs, but the impacts of these investments were largely unknown.

Program evaluations can involve both [[quantitative method|quantitative]] and [[qualitative method]]s of [[social research]]. People who do program evaluation come from many different backgrounds, such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[social work]], and [[public policy]]. Some graduate schools also have specific training programs for program evaluation.

==Doing an evaluation==

Program evaluation may be conducted at several stages during a program's lifetime. Each of these stages raises different questions to be answered by the evaluator, and correspondingly different evaluation approaches are needed. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (2004) suggest the following kinds of assessment, which may be appropriate at these different stages:

* Assessment of the need for the program
* Assessment of program design and logic/theory
* Assessment of how the program is being implemented (i.e., is it being implemented according to plan? Are the program's processes maximizing possible outcomes?)
* Assessment of the program's outcome or impact (i.e., what it has actually achieved)
* Assessment of the program's cost and efficiency

===Assessing needs===
A needs assessment examines the population that the program intends to target, to see whether the need as conceptualized in the program actually exists in the population; whether it is, in fact, a problem; and if so, how it might best be dealt with. This includes identifying and diagnosing the actual problem the program is trying to address, who or what is affected by the problem, how widespread the problem is, and what are the measurable effects that are caused by the problem. For example, for a housing program aimed at mitigating homelessness, a program evaluator may want to find out how many people are homeless in a given geographic area and what their demographics are. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (2004) caution against undertaking an intervention without properly assessing the need for one, because this might result in a great deal of wasted funds if the need did not exist or was misconceived.

Needs assessment involves the processes or methods used by evaluators to describe and diagnose social needs&lt;ref name="Rossi"/&gt;
This is essential for evaluators because they need to identify whether programs are effective and they cannot do this unless they have identified what the problem/need is. Programs that do not do a needs assessment can have the illusion that they have eradicated the problem/need when in fact there was no need in the first place. Needs assessment involves research and regular consultation with community stakeholders and with the people that will benefit from the project before the program can be developed and implemented. Hence it should be a bottom-up approach. In this way potential problems can be realized early because the process would have involved the community in identifying the need and thereby allowed the opportunity to identify potential barriers.

The important task of a program evaluator is thus to:
First, construct a precise definition of what the problem is.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt; Evaluators need to first identify the problem/need. This is most effectively done by collaboratively including all possible stakeholders, i.e., the community impacted by the potential problem, the agents/actors working to address and resolve the problem, funders, etc.  Including buy-in early on in the process reduces potential for push-back, miscommunication, and incomplete information later on.

Second, assess the extent of the problem.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
Having clearly identified what the problem is, evaluators need to then assess the extent of the problem. They need to answer the ‘where’ and ‘how big’ questions. Evaluators need to work out where the problem is located and how big it is. Pointing out that a problem exists is much easier than having to specify where it is located and how rife it is. Rossi, Lipsey &amp; Freeman (2004) gave an example that: a person identifying some battered children may be enough evidence to persuade one that child abuse exists. But indicating how many children it affects and where it is located geographically and socially would require knowledge about abused children, the characteristics of perpetrators and the impact of the problem throughout the political authority in question.

This can be difficult considering that child abuse is not a public behavior, also keeping in mind that estimates of the rates on private behavior are usually not possible because of factors like unreported cases. In this case evaluators would have to use data from several sources and apply different approaches in order to estimate incidence rates. There are two more questions that need to be answered:&lt;ref name="Barbazette"&gt;{{cite paper |last=Barbazette |first=J. |year=2006 |title=What is needs assessment? |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/57/07879752/0787975257.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evaluators need to also answer the ’how’ and ‘what’ questions&lt;ref name=Barbazette/&gt; The ‘how’ question requires that evaluators determine how the need will be addressed. Having identified the need and having familiarized oneself with the community evaluators should conduct a performance analysis to identify whether the proposed plan in the program will actually be able to eliminate the need. The ‘what’ question requires that evaluators conduct a task analysis to find out what the best way to perform would be. For example, whether the job performance standards are set by an organization or whether some governmental rules need to be considered when undertaking the task.&lt;ref name=Barbazette/&gt;

Third, define and identify the target of interventions and accurately describe the nature of the service needs of that population&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
It is important to know what/who the target population is/are – it might be individuals, groups, communities, etc. There are three units of the population: population at risk, population in need and population in demand&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
* Population  at risk: are people with a significant probability of developing the risk e.g. the population at risk for birth control programs are women of child-bearing age.
* Population in need: are people with the condition that the program seeks to address; e.g. the population in need for a program that aims to provide ARV’s to HIV positive people are people that are HIV positive.
* Population in demand: that part of the population in need that agrees to be having the need and are willing to take part in what the program has to offer e.g. not all HIV positive people will be willing to take ARV’s.
Being able to specify what/who the target is will assist in establishing appropriate boundaries, so that interventions can correctly address the target population and be feasible to apply&lt;&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;

There are four steps in conducting a needs assessment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouda|first1= R. H.|last2=Kusy|first2= M. E.|year=1995|title=Needs assessment: The first step|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~rouda/T2_NA.html#website=alumnus.caltech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Perform a ‘gap’ analyses
#:Evaluators need to compare current situation to the desired or necessary situation. The difference or the gap between the two situations will help identify the need, purpose and aims of the program.
#Identify priorities and importance
#:In the first step above, evaluators would have identified a number of interventions that could potentially address the need e.g. training and development, organization development etc. These must now be examined in view of their significance to the program’s goals and constraints. This must be done by considering the following factors: cost effectiveness (consider the budget of the program, assess cost/benefit ratio), executive pressure (whether top management expects a solution) and population (whether many key people are involved).
# Identify causes of performance problems and/or opportunities
#:When the needs have been prioritized the next step is to identify specific problem areas within the need to be addressed. And to also assess the skills of the people that will be carrying out the interventions.
# Identify possible solutions and growth opportunities
#:Compare the consequences of the interventions if it was to be implemented or not.
Needs analysis is hence a very crucial step in evaluating programs because the effectiveness of a program cannot be assessed unless we know what the problem was in the first place.

===Assessing program theory===
The program theory, also called a [[logic model]] or impact pathway,&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Framework for Program Evaluation in Public Health. MMWR 1999;48(No. RR-11).&lt;/ref&gt; is an assumption, implicit in the way the program is designed, about how the program's actions are supposed to achieve the outcomes it intends. This 'logic model' is often not stated explicitly by people who run programs, it is simply assumed, and so an evaluator will need to draw out from the program staff how exactly the program is supposed to achieve its aims and assess whether this logic is plausible. For example, in an HIV prevention program, it may be assumed that educating people about HIV/AIDS transmission, risk and safe sex practices will result in safer sex being practiced. However, research in South Africa increasingly shows that in spite of increased education and knowledge, people still often do not practice safe sex.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Riet, M. (2009). 'The production of context: using activity theory to understand behaviour change in response to HIV and AIDS.' Unpublished doctoral dissertation. University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the logic of a program which relies on education as a means to get people to use condoms may be faulty. This is why it is important to read research that has been done in the area.
Explicating this logic can also reveal unintended or unforeseen consequences of a program, both positive and negative. The program theory drives the hypotheses to test for impact evaluation. Developing a logic model can also build common understanding amongst program staff and stakeholders about what the program is actually supposed to do and how it is supposed to do it, which is often lacking (see [[Participatory impact pathways analysis]]). Of course, it is also possible that during the process of trying to elicit the logic model behind a program the evaluators may discover that such a model is either incompletely developed, internally contradictory, or (in worst cases) essentially nonexisistent. This decidedly limits the effectiveness of the evaluation, although it does not necessarily reduce or eliminate the program.&lt;ref&gt;Eveland, JD. (1986) "Small Business Innovation Research Programs: Solutions Seeking Problems". In D. Gray, T. Solomon, and W. Hetzner (eds.), Technological Innovation: Strategies for a New Partnership. Amsterdam: North-Holland&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating a logic model is a wonderful way to help visualize important aspects of programs, especially when preparing for an evaluation. An evaluator should create a logic model with input from many different stake holders. Logic Models have 5 major components: Resources or Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Short-term outcomes, and Long-term outcomes &lt;ref name="McLaughlin, J. A. 1999"&gt;McLaughlin, J. A., &amp; Jordan, G. B. (1999). Logic models: a tool for telling your programs performance story. Evaluation and program planning, 22(1), 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Creating a logic model helps articulate the problem, the resources and capacity that are currently being used to address the problem, and the measurable outcomes from the program. Looking at the different components of a program in relation to the overall short-term and long-term goals allows for illumination of potential misalignments. Creating an actual logic model is particularly important because it helps clarify for all stakeholders: the definition of the problem, the overarching goals, and the capacity and outputs of the program.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin, J. A. 1999"/&gt;

Rossi, Lipsey &amp; Freeman (2004) suggest four approaches and procedures that can be used to assess the program theory.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; These approaches are discussed below.
* Assessment in relation to social needs &lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
This entails assessing the program theory by relating it to the needs of the target population the program is intended to serve. If the program theory fails to address the needs of the target population it will be rendered ineffective even when if it is well implemented.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
* Assessment of logic and plausibility&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
This form of assessment  involves asking a panel of expert reviewers to critically review the logic and plausibility of the assumptions and expectations inherent in the program's design.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt; The review process is unstructured and open ended so as to address certain issues on the program design. Rutman (1980), Smith (1989), and Wholly (1994) suggested the questions listed below to assist with the review process.&lt;ref name= Rossi/&gt;
:Are the program goals and objectives well defined?
:Are the program goals and objectives feasible?
:Is the change process presumed in the program theory feasible?
:Are the procedures for identifying members of the target population, delivering service to them, and sustaining that service through completion well defined and suffiient?
:Are the constituent components, activities, and functions of the program well defined and sufficient?
:Are the resources allocated to the program and its various activities adequate?

* Assessment through comparison with research and practice &lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
This form of assessment requires gaining information from research literature and existing practices to assess various components of the program theory. The evaluator can assess whether the program theory is congruent with research evidence and practical experiences of programs with similar concepts.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;

* Assessment via preliminary observation &lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
This approach involves incorporating firsthand observations into the assessment process as it provides a reality check on the concordance between the program theory and the program itself.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt; The observations can focus on the attainability of the outcomes, circumstances of the target population, and the plausibility of the program activities and the supporting resources.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;

These different forms of assessment of program theory can be conducted to ensure that the program theory is sound.

===Assessing implementation===
Process analysis looks beyond the theory of what the program is supposed to do and instead evaluates how the program is being implemented. This evaluation determines whether the components identified as critical to the success of the program are being implemented.  The evaluation determines whether target populations are being reached, people are receiving the intended services, staff are adequately qualified. Process evaluation is an ongoing process in which repeated measures may be used to evaluate whether the program is being implemented effectively. This problem is particularly critical because many innovations, particularly in areas like education and public policy, consist of fairly complex chains of action. Many of which these elements rely on the prior correct implementation of other elements, and will fail if the prior implementation was not done correctly. This was conclusively demonstrated by [[Gene V. Glass]] and many others during the 1980s. Since incorrect or ineffective implementation will produce the same kind of neutral or negative results that would be produced by correct implementation of a poor innovation, it is essential that evaluation research assess the implementation process itself.&lt;ref&gt;Eveland, JD (1986) "Diffusion, Technology Transfer, and Implementation: Thinking and Talking about Change". Knowledge. 8(2):303-322.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, a good innovative idea may be mistakenly characterized as ineffective, where in fact it simply had never been implemented as designed.

===Assessing the impact (effectiveness)===
The impact evaluation determines the causal effects of the program. This involves trying to measure if the program has achieved its intended outcomes, i.e. program outcomes.

====Program Outcomes====
An outcome is the state of the target population or the social conditions that a program is expected to have changed.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;  Program outcomes are the observed characteristics of the target population or social conditions, not of the program. Thus the concept of an outcome does not necessarily mean that the program targets have actually changed or that the program has caused them to change in any way.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;

There are two kinds of outcomes, namely outcome level and outcome change, also associated with program effect.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;
*'''Outcome level''' refers to the status of an outcome at some point in time.
*'''Outcome change''' refers to the difference between outcome levels at different points in time.
*'''Program effect''' refers to that portion of an outcome change that can be attributed uniquely to a program as opposed to the influence of some other factor.

====Measuring Program Outcomes====
Outcome measurement is a matter of representing the circumstances defined as the outcome by means of observable indicators that vary systematically with changes or differences in those circumstances.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt; Outcome measurement is a systematic way to assess the extent to which a program has achieved its intended outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;The Intermediary Development Series. '' Measuring Outcomes. Dare Mighty Things, INC''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mouton (2009) measuring the impact of a program means demonstrating or estimating the accumulated differentiated proximate and emergent effect, some of which might be unintended and therefore unforeseen.&lt;ref name="Mouton, J 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mouton | first1 = J | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the impact of complex social interventions | url = | journal = Journal of Public Administration | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 849–865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outcome measurement serves to help you understand whether the program is effective or not. It further helps you to clarify your understanding of your program. But the most important reason for undertaking the effort is to understand the impacts of your work on the people you serve.&lt;ref name="Mouton, J 2009"/&gt; With the information you collect, you can determine which activities to continue and build upon, and which you need to change in order to improve the effectiveness of the program.

This can involve using sophisticated statistical techniques in order to measure the effect of the program and to find causal relationship between the program and the various outcomes. More information about impact evaluation is found under the heading 'Determining Causation'.

===Assessing efficiency===
Finally, cost-benefit or cost-efficiency analysis assesses the efficiency of a program. Evaluators outline the benefits and cost of the program for comparison. An efficient program has a lower cost-benefit ratio. There are two types of efficiency, namely, static and dynamic. While static efficiency concerns achieving the objectives with least costs, dynamic efficiency concerns continuous improvement.

==Determining causation==
Perhaps the most difficult part of evaluation is determining whether the program itself is causing the changes that are observed in the population it was aimed at. Events or processes outside of the program may be the real cause of the observed outcome (or the real prevention of the anticipated outcome).

Causation is difficult to determine. One main reason for this is [[Self-selection|self selection]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;Delbert Charles Miller, Neil J. Salkind (2002) ''Handbook of Research Design &amp; Social Measurement. Edition: 6, revised. Published by SAGE,''.&lt;/ref&gt; People select themselves to participate in a program. For example, in a job training program, some people decide to participate and others do not. Those who do participate may differ from those who do not in important ways. They may be more determined to find a job or have better support resources. These characteristics may actually be causing the observed outcome of increased employment, not the job training program.

Evaluations conducted with random assignment are able to make stronger inferences about causation. Randomly assigning people to participate or to not participate in the program, reduces or eliminates [[self-selection bias]]. Thus, the group of people who participate would likely be more comparable to the group who did not participate.

However, since most programs cannot use random assignment, causation cannot be determined. Impact analysis can still provide useful information. For example, the outcomes of the program can be described. Thus the evaluation can describe that people who participated in the program were more likely to experience a given outcome than people who did not participate.

If the program is fairly large, and there are enough data, statistical analysis can be used to make a reasonable case for the program by showing, for example, that other causes are unlikely.

==Reliability, validity and sensitivity in program evaluation==
It is important to ensure that the instruments (for example, tests, questionnaires, etc.) used in program evaluation are as reliable, valid and sensitive as possible. According to Rossi et al. (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;222),&lt;ref name = "Rossi"&gt;Rossi, P. Lipsey, M. W., &amp; Freeman, H.E. (2004). ''Evaluation: A systematic approach'' (7th ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; 'a measure that is poorly chosen or poorly conceived can completely undermine the worth of an impact assessment by producing misleading estimates. Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible'.

===Reliability===
The reliability of a measurement instrument is the 'extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing' (Rossi et al., 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;218).&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will 'appear to be less effective than it actually is' (Rossi et al., 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;219).&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.

===Validity===
The validity of a measurement instrument is 'the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure' (Rossi et al., 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;219).&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).

===Sensitivity===
The principal purpose of the evaluation process is to measure whether the program has an effect on the social problem it seeks to redress; hence, the measurement instrument must be sensitive enough to discern these potential changes (Rossi et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; A measurement instrument may be insensitive if it contains items measuring outcomes which the program couldn't possibly effect, or if the instrument was originally developed for applications to individuals (for example standardized psychological measures) rather than to a group setting (Rossi et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; These factors may result in 'noise' which may obscure any effect the program may have had.

Only measures which adequately achieve the benchmarks of reliability, validity and sensitivity can be said to be credible evaluations. It is the duty of evaluators to produce credible evaluations, as their findings may have far reaching effects. A discreditable evaluation which is unable to show that a program is achieving its purpose when it is in fact creating positive change may cause the program to lose its funding undeservedly.{{synthesis inline|date=February 2012}}

Steps to Program Evaluation Framework

According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) there are six steps to a complete program evaluation. The steps described are: engage stakeholder, describe the program, focus the evaluation design, gather credible evidence, justify conclusions, and ensure use and share lessons learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Disease Control|title=Evaluation Framework|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eval/framework/index.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These steps can happen in a cycle framework to represent the continuing process of evaluation.

==Evaluating Collective Impact==
Though program evaluation processes mentioned here are appropriate for most programs, highly complex non-linear initiatives, such as those using the [[collective impact]] (CI) model, require a dynamic approach to evaluation.  Collective impact is "the commitment of a group of important actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kania|first1=John|last2=Kramer|first2=Mark|title=Collective Impact|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/collective_impact|website=Stanford Social Innovation Review|publisher=Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically involves three stages, each with a different recommended evaluation approach:

* '''Early phase:''' CI participants are exploring possible strategies and developing plans for action.  Characterized by uncertainty.
''Recommended evaluation approach:'' Developmental evaluation to help CI partners understand the context of the initiative and its development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preskill|first1=Hallie|last2=Parkhurst|first2=Marcie|last3=Juster|first3=Jennifer Splansky|title=Guide to Evaluating Collective Impact|url=http://www.fsg.org/Portals/0/Uploads/Documents/PDF/Evaluating_Collective_Impact_Assessing_Progress_2.pdf|website=www.fsg.org|publisher=FSG, Inc.|accessdate=2014-09-19}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Developmental evaluation involves real time feedback about what is emerging in complex dynamic systems as innovators seek to bring about systems change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patton|first1=Michael|title=Evaluation Approaches and Techniques|url=http://tei.gwu.edu/evaluation-approaches-and-techniques#developmental-evaluation|website=The Evaluators' Institute|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Middle phase:''' CI partners implement agreed upon strategies.  Some outcomes become easier to anticipate.
''Recommended evaluation approach:'' Formative evaluation to refine and improve upon the progress, as well as continued developmental evaluation to explore new elements as they emerge.  Formative evaluation involves "careful monitoring of processes in order to respond to emergent properties and any unexpected outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formative Evaluation|url=http://evaluationtoolbox.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24:formative-evaluation&amp;catid=17:formative-evaluation&amp;Itemid=125|website=Community Sustainability Engagement Evaluation Toolbox|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Later phase:'''  Activities achieve stability and are no longer in formation. Experience informs knowledge about which activities may be effective.
''Recommended evaluation approach:'' Summative evaluation "uses both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to get a better understanding of what [the] project has achieved, and how or why this has occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summative Evaluation|url=http://evaluationtoolbox.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=126|website=Community Sustainability Engagement Evaluation Toolbox|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning a program evaluation==
Planning a program evaluation can be broken up into four parts: focusing the evaluation, collecting the information, using the information, and managing the evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor-Powell|first1=Ellen|last2=Steele|first2=Sarah|last3=Douglah|first3=Mohammad|title=Planning a Program Evaluation|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/g3658-1.pdf|website=University of Wisconsin Extension|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program evaluation involves reflecting on questions about evaluation purpose, what questions are necessary to ask, and what will be done with information gathered. Critical questions for consideration include:
*What am I going to evaluate?
*What is the purpose of this evaluation?
*Who will use this evaluation? How will they use it?
*What questions is this evaluation seeking to answer?
*What information do I need to answer the questions?
*When is the evaluation needed? What resources do I need?
*How will I collect the data I need?
*How will data be analyzed?
*What is my implementation timeline?

==Methodological constraints and challenges==

===The shoestring approach===
The "shoestring evaluation approach" is designed to assist evaluators operating under  limited budget, limited access or availability of data and  limited turnaround time, to conduct effective evaluations that are methodologically rigorous(Bamberger, Rugh, Church &amp; Fort, 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bamberger | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1177/109821400402500102 | title = Shoestring Evaluation: Designing Impact Evaluations under Budget, Time and Data Constraints | journal = American Journal of Evaluation | volume = 25 | pages = 5–37| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has responded to the continued greater need for evaluation processes that are more rapid and economical under difficult circumstances of budget, time constraints and limited availability of data.  However, it is not always possible to design an evaluation to achieve the highest standards available. Many programs do not build an evaluation procedure into their design or budget. Hence, many evaluation processes do not begin until the program is already underway, which can result in time, budget or data constraints for the evaluators, which in turn can affect the reliability, validity or sensitivity of the evaluation. &gt; The shoestring approach helps to ensure that the maximum possible methodological rigor is achieved under these constraints.

===Budget constraints===
Frequently, programs are faced with budget constraints because most original projects do not include a budget to conduct an evaluation (Bamberger et al., 2004). Therefore, this automatically results in evaluations being allocated smaller budgets that are inadequate for a rigorous evaluation. Due to the budget constraints it might be difficult to effectively apply the most appropriate   methodological instruments. These constraints may consequently affect the time available in which to do the evaluation (Bamberger et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger" /&gt; Budget constraints may be addressed by simplifying the evaluation design, revising the sample size, exploring economical data collection methods (such as using volunteers to collect data, shortening surveys, or using focus groups and key informants) or looking for reliable secondary data (Bamberger et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger" /&gt;

===Time constraints===
The most time constraint that can be faced by an evaluator is when the evaluator is summoned to conduct an evaluation when a project is already underway if they are given limited time to do the evaluation compared to the life of the study, or if they are not given enough time for adequate planning. Time constraints are particularly problematic when the evaluator is not familiar with the area or country in which the program is situated (Bamberger et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger" /&gt; Time constraints can be addressed by the methods listed under budget constraints as above, and also by careful planning to ensure effective data collection and analysis within the limited time space.

===Data constraints===
If the evaluation is initiated late in the program, there may be no baseline data on the conditions of the target group before the intervention began (Bamberger et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger" /&gt; Another possible cause of data constraints is if the data have been collected by program staff and contain systematic reporting biases or poor record keeping standards and is subsequently of little use (Bamberger et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger" /&gt; Another source of data constraints may result if the target group are difficult to reach to collect data from - for example homeless people, drug addicts, migrant workers, et cetera (Bamberger et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="Bamberger" /&gt; Data constraints can be addressed by reconstructing baseline data from secondary data or through the use of multiple methods. Multiple methods, such as the combination of qualitative and quantitative data can increase validity through triangulation and save time and money.
Additionally, these constraints may be dealt with through '''careful planning and consultation''' with program stakeholders. By clearly identifying and understanding client needs ahead of the evaluation, costs and time of the evaluative process can be streamlined and reduced, while still maintaining credibility.

All in all,  time, monetary and data constraints can have negative implications on the validity, reliability and transferability of the evaluation. The shoestring approach has been created to assist evaluators   to correct  the limitations identified above by identifying ways to reduce costs and time, reconstruct baseline data and to ensure maximum quality under existing constraints (Bamberger et al., 2004).

===Five-tiered approach===
The five-tiered approach to evaluation further develops the strategies that the shoestring approach to evaluation is based upon.&lt;ref name="F.H.J"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = F. H. | title = Child and Family Program Evaluation: Learning to Enjoy Complexity | doi = 10.1207/S1532480XADS0702_3 | journal = Applied Developmental Science | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 62–75 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally developed by Jacobs (1988) as an alternative way to evaluate community-based programs and as such was applied to a statewide child and family program in Massachusetts, U.S.A.&lt;ref name="W&amp;G"&gt;Weiss, H.B., &amp; Greene, J.C. (1992). An empowerment partnership for family support and education programs and evaluations. Family Science Review, 5(1,2): 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The five-tiered approach is offered as a conceptual framework for matching evaluations more precisely to the characteristics of the programs themselves, and to the particular resources and constraints inherent in each evaluation context.&lt;ref name="F.H.J"/&gt; In other words, the five-tiered approach seeks to tailor the evaluation to the specific needs of each evaluation context.

The earlier tiers (1-3) generate descriptive and process-oriented information while the later tiers (4-5) determine both the short-term and the long-term effects of the program.&lt;ref name="NPEN"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Parenting Education Network (n.d.)|title=Five-tiered approach to evaluation|accessdate=September 18, 2012|url=http://www.npen.org/parent-educators/evaluating/approach.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024215551/http://www.npen.org/parent-educators/evaluating/approach.html#|archive-date=2012-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five levels are organized as follows:
* Tier 1: needs assessment (sometimes referred to as pre-implementation)&lt;ref name="B&amp;D"&gt;{{cite web|first1=S. J.|last1=Bailey|first2=M. Y.|last2=Deen|year=2002|title=A Framework for introducing program evaluation to extension faculty and staff|website=Journal of Extension|accessdate=September 18, 2012|url=http://www.joe.org/joe/2002april/iw1.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tier 2: monitoring and accountability
* Tier 3: quality review and program clarification (sometimes referred to as understanding and refining)&lt;ref name="CYF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five-tiered approach to program evaluation|accessdate=September 2012|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/sfcs/cyfernet/cyfar/5_apprch.pdf|format=PdF|website=ag.arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tier 4: achieving outcomes
* Tier 5: establishing impact

For each tier, purpose(s) are identified, along with corresponding tasks that enable the identified purpose of the tier to be achieved.&lt;ref name="CYF"/&gt; For example, the purpose of the first tier, Needs assessment, would be to document a need for a program in a community. The task for that tier would be to assess the community's needs and assets by working with all relevant stakeholders.&lt;ref name="CYF"/&gt;

While the tiers are structured for consecutive use, meaning that information gathered in the earlier tiers is required for tasks on higher tiers, it acknowledges the fluid nature of evaluation.&lt;ref name="NPEN"/&gt; Therefore, it is possible to move from later tiers back to preceding ones, or even to work in two tiers at the same time.&lt;ref name="CYF"/&gt; It is important for program evaluators to note, however, that a program must be evaluated at the appropriate level.&lt;ref name="B&amp;D"/&gt;

The five-tiered approach is said to be useful for family support programs which emphasise community and participant empowerment. This is because it encourages a participatory approach involving all stakeholders and it is through this process of reflection that empowerment is achieved.&lt;ref name="W&amp;G"/&gt;

===Methodological challenges presented by language and culture===
The purpose of this section is to draw attention to some of the methodological challenges and dilemmas evaluators are potentially faced with when conducting a program evaluation in a developing country.  In many developing countries the major sponsors of evaluation are donor agencies from the developed world, and these agencies require regular evaluation reports in order to maintain accountability and control of resources, as well as generate evidence for the program’s success or failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bamberger |first=M. |year=2000 |title=The Evaluation of International Development Programs: A View from the Front |journal=American Journal of Evaluation |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=95–102 |doi=10.1177/109821400002100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are many hurdles and challenges which evaluators face when attempting to implement an evaluation program which attempts to make use of techniques and systems which are not developed within the context to which they are applied.&lt;ref name="Smith, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=T. |year=1990 |title=Policy evaluation in third world countries: some issues and problems |journal=Asian Journal of Public Administration |volume=12 |issue= |pages=55–68 |doi= 10.1080/02598272.1990.10800228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the issues include differences in culture, attitudes, language and political process.&lt;ref name="Smith, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebbutt, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ebbutt |first=D. |year=1998 |title=Evaluation of projects in the developing world: some cultural and methodological issues |journal=International Journal of Educational Development |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=415–424 |doi=10.1016/S0738-0593(98)00038-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture is defined by Ebbutt (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;416) as a "constellation of both written and unwritten expectations, values, norms, rules, laws, artifacts, rituals and behaviors that permeate a society and influence how people behave socially".&lt;ref name="Ebbutt, 1998" /&gt; Culture can influence many facets of the evaluation process, including data collection, evaluation program implementation and the analysis and understanding of the results of the evaluation.&lt;ref name="Ebbutt, 1998" /&gt;  In particular, instruments which are traditionally used to collect data such as questionnaires and semi-structured interviews need to be sensitive to differences in culture, if they were originally developed in a different cultural context.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bulmer |first=M. |last2=Warwick |first2=D. |year=1993 |title=Social research in developing countries: surveys and censuses in the Third World |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-471-10352-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The understanding and meaning of constructs which the evaluator is attempting to measure may not be shared between the evaluator and the sample population and thus the transference of concepts is an important notion, as this will influence the quality of the data collection carried out by evaluators as well as the analysis and results generated by the data.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;

Language also plays an important part in the evaluation process, as language is tied closely to culture.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;  Language can be a major barrier to communicating concepts which the evaluator is trying to access, and translation is often required.&lt;ref name="Ebbutt, 1998" /&gt;  There are a multitude of problems with translation, including the loss of meaning as well as the exaggeration or enhancement of meaning by translators.&lt;ref name="Ebbutt, 1998" /&gt;  For example, terms which are contextually specific may not translate into another language with the same weight or meaning.  In particular, data collection instruments need to take meaning into account as the subject matter may not be considered sensitive in a particular context might prove to be sensitive in the context in which the evaluation is taking place.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;  Thus, evaluators need to take into account two important concepts when administering data collection tools: lexical equivalence and conceptual equivalence.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;  Lexical equivalence asks the question: how does one phrase a question in two languages using the same words?  This is a difficult task to accomplish, and uses of techniques such as back-translation may aid the evaluator but may not result in perfect transference of meaning.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;  This leads to the next point, conceptual equivalence.  It is not a common occurrence for concepts to transfer unambiguously from one culture to another.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;  Data collection instruments which have not undergone adequate testing and piloting may therefore render results which are not useful as the concepts which are measured by the instrument may have taken on a different meaning and thus rendered the instrument unreliable and invalid.&lt;ref name="Bulmer &amp; Warwick, 1993" /&gt;

Thus, it can be seen that evaluators need to take into account the methodological challenges created by differences in culture and language when attempting to conduct a program evaluation in a developing country.

==Utilization results==
There are three conventional uses of evaluation results: '''persuasive utilization''', '''direct (instrumental) utilization''', and '''conceptual utilization'''.

===Persuasive utilization===
Persuasive utilization is the enlistment of evaluation results in an effort to persuade an audience to either support an agenda or to oppose it. Unless the 'persuader' is the same person that ran the evaluation, this form of utilization is not of much interest to evaluators as they often cannot foresee possible future efforts of persuasion.&lt;ref name="Rossi"/&gt;

===Direct (instrumental) utilization===
Evaluators often tailor their evaluations to produce results that can have a direct influence in the improvement of the structure, or on the process, of a program. For example, the evaluation of a novel educational intervention may produce results that indicate no improvement in students' marks. This may be due to the intervention not having a sound theoretical background, or it may be that the intervention is not conducted as originally intended. The results of the evaluation would hopefully cause to the creators of the intervention to go back to the drawing board to re-create the core structure of the intervention, or even change the implementation processes.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

===Conceptual utilization===
But even if evaluation results do not have a direct influence in the re-shaping of a program, they may still be used to make people aware of the issues the program is trying to address. Going back to the example of an evaluation of a novel educational intervention, the results can also be used to inform educators and students about the different barriers that may influence students' learning difficulties. A number of studies on these barriers may then be initiated by this new information.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

===Variables affecting utilization===
There are five conditions that seem to affect the utility of evaluation results, namely ''relevance'', ''communication between the evaluators and the users of the results'', ''information processing by the users'', ''the plausibility of the results'', as well as ''the level of involvement or advocacy of the users''.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

===Guidelines for maximizing utilization===
Quoted directly from Rossi et al. (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;416).:&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;
* Evaluators must understand the cognitive styles of decisionmakers
* Evaluation results must be timely and available when needed
* Evaluations must respect stakeholders' program commitments
* Utilization and dissemination plans should be part of the evaluation design
* Evaluations should include an assessment of utilization

==Internal versus external program evaluators==

The choice of the evaluator chosen to evaluate the program may be regarded as equally important as the process of the evaluation. Evaluators may be internal (persons associated with the program to be executed) or external (Persons not associated with any part of the execution/implementation of the program). (Division for oversight services,2004).  The following provides a brief summary of the advantages and disadvantages of internal and external evaluators adapted from the Division of oversight services (2004), for a more comprehensive list of advantages and disadvantages of internal and external evaluators, see (Division of oversight services, 2004).

===Internal evaluators===
'''Advantages'''
*May have better overall knowledge of the program and possess informal knowledge of the program
*Less threatening as already familiar with staff
*Less costly

'''Disadvantages'''
*May be less objective
*May be more preoccupied with other activities of the program and not give the evaluation complete attention
*May not be adequately trained as an evaluator.

===External evaluators===
'''Advantages'''
* More objective of the process, offers new perspectives, different angles to observe and critique the process
* May be able to dedicate greater amount of time and attention to the evaluation
* May have greater expertise and evaluation brain
'''Disadvantages'''
* May be more costly and require more time for the contract, monitoring, negotiations etc.
* May be unfamiliar with program staff and create anxiety about being evaluated
* May be unfamiliar with organization policies, certain constraints affecting the program.

==Three paradigms==

===Positivist===
Potter (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Potter, C. (2006). Program Evaluation. In M. Terre Blanche, K. Durrheim &amp; D. Painter (Eds.), ''Research in practice: Applied methods for the social sciences'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 410-428). Cape Town: UCT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies and describes three broad paradigms within program evaluation . The first, and probably most common, is the [[positivist]] approach, in which evaluation can only occur where there are "objective", observable and measurable aspects of a program, requiring predominantly quantitative evidence.  The positivist approach includes evaluation dimensions such as needs assessment, assessment of program theory, assessment of program process, impact assessment and efficiency assessment (Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, P., Lipsey, M.W., &amp; Freeman, H.E. (2004). ''Evaluation: a systematic approach'' (7th ed.). Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
A detailed example of the positivist approach is a study conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California report titled "Evaluating Academic Programs in California's Community Colleges", in which the evaluators examine measurable activities (i.e. enrollment data) and conduct quantitive assessments like factor analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill|first=Andrew|title=Evaluating Academic Programs in California's Community Colleges|url=http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=322|publisher=PPIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretive===
The second paradigm identified by Potter (2006) is that of interpretive approaches, where it is argued that it is essential that the evaluator develops an understanding of the perspective, experiences and expectations of all stakeholders.  This would lead to a better understanding of the various meanings and needs held by stakeholders, which is crucial before one is able to make judgments about the merit or value of a program.  The evaluator’s contact with the program is often over an extended period of time and, although there is no standardized method, observation, interviews and focus groups are commonly used.
A report commissioned by the World Bank details 8 approaches in which qualitative and quantitative methods can be integrated and perhaps yield insights not achievable through only one method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolcock|first=Michael|title=Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches in Program Evaluation|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALANALYSIS/1104890-1120158274352/20566665/Integratingqualitativeandquantapproachesraoandwoolcock.pdf|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical-emancipatory===
Potter (2006) also identifies critical-emancipatory approaches to program evaluation, which are largely based on [[action research]] for the purposes of social transformation.  This type of approach is much more ideological and often includes a greater degree of social activism on the part of the evaluator.  This approach would be appropriate for qualitative and participative evaluations.  Because of its critical focus on societal power structures and its emphasis on participation and empowerment, Potter argues this type of evaluation can be particularly useful in developing countries.

Despite the paradigm which is used in any program evaluation, whether it be positivist, interpretive or critical-emancipatory, it is essential to acknowledge that evaluation takes place in specific socio-political contexts.  Evaluation does not exist in a vacuum and all evaluations, whether they are aware of it or not, are influenced by socio-political factors.  It is important to recognize the evaluations and the findings which result from this kind of evaluation process can be used in favour or against particular ideological, social and political agendas (Weiss, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, C.H. (1999). Research-policy linkages: How much influence does social science research have? World Social Science Report, pp. 194-205.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially true in an age when resources are limited and there is competition between organizations for certain projects to be prioritised over others (Louw, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Louw, J. (1999). Improving practice through evaluation. In D. Donald, A. Dawes &amp; J. Louw (Eds.), ''Addressing childhood adversity'' (pp. 60-73). Cape Town: David Philip.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empowerment evaluation==

{{Main|Empowerment evaluation}}

Empowerment evaluation makes use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster improvement and self-determination of a particular program aimed at a specific target population/program participants.&lt;ref name="F.D.M"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fetterman | first1 = D.M. | year = 2002 | title = Empowerment evaluation: Building communities of practice and a culture of learning | url = | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 81–102 | doi=10.1023/a:1014324218388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment evaluation is value oriented towards getting program participants involved in bringing about change in the programs they are targeted for. One of the main focuses in empowerment evaluation is to incorporate the program participants in the conducting of the evaluation process. This process is then often followed by some sort of critical reflection of the program. In such cases, an external/outsider evaluator serves as a consultant/coach/facilitator to the program participants and seeks to understand the program from the perspective of the participants. Once a clear understanding of the participants perspective has been gained appropriate steps and strategies can be devised (with the valuable input of the participants) and implemented in order to reach desired outcomes.

According to Fetterman (2002)&lt;ref name="F.D.M"/&gt; empowerment evaluation has three steps;
*Establishing a mission
*Taking stock
*Planning for the future

===Establishing a mission===

The first step involves evaluators asking the program participants and staff members (of the program) to define the mission of the program. Evaluators may opt to carry this step out by bringing such parties together and asking them to generate and discuss the mission of the program. The logic behind this approach is to show each party that there may be divergent views of what the program mission actually is.

===Taking stock===

Taking stock as the second step consists of two important tasks. The first task is concerned with program participants and program staff generating a list of current key activities that are crucial to the functioning of the program. The second task is concerned with rating the identified key activities, also known as ''prioritization''. For example, each party member may be asked to rate each key activity on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important and 1 the least important. The role of the evaluator during this task is to facilitate interactive discussion amongst members in an attempt to establish some baseline of shared meaning and understanding pertaining to the key activities.In addition, relevant documentation (such as financial reports and curriculum information) may be brought into the discussion when considering some of the key activities.

===Planning for the future===

After prioritizing the key activities the next step is to plan for the future. Here the evaluator asks program participants and program staff how they would like to improve the program in relation to the key activities listed. The objective is to create a thread of coherence whereby the mission generated (step 1) guides the stock take (step 2) which forms the basis for the plans for the future (step 3). Thus, in planning for the future specific goals are aligned with relevant key activities. In addition to this it is also important for program participants and program staff to identify possible forms of evidence (measurable indicators) which can be used to monitor progress towards specific goals. Goals must be related to the program's activities, talents, resources and scope of capability- in short the goals formulated must be realistic.

These three steps of empowerment evaluation produce the potential for a program to run more effectively and more in touch with the needs of the target population. Empowerment evaluation as a process which is facilitated by a skilled evaluator equips as well as empowers participants by providing them with a 'new' way of critically thinking and reflecting on programs. Furthermore, it empowers program participants and staff to recognize their own capacity to bring about program change through collective action.&lt;ref name="F.D.M2"&gt;Fetterman, D.M. (2005). Empowerment evaluation principles in action: Assessing levels of commitment. In D.M. Fetterman &amp; A. Vandersman (Eds.), ''Empowerment evaluation principles in practice''(pp.27-41). New York: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformative Paradigm==
The transformative paradigm is integral in incorporating social justice in evaluation. Donna Mertens, primary researcher in this field, states that the transformative paradigm, "focuses primarily on viewpoints of marginalized groups and interrogating systemic power structures through mixed methods to further social justice and human rights".&lt;ref name="Mertens (2012)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mertens|first=D and Wilson, A.|title=Program Evaluation Theory and Practice: A Comprehensive Guide|year=2012|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, NY|pages=168–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative paradigm arose after marginalized groups, who have historically been pushed to the side in evaluation, began to collaborate with scholars to advocate for social justice and human rights in evaluation.  The transformative paradigm introduces many different paradigms and lenses to the evaluation process, leading it to continually call into question the evaluation process.

Both the [[American Evaluation Association]] and [[National Association of Social Workers]] call attention to the ethical duty to possess [[cultural competence]] when conducting evaluations.  Cultural competence in evaluation can be broadly defined as a systemic, response inquiry that is actively cognizant, understanding, and appreciative of the cultural context in which the evaluation takes place; that frames and articulates epistemology of the evaluation endeavor; that employs culturally and contextually appropriate methodology; and that uses stakeholder-generated, interpretive means to arrive at the results and further use of the findings.&lt;ref name=SenGupta&gt;{{cite book|last=SenGupta|first=S., Hopson, R., &amp; Thompson-Robinson, M.|title=Cultural competence in evaluation:an overview. New Directions in Evaluation, 102.|year=2004|pages=5–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many health and evaluation leaders are careful to point out that cultural competence cannot be determined by a simple checklist, but rather it is an attribute that develops over time.  The root of cultural competency in evaluation is a genuine respect for communities being studied and openness to seek depth in understanding different cultural contexts, practices and paradigms of thinking.  This includes being creative and flexible to capture different cultural contexts, and heightened awareness of power differentials that exist in an evaluation context.  Important skills include: ability to build rapport across difference, gain the trust of the community members, and self-reflect and recognize one’s own biases.&lt;ref name=Endo&gt;{{cite book|last=Endo|first=T., Joh, T., &amp; Yu, H.|title=Voices from the field: Health evaluation leaders in multicultural evaluation|year=2003|publisher=Policy Research Associates|location=Oakland, CA|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradigms===
The paradigms [[axiology]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and [[methodology]] are reflective of social justice practice in evaluation. These examples focus on addressing inequalities and injustices in society by promoting inclusion and equality in human rights.

====Axiology (Values and Value Judgements)====
The transformative paradigm’s axiological assumption rests on four primary principles:&lt;ref name="Mertens (2012)" /&gt;
* The importance of being culturally respectful
* The promotion of social justice
* The furtherance of human rights
* Addressing inequities

====Ontology (Reality)====
Differences in perspectives on  what is real are determined by diverse values and life experiences.  In turn these values and life experiences are often associated with differences in access to privilege, based on such characteristics as disability, gender, sexual identity, religion, race/ethnicity, national origins, political party, income level, are, language,  and immigration or refugee status.&lt;ref name="Mertens (2012)" /&gt;

====Epistemology (Knowledge)====
Knowledge is constructed within the context of power and privilege with consequences attached to which version of knowledge is given privilege.&lt;ref name="Mertens (2012)" /&gt;  "Knowledge is socially and historically located within a complex cultural context".&lt;ref name="Mertens 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mertens|first=D., Yamashita, M.|title=Mission statement for the American Evaluation Association's Topical Interest Group: Mixed Methods in Evaluation.|year=2010|location=Washington DC|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methodology (Systematic Inquiry)====
Methodological decisions are aimed at determining the approach that will best facilitate use of the process and findings to enhance social justice; identify the systemic forces that support the status quo and those that will allow change to happen; and acknowledge the need for a critical and reflexive relationship between the evaluator and the stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Mertens (2012)" /&gt;

===Lenses===
While operating through social justice, it is imperative to be able to view the world through the lens of those who experience injustices. Critical Race Theory, Feminist Theory, and Queer/LGBTQ Theory are frameworks for how we think should think about providing justice for marginalized groups. These lenses create opportunity to make each theory priority in addressing inequality.

====Critical Race Theory====
[[Critical Race Theory]](CRT)is an extension of critical theory that is focused in inequities based on race and ethnicity.  Daniel Solorzano  describes the role of CRT as providing a framework to investigate and make visible those systemic aspects of society that allow the discriminatory and oppressive status quo of racism to continue.&lt;ref name=Solorzano&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solorzano|first=D.|title=Images and Words that wound: Critical race theory, racial stereotyping and teacher education.|journal=Teacher Education Quarterly|year=1997|volume=24|pages=5–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist Theory====
The essence of [[feminist theories]] is to "expose the individual and institutional practices that have denied access to women and other oppressed groups and have ignored or devalued women" &lt;ref name=Brabeck&gt;{{cite book|last=Brabeck|first=M. &amp; Brabeck, K.|title=Feminist Perspective on Research Ethics|year=2009|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queer/LGBTQ Theory====
[[Queer theory|Queer/LGBTQ theorists]] question the heterosexist bias that pervades society in terms of power over and discrimination toward sexual orientation minorities.  Because of the sensitivity of issues surrounding LGBTQ status, evaluators need to be aware of safe ways to protect such individuals’ identities and ensure that discriminatory practices are brought to light in order to bring about a more just society.&lt;ref name="Mertens (2012)" /&gt;

==Government requirements==
Given the Federal budget deficit, the Obama Administration moved to apply an "evidence-based approach" to government spending, including rigorous methods of program evaluation.  The President's 2011 Budget earmarked funding for 19 government program evaluations for agencies such  as the Department of Education and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).  An inter-agency group delivers the goal of increasing transparency and accountability by creating effective evaluation networks and drawing on best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Evaluation|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/performance/chapter8-2012.pdf|publisher=White House|accessdate=20 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704212246/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/performance/chapter8-2012.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A six-step framework for conducting evaluation of public health programs, published by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), initially increased the emphasis on program evaluation of government programs in the US.  The framework is as follows:
# Engage [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]
# Describe the program.
# Focus the evaluation.
# Gather credible evidence.
# Justify conclusions.
# Ensure use and share lessons learned.

==Types of Evaluation==

There are many different approaches to program evaluation. Each serves a different purpose. 
* [[Utilization-Focused Evaluation]]
* CIPP Model of evaluation
* Formative Evaluation
* Summative Evaluation
* Developmental Evaluation
* Principles-Focused Evaluation
* Theory-Driven Evaluation
* Realist-Driven Evaluation

==CIPP Model of evaluation==
{{Main|CIPP evaluation model}}

===History of the CIPP model===
The CIPP model of evaluation was developed by Daniel Stufflebeam and colleagues in the 1960s.CIPP is an acronym for Context, Input, Process and Product. CIPP is an evaluation model that requires the evaluation of '''context''', '''input''', '''process''' and '''product''' in judging a programme’s value. CIPP is a decision-focused approach to evaluation and emphasises the systematic provision of information for [[programme management]] and operation.&lt;ref name = "Robinson"&gt;Robinson, B. (2002).The CIPP has its formation from the earlier stages where there were no paragraphs or any acronyms for any product or stanzas. The CIPP approach to evaluation.Collit project: A background note from Bernadette&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIPP model===
The CIPP framework was developed as a means of linking evaluation with programme [[decision-making]]. It aims to provide an analytic and rational basis for programme decision-making, based on a cycle of planning, structuring, implementing and reviewing and revising decisions, each examined through a different aspect of evaluation –context, input, process and product evaluation.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;

The CIPP model is an attempt to make evaluation directly relevant to the needs of decision-makers during the phases and activities of a programme.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt; Stufflebeam’s context, [[Factor of production|input]], process, and [[Product breakdown structure|product]] (CIPP) evaluation model is recommended as a framework to systematically guide the conception, design, [[implementation]], and assessment of service-learning projects, and provide feedback and judgment of the project’s effectiveness for continuous improvement.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;

===Four aspects of CIPP evaluation===
These aspects are context, inputs, process, and product. These four aspects of CIPP evaluation assist a decision-maker to answer four basic questions:
*What should we do?
This involves collecting and analysing needs assessment data to determine goals, priorities and objectives. For example, a context evaluation of a literacy program might involve an analysis of the existing objectives of the literacy programme, literacy achievement test scores, staff concerns (general and particular), literacy policies and plans and community concerns, perceptions or attitudes and needs.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;
*How should we do it?
This involves the steps and resources needed to meet the new goals and objectives and might include identifying successful external programs and materials as well as gathering information.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;
*Are we doing it as planned?
This provides decision-makers with information about how well the programme is being implemented. By continuously monitoring the program, decision-makers learn such things as how well it is following the plans and guidelines, conflicts arising, staff support and morale, strengths and weaknesses of materials, delivery and budgeting problems.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;
*Did the programme work?
By measuring the actual outcomes and comparing them to the anticipated outcomes, decision-makers are better able to decide if the program should be continued, modified, or dropped altogether. This is the essence of product evaluation.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;

===Using CIPP in the different stages of the evaluation===
The CIPP model is unique as an [[evaluation]] guide as it allows evaluators to evaluate the program at different stages, namely: before the program commences by helping evaluators to assess the need and at the end of the program to assess whether or not the program had an effect.

CIPP model allows you to ask formative questions at the beginning of the program, then later gives you a guide of how to evaluate the programs impact by allowing you to ask summative questions on all aspects of the program.
*'''Context''': What needs to be done? Vs. Were important needs addressed?
*'''Input''': How should it be done? Vs. Was a defensible design employed?
*'''Process''': Is it being done? Vs. Was the design well executed?
*'''Product''': Is it succeeding? Vs. Did the effort succeed?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Robots and Avatars''' was a programme of events and [[education]]al activities which explores how young people will work and play with new representational forms of virtual and physical life in 10–15 years time. It was produced by [[Body data space|body&gt;data&gt;space]] with support from [[National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts|NESTA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanza.co.uk/emergentcity/?p=363&lt;/ref&gt; between 2009 and 2012.

The project examined multi-identity evolutions of younger generations within the context of a world in which virtual and physical spaces are increasingly blended. A participatory web and events led programme with connected educational activities took taking place across 2010 and onwards, in the UK and internationally. The project included contributions by a diverse range of experts, professionals and specialists working with robots and avatars including Professor [[Noel Sharkey]] (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and Professor of Public Engagement University of Sheffield), Pear Urishima (Apple), [[Ghislaine Boddington]] from body&gt;data&gt;space and [[Derek Richards]] from [[Hi8us]] South.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apengine.org/2010/06/robots-and-avatars/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robots and Avatars Forum==
Robots and Avatars launched in November 2009 with a Forum at NESTA, attended by an international group of 80 experts, professionals and young people in [[London]].

==Robots and Avatars Lunch Debates==
Between June and November 2010 the programme hosted a series of Lunch Debates exploring Artificial Intelligence, Behaviour and Ethics, Health and Wellbeing and the Future Workplace with expert provocateurs and top level thinkers.

==The Overall Programme==
The programme continued throughout 2010-2011 with educational events, an [[exhibition]], a [[website]], [[vodcast]]s with key experts and a book/[[DVD]].

==Themes==
Robots and Avatars explored a wide range of themes including:
* [[Robot]]s

This is an excerpt from the original script of ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]].]] --&gt;
'''Screenwriting''', also called '''scriptwriting''', is the art and craft of writing [[Screenplay|scripts]] for [[mass media]] such as [[feature film]]s, [[television production]]s or [[video game]]s. It is often a [[freelance]] profession.

[[Screenwriter]]s are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of [[Script development|development]] with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
[[Spec script]]s are feature film or [[Television program|television show]] scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/267279_screenplay07.html The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]].

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the [[Writers Guild of America]] forbids members to write "on speculation". The distinction is that a "spec script" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.

=== Commissioned screenplay ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a [[Green-light|green light]].

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a [[Movie studio|studio]], production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from "open" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, ''How to Sell your Screenplay'', pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a "page one rewrite". {{anchor|polish}}When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a "polish" or "punch-up".

Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, [[screen credit]] may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=171-screen credits policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from wga.org&lt;/ref&gt; These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as [[script doctor]]s. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, [[Steve Zaillian]], [[William Goldman]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Mort Nathan]], Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Wright Wetman. "Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)". ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers&amp;mdash;often given other titles, such as [[story editor]] or [[Television producer|producer]]&amp;mdash;work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm TV Writer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034952/http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} from tvwriter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Television show creators write the [[television pilot]] and [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as [[showrunner]], [[head writer]] or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for [[soap opera]]s and [[telenovela]]s is different from that used by [[prime time]] shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by [[Jane Espenson]], screenwriting is a "sort of three-tiered system":&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000588.php 08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes], from "Jane in Progress" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson&lt;/ref&gt;
:a few top writers craft the overall [[story arc]]s. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;[http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2630 05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality &amp; Game Show Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.

===Video game writing===
{{Main|Video game writing}}
With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of [[video game design]]. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on writing a screenplay==
{{Literature}}
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a [[novel]] or [[short story]], a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pg4. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying "Screenplays are structure".

===Three-act structure===
{{Main article|Three-act structure}}
The three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.

In ''[[Writing Drama]]'', French writer and director [[Yves Lavandier]] shows a slightly different approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#1STRUC Excerpt on the three-act structure] from Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama''&lt;/ref&gt; As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero's Journey ===
The hero's journey, also referred to as the [[monomyth]], is an idea formulated by noted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).

Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include
#'''a call to adventure''', which the hero has to accept or decline,
#'''a road of trials''', on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#'''achieving the goal (or "boon")''', which often results in important self-knowledge,
#'''a return to the ordinary world''', which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#'''application of the boon,''' in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter [[Christopher Vogler]] refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' (1993).

=== Syd Field's Paradigm ===
In his book ''Screenplay'' [[Syd Field]] posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in [[Aristotle]]'s Three Acts divided into four pieces.

Field also introduced the idea of [[plot point|Plot Points]] into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:

'''Opening Image''': The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.

'''Exposition''': Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.

'''[[Inciting Incident]]''': Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.

'''Plot Point 1''': The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', this is when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s family is killed by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] in opposing [[Darth Vader]].

'''Pinch 1''': A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in ''Star Wars'', Pinch 1 is the [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtroopers]] attacking the [[Millennium Falcon]] in [[Mos Eisley]], reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the [[Death Star]] [[R2-D2]] is carrying and Luke and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).

'''Midpoint''': An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.

'''Pinch 2''': Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In ''Star Wars'', Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the [[Princess Leia|Princess]] in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack [[motif (literature)|motif]] unifies both Pinches.

'''Plot Point 2''': A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in ''[[Toy Story]]'', it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.

'''Showdown''': About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.

'''Resolution''': The issues of the story are resolved.

'''Tag''': An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as [[denouement]]. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.

===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as "[[Sequence (filmmaking)|eight-sequence structure]]", is a system developed by [[Frank Daniel]], while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, Paul Joseph: "Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach", pg3. Continuum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as "mini-movies", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. [[Pathetic fallacy]] is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Dialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Bollywood]] and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the [[screenplay writer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Plot===
{{See also|Act structure}}
While the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.

==Screenwriting education==
A number of American universities offer specialized [[Master of Fine Arts]] and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC]], [[DePaul University]], [[AFI Conservatory|American Film Institute]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts|NYU]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],  [[Boston University]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including [[London College of Communication]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[Edinburgh University]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College (University of London)]]. 

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the [[TheFilmSchool]], The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / [http://writers.uclaextension.edu/ Extension Programs in Screenwriting].

[[New York Film Academy]] offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, [[The Black List]], [[John August]] and Craig Mazin's [[Scriptnotes]] podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Julie|title=Just Effing Entertain Me|date=2013|publisher=Julie Gray|isbn=9781304404831|quote=A comprehensive guide to screenwriting with proven methods to help you test your ideas BEFORE you write your script, outlining tricks that make every page fascinating, chapters on character development, dialogue, theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from [[George Melies]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The "studio system" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the "blueprint" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the "spec script" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenwritingfacts.weebly.com/history.html|title=History|website=The Art of Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* ''[[Crashing Hollywood (1931 film)|Crashing Hollywood]]'' (1931)&amp;mdash;A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn’t like how accurate the movie is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030022/ | title=Internet Movie Database listing of Crashing Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;Actor [[William Holden]] portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading [[silent film]] star, played by [[Gloria Swanson]].
*''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;[[Humphrey Bogart]] is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* ''[[Paris, When it Sizzles]]'' (1964)&amp;mdash;[[William Holden]] plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires [[Audrey Hepburn]] to help.
* ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991)&amp;mdash;[[John Turturro]] plays a naïve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on [[William Faulkner]]).
* ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this comedy written by [[Barry Primus]] and [[J. F. Lawton]], [[Robert Wuhl]] is a screenwriter/director who's got integrity, vision, and a serious script - but no career. [[Martin Landau]] is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to [[Robert De Niro]], [[Danny Aiello]] and [[Eli Wallach]] - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star.
* ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this satire of the Hollywood system, [[Tim Robbins]] plays a movie producer who thinks he’s being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], completed works may be [[copyright]]ed, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal [[Register of Copyrights|registration]] or notice. However, the [[Library of Congress]] will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411- 17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411)]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup [[attorney fees]] or collect [[statutory damages for copyright infringement]], unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412- 17 USC 412]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the [http://www.creatorsvault.com/ Creators Vault].

There is a line of [[precedent]] in several states (including California and New York) that allows for "idea submission" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright.&lt;ref name="Biederman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law and Business of the Entertainment Industries|date=November 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275992057|pages=313–327|author=Donald E. Biederman|edition=5th|author2=Edward P. Pierson |author3=Martin E. Silfen |author4=Janna Glasser |author5=Charles J. Biederman |author6=Kenneth J. Abdo |author7=Scott D. Sanders }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortunate [[side effect]] of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read ''all'' unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers;&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad [[legal release]]s before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered.&lt;ref name="Biederman" /&gt; In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks.&lt;ref name="Rosman" /&gt; One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, [[Universal Studios]] resisted construction of a bike path along the [[Los Angeles River]] next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hymon|first1=Steve|author2=Andrew Blankstein|title=Studio poses obstacle to riverfront bike path|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bikelane27feb27-story.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked with a diverse communities including trade unions, government and public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary Stewart Russell|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=417803|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in physical science from Pembroke College, Cambridge, UK, Stewart made a sharp turn towards social science and took a PhD in the Technology Policy Unit of [[Aston University]], UK. He dedicated the rest of his career to exploring the challenges of environmental sustainability across a range of technological fields.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Stewart Russell obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/oct/23/stewart-russell-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2012|location=London|first=Robin|last=Williams|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he accepted a position as lecturer in Science, Technology and Society at the [[University of Wollongong]], in New South Wales, Australia. He returned to the United Kingdom in 2006 to join the University of Edinburgh as deputy director of the Research Centre for Social Sciences. In this role he helped build the interdisciplinary research programmes of the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]], and bring together the Research Centre for Social Studies and Science Studies Unit as the Science, Technology and Innovation Studies subject group. Collaborating with the [[National Museum of Scotland]] Stewart developed the innovative "Understanding Technology" public lecture series.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stewart Russell - About - Science, Technology and Innovation Studies |url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225145734/http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures are continued and held to commemorate his contribution.

'''Suzette Haden Elgin''' (born '''Patricia Anne Wilkins'''; November 18, 1936 – January 27, 2015) was an American science fiction author and linguist. She founded the [[Science Fiction Poetry Association]] and is considered an important figure in the field of science fiction [[constructed language]]s. Her best-known non-fiction includes the ''[[Verbal self defense|Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense]]'' series.

==Life==
Patricia Anne Wilkins was born in 1936 in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clute|first=John|authorlink=John Clute|title=Suzette Haden Elgin|work=Science Fiction Encyclopedia|publisher=Gollancz|year=2012|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/elgin_suzette_haden|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD) in the 1960s, and began writing science fiction in order to pay tuition. She gained a PhD in [[linguistics]], and was the first UCSD student ever to write two dissertations (on English and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]).

She created the [[engineered language]] [[Láadan]] for her ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]'' science fiction series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amy|last=Chozick|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/arts/television/in-game-of-thrones-a-language-to-make-the-world-feel-real.html|title=Athhilezar? Watch Your Fantasy World Language|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grammar and dictionary was published in 1985. She supported [[feminist science fiction]], saying "women need to realize that SF is the only [[genre]] of literature in which it's possible for a writer to explore the question of what this world would be like if you could get rid of [Y], where [Y] is filled in with any of the multitude of real world facts that constrain and oppress women. Women need to treasure and support science fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Kim|title=An Interview with Suzette Haden Elgin|work=Women Writers.net|year=1999|url=http://www.womenwriters.net/editorials/hadenelgin.htm|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, she published works of shorter fiction. Overlying themes in her work include [[feminism]], [[linguistics]] and the impact of proper [[language]], and peaceful coexistence with nature. Many of her works also draw from her [[Ozark]] background and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozarque.livejournal.com/profile Elgin blog], ozarque.livejournal.com; accessed April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/index.html#Biography Elgin biography], sfwa.org; accessed April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
Elgin became a professor at [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU). She retired in 1980 and lived in [[Arkansas]] with her second husband, George Elgin. She died at age 78 in 2015 from undisclosed causes. She was survived by her husband. Her son Michael pre-deceased her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/news/2015/01/28/obituary-suzette-haden-elgin notice of death opg Suzette Haden Elgin], SFSite News; accessed April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/02/suzette-haden-elgin-1936-2015 Locus Online obituary], locusmag.com; accessed April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozarque.livejournal.com/631306.html], 7th draft of her poem about Michael's death.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tall ship]] '''''Atyla''''' ({{IPA-es|aˈtila|lang}}) is a two-masted wooden [[schooner]] handmade in [[Spain]] between 1980 and 1984. She was designed by Esteban Vicente Jimenez to look like the Spanish vessels from the [[1800s (decade)|1800s]] and built with the intention of circumnavigating the earth following the Magellan–Elcano route and then become a training ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Una goleta vasca dará la vuelta al mundo en otoño |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59791640/Permanente/el_periodico_19_mayo_1984.jpg |accessdate=17 September 2014 |work=El Periódico |date=19 May 1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210524/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59791640/Permanente/el_periodico_19_mayo_1984.jpg |archivedate=3 March 2016 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although she never did that trip and instead sailed around Spain for almost her 30 years, in 2013 Esteban’s nephew became her new skipper and decided to finally dedicate her to international [[sail training]] for both professionals and amateurs.

==Construction==
''Atyla'' was a personal project of Esteban Vicente Jimenez ([[Soria]], 1953), sport teacher and professional canoeist. With his friends, they wanted to build a ship to sail around the world.
Esteban started designing the ship from scratch in 1979 to make it look like the traditional Spanish vessels from the [[1800s (decade)|1800s]]. The project was then tuned and corrected upon approval by the naval architect PhD. Franciso Lasa Etxarri.
Most of the wooden part were carved in Vinuesa (Soria), using ash, elondo, oak and mainly, Scots pine, a tree that is highly abundant in the area. The masts were made using two 175-year-old pines donated by the town of Vinuesa itself in support of the project. 
The rest of the boat, including the hull, was made using an African hardwood known as [[iroko]], which is amongst the most durable ones in the world. Some years later, in 1986, the original pine masts were replaced with iroko as well.  
The assembly took place in Lekeitio, in the abandoned building of the shipyard Eguiguren &amp; Atxurra by the banks of the river Lea. Its owner Jose María Solano allowed Esteban to use it. They had to restore the boat yard a little bit, and the building still stands today as part of Lekeitio’s history.
In 1983 the idea of circumnavigating the world following the Magellan–Elcano route was already rounded, and a company from the region ([[Petronor]]) was going to sponsor the circumnavigation.
In 1984 esteban Esteban received the Honourable Mention of the [[Rolex Awards for Enterprise]] for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=List of Rolex Awards of Entrepirse Leureates and Honourable Mention winners|date=1984|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|isbn=0-906053-951|pages=223–224|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59791640/Permanente/Rolex_Awards-Project_description-Vicente_Esteban.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launching==
[[File:Launching of the Schooner ATYLA in 1984.jpg|300px|framed|left|Launching in Lekeitio (Spain) in 1984]]
''Atyla'' was launched on May 15, 1984. On the following weeks the engine and the electronic systems where installed in the shipyard Celaya. This shipyard of the city of Erandio (between [[Bilbao]] and Getxo) was famous because of the huge sailing boats that were built there until its closing at the end of the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astilleros Celaya, una institución en la construcción de buques escuela desaparecida en los 80|url=http://www.masmar.com/noticias/html/27277.html|accessdate=16 September 2014|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040530170330/http://www.masmar.com/noticias/html/27277.html|archivedate=30 May 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Everything was ready when suddenly Petronor cancelled the sponsorship and Esteban was forced to find a new plan to fund the schooner's journey.

==Time spent in Spain==
In 1986 the plan was to go to the Caribbean to do short sailing trips with tourists. Nevertheless, the plans were once again cut short en route to the [[Canary Islands]] to cross the Atlantic Ocean, when a storm forced the crew to shelter in Tangier and the boat got completely looted.
Without provisions or equipment, the crew sailed the ''Atyla'' to the island of Lanzarote to recover from the robbery and there they started doing day-trips of sailing for families. ''Atyla'' remained nineteen years in the Port of Playa Blanca (south of Lanzarote).
In 2005 the government of Cantabria (North Spain) hired ''Atyla'' to represent the region. She was brought to Santander, where for six years she was used for different kinds of activities related to tourism and environmental projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laventaviejadelangre.com/turismo-cantabria-goleta-cantabria-infinita.html Article from the website laventaviejadelangre.com about the sailing trips in Cantabria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820000906/http://www.laventaviejadelangre.com/turismo-cantabria-goleta-cantabria-infinita.html |date=2014-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the contract with the government of Cantabria was finished Esteban's nephew Rodrigo de la Serna (born in Madrid in 1989) decided to take charge of ''Atyla'' in order to keep her sailing.
Esteban and Rodrigo worked together carving a new bowsprit and both the gaff and boom of the foresail and then they moved the vessel to the Mediterranean Sea where she was chartered for a big sailing event by the brand [[Cutty Sark (whisky)|Cutty Sark]] commencing in Ibiza.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrmQeCLR6a4|Official video by the brand about the sailing event]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Sail Training==
In September 2013 ''Atyla'' took part on the Mediterranean Tall Ships Regatta 2013, organized by [[Sail Training International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/news/article/read_double-celebrations-for-atyla_item_100953.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Rodrigo saw in these kind of events his opportunity to finally dedicate the vessel to sail training and to develop an educational project around it.
In 2014 ''Atyla's'' route was called "Full sail around Europe" and it consisted on navigating 20,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres (equivalent to half the Earth's circumference) without leaving the European continent.&lt;ref&gt;http://classicyachtinfo.com/forums/topic/full-sail-around-europe/&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship is currently in the process of registering under the British Flag

'''William James''' (January 11, 1842&amp;nbsp;– August 26, 1910) was an American philosopher and [[psychology|psychologist]], and the first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) ''Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach''. [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/TLBrink_PSYCH01.pdf "Unit One: The Definition and History of Psychology"]. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; James was a leading thinker of the late nineteenth century, one of the most influential U.S. philosophers, and has been labelled the "Father of American psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=65 |title=William James: Writings 1878–1899 |publisher= [[The Library of America]]|date=1992-06-01 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=66 |title=William James: Writings 1902–1910 |publisher= The Library of America |date=1987-02-01 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dr. Megan E.

Along with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], James established the philosophical school known as [[pragmatism]], and is also cited as one of the founders of [[functional psychology]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' analysis, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–52 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey published in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' in 1991 ranked James's reputation in second place,&lt;ref&gt;J.

''American Psychologist'', 1991, Volume 46, pp. 789–792.&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Wilhelm Wundt]], who is widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-wundt/ "Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Butler-Bowdon: [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfjB9Blnk8kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA20,M1 ''50 Psychology Classics'']. Nicholas Brealey Publishing 2007. {{ISBN|1857884736}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; James also developed the philosophical perspective known as [[radical empiricism]]. James' work has influenced intellectuals such as [[Émile Durkheim]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Richard Rorty]],&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/ |title=William James |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Center for the Study of Language and Information]] (CSLI), [[Stanford University]] |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has even [[Moral Equivalent of War speech|influenced]] Presidents, such as [[Jimmy Carter]].

Born into a wealthy family, James was the son of the [[Swedenborgian]] theologian [[Henry James Sr.]] and the brother of both the prominent novelist [[Henry James]] and the diarist [[Alice James]]. James trained as a [[physician]] and taught anatomy at Harvard, but never practiced medicine. Instead he pursued his interests in psychology and then philosophy. James wrote widely on many topics, including [[epistemology]], [[education]], [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]], [[religion]], and [[mysticism]]. Among his most influential books are ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', which was a groundbreaking text in the field of psychology; ''[[Essays in Radical Empiricism]]'', an important text in philosophy; and ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', which investigated different forms of [[religious experience]], including theories on [[mind-cure]].&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience|date=2009|publisher=The Library of America|isbn=1598530623|pages=74–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Houghton MS Am 1092 (1185) - William James in Brazil, 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|right|William James in Brazil, 1865]]

William James was born at the [[Astor House]] in New York City in 1842. He was the son of [[Henry James Sr.]], a noted and independently wealthy [[Swedenborgian]] [[theology|theologian]] well acquainted with the literary and intellectual elites of his day. The intellectual brilliance of the James family milieu and the remarkable epistolary talents of several of its members have made them a subject of continuing interest to historians, biographers, and critics.

William James received an eclectic trans-Atlantic education, developing fluency in both German and French.  Education in the James household encouraged cosmopolitanism. The family made two trips to Europe while William James was still a child, setting a pattern that resulted in thirteen more European journeys during his life. His early artistic bent led to an apprenticeship in the studio of [[William Morris Hunt]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], but he switched in 1861 to scientific studies at the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] of [[Harvard University]].

In his early adulthood, James suffered from a variety of physical ailments, including those of the eyes, back, stomach, and skin. He was also [[tone deafness|tone deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Oliver|title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain, Revised and Expanded Edition|year=2008|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-3353-5|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subject to a variety of psychological symptoms which were diagnosed at the time as [[neurasthenia]], and which included periods of [[depression (mood)|depression]] during which he contemplated [[suicide]] for months on end. Two younger brothers, Garth Wilkinson (Wilky) and Robertson (Bob), fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The other three siblings (William, Henry, and Alice James) all suffered from periods of invalidism.

He took up medical studies at [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1864 (according to his brother [[Henry James]], the author). He took a break in the spring of 1865 to join naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]] on a scientific expedition up the [[Amazon River]], but aborted his trip after eight months, as he suffered bouts of severe [[seasickness]] and mild [[smallpox]]. His studies were interrupted once again due to illness in April 1867. He traveled to Germany in search of a cure and remained there until November 1868; at that time he was 26 years old. During this period, he began to publish; reviews of his works appeared in literary periodicals such as the ''North American Review''.

James finally earned his [[Medical Doctor|M.D.]] degree in June 1869 but he never practiced medicine. What he called his "soul-sickness" would only be resolved in 1872, after an extended period of philosophical searching. He married Alice Gibbens in 1878. In 1882 he joined the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Antony Lysy, "William James, Theosophist", ''The Quest'' Volume 88, number 6, November&amp;ndash;December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

James's time in Germany proved intellectually fertile, helping him find that his true interests lay not in medicine but in philosophy and psychology. Later, in 1902 he would write: "I originally studied medicine in order to be a physiologist, but I drifted into psychology and philosophy from a sort of fatality. I never had any philosophic instruction, the first lecture on psychology I ever heard being the first I ever gave".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Barton Perry]], ''The Thought and Character of William James'', vol. 1, (1935), 1996 edition: {{ISBN|0-8265-1279-8}}, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875–1876, James, [[Henry Pickering Bowditch]] (1840–1911), [[Charles Pickering Putnam]] (1844–1914), and [[James Jackson Putnam]] (1846–1918) founded the [[Putnam Camp]] at [[St. Huberts, New York|St. Huberts]], [[Essex County, New York]].&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/| title = Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)| publisher = [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2016-02-01}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=26543&amp;q=false| title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Putnam Camp| accessdate = 2016-02-01| author = Rachel D.

==Career==
James interacted with a wide array of writers and scholars throughout his life, including his godfather [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], his godson [[William James Sidis]], as well as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[John Dewey]], [[Macedonio Fernández]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Horatio Alger, Jr.]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[Sigmund Freud]].

James spent almost all of his academic career at Harvard. He was appointed instructor in [[physiology]] for the spring 1873 term, instructor in [[anatomy]] and physiology in 1873, assistant professor of psychology in 1876, assistant professor of philosophy in 1881, full professor in 1885, endowed chair in psychology in 1889, return to philosophy in 1897, and emeritus professor of philosophy in 1907.

James studied medicine, physiology, and biology, and began to teach in those subjects, but was drawn to the scientific study of the human mind at a time when psychology was constituting itself as a [[science]].  James's acquaintance with the work of figures like [[Hermann Helmholtz]] in Germany and [[Pierre Janet]] in France facilitated his introduction of courses in scientific psychology at [[Harvard University]].  He taught his first [[experimental psychology]] course at Harvard in the 1875–1876 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Duane P. Schultz|author2=Sydney Ellen Schultz|title=A History of Modern Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge36EniJWwQC&amp;pg=PA185 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |date=22 March 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-09799-0|pages=185–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Harvard years, James joined in philosophical discussions and debates with [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and [[Chauncey Wright]] that evolved into a lively group informally known as [[The Metaphysical Club]] in 1872. [[Louis Menand]] (2001) suggested that this Club provided a foundation for American intellectual thought for decades to come.  James joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]] in 1898, in opposition to the United States annexation of the Philippines.

James's daughter Peggy took the picture. On hearing the camera click, James cried out: "Royce, you're being photographed! Look out! I say ''Damn the Absolute!"'']]

Among James's students at Harvard University were luminaries such as [[Boris Sidis]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[George Santayana]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Ralph Barton Perry]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Alain Locke]], [[C. I. Lewis]], and [[Mary Whiton Calkins]]. Antiquarian bookseller [[Gabriel Wells]] tutored under him at Harvard in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twainquotes.com/UniformEds/UniformEdsCh29.html|title=A History of and Guide to Uniform Editions of Mark Twain's Works|first=Barbara|last=Schmidt|publisher=twainquotes.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his January, 1907 retirement from Harvard, James continued to write and lecture, publishing ''Pragmatism'', ''A Pluralistic Universe'', and ''The Meaning of Truth''.  James was increasingly afflicted with cardiac pain during his last years.  It worsened in 1909 while he worked on a philosophy text (unfinished but posthumously published as ''Some Problems in Philosophy'').  He sailed to Europe in the spring of 1910 to take experimental treatments which proved unsuccessful, and returned home on August 18. His heart failed on August 26, 1910 at his home in [[Chocorua, New Hampshire]]. He was buried in the family plot in Cambridge Cemetery, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

He was one of the strongest proponents of the school of [[Functional psychology|functionalism]] in psychology and of [[pragmatism]] in philosophy.  He was a founder of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]], as well as a champion of alternative approaches to healing.  He challenged his professional colleagues not to let a narrow mindset prevent an honest appraisal of those beliefs.

In an empirical study by Haggbloom et al. using six criteria such as citations and recognition, James was found to be the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haggbloom, S.J. |year=2002 |title=The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=139–15 |url=http://htpprints.yorku.ca/archive/00000064/ |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429015400/http://htpprints.yorku.ca/archive/00000064/ |archivedate=2006-04-29 |df= }}. Haggbloom ''et al.'' combined 3 quantitative variables: citations in professional journals, citations in textbooks, and nominations in a survey given to members of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], with 3 qualitative variables (converted to quantitative scores): [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) membership, American Psychological Association (APA) President and/or recipient of the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and surname used as an eponym. Then the list was rank ordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Alice Runnels James, 1921.jpg|thumb|Alice Runnels James (Mrs. William James [wife of son, the painter Billy James (1882-1961)]), [[John Singer Sargent]], 1921]]

William James was the son of Henry James (Senior) of Albany, and Mary Robertson Walsh. He had four siblings: [[Henry James|Henry]] (the novelist), Garth Wilkinson, Robertson, and Alice. William became engaged to Alice Howe Gibbens on May 10, 1878; they were married on July 10. They had 5 children: Henry (born May 18, 1878), William (born June 17, 1882), Herman (born 1884, died in infancy), Margaret (born March, 1887) and Alexander (the artist) (born December 22, 1890).

==Writings==
William James wrote voluminously throughout his life. A non-exhaustive bibliography of his writings, compiled by [[John J. McDermott (philosopher)|John McDermott]], is 47 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;John J. McDermott, ''The Writings of William James: A Comprehensive Edition'', University of Chicago Press, 1977 revised edition, {{ISBN|0-226-39188-4}}, pp. 812–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

He gained widespread recognition with his monumental ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890), totaling twelve hundred pages in two volumes, which took twelve years to complete.  ''Psychology: The Briefer Course'', was an 1892 abridgement designed as a less rigorous introduction to the field. These works criticized both the English [[associationist]] school and the [[Hegel]]ianism of his day as competing dogmatisms of little explanatory value, and sought to re-conceive the human mind as inherently purposive and selective.

[[President Jimmy Carter's Moral Equivalent of War Speech]], on April 17, 1977, equating the United States' [[1970s energy crisis]], oil crisis and the changes and sacrifices Carter's proposed plans would require with the "moral equivalent of war," may have borrowed its title, much of its theme and the memorable phrase from James' classic essay "The Moral Equivalent of War" derived from his last speech, delivered at Stanford University in 1906, and published in 1910, in which "James considered one of the classic problems of politics: how to sustain political unity and civic virtue in the absence of war or a credible threat...." and which "...sounds a rallying cry for service in the interests of the individual and the nation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow_intro.htm William James' The Moral Equivalent of War Introduction by John Roland].

==Epistemology==
[[File:William James - John La Farge.jpg|thumb|Portrait of William James by [[John La Farge]], circa 1859]]
James defined [[truth|true]] beliefs as those that prove useful to the believer. His [[pragmatic theory of truth]] was a synthesis of [[correspondence theory of truth]] and [[coherence theory of truth]], with an added dimension. Truth is verifiable to the extent that thoughts and statements correspond with actual things, as well as the extent to which they "hang together," or cohere, as pieces of a puzzle might fit together; these are in turn verified by the observed results of the application of an idea to actual practice.&lt;ref name=PragTruth&gt;James, William, Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking Lect. 6, "Pragmatism's Conception of Truth," (1907)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.6, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", pp. 427–28 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

"The most ancient parts of truth . . . also once were plastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also mediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts played no role whatsoever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they are true, for 'to be true' means only to perform this marriage-function," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;William James. "Pragmatism's Conception of Truth". Lecture 6 in ''Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking''. New York: Longman Green and Co (1907): [http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/James/James_1907/James_1907_06.html p. 83.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715031834/http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/James/James_1907/James_1907_06.html |date=2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Anything short of God is not rational, anything more than God is not possible" he wrote.

He writes, "First, it is essential that God be conceived as the deepest power in the universe, and second, he must be conceived under the form of a mental personality."

He also writes, "A God who can relish such superfluities of horror is no God for human beings to appeal to. ...In other words the "Absolute" with his one purpose, is not the man-like God of common people."

James held a world view in line with [[pragmatism]], declaring that the value of any truth was utterly dependent upon its use to the person who held it. Additional tenets of James's pragmatism include the view that the world is a mosaic of diverse experiences that can only be properly interpreted and understood through an application of "radical empiricism." Radical empiricism, not related to the everyday scientific [[empiricism]], asserts that the world and experience can never be halted for an entirely objective analysis; the mind of the observer and the act of observation affect any empirical approach to truth. The mind, its experiences, and nature are inseparable. James's emphasis on diversity as the default human condition—over and against duality, especially Hegelian dialectical duality—has maintained a strong influence in American culture. James's description of the mind-world connection, which he described in terms of a "[[stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]", had a direct and significant impact on [[avant-garde]] and [[modernist]] literature and art, notably in the case of James Joyce.

In ''What Pragmatism Means'', James writes that the central point of his own doctrine of truth is, in brief, that "Truths emerge from facts, but they dip forward into facts again and add to them; which facts again create or reveal new truth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The 'facts' themselves meanwhile are not true. They simply are. Truth is the function of the beliefs that start and terminate among them." [[Richard Rorty]] made the contested claim that James did not mean to give a theory of truth with this statement and that we should not regard it as such. However, other pragmatism scholars such as [[Susan Haack]] and Howard Mounce do not share Rorty's [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. O. Mounce|title=The two pragmatisms: from Peirce to Rorty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5dQRUqk3QUC|accessdate=28 August 2011|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Meaning of Truth'', James seems to speak of truth in relativistic terms: "The critic's [sc., the critic of pragmatism] trouble...seems to come from his taking the word 'true' irrelatively, whereas the pragmatist always means 'true for him who experiences the workings.' "&lt;ref&gt;''The Meaning of Truth'', Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., New York, 1909, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; However, James responded to critics accusing him of [[relativism]], [[scepticism]] or [[agnosticism]], and of believing only in relative truths. To the contrary, he supported an [[epistemological realism]] position.&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Defense of a Pragmatic Notion of Truth'', written to counter criticisms of his ''Pragmatism's Conception of Truth'' 1907 lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pragmatism and "cash value" ===
Pragmatism is an approach to philosophy which holds that the truth or meaning of a statement is to be measured by its practical consequences.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Wayne|title=William James (1842–1910)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/james-o/#SH3a|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=IEP|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the introduction to William James's ''Pragmatism'' by Bruce Kuklick (1981, p. xiv):

&lt;blockquote&gt;James went on to apply the pragmatic method to the epistemological problem of truth. He would seek the meaning of 'true' by examining how the idea functioned in our lives. A belief was true, he said, if it worked for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world. James was anxious to uncover what true beliefs amounted to in human life, what their "cash value" was, and what consequences they led to. A belief was not a mental entity which somehow mysteriously corresponded to an external reality if the belief were true. Beliefs were ways of acting with reference to a precarious environment, and to say they were true was to say they were efficacious in this environment. In this sense the pragmatic theory of truth applied Darwinian ideas in philosophy; it made survival the test of intellectual as well as [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James’s book of lectures on Pragmatism is arguably the most influential book of American Philosophy. The lectures inside depict his position on the subject. In his sixth lecture he starts of by defining truth as "agreement with reality". With this, James warns that there will be disagreements between pragmatics and intellectualists over the concepts of "agreement" and "reality", the last reasoning before thoughts settle and become autonomous for us. However, he contrasts this by supporting a more practical interpretation that: a true idea or belief is one that we can blend with our thinking so that it can be justified through experiences.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If theological ideas prove to have a value for concrete life, they will be true, for pragmatism, in the sense of being good for so much. For how much more they are true, will depend entirely on their relations to the other truths that also have to be 
Acknowledged. (''Pragmatism'' (1907), p. 29)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James has three dimensions with which reality must agree with truths: (1) matters of fact, (2) relations of ideas, and (3) the entire set of other truths to which we are committed” (James).  Saying that these truths agree with the realities pragmatically means that they lead us to useful outcomes.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

According to William James’ pragmatic approach to belief, knowledge is commonly viewed as a justified and true belief. James will accept a view if it’s conception of truth is analyzed and justified through interpretation, pragmatically. As a matter of fact, James’ whole philosophy is of productive beliefs.  

Belief in anything involves conceiving of how it is real, but disbelief is the result when we dismiss something because it contradicts another thing we think of as real. In his "Sentiment of Rationality", saying that crucial beliefs are not known is to doubt their truth, even if it seems possible. James names four "postulates of rationality" as valuable but unknowable: God, immorality, freedom, and moral duty.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

In contrast, the weak side to pragmatism is that the best justification for a claim is whether it works. However, a claim that does not have outcomes cannot be justified, or unjustified, because it will not make a difference. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no difference that doesn’t make a difference. (''Pragmatism'' (1907), p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Will to believe doctrine ===
{{Main article|The Will to Believe}}

In William James's lecture of 1896 titled "The Will to Believe", James defends the right to violate the principle of [[evidentialism]] in order to justify hypothesis venturing. This idea foresaw 20th century objections to evidentialism and sought to ground justified belief in an unwavering principle that would prove more beneficial.  Through his philosophy of [[pragmatism]] William James justifies religious beliefs by using the results of his hypothetical venturing as evidence to support the hypothesis' truth.  Therefore, this doctrine allows one to assume belief in a god and prove its existence by what the belief brings to one's life. 

This was criticized by advocates of [[skeptic]]ism rationality, like [[Bertrand Russell]] in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]] and [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]] with [[The Will to Doubt]]. Both argued that one must always adhere to [[fallibilism]], recognizing of all human knowledge that "None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error", and that the only means of progressing ever-closer to the truth is to never assume certainty, but always examine all sides and try to reach a conclusion objectively.

==Free will==

In his search for truth and assorted principles of psychology, William James developed his two-stage model of free will.  In his model, he tries to explain how it is people come to the making of a decision and what factors are involved in it.  He firstly defines our basic ability to choose as free will.  Then he specifies our two factors as chance and choice.  “James’s two-stage model effectively separates chance (the in-deterministic free element) from choice (an arguably determinate decision that follows causally from one’s character, values, and especially feelings and desires at the moment of decision).”&lt;ref&gt;Bob Doyle. Free Will: the Scandal in Philosophy. I-Phi Press, 2011. The Information Philosopher.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chance is, as previously said, the “free element” it is that part of the model we have no control over, the wild stallion if you will.  James says that in the sequence of the model, chance comes before choice.  In the moment of decision we are given the chance to make a decision and then the choice is what we do (or do not do) regarding the decision.  

When it comes to choice, James says we make a choice based on different experiences.  It comes from our own past experiences, the observations of others or as James himself says “A supply of ideas of the various movements that are […] left in the memory by experiences of their involuntary performance is thus the first prerequisite of the voluntary life.”&lt;ref&gt;Bob Doyle. Free Will: the Scandal in Philosophy. I-Phi Press, 2011. The Information Philosopher.&lt;/ref&gt; What James describes is that once you’ve made a decision in the past, the experience is stockpiled into your memory where it can be referenced the next time a decision must be made.  And will be drawn from as a positive solution.  But in his development of the design, James also struggled with being able to prove that free will is actually free or predetermined.  

People can make judgements of regret, moral approval and moral disapproval, and if those are absent, then that means our will is predetermined.  An example of this is “James says the problem is a very “personal” one and that he cannot personally conceive of the universe as a place where murder must happen.”&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A. Shouler. The Everything Guide to Understanding Philosophy: the Basic Concepts of 	the Greatest Thinkers of All Time - Made Easy! Adams Media, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if there were no regrets or judgements then all the bad stuff would not be considered bad, only as predetermined because there are no options of “good” and “bad”.  “The free will option is pragmatically truer because it better accommodates the judgements of regret and morality.”&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A. Shouler. The Everything Guide to Understanding Philosophy: the Basic Concepts of 	the Greatest Thinkers of All Time - Made Easy! Adams Media, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall James uses this line of reasoning to prove that our will is indeed free: because of our morality codes, and the conceivable alternate universes where a decision has been regarded different than what we chose.   

In ''The Will to Believe'', James simply asserted that his will was free. As his first act of freedom, he said, he chose to believe his will was free. He was encouraged to do this by reading [[Charles Renouvier]], whose work convinced James to convert from [[monism]] to [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]. In his diary entry of April 30, 1870, James wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life. I finished the first part of Renouvier's second Essais and see no reason why his definition of free will—"the sustaining of a thought because I choose to when I might have other thoughts"—need be the definition of an illusion. At any rate, I will assume for the present—until next year—that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Barton Perry, ''The Thought and Character of William James'', vol. 1, p. 323; Letters of William James, vol. I, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1884 James set the terms for all future discussions of [[determinism]] and [[compatibilism]] in the [[free will]] debates with his lecture to [[Harvard Divinity School]] students published as "The Dilemma of Determinism." In this talk he defined the common terms "hard determinism" and "soft determinism" (now more commonly called "[[compatibilism]]").

&lt;blockquote&gt;Old-fashioned determinism was what we may call hard determinism. It did not shrink from such words as fatality, bondage of the will, necessitation, and the like. Nowadays, we have a soft determinism which abhors harsh words, and, repudiating fatality, necessity, and even predetermination, says that its real name is freedom; for freedom is only necessity understood, and bondage to the highest is identical with true freedom.&lt;ref name=will149&gt;The Dilemma of Determinism, republished in The Will to Believe, Dover, 1956, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James called compatibilism a "quagmire of evasion",&lt;ref name=will149/&gt; just as the ideas of [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]]—that free will was simply freedom from external coercion—were called a "wretched subterfuge" by [[Immanuel Kant]].

James described [[chance (philosophy)|chance]] as neither hard nor soft determinism, but "[[indeterminism]]". He said

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stronghold of the determinist argument is the antipathy to the idea of chance...This notion of alternative possibility, this admission that any one of several things may come to pass is, after all, only a roundabout name for chance.&lt;ref&gt;The Dilemma of Determinism, republished in The Will to Believe, Dover, 1956, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James asked the students to consider his choice for walking home from Lowell Lecture Hall after his talk.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is meant by saying that my choice of which way to walk home after the lecture is ambiguous and matter of chance?...It means that both Divinity Avenue and Oxford Street are called but only one, and that one either one, shall be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;The Dilemma of Determinism, republished in ''The Will to Believe'', Dover, 1956, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this simple example, James laid out a two-stage decision process with chance in a present time of random alternatives, leading to a choice of one possibility that transforms an ambiguous future into a simple unalterable past. James' two-stage model separates chance (undetermined alternative possibilities) from [[choice]] (the free action of the individual, on which randomness has no effect). Subsequent thinkers using this model include [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Arthur Holly Compton]], and [[Karl Popper]].

==Philosophy of religion==
[[File:WJ-Variety-Religious-Exp.png|thumb|right|Excerpt]]

James did important work in [[philosophy of religion]].  In his [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] he provided a wide-ranging account of ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (1902) and interpreted them according to his pragmatic leanings. Some of the important claims he makes in this regard:

* Religious genius (experience) should be the primary topic in the study of religion, rather than religious institutions—since institutions are merely the social descendant of genius.
* The intense, even pathological varieties of experience (religious or otherwise) should be sought by psychologists, because they represent the closest thing to a microscope of the mind—that is, they show us in drastically enlarged form the normal processes of things.
* In order to usefully interpret the realm of common, shared experience and history, we must each make certain "[[overbelief|over-beliefs]]" in things which, while they cannot be proven on the basis of experience, help us to live fuller and better lives.
* Religious Mysticism is only one half of mysticism, the other half is composed of the insane and both of these are co-located in the 'great subliminal or transmarginal region'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience|last=James|first=William|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York|pages=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James investigated [[mysticism|mystic]]al experiences throughout his life, leading him to experiment with [[chloral hydrate]] (1870), [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl nitrite]] (1875), [[nitrous oxide]] (1882), and [[peyote]] (1896).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} James claimed that it was only when he was under the influence of nitrous oxide that he was able to understand [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;William James, [http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/jnitrous.html "Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide"]&lt;/ref&gt;  He concluded that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others, they are certainly ideas to be considered, but can hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such. ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |year = 2007 |ISBN = 0415939267 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mysticism ==
William James provided a description of the mystical experience, in his famous collection of lectures published in 1902 as ''The Varieties of Religious Experience.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodysoulandspirit.net/mystical_experiences/learn/experts_define/james.shtm|title=Mysticism Defined by William James|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bodysoulandspirit.net|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are as follows
* Passivity - a feeling of being grasped and held by a superior power not under your own control.
* Ineffability - no adequate way to use human language to describe the experience. 
* Noetic - universal truths revealed that are unable to be acquired anywhere else. 
* Transient - the mystical experience is only a temporary experience.

==Instincts==
{{see also|Instinct}}
Like Sigmund Freud, James was influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name = "Buss 1"/&gt; At the core of James' theory of psychology, as defined in ''The Principles of Psychology'' (1890), was a system of "instincts".&lt;ref name = "Buss 1"/&gt; James wrote that humans had many instincts, even more than other animals.&lt;ref name = "Buss 1"/&gt; These instincts, he said, could be overridden by experience and by each other, as many of the instincts were actually in conflict with each other.&lt;ref name = "Buss 1"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary psychology: the new science of the mind. Pearson. 2008. Chapter 1, pp. 2–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, however, psychology turned away from evolutionary theory and embraced radical behaviorism.&lt;ref name = "Buss 1"/&gt;

==Theory of emotion==
James is one of the two namesakes of the [[James–Lange theory]] of [[emotion]], which he formulated independently of [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]] in the 1880s.  The theory holds that emotion is the mind's perception of physiological conditions that result from some stimulus.  In James's oft-cited example, it is not that we see a bear, fear it, and run;  we see a bear and run; consequently, we fear the bear.  Our mind's [[perception]] of the higher adrenaline level, heartbeat, etc. is the emotion.

This way of thinking about emotion has great consequences for the philosophy of [[aesthetics]] as well as to the philosophy and practice of [[education]].&lt;ref name="reconstructing" /&gt;  Here is a passage from his great work, ''The Principles of Psychology'', that spells out those consequences:

{{quotation|[W]e must immediately insist that aesthetic emotion, pure and simple, the pleasure given us by certain lines and masses, and combinations of colors and sounds, is an absolutely sensational experience, an optical or auricular feeling that is primary, and not due to the repercussion backwards of other sensations elsewhere consecutively aroused. To this simple primary and immediate [[pleasure]] in certain pure sensations and harmonious combinations of them, there may, it is true, be added secondary pleasures; and in the practical enjoyment of works of art by the masses of mankind these secondary pleasures play a great part. The more classic one's taste is, however, the less relatively important are the secondary pleasures felt to be, in comparison with those of the primary sensation as it comes in. [[Classicism]] and [[romanticism]] have their battles over this point.}}

The theory of emotion was also independently developed in Italy by the Anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi,.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Sergi]], (1858) ''L'origine dei fenomeni psichici e loro significazione biologica'', {{ISBN|1271529408}}, Milano, Fratelli Dumolard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Sergi]], (1894)
''Principi di Psicologie: Dolore e Piacere; Storia Naturale dei Sentimenti", {{ISBN|1147667462}}, Milano, Fratelli Dumolard&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to give due credit, such a theory should be called the James-Lange-Sergi theory of emotion. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== William James' bear ===
From [[Joseph LeDoux]]'s description of William James's ''Emotion''&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph E. LeDoux]], (1996) ''The Emotional Brain: the Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life'', {{ISBN|0-684-83659-9}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why do we run away if we notice that we are in danger? Because we are afraid of what will happen if we don't. This obvious answer to a seemingly trivial question has been the central concern of a century-old debate about the nature of our emotions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It all began in 1884 when William James published an article titled "What Is an Emotion?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/emotion.htm "What is an Emotion?"] ''Mind'', vol. 9, 1884, pp. 188–205&lt;/ref&gt; The article appeared in a philosophy journal called ''Mind'', as there were no psychology journals yet. It was important, not because it definitively answered the question it raised, but because of the way in which James phrased his response. He conceived of an emotion in terms of a sequence of events that starts with the occurrence of an arousing stimulus (the [[sympathetic nervous system]] or the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]); and ends with a passionate feeling, a conscious emotional experience. A major goal of emotion research is still to elucidate this stimulus-to-feeling sequence—to figure out what processes come between the stimulus and the feeling.

James set out to answer his question by asking another: do we run from a bear because we are afraid or are we afraid because we run? He proposed that the obvious answer, that we run because we are afraid, was '''wrong''', and instead argued that we are afraid because we run:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our natural way of thinking about... emotions is that the mental perception of some fact excites the mental affection called emotion, and that this latter state of mind gives rise to the bodily expression. My theory, on the contrary, is that the bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they occur IS the emotion (called 'feeling' by [[Damasio#Looking for Spinoza|Damasio]]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The essence of James's proposal was simple. It was premised on the fact that emotions are often accompanied by bodily responses (racing heart, tight stomach, sweaty palms, tense muscles, and so on; [[sympathetic nervous system]]) and that we can sense what is going on inside our body much the same as we can sense what is going on in the outside world. According to James, emotions feel different from other states of mind because they have these bodily responses that give rise to internal sensations, and different emotions feel different from one another because they are accompanied by different bodily responses and sensations. For example, when we see James's bear, we run away. During this act of escape, the body goes through a physiological upheaval: blood pressure rises, heart rate increases, pupils dilate, palms sweat, muscles contract in certain ways (evolutionary, innate defense mechanisms). Other kinds of emotional situations will result in different bodily upheavals. In each case, the physiological responses return to the brain in the form of bodily sensations, and the unique pattern of sensory feedback gives each emotion its unique quality. Fear feels different from anger or love because it has a different physiological signature (the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] for love). The mental aspect of emotion, the feeling, is a slave to its physiology, not vice versa: we do not tremble because we are afraid or cry because we feel sad; we are afraid because we tremble and are sad because we cry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philosophy of history==
One of the long-standing schisms in the [[philosophy of history]] concerns the role of individuals in social change.

One faction sees individuals (as seen in [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[The French Revolution, A History]]'') as the motive power of history, and the broader society as the page on which they write their acts. The other sees society as moving according to [[holistic]] principles or laws, and sees individuals as its more-or-less willing pawns.  In 1880, James waded into this controversy with "Great Men, Great Thoughts, and the Environment," an essay published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. He took Carlyle's side, but without Carlyle's one-sided emphasis on the political/military sphere, upon heroes as the founders or overthrowers of states and empires.

A philosopher, according to James, must accept [[genius]]es as a given entity the same way as a biologist accepts as an entity Darwin's ‘spontaneous variations.’ The role of an individual will depend on the degree of its conformity with the social environment, epoch, moment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L. E. 2010. The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution &amp; History, Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136). [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/ p. 103]&lt;/ref&gt;

James introduces a notion of receptivities of the moment. The [[society|societies]]' mutations from generation to [[generation]] are determined (directly or indirectly) mainly by the acts or examples of individuals whose genius was so adapted to the receptivities of the moment or whose accidental position of authority was so critical that they became ferments, initiators of movements, setters of precedent or fashion, centers of corruption, or destroyers of other persons, whose gifts, had they had free play, would have led society in another direction.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 2005 [1880]. ''Great Men and Their Environment''. Kila, MT: Kessinger Publishing. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

== View on spiritualism and associationism ==
[[File:Houghton MS Am 1092 (1185) - William James.jpg|thumb|William James in a séance with a spiritualist medium]]
James studied closely the schools of thought known as [[associationism]] and [[spiritualism]]. The view of an associationist is that each experience that one has leads to another, creating a chain of events. The association does not tie together two ideas, but rather physical objects.&lt;ref name="James, 1892"&gt;James, (1892)&lt;/ref&gt;  This association occurs on an atomic level. Small physical changes occur in the brain which eventually form complex ideas or associations. Thoughts are formed as these complex ideas work together and lead to new experiences. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]] both were precursors to this school of thought, proposing such ideas as "physical vibrations in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves are the basis of all sensations, all ideas, and all motions..."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  James disagreed with associationism in that he believed it to be too simple. He referred to associationism as "psychology without a soul"&lt;ref name=j1890&gt;James, (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; because there is nothing from within creating ideas; they just arise by associating objects with one another.

On the other hand, a spiritualist believes that mental events are attributed to the soul. Whereas in associationism, ideas and behaviors are separate, in spiritualism, they are connected. Spiritualism encompasses the term [[innatism]], which suggests that ideas cause behavior. Ideas of past behavior influence the way a person will act in the future; these ideas are all tied together by the soul. Therefore, an inner soul causes one to have a thought, which leads them to perform a behavior, and memory of past behaviors determine how one will act in the future.&lt;ref name=j1890/&gt;

James had a strong opinion about these schools of thought. He was, by nature, a [[Pragmatism#A list of pragmatists|pragmatist]] and thus took the view that one should use whatever parts of theories make the most sense and can be proven.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2006"&gt;Richardson (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he recommended breaking apart spiritualism and associationism and using the parts of them that make the most sense. James believed that each person has a soul, which exists in a spiritual universe, and leads a person to perform the behaviors they do in the physical world.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2006"/&gt; James was influenced by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who first introduced him to this idea. James stated that, although it does appear that humans use associations to move from one event to the next, this cannot be done without this soul tying everything together. For, after an association has been made, it is the person who decides which part of it to focus on, and therefore determines in which direction following associations will lead.&lt;ref name="James, 1892"/&gt; Associationism is too simple in that it does not account for decision-making of future behaviors, and memory of what worked well and what did not. Spiritualism, however, does not demonstrate actual physical representations for how associations occur. James combined the views of spiritualism and associationism to create his own way of thinking.

James was a founding member and vice president of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Taylor. (2009). ''The Mystery of Personality: A History of Psychodynamic Theories''. Springer. p. 30. {{ISBN|978-0387981031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lending of his name made [[Leonora Piper]] a famous medium. In 1885, the year after the death of his young son, James had his first sitting with Piper at the suggestion of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Blum]]. (2007). ''Ghost Hunters: William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life''. Penguin Group. p. 98. {{ISBN|978-0-14-303895-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James was soon convinced that Piper knew things she could only have discovered by supernatural means. He expressed his belief in Piper by saying, "If you wish to upset the law that all crows are black, it is enough if you prove that one crow is white. My white crow is Mrs. Piper."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Murphy]], Robert O. Ballou. (1960). ''William James on Psychical Research''. Viking Press. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; However, James did not believe that Piper was in contact with spirits. After evaluating sixty-nine reports of Piper's mediumship he considered the hypothesis of [[telepathy]] as well as Piper obtaining information about her sitters by natural means such as her memory recalling information. According to James the "spirit-control" hypothesis of her mediumship was incoherent, irrelevant and in cases demonstrably false.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bordogna. (2008). ''William James at the Boundaries: Philosophy, Science, and the Geography of Knowledge''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 127. {{ISBN|978-0226066523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James held séances with Piper and was impressed by some of the details he was given; however, according to [[Massimo Polidoro]] a maid in the household of James was friendly with a maid in Piper's house and this may have been a source of information that Piper used for private details about James.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2001). ''Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. p. 36. {{ISBN|978-1573928960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliographers [[Frederick Burkhardt]] and [[Fredson Bowers]] who compiled the works of James wrote "It is thus possible that Mrs. Piper's knowledge of the James family was acquired from the gossip of servants and that the whole mystery rests on the failure of the people upstairs to realize that servants [downstairs] also have ears."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Burkhardt]] and [[Fredson Bowers]]. (1986). ''Essays in Psychical Research''. Harvard University Press. p. 397 in William James. [http://www.nlx.com/collections/66 ''The Works of William James'']. Edited by Frederick H. Burkhardt, Fredson Bowers, and Ignas K. Skrupskelis. 19 vols. Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard University Press. 1975–1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

James was convinced that the "future will corroborate" the existence of [[telepathy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnfjc6;view=1up;seq=441 About the Shadow World]. ''Everybody's Magazine''. v. 20 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists such as [[James McKeen Cattell]] and [[Edward B. Titchener]] took issue with James's support for [[Parapsychology|psychical research]] and considered his statements unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, Peter. (2013). ''Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 184-188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, Gregory A; Wertheimer, Michael; White, Charlotte. (2013). ''Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology''. Psychology Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|0-8058-0620-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell in a letter to James wrote that the "Society for Psychical Research is doing much to injure psychology".&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, C. James. (2015). ''A History of Modern Psychology''. Wiley. p. 154. {{ISBN|978-1-118-83375-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== James' theory of the self&lt;!--'James' theory of the self' and 'James's theory of the self' redirect here--&gt; ==
'''James' theory of the self'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; divided a person's mental picture of self into two categories: the "Me" and the "I". The "Me" can be thought of as a separate object or individual a person refers to when describing their personal experiences; while the "I" is the self that knows who they are and what they have done in their life.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; Both concepts are depicted in the statement; "''I'' know it was ''me'' who ate the cookie."  He called the "Me" part of self the "empirical me" and the "I" part "the pure Ego".&lt;ref name="cooper1992" /&gt; For James, the "I" part of self was the thinking self, which could not be further divided. He linked this part of the self to the soul of a person, or what is now thought of as the mind.&lt;ref name=psychclassics /&gt; Educational theorists have been inspired in various ways by James's theory of self, and have developed various applications of these theories to curricular and pedagogical theory and practice.&lt;ref name="reconstructing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ergas|first1=Oren|title=Reconstructing 'education' through mindful attention|date=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-137-58781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James further divided the "Me" part of self into: the material self, the social self, and the spiritual self, as below.&lt;ref name=cooper1992&gt;Cooper, W. E. (1992). "William James's theory of the self". ''Monist'' 75(4), 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material self ===
The material self consists of things that belong to a person or entities that a person belongs to. Thus, things like the body, family, clothes, money, and such make up the material self. For James, the core of the material self was the body.&lt;ref name=psychclassics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.asu.edu/James/Principles/prin10.htm |title=Classics in the History of Psychology (archived copy) |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206021129/http://psychclassics.asu.edu/James/Principles/prin10.htm |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second to the body, James felt a person's clothes were important to the material self. He believed a person's clothes were one way they expressed who they felt they were; or clothes were a way to show status, thus contributing to forming and maintaining one's self-image.&lt;ref name=psychclassics /&gt; Money and family are critical parts of the material self. James felt that if one lost a family member, a part of who they are was lost also. Money figured in one's material self in a similar way. If once a person had significant money then lost it, who they were as a person changed as well.&lt;ref name=psychclassics /&gt;

=== Social self ===
Our social selves are who we are in a given social situation. For James, people change how they act depending on the social situation that they are in. James believed that people had as many social selves as they did social situations they participated in.&lt;ref name=psychclassics /&gt; For example, a person may act in a different way at work when compared to how that same person may act when they are out with a group of friends. James also believed that in a given social group, an individual's social self may be divided even further.&lt;ref name=psychclassics /&gt; An example of this would be, in the social context of an individual's work environment, the difference in behavior when that individual is interacting with their boss versus their behavior when interacting with a co-worker.

=== Spiritual self ===
For James, the spiritual self was who we are at our core. The spiritual self is more concrete or permanent than the other two selves. The spiritual self is our subjective and most intimate self. Aspects of an individual's spiritual self include things like their personality, core values, and conscience that do not typically change throughout their lifetime. The spiritual self involves introspection, or looking inward to deeper spiritual, moral, or intellectual questions without the influence of objective thoughts.&lt;ref name=psychclassics /&gt; For James, achieving a high level of understanding of who we are at our core, or understanding our spiritual selves is more rewarding than satisfying the needs of the social and material selves.

=== Pure ego ===
The pure ego is what James refers to as the "I" self. For James, the pure ego is what provides the thread of continuity between our past, present, and future selves. The pure ego's perception of consistent individual identity arises from a continual stream of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to William James|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/hunt.html|website=www.uky.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; James believed that the pure ego was similar to what we think of as the soul, or the mind. The pure ego was not a substance and therefore could not be examined by science.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

The '''École Hassania des Travaux Publics''' ("Hassania School of Public Works"), or '''EHTP''', is one of Morocco's oldest engineering schools, a member of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles]], and remains to this day the most prestigious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Grande Ecole]] in engineering. It is located in [[Casablanca]] few miles from the [[Casablanca Technopark]].

It was established in 1971 by the Public Ministry of Public Works to provide the [[Moroccan Kingdom]] with engineers of high potential in the sectors of [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[regional planning]].

In 1993, the status of EHTP was set up as publicly owned engineering establishment under the supervision of the Moroccan Ministry Of Equipment and Transport.

The school offers an initial training of Specialized master's degree in "Gestion et exploitation des systèmes de transport" (Management and Exploitation of Transportation Systems). Created in 2004 in partnership with the [[École des Ponts ParisTech]], the [[École nationale des travaux publics de l'État]] and the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], It was accredited by the Ministry of Education in 2008.

In terms of scientific research, the EHTP has a number of laboratories and research centers endowed with all the necessary equipment for scientific and technical studies.

== Academics ==
With traditional core competences in [[civil engineering]] and [[regional planning]] EHTP offers high-level programmes in an extensive range of fields, from [[Computer Science]] - [[Software engineering]], [[Electrical engineering]] to [[Meteorology]] engineering and [[Geographical Information Systems]] engineering.

In addition to its technical education, the EHTP founded in 2001 a cultural modulus entitled "Personal Initiation Project" (PIP). It offers an occasion for young students to carry out a cultural and associative project in the course of their studies.

Besides Academic training, the Hassania School of Public Works is the leader in terms of in-service training. The school offers a multidisciplinary MBA training in International Management in partnership with [[ENPC]] in France.

Three major types of programmes are on offer :

* Engineering programmes: leading to a 5-year postgraduate engineering degree (accessible, after competitive examinations, by both undergraduate-graduate curriculum and the 2-year master course) or to masters of science
* Professional programmes for postgraduates: Mastères spécialisés (M.S.), [[MBA]] (Master of Business Administration).

== Engineering fields ==
* [[Civil engineering]]
* [[Computer science]], [[Software engineering]]
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Meteorology]]
* [[Geographical Information Systems]]

== Master ==

Specialized master's degree MAGEST : « Master Gestion et exploitation des systèmes de transport » (Master in Management and Exploitation of Transportation Systems) was created in 2004 under the [[TEMPUS - MEDA]] programme.
The master's degree was developed in partnership with 3 other schools : the [[École des Ponts ParisTech]], the [[École nationale des travaux publics de l'État]] in [[France]] and the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]] in [[Spain]]. It's an initiation training of 3 semesters (1 year and a half) after 4 years of obtaining the [[Baccalauréat]], with a goal of providing necessary tools and training in the management of the transportation system in Morocco, a sector that shows dynamic development in the country.

Since 2008, the training was accredited by the Ministry of Education in Morocco.
