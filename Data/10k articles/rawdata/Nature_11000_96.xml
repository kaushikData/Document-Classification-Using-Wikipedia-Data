An airshed is a part of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that behaves in a coherent way with respect to the dispersion of [[Air pollutants|emissions]]. It typically forms an analytical or management unit. Also: a geographic boundary for air-quality standards.

Alternatively - an airshed is a geographical area where local [[topography]] and [[meteorology]] limit the dispersion of pollutants away from the area.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Alan H. Weisman''' (born March 24, 1947) is an American author, professor, and journalist.

== Education and career ==
Weisman was born on March 24, 1947, in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. Up until 8th grade he loved science but his science teacher hated him, and this English teacher loved him. So he changed to become a journalist. He holds a bachelor's degree in literature and a master's degree in journalism from [[Northwestern University]]. From 2004 to 2013 he was Laureate Professor in Journalism and Latin American Studies at the [[University of Arizona]], where he led an annual field program in international field journalism. He has also taught writing and journalism at [[Prescott College]] and [[Williams College]] and has been a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in [[Colombia]].

== Work ==
He has written several books and won numerous international awards for his work in journalism and literature.  Recent works include the critically acclaimed ''[[The World Without Us]]'', which describes a post-human scenario of the planet and   ''Countdown: Our Last, Best Hope for a Future on Earth?'', which has been short listed for a [[Los Angeles Times]] science and technology book prize. 
Among his other works are ''Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World'' (1998), winner of the Social Inventions Award from the Global Ideas Bank, ''An Echo In My Blood'' (1999), ''La Frontera: The United States Border With Mexico'', and ''We, Immortals'' (1979). His reports from around the world have appeared in ''[[Harper's]]'', ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' magazine, the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Orion (magazine)|Orion]]'', ''[[Audubon Magazine|Audubon]]'', ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'', ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]'', ''[[Resurgence (magazine)|Resurgence]]'', and several anthologies, including ''The Best American Science Writing 2006''.

Weisman is also a producer of radio documentaries for Homelands Productions, creating reports for [[National Public Radio]] and [[American Public Media]].

== Awards and media attention ==
Among his awards and citations are the Four Corners Award for Best Nonfiction Book, The Wenjin Prize from the National Library of China, a Los Angeles Press Club Award for Best Feature Story, a Best of the West Award in Journalism, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Citation, the Unity Media Award, the Brazilian government's Premio Nacional de Jornalismo Radiofonico, and major grants from [[The Ford Foundation]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[MacArthur Foundation]]. His book ''The World Without Us'' was a finalist for the National Book Critics' Circle Award, the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize, the Orion Prize, and the Rachel Carson Environment Book Award. ''Countdown'' won the 2013 Paris Book Festival Prize for nonfiction, the 2014 Los Angeles Times Book Prize, the 2014 Nautilus Gold Book Award, the Population Institute’s 2014 Global Media Award for best book, and was a finalist for the Orion Prize and the Books for a Better Life Award.

Weisman appeared as a guest on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on August 21, 2007, and on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' on March 14, 2014.

'''Alfred Thomas Agate''' (February 14, 1812 in [[Sparta, New York]] – January 5, 1846 in Washington, D.C.) was a noted American artist, painter and [[miniaturist]].

Agate lived in New York from 1831 to 1838.  He studied with his brother, [[Frederick Styles Agate]], a portrait and historical painter.  He later went on to study with [[Thomas Seir Cummings]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  By the late 1830s, Agate was exhibiting his work at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York, and established himself as a skilled painter in oils. He was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an honorary  member in 1840.

Agate drew landscapes, portraits, and scientific illustrations. For much of his landscapes,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Agate used a [[camera lucida]], a device which projected the scene onto a piece of paper for purposes of tracing.

==Expedition==
[[File:Peruvian Andes2.jpg|left|thumb|"Andes near Alparmarca, Peru: Sketched from an Elevation of 16,000 Feet".  Illustration by Alfred Agate from the South American portion of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]], digitally restored.]]
[[Image:Nukufetauman1831.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A man from the [[Nukufetau]] atoll, Ellice Islands (now [[Tuvalu]]) 1841.]]

Agate created many artworks during his service with the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–1842 under [[Charles Wilkes]]. He was especially good at [[botanical]] illustrations, and was the designated portrait and botanical artist of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/ac/exploration/wilkes/wilkes1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Exploring Expedition]] passed through the [[Tuvalu|Ellice Islands]] and visited [[Funafuti]], [[Nukufetau]] and [[Vaitupu]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, David B. – 1968 ''The Wilkes Expedition. The First United States Exploring Expedition'' (1838–42). Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt; During the visit of the expedition to the Ellice Islands (now known as [[Tuvalu]]) Alfred Thomas Agate recorded the dress and tattoo patterns of men of [[Nukufetau]].&lt;ref&gt;The extensive report of the expedition has been digitized by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The visit to the Ellice Islands (now known as [[Tuvalu]]) is described in Chapter 2 in volume 5, pp. 35–75, 'Ellice's and Kingsmill's Group', http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/usexex/&lt;/ref&gt;

Agate created the first known picture of [[Mount Shasta]]. Agate contributed more than half (173 of 342) of the sketches and paintings reproduced as [[lithograph]]s illustrating the five volumes of the expedition's reports. He sketched the [[Oregon Territory]], including a look into a ''[[Chinook people|Chinook]] Lodge'', an ''Indian Burial Place'', an ''Indian Mode of Rocking Cradle'', and a picture of the wreck of one of the expedition's sailing ships at the mouth of the [[Columbia River]].

==After the expedition==
Agate lived in Washington, D.C. from 1842 onward, but his health suffered severely from the expedition and he died four years later of [[tuberculosis|consumption]].

On Agate's death in 1846, the drawings passed to his widow, Elizabeth Hill Kennedy Agate, who later married Dr. William J. C. Du Hamel of Washington, D.C. In 1926, one of her daughters from this marriage, Elizabeth A. Du Hamel, sold them to the [[Naval Historical Foundation]]. The Naval Historical Foundation donated Agate's artwork to the Navy Art Collection in 1998.

==Namesakes==
[[Image:Makin Islander.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of a native of the [[Gilbert Islands]] (then called the Kingsmill Islands), drawn by Alfred Thomas Agate (1841)]]
In 1841, [[Agate Passage]] near [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]] was named by Lt. [[Charles Wilkes]] in honor of Agate.  Agate Island in [[Fiji]] was also named in honor of Agate. Botanist [[Asa Gray]] used Agate's drawings and the expedition's specimens for botanical reports, and named a [[violet (plant)|violet]], ''[[Agatea]] violaris'', after him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''Big Pocono State Park''' is a {{convert|1305.6|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Jackson Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Jackson]] and [[Pocono Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Pocono]] townships in [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania]] in northeastern [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. The park is on [[Camelback Mountain (Big Pocono)|Camelback Mountain]] and is maintained jointly by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] and Camelback Ski Corporation.

From the summit of the mountain, one has a view of vast portions of eastern Pennsylvania as well as parts of [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. A paved drive, {{convert|1.4|mi}} in length, around the summit provides visitors with a view in all directions. Visitors can see the [[Delaware Water Gap]] from this location.

The park, except for the [[Camelback Ski Area]], closes for the winter seven days following the end of [[deer]] season in December and reopens as conditions permit in the spring.

== History ==
[[File:Big Pocono State Park view south from Camelback Mountain.jpg|thumb|View south from Big Pocono State Park at Camelback Mountain]]
The land on which Big Pocono State Park is situated was owned by Henry S. Cattell at the turn of the 20th century. Knowing of the fondness that others in the area shared with him for the view that the summit provided, Cattell constructed a stone cabin there in 1908. For many years the cabin was left unlocked so that anyone who wished to use it as a shelter, could.&lt;ref name="bpsp"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-03-24
| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennsylvania Game Commission purchased the land in 1928, 12 years following the death of Cattell. In 1950, the state leased a portion of the land on the north slope for commercial development. The company was later renamed the Camelback Ski Corporation, and the facility is now a major [[ski resort]].&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

In 1953, the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters (now the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources) acquired {{convert|1306|acre}} of state game lands, which comprised the land that was purchased by the Game Commission, including the ski area lease, and the area immediately around the summit.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

Big Pocono State Park opened to the public in 1954, following the construction of facilities and the scenic drive around the summit. The Cattell Cabin served as a park office and a nature museum for many years.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

Although the museum no longer exists, the stone cabin still stands and is paramount only to the great views one can obtain by going to the different observation points provided by both DCNR and the Camelback Ski Corporation.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

== Recreation ==
Big Pocono State Park offers a hiking trail system that consists of {{convert|7|mi}} of interconnecting trails. The trails are of varying terrain and grade, and park officials caution inexperienced hikers to inquire at the park office before attempting the steep and rocky North Trail.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

In addition to the hiking trails, there is also a horseback riding trail ({{convert|3|mi}}). The trailhead is near the entrance of the park, on the west end.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

Three picnic areas with a total of 50 tables are situated within the park. The picnic area adjacent to Cattell Cabin has tables in an open setting, and the east and south picnic areas are in a wooded setting.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;
[[Image:Camelbackski1.jpg|thumb|Skiing on Camelback Mountain]]
The [[Camelback Ski Area]], located on the north slope, boasts the largest [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]] and snowtubing facility in the [[Pocono Mountains]]. The facility has 33 trails, 13 lifts, two terrain parks, detachable quads, a [[halfpipe]], night skiing and 100% snowmaking. The ski area also operates the Cameltop restaurant, which is located near the summit and is open from [[Memorial Day]] to [[Columbus Day]]. In the summertime, a waterpark named [[Camelbeach]] is operated on the grounds of Camelback, and this can be seen from Big Pocono.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

[[Hunting]] is permitted in designated areas of the park during hunting seasons.&lt;ref name="bpsp"/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Chandrasekhar's ''H''-function}}
In atmospheric [[radiation]], '''Chandrasekhar's ''H''-function''' appears as the solutions of problems involving scattering, introduced by the [[Indian American]] [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan. Radiative transfer. Courier Corporation, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell, John R., M. Pinar Menguc, and Robert Siegel. Thermal radiation heat transfer. CRC press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Modest, Michael F. Radiative heat transfer. Academic press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hottel, Hoyt Clarke, and Adel F. Sarofim. Radiative transfer. McGraw-Hill, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sparrow, Ephraim M., and Robert D. Cess. "Radiation heat transfer." Series in Thermal and Fluids Engineering, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978, Augmented ed. (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandrasekhar's ''H''-function &lt;math&gt;H(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; defined in the interval &lt;math&gt;0\leq\mu\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following nonlinear integral equation

:&lt;math&gt;H(\mu) = 1+\mu H(\mu)\int_0^1 \frac{\Psi(\mu')}{\mu + \mu'}H(\mu') \, d\mu'&lt;/math&gt;

where the characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is an even polynomial in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following condition

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu \leq \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the equality is satisfied in the above condition, it is called ''conservative case'', otherwise ''non-conservative''. [[Albedo]] is given by &lt;math&gt;\omega_o= 2\Psi(\mu) = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;. An alternate form which would be more useful in calculating the ''H'' function numerically by iteration was derived by Chandrasekhar as,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{H(\mu)} = \left[1-2\int_0^1\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu\right]^{1/2} + \int_0^1 \frac{\mu'\Psi(\mu')}{\mu + \mu'}H(\mu') \, d\mu'&lt;/math&gt;.

In conservative case, the above equation reduces to 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{H(\mu)}= \int_0^1 \frac{\mu' \Psi(\mu')}{\mu+\mu'}H(\mu')d\mu'&lt;/math&gt;.

==Approximation==

The ''H'' function can be approximated up to an order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;H(\mu) = \frac{1}{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_n}\frac{\prod_{i=0}^n (\mu+\mu_i)}{\prod_\alpha (1+k_\alpha\mu)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; are the zeros of [[Legendre polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;P_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are the positive, non vanishing roots of the associated characteristic equation

:&lt;math&gt;1 = 2 \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{a_j\Psi(\mu_j)}{1-k^2\mu_j^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are the quadrature weights given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_j = \frac{1}{P_{2n}'(\mu_j)}\int_{-1}^1 \frac{P_{2n}(\mu_j)}{\mu-\mu_j} \, d\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;

==Explicit solution in the complex plane==
In complex variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; the ''H'' equation is 

: &lt;math&gt; H(z) = 1- \int_0^1 \frac z {z+\mu} H(\mu)\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu, \quad \int_0^1 |\Psi(\mu)| \, d\mu \leq \frac{1}{2}, \quad \int_0^\delta |\Psi(\mu)| \, d\mu \rightarrow 0, \ \delta\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

then for &lt;math&gt;\Re (z)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, a unique solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ln H(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{-i\infty}^{+ i\infty} \ln T(w) \frac{z}{w^2-z^2} \, dw&lt;/math&gt;

where the imaginary part of the function &lt;math&gt;T(z)&lt;/math&gt; can vanish iff &lt;math&gt;z^2&lt;/math&gt; is real i.e., &lt;math&gt;z^2 = u+iv = u\ (v=0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have

: &lt;math&gt;T(z) = 1- 2 \int_0^1 \Psi(\mu) \, d\mu - 2 \int_0^1 \frac{\mu^2 \Psi(\mu)}{u-\mu^2} \, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

The above solution is unique and bounded in the interval &lt;math&gt;0\leq z\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for conservative cases. In non-conservative cases, if the equation &lt;math&gt;T(z)=0&lt;/math&gt; admits the roots &lt;math&gt;\pm 1/k&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a further solution given by

:&lt;math&gt;H_1(z) = H(z) \frac{1+kz}{1-kz}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

*&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 H(\mu)\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu = 1-\left[1-2\int_0^1\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu \right]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;. For conservative case, this reduces to &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \Psi(\mu)d\mu=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\left[1-2\int_0^1\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu\right]^{1/2} \int_0^1 H(\mu) \Psi(\mu) \mu^2 \, d\mu + \frac{1}{2} \left[\int_0^1 H(\mu)\Psi(\mu)\mu \, d\mu\right]^2 = \int_0^1 \Psi(\mu)\mu^2 \, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;. For conservative case, this reduces to &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 H(\mu)\Psi(\mu) \mu d\mu = \left[2\int_0^1 \Psi(\mu)\mu^2d\mu\right]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.
*If the characteristic function is &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mu)=a+b\mu^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a, b &lt;/math&gt; are two constants(have to satisfy &lt;math&gt;a+b/3\leq 1/2&lt;/math&gt;) and if &lt;math&gt;\alpha_n = \int_0^1 H(\mu)\mu^n \, d\mu, \ n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; is the nth moment of the ''H'' function, then we have 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (a\alpha_0^2 + b \alpha_1^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b\mu^2) \int_0^1\frac{H(\mu')}{\mu+\mu'}\,d\mu'=\frac{H(\mu)-1}{\mu H(\mu)}-b(\alpha_1-\mu\alpha_0)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Cultural depictions of [[lion]]s''' are known in [[Europe]]an, [[Africa]]n and [[Asia]]n countries. The lion has been an important symbol to humans for tens of thousands of years. The earliest graphic representations feature lions  as organized hunters with great strength, strategies, and skills. In later depictions of human cultural ceremonies, lions were often used symbolically and may have played significant roles in magic, as deities or close association with deities, and served as intermediaries and clan identities.

The earliest historical records in Egypt present an established religious pantheon that included a lioness as one of the most powerful cultural figures, protecting the people and especially, their rulers, as well as being assigned powerful roles in nature. As human groups moved from being isolated clans and tribes to cities, kingdoms, and countries, ancient symbols retained their importance as they assumed new roles and lions have remained as popular symbols through to modern times.

Depictions of lions in other cultures resembled this and all changed into more supportive roles as human figures began to be portrayed as deities. Similar imagery persisted and was retained through cultural changes, sometimes unchanged. Adoptions of lion imagery as symbols into other cultures without direct contact with lions could be very imaginative, often lacking accurate anatomical details or creating unrealistic characteristics. The association of lions with virtues and character traits was adopted in cultures where and when the religious symbolism had ceased.

The earliest known [[cave painting]]s of lions were found in the [[Chauvet Cave]] and in [[Lascaux]] in France's [[Ardèche]] region and represent some of the earliest [[paleolithic]] cave art, dating to between 32,000 and 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chauvet | first=J.-M. |last2=Brunel| first2= D.

Sekhmet is flanked by the goddess [[Wadjet]] as the [[cobra]] and the goddess [[Nekhbet]] as the white [[vulture]], symbols of lower and upper Egypt, respectively. They were depicted on the crown of Egypt; this triad remained fundamental to ancient Egyptian religion throughout the rise and fall of other deities |image2=Mycenae lion gate detail dsc06384.jpg |caption2=The [[Lion Gate]] of [[Mycenae]]; two [[confronted animals]] flank the central column |image3=Lioness Bast cosmetic jar 83d40m tut burial artifact.JPG |caption3=An [[alabaster]] cosmetic jar topped with Bast, from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] ({{circa|1323 BC}}—''Cairo Museum'')}}

The earliest tomb paintings in [[Ancient Egypt]], at [[Nekhen]], c. 3500 [[Before Christ|BC]], classified as [[Naqada]], possibly [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzeh]], culture include images of lions, including an image of a human (or deity) flanked by two lions in an upright posture. Among ancient Egyptians, from prehistoric times through well documented records, the war goddess [[Sekhmet]], a lioness,&lt;ref name="Garai73"/&gt; later depicted as woman with a lioness head, was one of their major deities. She was a sun deity as well as a fierce warrior and protector. Usually she was assigned significant roles in the natural environment. The Egyptians held that this sacred lioness was responsible for the annual flooding of the [[Nile]],&lt;ref name="Garai73"/&gt; the most significant contributing factor to the success of the culture. Sometimes with regional differences in names, a lioness deity was the patron and protector of the people, the king, and the land. As the country united, a blending of those deities was assigned to Sekhmet.{{cn|date=November 2018}}
 
Similar regional lioness deities assumed minor roles in the pantheon or, when so significant in a region, continued local religious observance in their own right, such as [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]]. Offspring of these deities found niches in the expanding pantheon as well.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

During the [[New Kingdom]] the [[Nubia]]n gods [[Maahes]] (god of war and protection and the son of Bast) and [[Dedun]] (god of [[incense]], hence luxury and wealth) were depicted as lions. Maahes was absorbed into the [[Egyptian pantheon]], and had a temple at the city the invading Greeks called [[Leontopolis]], "City of Lions", at the delta in Lower Egypt. His temple was attached to the major temple of his mother, Bast. Dedun was not absorbed into the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]] and remained a Nubian deity.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

[[Bast (mythology)|Bast]], originally depicted as a lioness and the "[[eye of Ra]]" in the delta region,&lt;ref name="Garai73"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-21773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the parallel deity to Sekhmet in the southern region. Her nature gradually changed after the unification of the country and Sekhmet prevailed throughout. At that time Bast changed into the goddess of personal protection with different responsibilities, and often was depicted as a very tame lioness or a cat. She is shown to the left atop an ala'''bast'''er jar that contained precious oils and lotions. The name of the stone probably bears her named because materials sacred to her usually were stored in it..{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[sphinx]] of Ancient Egypt shows the head and shoulders of a human and the body of a lioness. The statues represents Sekhmet, who was the protector of the [[pharaoh]]s. Later pharaohs were depicted as sphinxes, being thought as the offspring of the deity.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Ancient Mesopotamia ===

In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the lion was regarded as a symbol of kingship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cassin |first=Elena |year=1981 |title=Le roi et le lion |journal=Revue de l'histoire des religions |volume=298 |issue=198–4 |pages=355–401 |doi=10.3406/rhr.1981.4828 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1981_num_198_4_4828 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sculptures and reliefs of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] dating to the 6th and 7th centuries BC were rediscovered and [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] in the mid 19th century. Several reliefs feature lions, including the [[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reade, J. |title=Assyrian Sculpture |year=1988 |edition=Second |publisher=British Museum Press |location=London |isbn=9780714120201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A well-known detail of this relief is ''The Dying Lioness'' depicting a half-paralyzed lioness pierced with arrows. Other [[Assyrian palace relief]]s from this era depict dozens of lions being hunted, originally in an [[Assyria]]n royal palace in [[Nineveh]], located in modern day Iraq. The Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]] was represented driving a chariot drawn by seven lions.&lt;ref name="Garai73"/&gt;
Ishtar's [[Sumer]]ian analogue [[Inanna]] was frequently depicted standing on the backs of two lionesses. Such symbolism was appropriated by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for their [[Lion of Babylon tank]], with the technology adapted from a Russian model.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Ancient depictions often described as "panthers" because of no mane, in fact, are lionesses and may be identified easily by the distinctive tip of their tails that artists familiar with their subject, correctly portrayed.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Lions have been widely used in [[sculpture]] to provide a sense of majesty and awe, especially on public buildings. Lions were bold creatures and many ancient cities would have an abundance of lion sculptures to show strength in numbers as well.&lt;ref name="AIOC"&gt;[http://www.thechicagotraveler.com/the-art-institute-of-chicago/ "The Art Institute of Chicago"].

Lion in the Iranian mythology is a symbol of courage and monarchy. He is portrayed standing beside the kings in artifacts and sitting on the graves of knights. Imperial seals were also decorated with carved lions. The lion and sun motif is based largely on astronomical configurations, and the ancient zodiacal sign of the sun in the house of Leo. Lion and sun will become a symbol of royalty in Iranian flag and coins. Goddesses Anahita sometimes have portrayed standing on a lion. Lion is also title of the fourth grade of Mithraism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_28523.html|title = The Archytype of Lion, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date = 2013|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, No. 49|last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lions have been extensively used in ancient Persia as sculptures and on the walls of palaces, in fire temples, tombs, on dishes and jewellery; especially during the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The gates were adorned with lions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/ancient-art/persian.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Evidences are found in [[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Hyrcania]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Classical period===
{{see also|Medici lions|Albani lion}}
Several discoveries of lion bones in Greece, the [[Ukraine]] and the [[Balkans]] have confirmed that lions lived there up to perhaps 1,000 BC, which was previously only a suspicion by some archaeologists. Thus the strong emphasis on lions in the earliest figurative Greek art, especially that of [[Mycenaean Greece]] from around 1600-1400 BC, reflected the world in which Greeks lived, rather than being based on stories from further east, as once thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas, Nancy R. |chapter=The Early Mycenaean Lion up to Date |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zQOQey4OkAsC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181 |title=Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A. Immerwahr |publisher=Hesperia |location=Princeton |pages=189–191 |isbn=0876615337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionesses often flanked the Gorgon, a vestige of the earliest Greek protective deity that often was featured atop temples of later eras. The western [[pediment]] from the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis Temple of Corfu]] is a well preserved example.
The most notable lion of Ancient Greek mythology was the [[Nemean lion]], killed barehanded by [[Heracles]], who subsequently bore the pelt as an invulnerable magic cloak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graves |first=R |authorlink=Robert Graves |title=Greek Myths |year=1955|publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-001026-2|pages=465–469 |chapter=The First Labour:The Nemean Lion}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This lion is also said to be represented by the [[constellation]] of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], and also the [[Leo (astrology)|sign]] of the [[Zodiac]].

Lions are known in many cultures as the king of animals, which can be traced to the [[Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Hagigah 13b&lt;/ref&gt; and to the classical book ''[[Physiologus]]''. In his [[Aesop's Fables|fables]], the famed Greek story teller [[Aesop]] used the lion's symbolism of power and strength in [[The Lion and the Mouse]] and [[Lion's Share]].

{{anchor|Gaetulian lion}}
Since [[classical antiquity]], a ''Gaetulian lion'' in literature is a lion of fierce reputation. Gaetulia, in ancient geography, was the land of the [[Gaetuli]], a warlike tribe of [[ancient Libya]] that appears in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' (19 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Aeneid]] |author=[[Virgil]] |chapter=Book V, Line 352 |year= |quote=..my task to offer consolation to our friend for the downfall he did nothing to deserve." With these words he gave Salius the hide of a huge ''Gaetulian lion'', weighed down with gilded claws and mane.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaetulia lion appears in [[Odes (Horace)|''Odes'' of Horace]] (23 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Odes (Horace)|''Odes'' of Horace]] |chapter=Book I, Ode XXIII |author=[[Horace]] |year= |quote=You shun me, Chloe, like a fawn that is seeking its timorous mother in the pathless mountains, not without a vain dread of the breezes and the thickets: for she trembles both in her heart and knees, whether the arrival of the spring has terrified by its rustling leaves, or the green lizards have stirred the bush. But I do not follow you, like a savage tigress, or a ''Gaetulian lion'', to tear you to pieces. Therefore, quit your mother, now that you are mature for a husband.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (77 AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] |chapter=Book VIII – Chapter: Wonderful feats performed by lions |author=[[Pliny the Elder]] |year= |quote=It was formerly a very difficult matter to catch the lion, and it was mostly done by means of pit-falls. In the reign however, of the Emperor Claudius, accident disclosed a method which appears most disgraceful to the name of such an animal; a Gaetulian shepherd stopped a lion, that was rushing furiously upon him, by merely throwing his cloak over the animal; a circumstance which afterwards afforded an exhibition in the arena of the Circus, when the frantic fury of the animal was paralyzed in a manner almost incredible by a light covering being thrown over its head, so much so, that it was put into chains without the least resistance; we must conclude, therefore, that all its strength lies in its eyes. The circumstance renders what was done by Lysimachus less wonderful, who strangled a lion, with which he had been shut up by command of Alexander.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]]'s ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' ({{circa}} 215),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]  |author=[[Philostratus]] |year=215 |quote=The extremity of Libya, which bears the name ''Abinna'', furnishes a haunt of lions, who hunt their prey along the brows of the [[Rif|mountains which are to be seen rising inland]], and it marches with the ''Gaetuli'' and [[Mauretania Tingitana|Tingae]], both of them wild Libyan tribes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]] |author=[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] |year=1879 |quote="Your father and mother?" cried the priest.

In [[Socrates]]' model of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (as described by [[Plato]]), the bestial, selfish nature of humanity is described metaphorically as a lion, the "leontomorphic principle".&lt;ref name="nhlrepublic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/plato.html | title = Plato, Republic 588A-589B | publisher = "The Gnostic Society Library | accessdate = 2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical references and Judaeo-Christian tradition===
[[File:daniellion.jpg|thumb|right|''Daniel's Answer to the King'' by [[Briton Rivière]], R.A. (1840–1920), 1890 (Manchester City Art Gallery)]]

Several Biblical accounts document the presence of lions, and cultural perception of them in ancient Israel.
The best known Biblical account featuring lions comes from the [[Book of Daniel]] (chapter 6), where Daniel is [[Daniel in the lions' den|thrown into a den of lions]] and miraculously survives.

A lesser known Biblical account features [[Samson]] who kills a lion with his bare hands, later sees bees nesting in its carcass, and poses a riddle based on this unusual incident to test the faithfulness of his fiancée ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 14).
[[File:Venezia, scudo di pasquale cicogna, 1593.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Lion of Venetia, [[Lombardy-Venetia scudo|scudo]] - symbol of the patron saint of the town]]
The prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] said (Amos, 3, 8): "The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?", i.e., when the gift of prophecy comes upon a person, he has no choice but to speak out.

In [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 5:8, the [[Devil]] is compared to a roaring lion "seeking someone to devour."&lt;ref&gt;C.A.W. Guggisberg, ''Simba''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Peter#Chapter 5]] Verse 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian tradition, [[Mark the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel of Mark|second gospel]] is symbolized by a lion - a figure of courage and monarchy. It also represents Jesus' [[Resurrection]] (because lions were believed to sleep with open eyes, a comparison with Christ in the tomb), and Christ as [[monarchy|king]]. Some Christian legends refer to Saint Mark as "Saint Mark the Lionhearted". Legends say that he was fed to the lions and the animals refused to attack or eat him. Instead the lions slept at his feet, while he petted them. When the Romans saw this, they released him, spooked by the sight.

===Late antiquity mysticism===
In [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] traditions, the [[Demiurge]] is depicted as a lion-faced figure ("leontoeides"). The gnostic concept of the Demiurge is usually that of a malevolent, petty creator of the physical realm, a false deity responsible for human misery and the gross matter than traps the spiritual essence of the soul, and thus an "animal-like" nature. As a lion-headed figure, the Demiurge is associated with devouring flames,&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. Ref. vi. 9&lt;/ref&gt; destroying the souls of humans after they die, as well as with arrogance and callousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apocryphon of John]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lion-faced figurine is usually associated with the [[Mithraic mysteries]]. Without any known parallel in classical, Egyptian, or middle-eastern art,&lt;ref&gt;von Gall, Hubertus, "The Lion-headed and the Human-headed God in the Mithraic Mysteries," in Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin ed. Études mithriaques, 1978, pp. 511&lt;/ref&gt; what this figure is meant to represent currently is unknown. Some have interpreted it to be a representation of [[Ahriman]],&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Howard M., "The Meaning and Function of the Leontocephaline in Roman Mithraism" in Numen, Vol. 32, Fasc. 1 (Jul., 1985), pp. 17-45&lt;/ref&gt; of the aforementioned gnostic Demiurge,&lt;ref&gt;David M Gwynn (2010).

In a key scene of ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' ({{lang-fr|Yvain, le Chevalier au Lion}}), a [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]] by [[Chrétien de Troyes]], the hero is depicted as rescuing a lion from a serpent.

Subsequently, the lion proves to be a loyal companion and a symbol of knightly virtue, and helps Yvain complete his altruistic ventures. In the happy end, the lion comes to dwell with Yvain and his wife [[Laudine]] at their castle.

In Middle Eastern culture, both Arab and Persian, the lion is regarded as the symbol of courage, bravery, royalty, and chivalry. The Middle Eastern depiction of lions are derived from earlier [[Mesopotamian]] Babylonian and Persian arts. [[Islamic art]] commonly manifests its aesthetic elements predominantly in [[Islamic calligraphy]], floral, and geometric decorative patterns, since Islamic religious tradition discourages the depictions of humans and living creatures (animals) in its sculpture. Through [[Persian art]]s miniatures and paintings, however, the depictions of humans and animals survives. In [[Muslim Spain]] period, the lion court of [[Alhambra]] palace displays the lion statues as supporters and waterspout of fountain.

"[[Aslan (disambiguation)|Aslan]]" or "Arslan" (Ottoman ارسلان ''arslān'' and اصلان ''aṣlān'')  is the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] word for "lion". It was used as a title by a number of [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] rulers, including [[Alp Arslan]] and [[The Lion of Janina|Ali Pasha]], and is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] name.

===Hindu-Buddhist traditions in South, South East &amp; East Asia===
The lion symbolism and its cultural depictions can be found in [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist art]] of [[India]] and Southeast Asia. The lion symbolism in India was based upon [[Asiatic lion]]s that once spread in Indian subcontinent as far as the Middle East.

[[Narasimha]] ("man-lion"), also spelt ''Narasingh'', ''Narasinga'', is described as an incarnation ([[Avatar]]a) of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]]. It is worshiped as "Lion God" and considered sacred by all [[Hindu]]s in India.

Lions are also found in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism. Lion pillars erected during the reign of Emperor [[Ashoka]] show lions and the [[chakra]] emblem. The lions depicted in the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] inspired artists who designed the [[Emblem of India]].

[[Singh]] is an [[ancient history|ancient]] Indian [[Vedic Sanskrit|vedic]] name meaning "lion", dating more than 2,000 years ago to [[History of India|ancient India]]. It was originally only used by [[Rajput]]s, a [[Hindu]] [[Kshatriya]] or military [[caste]] in India. After the birth of the [[Khalsa]] brotherhood in 1699, the [[Sikh]]s also adopted the name "Singh" due to the wishes of [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs and numerous other Hindu martial groups today, it is also used by more than 20 million [[Sikh]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;McCleod, Head of Sikh Studies, Department of South Asian Studies, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Khushwant Singh]], ''A History of the Sikhs, Volume I''&lt;/ref&gt; The appellation of the name Singh was used by the Rajputs before being adopted by the Sikhs in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, G. year??

The lion also features as the carrier or the vehicle of [[Durga]], the Hindu goddess of war, worshipped in and around the [[Bengal]] region.

The lion is symbolic for the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], [[Sri Lanka]]'s ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan ''Sinhala'', meaning the "lion people" or "people with lion blood", while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the modern national [[flag of Sri Lanka]].

The entrance to [[Sigiriya]], the Lion-Rock of Sri Lanka, was through the Lion Gate, the mouth of a stone lion. The paws of the lion is one of seven [[World Heritage Site]]s in [[Sri Lanka]].

====Southeast Asia====

[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]]]]
Lions were never native animals of Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lion in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the artist who carved the lion sculpture never saw the lion before, and all were based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lion as the noble and powerful beast in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture.

Statue of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardian. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]] andesite stone statues of lions guarding four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephant, lion, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of a winged lion also is found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]], as well as in [[Bali]]nese temples. The Balinese winged lion often served as the guardian statue or as the pedestal of wooden column.

In [[Cambodia]] statues of lions flanking the temple gate or access roads are commonly found in temples of [[Angkor]]. [[Bakong]], a stepped pyramid Hindu temple from earlier period also displays lion statues as guardians of each stage on each of the cardinal points. Khmer lion guardian statues are commonly found in [[Angkor Wat]], [[Bayon]], [[Pre Rup]] and [[Srah Srang]]. Just like ancient Java, the depiction of lion in ancient Khmer art is not in naturalistic style, more like a symbolic mythical animal derived from Indian Hindu-Buddhist art. The royal emblem of Cambodia depicting a pair of guardian animals; ''gajasingha'' (hybrid of elephant and lion) and ''singha'' (lion). In [[Thailand]], a pair of lion statues are often placed in front of temple gate as guardian. The style of Thai lion is similar to those of Cambodian, since Thailand derived many of its aesthetics and arts elements from Cambodian Khmer art.

In [[Myanmar]], the statue of lion called [[Chinthe]] guarding the stupas, pagodas, and Buddhist temples in [[Bagan]], while pair of lions are also featured in the country's [[Coat of arms of Burma|coat-of-arms]].

The [[island country|island nation]] of [[Singapore]] (''Singapura'') derives its name from the [[Malay language|Malay]] words {{lang|ms|singa}} (lion) and {{lang|ms|pura}} (city), which in turn is from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-[[Sanskrit]] சிங்க ''singa'' {{lang|sa|सिंह}}  {{IAST|''siṃha''}} and {{lang|sa|पुर}} புர {{IAST|''pura''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html |title=Singapore |publisher=bartleby.com |accessdate=2006-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629044446/http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html |archivedate=29 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Malay Annals]], this name was given by a fourteenth-century [[Sumatra]]n Malay prince named [[Sang Nila Utama]], who, on alighting the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast on shore that his chief minister identified as a lion (Asiatic lion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Early History | url = http://www.sg/explore/history.htm | publisher = Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore | accessdate = 2006-04-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427030111/http://www.sg/explore/history.htm | archivedate = 27 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies of Singapore indicate that lions have never lived there, and the beast seen by Sang Nila Utama likely was a [[tiger]].

In the modern era, the lion or [[Merlion]] became the icon of [[Singapore]] due to the island's [[Etymology of Singapore|name]]. The Merlion also figures heavily in the official symbols of the [[Philippines]] as it was once an [[Ultramar|overseas possession]] of Spain; it appears on the coat-of-arms of [[Manila]], as well as the emblems of the [[President of the Philippines|President]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]], and [[Philippine Navy|its navy]].

====East Asian traditions====

The common motif of the "majestic and powerful" lion was introduced to China by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] missionaries from India, somewhere in the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021006/spectrum/art.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lions themselves, however, are not native to China, yet appear in the art of China and the Chinese people believe that lions protect humans from evil spirits, hence the [[Chinese New Year]] [[lion dance]] to scare away demons and ghosts. [[Chinese guardian lions]] are frequently used in sculpture in traditional [[Chinese architecture]]. For instance, in the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], two lion statues are seen in almost every door entrance.

Lions feature prominently in the Tibetan culture with a pair of [[Snow Lion]]s seen on the [[flag of Tibet|Tibetan flag]]. The Snow Lions are mythical creatures that are seen as protector entities. The Snow Lion symbolizes fearlessness, unconditional cheerfulness, east, and the Earth element. It is one of the [[Shambhala Buddhism#Shambhala Terma|Four Dignities]]. It ranges over the mountains, and is commonly pictured as being white with a [[turquoise]] mane.

Lions (獅子, ''[[shishi (stone lion)|shishi]]'') feature prominently in many [[kabuki]] plays and other forms of Japanese legend and traditional tales.

The lion holds historical significance for English heraldry and symbolism. The [[Coat of arms of England|three lions]] was a symbol for [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], and later, for England. For many centuries the lion had been a feature of the [[Armorial of Plantagenet]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]], and is still worn by both the [[England national football team]] and [[England and Wales cricket team]].

The [[Royal Banner of Scotland|lion rampant]] continues to be used widely today; the [[Royal Banner of Scotland]] has given rise to its use as the emblem for the [[Scotland national football team]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] of the [[Scottish Premier League]], as well as English [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]; and not only sport but businesses such as the French car company [[Peugeot]], the international [[beer]] company [[Lion Nathan]], and [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] ferries. Arising from heraldic use, the ''[[Red Lion (disambiguation)|Red Lion]]'' is also a popular pub name, with over 600 pubs bearing the name.&lt;ref name="Pubnames"&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Leslie Dunkling|Dunkling L]], Wright G |title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Pub Names |year=1994|origyear=1987 |publisher= Wordsworth Reference|location=Ware, Hertfordshire |isbn=1-85326-334-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rarer inn name is the ''White Lion'', derived from [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] or the [[Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref name="Pubnames"/&gt; Though the lion rampant appears on the [[Lyon]] coat of arms and flag, the French city's name has an unrelated derivation despite the similarity.  ''[[Rampant]]'' lions are common charges in heraldry. For example, the arms of the Carter of Castle Martin family, [[Ireland]] (see [[Carter-Campbell of Possil]]) include a pair of rampant combatant lions.

In the Middle Ages, when lions became a major element in heraldry, few Europeans had any chance to see actual lions. The lions were for them nearly as much legendary animals as were dragons or gryffins, which also commonly appeared on coats of arms.

*[[Singapore]]'s name is the Anglicised form of the original Sanskrit-derived Malay name '''Singapura''', which means 'Lion City'. Malay mythology describes how the founder-prince of Singapore (then called 'Temasek') sighted a strange red and black beast with a mane when he first set ashore the island. Believing it to be a lion and a good omen (although lions were not known to exist anywhere in Southeast Asia) he renamed the island Singapura. The lion features on the Singapore national coat of arms and is also the nickname of the national football team. 'Lion City' is also a common moniker for the city-state.
* Using '''Leon''' (lion) as a placename started in [[Ancient Greece]]; several locations in Greece itself had the name ([[Greek language|Greek]]:: {{lang|grc|Λέων}}) as well as a [[Leon, Italy|Greek colony]] in [[Sicily]].
* [[Lviv]], the major city of western [[Ukraine]], is named for Prince [[Lev I of Galicia]]. [[Lev (disambiguation)|Lev]] is a common [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name meaning "lion".  The Latin name for Lviv is Leopolis, meaning "Lion City".
* The name of the city of [[Oran]] in [[Algeria]] is derived from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] root 'HR meaning ''lion'', from which are also derived the names of [[Tahert]] and [[Souk Ahras]]. The name is attested in multiple [[Berber languages]], for instance as ''uharu'' and ''ahra''. A popular Oran legend tells that in the period around 900 BC, there were sightings of lions in the area. The two last felines were killed in a mountain near the city of Oran, which is now known as ''La montagne des Lions'' ("The Mountain of Lions"). In fact, there are two giant lion statues in front of Oran's city hall, hence the twin lions' mountain is Oran's symbol.
* Despite common misconception, the name of the French city of [[Lyon]] is a corruption of [[Lugdunum#Name|Lugdunum]], a Latinization of Celtic for "fortress of god [[Lugus]]". The same happens with the Spanish city of [[León, Spain|León]], whose name is a corruption of ''legio'', Latin for "[[Roman legion|legion]]". However their coats of arms wear lions as ''[[armes parlant]]''.

* In [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]] by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], the lion is used as a metaphor to describe a human who rebels against old knowledge, to make a new morality possible. The morality of the [[Übermensch|overman]].
* The lion's symbolism continues in fantasy literature. ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' features the [[Cowardly Lion]], who is particularly ashamed of his cowardice because of his cultural role as the "king of the beasts".&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 148, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aslan]], the "Greatest Lion" is the central figure in C.S.

The lion is also the symbol for Gryffindor house, the house of bravery, in [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.
* ''[[Lafcadio: The Lion Who Shot Back]]'' is a 1963 [[Children's literature|children's book]] written and illustrated by [[Shel Silverstein]]. Lions also tend to appear in several children's stories, being depicted as "the king of the jungle".
* In award-winning children's picture book, ''Charlie and Mama Kyna'', Leo, the lion, befriends and journeys home with Charlie in vivid illustrations.
* In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series by [[George R. R. Martin]], one of the main noble houses and main antagonists of the series, the Lannisters, have a golden lion on crimson as their family symbol, and in contrast to the lion being presented as a regal, noble creature in traditional folklore, it carries the undertones of pride, corruption, and lust for power of the Lannisters.
* Again adhering to ''king of the beast'' role, the book ''[[The Forges of Dawn]]'' focuses on the lions (called lyons) as opposed to the other creatures of Africa. These lyons rule empires and, in the case of the antagonists, almost entire continents. They are somewhat evolved from the lions we know today. For example, lyons have more mobile [[dewclaws]] as opposed to lions who's declaws are more stationary. They also live longer and speak varied languages.
* The ''[[Pride of Baghdad]]'' is based on a real story of African lions that escaped from [[Baghdad Zoo]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="Richards2006"&gt;{{cite web |author=Richards, D. |year=2006 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=8330 |title=The Joy of Pride: Vaughan talks "Pride of Baghdad" |work=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[live action]] picture ''[[Born Free]]'' (1966), based on the true story from the bestselling book of the same title, covered the story of the Kenyan lioness [[Elsa the Lioness|Elsa]], and the efforts of [[Joy Adamson]] and her game-warden husband [[George Adamson|George]] to train Elsa for release back into the wild.
* ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'' (1996) is a movie set in 1898. It is based on the true story of two lions in Africa that killed 130 people over a nine-month period, during the construction of a railroad bridge across the [[Tsavo River]], in what is now [[Kenya]]. The local natives named the two lions, both males,  "The Ghost" and "The Darkness".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/dalmatica/446710932/ The Ghost and the Darkness Were Their Names on Flickr - Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Siberian taiga''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[Taiga|Taiga and Boreal forests]] [[Biome]], is a very large biogeographic region in eastern [[Russia]].

==Setting==

This vast ecoregion is located in the heart of [[Siberia]], stretching over 20° of [[latitude]] and 50° of [[longitude]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa0601&lt;/ref&gt; (52° to 72° N, and 80° to 130° E). The climate in the East Siberian taiga is [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] (tropical deciduous and coniferous) and displays high [[continentality]], with extremes ranging from {{convert|40|°C|°F}} to {{convert|-62|°C|°F}}. Winters are long and very cold, but dry, with little [[snow]]fall due to the effects of the [[Siberian High|Siberian anticyclone]]. Summers are short, but can be quite warm for the northerly location.

[[File:Taiga of Far East near Imeni Poliny Osipenko village, Khabarovsk Krai.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|East Siberian taiga in the north of [[Khabarovsk Krai]]]]

Precipitation is low, ranging from {{convert|600|mm|in}} to {{convert|200|mm|in}}, decreasing from east to west. The topography of this ecoregion is varied, consisting of wide, flat plains and areas of [[karst topography]]. In contrast to the neighbouring [[West Siberian taiga]], large [[bog]]s and [[wetland]]s are conspicuously absent. Some trees also shed their leaves annually, a characteristic of deciduous forests.

==Flora==

Vegetation consists mainly of vast, dense forests of Dahurian Larch (''[[Larix gmelinii]]''), with Siberian Larch (''[[Larix sibirica]]'') and hybrid between the Dahurian and Siberian Larches (''[[Larix x czekanowskii]]'') occurring as one moves to the west. [[Cranberry]] (''Vaccinium oxycoccus'') and [[bilberry]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus'') bushes dominate the understory.

Throughout the ecoregion, smaller areas dominated by [[Siberian pine]] (''Pinus sibirica''), [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), [[Siberian spruce]] (''Picea obovata'') and Siberian fir (''[[Abies sibirica]]'') can be found. Pine forests and deciduous forests composed of [[birch]] and [[Populus|poplar]] species become more common as one moves south, and at the [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]] of the [[Lena River]] and the [[Nizhnyaya Tunguska River]], as well as in the [[Angara River]] basin, [[steppe]] and [[shrub-steppe]] communities can be found along with areas of [[forest-steppe]].

==Fauna==

This region contains the highest number of [[brown bear]]s (''[[East Siberian brown bear|Ursus arctos collaris]]''), [[Eurasian wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') and wild [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus'') in [[Russia]]. Further south mammals in the East Siberian taiga include [[Siberian musk deer]] (''Moschus moschiferus''), wapiti also known as [[Asia]]n [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis'') and [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''). Birds of this ecoregion include the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), [[peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus''), [[osprey]] (''Pandion haliaetus''), [[black stork]] (''Ciconia nigra''), [[hooded crane]] (''Grus monacha''), [[carrion crow]] (''Corvus corone''), the [[Siberian blue robin|Siberian blue]] and [[rufous-tailed robin]]s (''Luscinia cyane'' and ''L. sibilans'', respectively), the [[thrush nightingale]] (''Luscinia luscinia''), [[Pallas's rosefinch]] (''Carpodacus roseus''), [[Pacific swift]] (''Apus pacificus'') and [[Baikal teal]] (''Anas formosa'').

==Conservation status, threats and protected areas==

Although little of this ecoregion is protected, its conservation status is listed as "Relatively Stable/Intact". Protected areas in this ecoregion include:
* [[Stolby Nature Sanctuary]]
* [[Olyokma Nature Reserve]]
* [[Tunguska Nature Reserve]]
* [[Central Siberia Nature Reserve]]
All are "[[Zapovednik]]s", (that is, strict ecological reserves).  The main threats to this ecoregion's integrity are [[poaching]] and clear-cut logging in the southern and central portions of the region.

After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], came a new threat. There is little forest in China, and Chinese entrepreneurs (due to the lack of woods, and fuelled by strong economic growth), began to show interest in obtaining the woods from RF. High levels of [[Corruption in Russia|corruption]] and some other reasons allowed them to achieve their goal. A new law adopted was Federal law 473-FZ, which protects the rights of foreign companies in RF, and Chinese [[Lumberjack|lumberjacks]] began to destroy all the trees on the leased land (and far beyond too). There have been numerous attempts of [[Deforestation|deforestation]] in the protected [[Floodplain|floodplain]] of the rivers. Because of the large environmental damage, their activities caused protests by local residents and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]&lt;ref name="WWF-2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kabanets|first1=A.G.|last2=Milakovsky|first2=B.J.|last3=Lepeshkin|first3=E.A. and Sychikov, D.V.|editor=Smirnov, D.Y|title=Illegal logging in the Russian Far East: global demand and taiga destruction.|url=http://wwf.ru/resources/publ/book/eng/776|accessdate=23 July 2017|year=2013|publisher=WWF Russia|location=Moscow|language=en|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWF-2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kabanets|first1=A.G.|last2=Chuvasov|first2=E.V.|last3=Sychikov|first3=A.V., Sychikov D.V. and Milakovsky, B.J.|title=The use of the shortcomings of the legislation and control to cover up illegal logging (review), on Russian: [Практика рубок ухода и санитарных рубок на Дальнем Востоке России:  законное прикрытие незаконных рубок: обзор]|url=https://new.wwf.ru/resources/publications/booklets/praktika-rubok-ukhoda-i-sanitarnykh-rubok-na-dalnem-vostoke-rossii-zakonnoe-prikrytie-nezakonnykh-ru/|accessdate=23 July 2017|year=2016|publisher=WWR Russia|location=Vladivostok|language=ru|isbn=978-5-91849-115-7|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The actions of the Chinese companies pose a threat to the native population of Siberia and the Far East ([[Evenks]], [[Udege people|Udege]] et al.), depriving them of their habitat and traditional ways of life.

==Energy management==
[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|thumb|Thermal energy is the amount of random molecular [[kinetic energy]].]]

Energy accounting is a system used in [[energy management system]]s to measure and analyze energy consumption to improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] within an organization.&lt;ref name=Acc /&gt; Organisations such as Intel corporation use these systems to track energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various [[energy transformation]]s are possible. An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system. This becomes a useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts. How much energy is needed at each point in a system is measured, as well as the form of that energy. An accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within a system. Sometimes, non-useful work is what is often responsible for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml Science Notes: Energy Accounting and Balance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |date=2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy balance==
[[Energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) is the ratio of energy delivered by an energy technology to the energy invested to set up the technology.

'''Functional ecology''' is a branch of [[Ecology (disciplines)|ecology]] that focuses on the roles, or functions, that species play in the community or [[ecosystem]] in which they occur. In this approach, physiological, anatomical, and life history characteristics of the species are emphasized. The term "function" is used to emphasize certain physiological processes rather than discrete properties, describe an organism's role in a trophic system, or illustrate the effects of natural selective processes on an organism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;" Towards A Definition Of Functional Ecology On JSTOR ". Jstor.org. N. p., 2017. Web. 2 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This sub-discipline of ecology represents the crossroads between ecological patterns and the processes and mechanisms that underlie them. It focuses on traits represented in large number of species and can be measured in two ways. The first being screening, which involves measuring a trait across a number of species, and the second being empiricism, which provides quantitative relationships for the traits measured in screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keddy|first=PA|date=1992|title=A pragmatic approach to functional ecology.|url=http://drpaulkeddy.com/pdffiles/Keddypragmatic1992.pdf|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=6|issue=6|pages=621–626|doi=10.2307/2389954|jstor=2389954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional ecology often emphasizes an integrative approach, using organism traits and activities to understand community dynamics and ecosystem processes, particularly in response to the rapid global changes occurring in earth’s environment.

Functional ecology sits at the nexus of several disparate disciplines and serves as the unifying principle between [[evolutionary ecology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]] and [[genomics]], and traditional ecological studies, and attempts to understand species' "competitive abilities, patterns of species co-occurrence, community assembly, and the role of different traits on ecosystem functioning".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laureto|first=Livia Maira Orlandi|last2=Cianciaruso|first2=Marcus Vinicius|last3=Samia|first3=Diogo Soares Menezes|date=2015-07|title=Functional diversity: an overview of its history and applicability|journal=Natureza &amp; Conservação|volume=13|issue=2|pages=112–116|doi=10.1016/j.ncon.2015.11.001|issn=1679-0073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The notion that ecosystems' functions can be affected by their constituent parts has its origins in the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species|On The Origin of Species]]'' is one of the first texts to directly comment on the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem health by noting a positive correlation between plant density and ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In his influential 1927 work, ''Animal Ecology'', [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] proposed classifying an ecosystem based on the how its members utilize resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal Ecology|last=Elton|first=Charles|publisher=New York, Macmillan Co.|year=1927|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, Elton's model of ecosystems was widely accepted, where organisms that shared similarities in resource use occupied the same 'guild' within an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, an increased interest in functional classification revolutionized functional ecology. 'Guilds' would be re-termed 'functional groups', and classification schemes began to focus more on interactions between species and trophic levels. Functional ecology became widely understood to be the study of ecological processes that concern the adaptations of organism within the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1990s, biodiversity became better understood as the diversity of species' ecological functions within an ecosystem, rather than simply a great number of different species present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, in the 2000s researchers began using functional classification schemes to examine ecosystems' and organisms' responses to drastic change and disturbance, and the impact of function loss on the health of an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Functional Diversity ==
Functional diversity is widely considered to be “the value and the range of those species and organismal traits that influence ecosystem functioning”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this sense, the use of the term “function” may apply to individuals, populations, communities, trophic levels, or evolutionary process (i.e. considering the function of adaptations).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Functional diversity was conceived as an alternative classification to schemes using genetic diversity or physiological diversity to measure the ecological importance of species in an environment, as well as a way to understand how biodiversity affects specific ecosystem functions, where in this context, 'biodiversity' refers to the diversity of ecosystem functions present in a given system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Understanding ecosystems via functional diversity is as powerful as it is broadly applicable and gives insight into observable patterns in ecosystems, such as species occurrence, species competitive abilities, and the influence of biological communities on ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on Ecosystem Health ===
A key interest of modern research in Functional Ecology is the impact of functional diversity on ecosystem health. Unsurprisingly, biodiversity has a positive impact on the productivity of an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardinale|first=Bradley J.|last2=Duffy|first2=J. Emmett|last3=Gonzalez|first3=Andrew|last4=Hooper|first4=David U.|last5=Perrings|first5=Charles|last6=Venail|first6=Patrick|last7=Narwani|first7=Anita|last8=Mace|first8=Georgina M.|last9=Tilman|first9=David|date=2012-06|title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11148|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=486|issue=7401|pages=59–67|doi=10.1038/nature11148|pmid=22678280|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased functional diversity increases both the capacity of the ecosystem to regulate the flux of energy and matter through the environment (Ecosystem Functions) as well as the ecosystem's ability to produce resources beneficial to humans such as air, water, and wood (Ecosystem Services).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ecosystem Functions are drastically reduced with decreases in the diversity of genes, species and functional groups present within an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In fact, reductions in functional diversity broadly impact the survivability of organisms in an environment regardless of functional group, trophic level, or species, implying that the organization and interaction of communities in an ecosystem has a profound impact on its ability to function and self-sustain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, diversity improves environmental stability. The greater an ecosystem's diversity, the more resilient it is to changes in species composition (e.g. extinction events or invasive species) and extraneous changes to environmental conditions (e.g. logging, farming, and pollution).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, the benefits that diversity provides to an environment scale non-linearly with the amount of diversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Unfortunately, this relationship also acts in the opposite direction. The ''loss'' of  diversity non-linearly disrupts ecosystems (even stable ones); this negative impact is especially detrimental when the loss is across trophic levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For, example, the loss of a single tertiary predator can have cascading effects on the food chain, resulting in reduction of plant biomass and genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This in turn can alter the "vegetation structure, fire frequency, and even disease epidemics in a range of ecosystems".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The effects of diversity on ecosystems are so powerful, that they can rival the impact of climate change and other global ecosystem stressors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, in rare situations, diversity has been shown to retard ecological productivity. In experimentally concocted microscopic environments, a diverse culture of bacteria was unable to out-produce a homogeneous culture of  an 'efficient' control strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardinale|first=Bradley J.|last2=Wright|first2=Justin P.|last3=Cadotte|first3=Marc W.|last4=Carroll|first4=Ian T.|last5=Hector|first5=Andy|last6=Srivastava|first6=Diane S.|last7=Loreau|first7=Michel|last8=Weis|first8=Jerome J.|date=2007-11-13|title=Impacts of plant diversity on biomass production increase through time because of species complementarity |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=104|issue=46|pages=18123–18128|doi=10.1073/pnas.0709069104 |pmc=2084307|pmid=17991772}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statistical validity and setup of these experiments have been questioned, and require further investigation to carry substantial merit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In general, the current consensus that diversity is beneficial to ecosystem health has much more theoretical and empirical support and is more widely applicable.

Most models of complex functional diversity are only effective in a small range of spacial scales.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carmona|first=Carlos P.|last2=de Bello|first2=Francesco|last3=Mason|first3=Norman W.H.|last4=Lepš|first4=Jan|date=2016-05|title=Traits Without Borders: Integrating Functional Diversity Across Scales|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(16)00045-8|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=English|volume=31|issue=5|pages=382–394|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2016.02.003|pmid=26924737|issn=0169-5347}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by defining the functional trait probability density as a "function representing the distribution of probabilities of observing each possible trait value in a given [[ecological unit]]," the results of many models can be generalized to larger scales.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; At larger spatial scales, more environmental heterogeneity may increase opportunities for species to exploit more functional groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Consistent with this conclusion, tests of theoretical models predict that the net effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functions grow stronger over time, over larger spacial scales, and with more heterogeneous natural resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, these results are expected to underestimate the actual relationshipm impling that large space and time scales coupled with diverse resources are more than necessary to sustain an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications of Functional Ecology ==

A functional approach to understanding and dealing with environments provides numerous benefits to our understanding of biology and its applications in our lives. While the concept of functional ecology is still in its infancy, it has been widely applied throughout biological studies to better understand organisms, environments, and their interactions.

=== Species Detection and Classification ===

The notions of functional ecology have beneficial implications for species detection and classification. When detecting species, ecologically important traits, such as plant height, influence the probability of detection during field surveys.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=Tobias|last2=Allan|first2=Eric|last3=Pearman|first3=Peter B.|last4=Amrhein|first4=Valentin|date=2017-12-27|title=Functional ecology and imperfect detection of species|journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=917–928|doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12950|issn=2041-210X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When holistically analyzing an environment, the systematic error of imperfect species detection can lead to incorrect trait-environment evolutionary conclusions as well as poor estimates of functional trait diversity and environmental role.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, if small species of insects are less likely to be detected, researchers may conclude that they are much more scarce (and thus less impactful) in the environment than larger species of insects. This 'detection filtering' has major consequences on functional packaging and the defining functional groups in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thankfully, correlations between environmental change and evolutionary adaptation is are much larger than the effects of imperfect species detection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nevertheless, approaching ecosystems with theoretical maps of functional relationships between species and groups can reduce the likelihood of improper detection and improve the robustness of any biological conclusions drawn.

A functional approach to defining traits can even help species classification. Trait focused schemes of taxonomy have long been used to classify species, but the number and type of 'trait' to consider is widely debated. Considering more traits in a classification scheme will separate species into more specific functional groups, but may lead to an overestimation of total functional diversity in the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, considering too few traits runs the risk of classifying species as functionally redundant, when they are in fact vital to the health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; So, before one can classify organisms by traits, the definition of 'trait' must be settled. Rather than define traits as proxies for organism performance, as Darwin did, modern ecologists favor a more robust definition of traits often referred to as "functional traits".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Violle|first=Cyrille|last2=Navas|first2=Marie-Laure|last3=Vile|first3=Denis|last4=Kazakou|first4=Elena|last5=Fortunel|first5=Claire|last6=Hummel|first6=Irène|last7=Garnier|first7=Eric|date=2007-05|title=Let the concept of trait be functional!|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=116|issue=5|pages=882–892|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15559.x|issn=0030-1299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this paradigm, functional traits are defined as morpho-physiophenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Notice that is definition is not specific to species. Since larger biological organizations grow, reproduce and sustain just as individual organisms do, functional traits can be used to describe ecosystem processes and properties as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To distinguish between functional traits at different scales, the classification scheme adopts the following nomenclature. Individual organisms have Ecophysiological traits and life-history traits; populations have demographic traits; communities have response traits; and ecosystems have effect traits.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At each level, functional traits can directly and indirectly influence functional traits in the levels above or below them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, when averaged over an ecosystem, individual plants' heights can contribute to ecosystem productivity or efficiency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;caption href="Digital object identifier"&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Trait&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Scale&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th href="Category:Ecology"&gt;Scope&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td href="Category:All stub articles"&gt;Ecophysiological&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Individual&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Physiological quality that affects relative fitness&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leaf size can affect solar energy absorption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Life-history&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Individual&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Qualities that impact relative fitness and change over an individual's lifespan&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Body size changes, lifespan, age to reproduction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Demographic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Population&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Changes in a population over time&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Birth and death rates&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Response&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Community&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Community responses to environmental variables&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Flora grow taller after a fire clears tree canopy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Effect&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ecosystem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Effects that involve an ecosystem functioning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The necessity of plants for an ecosystem to exist&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=== Genomics ===
Functional Ecology is closely intertwined with genomics. Understanding the functional niches that organisms occupy in a ecosystem can provide clues to genetic differences between members of a genus.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9781785481468500095|title=Insight on Environmental Genomics|last=Faure|first=Denis|last2=Joly|first2=Dominique|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781785481468|pages=93–102|doi=10.1016/b978-1-78548-146-8.50009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, discovering the traits/functions that genes encode for yields insight into the roles that organisms perform in their environment. This kind of genomic study is referred to as genomic ecology or ecogenomics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Genomic ecology can classify traits on cellular and physiological levels leading to a more refined classification system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, once genetic markers for functional traits in individuals are identified, predictions about the functional diversity and composition of an ecosystem can be made from the genetic data of a few species in a process called "reverse ecology".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Reverse ecology can contribute to better taxonomy of organisms as well. Rather than defining species by genetic proximity alone, organisms can be additionally classified by the functions they serve in the same ecology. This application of reverse ecology has proven especially useful in the classification of bacteria. Researchers were able to identify the correspondence between genetic variation and ecological niche function in the genus ''Agrobacterium'' and their greater biological implication on species distinction and diversity in the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The researchers found that 196 genes specific to ''Agrobacterium fabrum'' coded for metabolic pathways specific to plants which allowed for the use of plant-specific compounds and sugars to avoid iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This trait, unique to ''Agrobacterium fabrum,'' allowed it to avoid competition with closely related bacteria in ''Agrobacterium'' found within the same environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, understanding the genetics of ''Agrobacterium fabrum'' allowed researchers to infer that it evolved into the niche (i.e. ecological role) of a plant so that it could avoid competing with its close relatives. If this process can be shown to generalize, then the ecological functions of other organisms can be inferred simply from genetic information.

However, reverse ecology and genomic ecology face several hurdles before they can be accepted as rigorous and mainstream approaches to taxonomy or ecology. One of the major challenges is that technologies for the sequencing and comparison of transcriptomic data do not exist, making the acquisition of transcriptomic data dependent on environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, as studied environments increase in complexity, transcriptomic data becomes harder to collect.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Furthermore, the functions that many discovered genes encode for are still unknown making it difficult if not impossible to infer ecological function from a genome.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Testing hypotheses concerning what functions given genes encode for is difficult experimentally and is expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== De-extinction ===
Functional ecology also has broad applications to the science of and debate over [[de-extinction]], the resurrection of extinct species. Function ecology can be applied to strategically assess the resurrection of extinct species to maximize its impact on an environment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=Douglas J.|last2=Hardesty-Moore|first2=Molly|last3=Halpern|first3=Benjamin S.|last4=Young|first4=Hillary S.|date=2016-09-12|title=A mammoth undertaking: harnessing insight from functional ecology to shape de-extinction priority setting|journal=Functional Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1003–1011|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12728|issn=0269-8463}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid reintroducing a species that is rendered functionally redundant by one of its ancestors, a functional analysis of global ecosystems can be performed to determine which ecosystems would benefit most from the added functional diversity of the reintroduced species.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These considerations are important because, while many species currently being considered for de-extinction are terrestrial, they are also functionally redundant in their former ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, many extinct marine species have been identified as functionally unique in their environments, even today, which makes a strong case for their reintroduction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In fact, while some functions have been recovered by evolution, as is the case with many extinct terrestrial species, some functional gaps have widened over time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Reintroducing extinct species has the potential to close these gaps, making richer, more balanced ecosystems.

Furthermore, before a species goes extinct in the classical sense of the word, keeping a functional perspective in mind can avoid "functional extinction".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Functional extinction is defined as "the point at which a species fails to perform its historical functional role".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Endangered species such as species of tigers, tuna and sea otters usually qualify for this threshold.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If functional ecology is considered, new species (not necessarily extinct) can be introduced into ecosystem where a species has become functionally extinct before any de-extinction action ever needs to be taken. This can be a key transformative process in ecological preservation and restoration because functional extinction can have cascading effects on the health of an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, species that engineer ecosystems such as beavers are particularly unique functionally; their absence from an ecosystem could be devastating.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

While functional arguments for reintroduction of extinct species, may paint thoughtful reintroduction as a ecological boon, the ethical and practical debate over de-extinction has not left functional approaches unscathed. The main critique of functional arguments in favor of de-extinction are largely focused on contentions that ecological functions are often ambiguously defined and that it is unclear what functions must be present to define an ecosystem. These arguments suggest that reintroducing an extinct species could be drastically harm an ecosystem if conclusions about its function or the functions of the species it is intended to replace are incorrect. Additionally, even if an extinct species' function is well understood de-extinction could be equally harmful if the function served by the extinct species is no longer needed by the ecosystem.

'''Hanns Hörbiger''' (29 November 1860, in [[Atzgersdorf]] &amp;ndash; 11 October 1931, in [[Mauer, Vienna|Mauer]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[engineer]] from [[Vienna]] with roots in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. He took part in the construction of the [[Budapest]] subway and in 1894 invented a new type of valve essential for compressors still in widespread use today.

He is also remembered today for his [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[Welteislehre]] ("World Ice") theory.

== Early life ==
Hanns Hörbiger was born in Atzgersdorf, a suburb of [[Liesing]], Vienna and studied engineering at the local Technical College.

In 1894 Hörbiger had an idea for a new design of blast furnace blowing engine: he replaced the old and easily  damaged leather flap valves with a steel valve. Opening and closing automatically, and light and frictionless guided, the disk valve eliminated all the drawbacks of previous valve designs.

Hörbiger registered a patent for his invention, which smoothed the way for efficient steel production and greater productivity in mining. High-pressure chemistry and the global network of gas exchange – none of these would be possible without the Hörbiger Valve.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1900, Hanns Hörbiger and the engineer Friedrich Wilhelm Rogler founded an engineer’s office in [[Budapest]], which was moved to Vienna in 1903. By 1925 it had developed into the Hörbiger &amp; Co. company. Alfred Hörbiger, one of Hörbiger’s sons, joined the company in 1925 and assumed the management, while Hanns Hörbiger devoted himself to scientific study until his death in 1931.

The company developed rapidly under Alfred Hörbiger’s management: a production facility was taken into service in Vienna and an affiliated company was set up in Düsseldorf. Hörbiger expanded into England and concluded numerous licensing agreements with leading manufacturers of piston blowers, compressors and ships’ Diesel engines in Europe and North America.

The success was driven by originality and inventive genius. The disk valve became more sophisticated: Hörbiger developed highlift or high-pressure valves, compressor control systems and damper plates. By 1937, 98 percent of production was destined for export. The name Hörbiger had become a dependable trademark in valve and control technology for compressors. As of 2017, the engineering company founded by Hanns Hörbiger still exists as HOERBIGER and is a major supplier of compression technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoerbiger.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Welteislehre ==
{{Main|Welteislehre}}
Hörbiger is nowadays chiefly remembered for his ''[[Welteislehre]]'' ("World Ice") theory, which he first put forward in the 1913 book, ''Wirbelstürme, Wetterstürze, Hagelkatastrophen und Marskanal-Verdoppelungen'', written in collaboration with amateur astronomer [[Philipp Johann Heinrich Fauth|Philipp Fauth]]. Hörbiger's theories were later popularized by [[Hans Schindler Bellamy|H.S. Bellamy]], and influenced [[Hans Robert Scultetus]], head of the ''Pflegestätte für Wetterkunde'' (Meteorology Section) of the [[SS]]-[[Ahnenerbe]], who believed that ''Welteislehre'' could be used to provide accurate long-range weather forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gratzer|first = Walter Bruno|title = The Undergrowth of Science: Delusion, Self-deception, and Human Frailty|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|date = 2001|location =|nopp =|pages = 235–236|url =|isbn = 0-19-860435-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Two of Hörbiger's sons, [[Paul Hörbiger|Paul]] and [[Attila Hörbiger|Attila]], were matineé idols in the interwar years, and Paul Hörbiger's granddaughter [[Mavie Hörbiger]] also went on to become a celebrated actress. His two other sons devoted themselves to promoting their father's theory.

== Honors ==
The [[Deslandres (crater)|Deslandres]] crater on [[the moon]] was designated ''Hörbiger'' by [[Philipp Johann Heinrich Fauth|Philipp Fauth]] on his private lunar chart; it subsequently received the official name of Deslandres, following a 1942 suggestion by [[E. M. Antoniadi]] in 1942, which was approved at the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s 1948 General Assembly.

[[File:Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|265px|Outdoor components of a residential air-source heat pump]]
A '''heat pump''' is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to what is called a [[heat sink]]. Heat pumps move [[thermal energy]] in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hQDOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+%22heat+sink%22+opposite+direction#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20%22heat%20sink%22%20opposite%20direction&amp;f=false|title=Sustainable Energy Solutions in Agriculture |last=Bundschuh |first=Jochen |last2=Chen|first2=Guangnan|date=2014-03-07|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781315778716|location=|pages=111|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common design of a heat pump involves four main components – a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], an [[evaporator]] and a [[compressor]]. The heat transfer medium circulated through these components is called [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/market-technology/heat-pump-work/ Article on IEA HPT TCP How does a heat pump work?&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction – releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times more effective at heating than simple [[Electric heating|electrical resistance heater]]s using the same amount of electricity. However, the typical cost of installing a heat pump is also higher than that of a resistance heater.

When discussing about and comparing energy efficiency of heat pumping applications some different factors are mainly used, COP ([[Coefficient of Performance]]), SCOP ([[Seasonal Coefficient of Performance]]) and SPF ([[Seasonal Performance Factor]]). The more efficient a heat pump is the less energy consuming it will be and the more cost-effective it can be to operate. There are several factors that will affect the efficiency of a heat pump such as climate, temperature, auxiliary equipment, technology, size and control system.&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/market-technology/efficiency-heat-pumps/ IEA HPT TCP Efficiency and heat pumping application&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
[[Heat|Heat energy]] naturally transfers from warmer places to colder spaces. However, a heat pump can reverse this process, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. Heat is not conserved in this process and requires some amount of external energy, such as electricity. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems, the term ''heat pump'' usually refers to [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer. These heat pumps can be reversible, and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space.

Heat pumps are used to transfer heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat. Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment, only a fraction of which comes from electricity (or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor). In electrically-powered heat pumps, the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed, giving the system a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 or 4, as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater, in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy.

Heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes, in the evaporator, and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses, in the condenser. The refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser, allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BxEOvbuMSGgC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+refrigerant+evaporator+condenser+efficient+thermal+energy+transfer#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20refrigerant%20evaporator%20condenser%20efficient%20thermal%20energy%20transfer%20distance&amp;f=false|title=The Future of Energy Use|last=O'Keefe|first=Philip|last2=O'Brien|first2=Geoff|last3=Pearsall|first3=Nicola|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Earthscan|year=|isbn=9781844075041|location=|pages=224|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversible heat pumps===
Reversible heat pumps work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space. They employ a [[reversing valve]] to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils.

In '''heating mode,''' the outdoor coil is an evaporator, while the indoor is a condenser. The refrigerant flowing from the evaporator (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from outside air (or soil, or better still, moving water) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including energy from the compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around the inside of the building by an [[air handler]].

Alternatively, thermal energy is transferred to water, which is then used to heat the building via radiators or [[underfloor heating]]. The heated water may also be used for [[domestic hot water]] consumption.  The refrigerant is then allowed to expand, and hence cool, and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator, and the cycle repeats. This is a standard refrigeration cycle, save that the "cold" side of the refrigerator (the evaporator coil) is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder.

In cold weather, the outdoor unit of an air source heat pump needs to be intermittently defrosted. This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements (located in the air-handler) to be activated. At the same time, the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant. The condenser/evaporator fan will not run during defrost mode.

In '''cooling mode''' the cycle is similar, but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil (which reaches a lower temperature) is the evaporator. This is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate.

==Operating principles==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and [[Condensation|condensing]] fluid known as a [[refrigerant]]. The heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed, and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed. [[File:Heatpump2.svg|thumb|300px|A simple stylized diagram of a heat pump's [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[compressor]]]]
[[File:refrigeration PV diagram.svg|thumb|300px|A fictitious pressure-volume diagram for a typical refrigeration cycle]]
The [[Working fluids|working fluid]], in its gaseous state, is pressurized and circulated through the system by a [[Gas compressor|compressor]]. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a [[heat exchanger]], called a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], [[capillary]] tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a [[turbine]]. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ruR7U3IjrR0C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+turbine++expansion+valve,+capillary#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20turbine%20%20expansion%20valve,%20capillary&amp;f=false|title=EXERGY: Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development|last=Dincer|first=Ibrahim|last2=Rosen|first2=Marc A.|date=2007-09-18|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080531359|location=|pages=98|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential that the refrigerant reaches a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the "hot" heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the [[coefficient of performance]] (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.automaticheating.com.au/heat-pumps-explained/|title=Introduction to Heat Pumps|work=Automatic Heating|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled.

===Heat transport===
Heat is typically transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid.  Air is sometimes used, but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat. In systems using refrigerant, this working fluid can also be used to transfer heat a considerable distance, though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage.  When large amounts of heat are to be transferred, water is typically used, often supplemented with [[antifreeze]], [[corrosion inhibitors]], and other additives.

===Heat sources/sinks===
A common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air, as used by an air-source heat pump.  A fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency.

Larger installations handling more heat, or in tight physical spaces, often use water-source heat pumps.  The heat is sourced or rejected in water flow, which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct cross-section than air flow can carry.  The water may be heated at a remote location by [[boiler]]s, [[solar energy]], or other means.  Alternatively when needed, the water may be cooled by using a [[cooling tower]], or discharged into a large body of water, such as a lake, stream or an ocean.

[[Geothermal heat pump]]s or ground-source heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink, and water as the heat transfer medium.  This is possible because below ground level, the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons, and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat. Ground source heat pumps work in the same way as air-source heat pumps, but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground. Ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside. Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.

Heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters, or oil or gas combustion. The auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads, or to provide a back-up system.

==Applications==
There are millions of domestic installations using air source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/buildings_roadmap.pdf pg16&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs (HVAC) and may also provide domestic hot water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems|title = Heat Pump Systems |publisher = U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.gshp.org.uk/RHI_Domestic.html|title = Renewable Heat Incentive – Domestic RHI – paid over 7 years |website = Ground Source Heat Pump Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HVAC===
In [[HVAC]] applications, a heat pump is typically a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of ''heat flow'' (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building. In cooler climates, the default setting of the reversing valve is heating.

The default setting in warmer climates is cooling. Because the two heat exchangers, the condenser and evaporator, must swap functions, they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes. Therefore, the SEER rating, which is the Seasonal Energy [[SEER|Efficiency]] Rating, of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines. For equipment to receive the Energy Star Rating, it must have a rating of at least 14.5 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rfohl.com/heating-cooling-mechanics-terminology/|title=Heating And Cooling Mechanics and Terminology - R.F. Ohl|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water heating===
In [[water heating]] applications, a heat pump may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or heating potable water for use by homes and industry. Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank, another variety extracts heat from indoor air to assist in cooling the space.

===District heating===
[[File:Generations of district heating systems EN.svg|thumb|Heat pumps can be integrated in district heating systems, especially if these are operated with low temperatures.]]
Heat pumps can also be used as heat supplier for [[district heating]]. Possible heat sources for such applications are [[sewage]] water, ambient water (like sea, lake and river water), industrial [[waste heat]], [[geothermal energy]], [[flue gas]], waste heat from [[district cooling]] and heat from [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|solar heat storage]]. In Europe, more than 1500 MW were installed since the 1980s, of which about 1000 MW were in use in Sweden in 2017.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=David |first1=Andrei et al |last2= |first2= |date=2017 |title=Heat Roadmap Europe: Large-Scale Electric Heat Pumps in District Heating Systems |url= |journal=[[Energies]] |volume=10 |issue= 4|pages=578 |doi=10.3390/en10040578 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale heat pumps for district heating combined with thermal energy storage offer high flexibility for the integration of variable renewable energy. Therefore they are regarded as a key technology for smart energy systems with high shares of [[renewable energy]] up to 100 % and advanced 4th generation district heating systems.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Henrik Lund (academic)|Lund]] |first1=Henrik et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |title=4th Generation District Heating (4GDH): Integrating smart thermal grids into future sustainable energy systems |url= http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/4th-generation-district-heating-4gdh(61c90957-a9e5-4725-b145-6d481776f827).html|journal=[[Energy (journal)|Energy]] |volume=68 |issue= |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.089 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayegh |first1=M.A. et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2018 |title=Heat pump placement, connection and operational modes in European district heating |url= |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=166 |issue= |pages=122–144 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example for such an usage is the [[Drammen Heat Pump]] commissioned in 2011. This heat pump uses heat from a fjord whose temperature is around 8&amp;nbsp;°C using 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 megawatts to town center residences and businesses. A city ordinance mandates this heating system for many new buildings.

===Industrial heating===
There is a great potential to reduce the energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in the industry by application of industrial heat pumps. An international collaboration project completed in 2015 collected totally 39 examples of R&amp;D-projects and 115 case studies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/annex35/ IEA HPT TCP Annex 35&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that short payback periods are possible (less than 2 years), high reduction of CO2-emissionen can be achieved (in some cases more than 50 %).&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/publications/?search=Annex+35 IEA HPT TCP Annex 35 Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/publications/application-of-industrial-heat-pumps-annex-35-two-page-summary/ IEA HPT TCP Annex 25 Summary &lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
Until the 1990s, the [[refrigerant]]s were often [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s such as R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]), one in a class of several refrigerants using the brand name [[Freon]], a trademark of [[DuPont]]. Its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the [[Montreal Protocol]] of August 1987 because of the [[ozone depletion|damage]] that [[CFCs]] cause to the [[ozone layer]] if released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/Section_1.2_Control_measures/Annex_A_-_Group_I.shtml|title=Handbook for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer - 7th Edition|year=2007|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme - Ozone Secretariat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One widely adopted replacement refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) known as [[R-134a]] (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (dichlorodifluoromethane) and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant [[ozone depletion potential]] and a somewhat lower [[global warming potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/Refrigerants-Environment-Properties-d_1220.html|title=Refrigerants - Environmental Properties|website=The Engineering ToolBox|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other substances such as liquid R-717 [[ammonia]] are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable [[propane]] or [[butane]], can also be used.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ammonia, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2006|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2|author=Max Appl|chapter=Ammonia|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, [[carbon dioxide]], [[R-744]], has increasingly been used, utilizing the [[transcritical cycle]], although it requires much higher working pressures. In residential and commercial applications, the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) R-22 is still widely used, however, HFC [[R-410A]] does not deplete the ozone layer and is being used more frequently; however, it is a powerful greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change.&lt;ref name=R-410A&gt;[[R-410A#Environmental effects]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ecometrica.com|title=Calculation of green house gas potential of R-410A|url=http://ecometrica.com/article/calculating-the-global-warming-potential-of-refrigerant-gas-mixes|accessdate=2015-07-13|ref=Calculation of green house gas potential of R-410A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, or plain air is used in the [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cycle]], providing the maximum number of options in environmentally friendly gases.

More recent refrigerators use [[R600A]] which is [[isobutane]], and does not deplete the ozone and is less harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LpStalb-tF4C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=R600A+isobutane+ozone+environment#v=onepage&amp;q=R600A%20isobutane%20ozone%20environment&amp;f=false|title=Green Electricity and Global Warming|last=Itteilag|first=Richard L.|date=2012-08-09|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=|isbn=9781477217405|location=|pages=77|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimethyl ether]] (DME) has also gained in popularity as a refrigerant.&lt;ref name="mecanica-dme"&gt;[http://www.e-bookspdf.org/view/aHR0cDovL25yZWMubW4vZGF0YS91cGxvYWRzL05vbSUyMHNldGd1dWwlMjB4aWNoZWVsL092ZXJ2aWV3L0dsb2JhbCUyMHdhcm1pbmcucGRm/UjQwNGEgJiBEbWUgLSDQodGN0YDQs9GN0Y3Qs9C00Y3RhSDQrdGA0YfQuNC8INCl0q/Rh9C90LjQuQ== r404a &amp; dme eco-refrigerant blend as a new solution to limit the global warming effect] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211640/http://www.mecanica.pub.ro/frigo-eco/R404A_DME.pdf archive 2012.03.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

As quite similar criteria shall be fulfilled by [[working fluids]] applied to heat pumps, refrigeration and ORC cycles, several working fluids are applied by all these technologies and can be sorted into the same thermodynamic classification category based on the shape of their saturation curve.

==Noise==
A ground source heat pump has no need for an outdoor unit with moving mechanical components: no external noise is produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

An air source heat pump requires an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise. In 2013, the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.cen.eu/BP/6095.pdf|title=HEAT PUMPS AND AIR CONDITIONING UNITS, Social Factors, CEN/TC 113 Business Plan, p. 2|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CEN/TC 113 Business Plan outset was that "consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations", no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by January 2016.

In the United States, the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as "an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 [[A-weighting|A-weighted decibels (dBA)]] to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas (U.S. EPA 1974). This limit is a day–night 24-hr average noise level (LDN), with a 10-dBA penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1307272/|title=Monica S. Hammer, Tracy K. Swinburn, and Richard L. Neitzel "Environmental Noise Pollution in the United States: Developing an Effective Public Health Response" Environmental Health Perspectives V122,I2,2014|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-dB(A) penalty makes the permitted U.S. nighttime noise level equal to 45 dB(A), which is more than is accepted in some European countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps.

Another feature of [[Air source heat pumps|ASHP]] external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannabery.com/faq8.shtml|title= Hannabery HVAC "Commonly Reported HVAC Problems: Outdoor unit makes strange or loud noises"|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode. After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan. The acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA. This is included in legislation in France. According to the French concept of noise nuisance, "noise emergence" is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise, and ambient noise without the disturbing noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiil.org/bestpractices/How%20to%20determine%20acceptable%20levels%20of%20noise%20nuisance%20%28France%29|title=Hiil innovating Justice "How to determine acceptable levels of noise nuisance (France)|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006910540&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid |title=Code de la santé publique - Article R1334-33 (in French)|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance considerations==
When comparing the performance of heat pumps, it is best to avoid the word "efficiency", which has a very specific thermodynamic definition. The term [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input. Most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input.

According to the US [[EPA]], geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/choosing-and-installing-geothermal-heat-pumps|title=Choosing and Installing Geothermal Heat Pumps|website=Energy.gov|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COP for heat pumps range from 3.2 to 4.5 for air source heat pumps to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground source heat pumps.&lt;ref name="Lowe2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=David|last2=Madani|first2=Hatef|title=On heat pumps in smart grids: A review|journal=[[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]]|volume=70|issue=2|year=2017|pages=342–357|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.182|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895978/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used for heating a building with an outside temperature of, for example, 10&amp;nbsp;°C, a typical [[air-source heat pump]] (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical resistance [[heater]] has a COP of 1.0. That is, one [[joule]] of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat, while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge).  When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.

On the other hand, well designed [[ground-source heat pump]] (GSHP) systems benefit from the moderate temperature underground, as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/ThermalBanks.html Thermal Banks store heat between seasons | Seasonal Heat Storage | Rechargeable Heat Battery | Thermogeology | UTES | Solar recharge of heat batteries]&lt;/ref&gt; Their year-round COP is therefore normally in the range of 3.2 to 5.0.

When there is a high temperature differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to [[Carnot cycle|Carnot efficiency]] limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273&amp;nbsp;°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18&amp;nbsp;°C (0&amp;nbsp;°F) for air source heat pumps.

Also, as the heat pump takes heat out of the air, some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.

The design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.

Heat exchangers are expensive, requiring drilling for some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient, and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency. Heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment (not long-term savings) compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers, so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards. Electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;[[BSRIA]], "European energy legislation explained", www.bsria.co.uk, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooling mode, a heat pump's operating performance is described in the US as its [[energy efficiency ratio]] (EER) or [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER), and both measures have units of BTU/(h·W) (1 BTU/(h·W)&amp;nbsp;= 0.293 W/W). A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode, and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode. Actual performance varies, however, and depends on many factors such as installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, and maintenance.

As with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid, it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean. If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils, the efficiency of the unit (both in heating and cooling modes) will suffer.

Heat pumps are more ''effective'' for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.

The COP for a heat pump in a heating or cooling application, with steady-state operation, is:

COP_\text{heating} = \frac{\Delta Q_\text{hot}}{\Delta A} \leq \frac{T_\text{hot}}{T_\text{hot}-T_\text{cool}},
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
COP_\text{cooling} = \frac{\Delta Q_\text{cool}}{\Delta A} \leq \frac{T_\text{cool}}{T_\text{hot}-T_\text{cool}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_\text{cool}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat extracted from a cold reservoir at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{cool}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat delivered to a hot reservoir at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta A&lt;/math&gt; is the compressor's dissipated work.
* All temperatures are absolute temperatures usually measured in [[kelvin]]s or degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]].

=== Coefficient of performance and lift ===
The coefficient of performance (COP) increases as the temperature difference, or "lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g. underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g. the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures, reducing the COP that can be attained, and affecting the choice of heat pump technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

One observation is that while current "best practice" heat pumps (ground source system, operating between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 35&amp;nbsp;°C) have a typical COP around 4, no better than 5, the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental [[Carnot cycle]] limits. This means that in the coming decades, the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double. Cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better [[gas compressor]], fitting HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows, and solving internal [[lubrication]] problems resulting from slower gas flow.

Depending on the working fluid, the expansion stage can be important also. Work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power.  (An evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole, but an ideal gas is not.)

==Types==

The two main types of heat pumps are [[Gas compression|compression]] and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or burnable fuels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_warmtepomp.pdf Warmtepompen voor woningverwarming brochure] 9-10-2013&lt;/ref&gt; An absorption heat pump may be fueled by [[natural gas]] or [[LP gas]], for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed, may average only 1.5, that is better than a natural gas or LP gas furnace, which can only approach 1.

==Heat sources and sinks==
By definition, all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated. Most commonly, heat pumps draw heat from the air (outside or inside air) or from the ground ([[groundwater]] or [[soil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/folder_warmtepomp.pdf |title=Heat pumps sources including groundwater, soil, outside and inside air) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007174118/http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/folder_warmtepomp.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat drawn from ground-sourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat, and it should not be confused with direct [[geothermal heating]], though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground. True geothermal heat, when used for heating, requires a circulation pump but no heat pump, since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated, so the technology relies only upon simple [[heat convection]].

Other heat sources for heat pumps include water; nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used, and sometimes domestic waste water (via [[drain water heat recovery]]) which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures (though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated).

A number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/pdfs/26161b.pdf|title=Homeowners using heat pump systems|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|date=September 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131222926/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/pdfs/26161b.pdf|archivedate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air source heat pump===
{{Main|Air source heat pumps}}
* Air source heat pump (extracts heat from outside air)
** Air–air heat pump (transfers heat to inside air)
** Air–water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)

Air-air heat pumps, that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air, are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to [[air conditioner]]s operating in reverse. Air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, [[floor heating]] being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.

Air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.

The heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps (and hence their energy efficiency) still declines dramatically as the temperature drops, but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps, as shown in the following table (temperatures are approximate and may vary by manufacturer and model):

{| class="wikitable"

===Ground-source heat pump===
{{Main|Ground-source heat pump}}
* Ground source heat pump (extracts heat from the ground or similar sources)
** Ground–air heat pump (transfers heat to inside air)
*** Soil–air heat pump (soil as a source of heat)
*** Rock–air heat pump (rock as a source of heat)
*** Water–air heat pump (body of water as a source of heat, can be [[groundwater]], [[lake]], [[river]] etc.)
** Ground–water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)
*** Soil–water heat pump (ground as a source of heat)
*** Rock–water heat pump (rock as a source of heat)
*** Water–water heat pump (body of water as a source of heat)

Ground-source heat pumps, also called geothermal heat pumps, typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps.  This is because they draw heat from the ground or [[groundwater]] which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet (9 m).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130530033808/http://www.geo4va.vt.edu/A1/A1.htm Earth Temperature and Site Geology]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the temperature differential is lower, leading to higher efficiency.  Well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have COPs of 4.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydro.mb.ca/regulatory_affairs/electric/gra_2012_2013/Appendix_38.pdf Performance of Ground Source Heat Pumps in Manitoba] Rob Andrushuk, Phil Merkel, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the heating season, with lower seasonal COPs of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground. The tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install, due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid (water with a little antifreeze).

When compared, groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil. Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized. This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity, and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a "typical worst case" cold spell, or is simply undersized for the load.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516220648/http://geothermalhelp.com/sizing-a-geothermal-heating-system/ Geothermalhelp.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop. There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; one way is to make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/asphalt_solar_collector.html Asphalt Solar Collector Renewable Heat for IHT | Solar Collectors | Solar Recharge for GSHP | Pavement Solar Collectors | Road Solar Thermal Collector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized, by ensuring [[soil thermal properties]] and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/ Soil Thermal Conductivity Surveys]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhaust air heat pump===
{{Main|Exhaust air heat pump}}
* Exhaust air heat pump (extracts heat from the exhaust air of a building, requires [[Ventilation (architecture)|mechanical ventilation]])
** Exhaust air-air heat pump (transfers heat to intake air)
** Exhaust air-water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)

===Water source heat pump===
* Uses flowing water as source or sink for heat
* Single-pass vs. recirculation
** Single-pass — water source is a body of water or a stream, and utilized water is rejected at a different temperature without further use
** Recirculation
*** When cooling, closed-loop heat transfer medium to central [[cooling tower]] or [[chiller]] (typically in a building or industrial setting)
*** When heating, closed-loop heat transfer medium from central boilers generating heat from combustion or other sources

===Hybrid heat pump===
Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, depending on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, they use the ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up the temperature of the ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.

===Air/water-brine/water heat pump (hybrid heat pump)===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
The air/water-brine/water heat pump is a hybrid heat pump, developed in Rostock, Germany, that uses only renewable energy sources.  Unlike other hybrid systems, which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources, it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device. The air/water-brine/water heat pump has two evaporators — an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator — both connected to the heat pump cycle. This allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions (for example, air temperature).  The unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode — air or geothermal heat, or both together.  The process is controlled by a control unit, which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system.

The control unit comprises two controllers, one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation, in one device.  All components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system.  The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the air/water-brine/water heat pump a patent in 2008, under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump”. This hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage.  It trades and is marketed under the name ''ThermSelect''.  In the United Kingdom, ''ThermSelect'' won the 2013 Commercial Heating Product of the Year award of the HVR Awards for Excellence, organised by ''Heating and Ventilating Review'', an industry magazine.

=== Solar-assisted heat pump ===
{{see also|Solar-assisted heat pump}}
A solar-assisted heat pump is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].&lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | language = en | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.&lt;ref name = ref2&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

==Solid state heat pumps==

===Magnetic===
{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}
In 1881, the German physicist [[Emil Warburg]] put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature. Some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway, claiming to cut energy consumption by 40% compared to current domestic refrigerators&lt;!-- The article referenced is unclear what the reference "standard fridge" is --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Unlimited, December 2006 [http://environment.guardian.co.uk/energy/story/0,,1971818,00.html 'A cool new idea from British scientists: the magnetic fridge']&lt;/ref&gt; The process works as follows: Powdered [[gadolinium]] is moved into a magnetic field, heating the material by 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 9&amp;nbsp;°F). The heat is removed by a circulating fluid. The material is then moved out of the magnetic field, reducing its temperature below its starting temperature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Thermoelectric===
{{Main|Thermoelectric cooling|Thermoelectric materials}}
Solid state heat pumps using the [[thermoelectric effect]] have improved over time to the point where they are useful for certain refrigeration tasks.  Thermoelectric (Peltier) heat pumps are generally only around 10-15% as efficient as the ideal [[refrigerator]] ([[Carnot cycle]]), compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression cycle systems (reverse [[Rankine cycle|Rankine]] systems using compression/expansion);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-19259.pdf - The Prospects of Alternatives to Vapor Compression Technology for Space Cooling and Food Refrigeration Applications] DR Brown, N Fernandez, JA Dirks, TB Stout. [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; however, this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science.
A reason why this is popular is because it has a "long lifetime" as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants.

A '''hotbed''' is a biological term for an area of decaying [[organic matter]] that is warmer than its surroundings.  The heat gradient is generated by the [[decompose|decomposition]] of organic substituents within the pile by microorganism metabolization.

A hotbed covered with a small glass cover (also called a '''hotbox''') is used as a small version of a hothouse (heated [[greenhouse]]). Oftentimes, this bed is made of [[manure]] from animals such as [[horse]]s.  These animals pass undigested plant [[cellulose]] in their [[droppings]], creating a good environment for microorganisms to come and break down the cellulose and create a hotbed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hotbed|title=Definition of HOTBED|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some egg-laying animals, such as the [[brush turkey]], make or use hotbeds to [[Avian incubation|incubate]] their eggs.

By extension, the term ''hotbed'' is used metaphorically to describe an environment that is ideal for the growth or development of something, especially of something undesirable.

==Uses==
Water therapy may be restricted to use as [[aquatic therapy]], a form of [[physical therapy]], and as a cleansing agent. However, it is also used as a medium for delivery of heat and cold to the body, which has long been the basis for its application. Hydrotherapy involves a range of methods and techniques, many of which use water as a medium to facilitate thermoregulatory reactions for therapeutic benefit.

Hydrotherapy is used as an adjunct to therapy, including in nursing, where its use is now long established.&lt;ref name=KozierErb&amp;Olivieri/&gt;&lt;ref name=PughPughPugh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller&amp;Keane/&gt; It continues to be widely used for [[burn]] treatment,&lt;ref name=GruberEtAl1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=DavidsonEtAl2010/&gt; although shower-based hydrotherapy techniques have been increasingly used in preference to full-immersion methods,&lt;ref name=DavidsonEtAl2010/&gt; partly for the ease of cleaning the equipment and reducing infections due to contamination.&lt;ref name=RodeEtAl2009/&gt;  When removal of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] is necessary for the treatment of wounds, hydrotherapy which performs selective mechanical [[debridement]] can be used.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Physical Therapy Association |author1-link = American Physical Therapy Association |date = 15 September 2014 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Physical Therapy Association |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-physical-therapy-association/ |accessdate = 15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include directed wound irrigation and [[therapeutic irrigation]] with suction.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"/&gt;

==Technique==
The appliances and arrangements by means of which heat and cold are brought to bear are (a) packings, hot and cold, general and local, sweating and cooling; (b) hot air and steam baths; (c) general baths, of hot water and cold; (d) sitz (sitting), spinal, head and foot baths; (e) bandages (or compresses), wet and dry; also (f) fomentations and poultices, hot and cold, [[Wikt:sinapism|sinapisms]], [[Wikt:stupe|stupes]], rubbings and water potations, hot and cold.&lt;ref name=Thrash&amp;Thrash/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hydropathy8thed/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Hydrotherapy which involves submerging all or part of the body in water can involve several types of equipment:
* Full body immersion tanks (a "Hubbard tank" is a large size)
* Arm, hip, and leg whirlpool

Whirling water movement, provided by mechanical pumps, has been used in water tanks since at least the 1940s. Similar technologies have been marketed for recreational use under the terms "[[hot tub]]" or "spa".

In some cases baths with [[whirlpool]] water flow aren't used to manage wounds because a whirlpool will not selectively target the tissue to be removed and can damage all tissue.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"/&gt; Whirlpools also create an unwanted risk of bacterial infection, can damage fragile body tissue, and in the case of treating arms and legs, bring risk of [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] from [[edema]].&lt;ref name="APTAfive"/&gt;

==History==
The therapeutic use of water has been recorded in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations.&lt;ref name= Metcalfe1898/&gt;&lt;ref name= Floyer /&gt;&lt;ref name= Metcalfe1877/&gt;&lt;ref name= ErasmusWilson1861/&gt;&lt;ref name= Baths1911/&gt;  Egyptian royalty bathed with [[essential oil]]s and flowers, while Romans had communal public baths for their citizens. [[Hippocrates]] prescribed bathing in spring water for sickness. Other cultures noted for a long history of hydrotherapy include China and Japan,&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1877/&gt; the latter being centred primarily around Japanese hot springs or “[[onsen]]”. Many such histories predate the Roman [[thermae]].

===Modern revival===
[[File:James Currie b1756.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]], who, according to [[Captain R. T. Claridge]] discovered "...the merit of settling the use of cold water...[and who established] the scientific base of Hydropathy"]]
An important note on the growth of hydropathy is that it started to become prominent as traditional medical practice was becoming more professional in terms of how doctors operated, alienating many patients, as they felt that the medical encounter was becoming less personalized, and the more scientific the medical language became, the less that they could easily understand. Hydropathy was a return to a treatment that was spiritual and natural, making it more palatable to those who felt uncomfortable with the direction that traditional medicine was taking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Ian|year=2012|title=Keep Taking the Liquids|url=|journal=Today's History|volume=|pages=44–46|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea behind hydropathy during the 1800s was to be able to induce something called a crisis. The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise to the surface of the skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to cold water in different ways.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great American Water Cure Craze: A History of Hydropathy in the United States|last=Weiss, Kemble|first=Harry B., Howard R.|publisher=The Past Times Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Trenton, New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two English works on the medical uses of water were published in the 18th century that inaugurated the new fashion for hydrotherapy. One of these was by Sir [[John Floyer (physician)|John Floyer]], a physician of [[Lichfield]], who, struck by the remedial use of certain springs by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the history of cold bathing and published a book on the subject in 1702.&lt;ref name="Floyer" /&gt; The book ran through six editions within a few years and the translation of this book into German was largely drawn upon by Dr [[J. S. Hahn]] of Silesia as the basis for his book called ''On the Healing Virtues of Cold Water, Inwardly and Outwardly Applied, as Proved by Experience'', published in 1738.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe1898pp5-6" /&gt;

The other work was a 1797 publication by Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] of [[Liverpool]] on the use of hot and cold water in the treatment of fever and other illness, with a fourth edition published in 1805, not long before his death.&lt;ref name=Currie1805/&gt;  It was also translated into German by Michaelis (1801) and [[Dietrich Hermann Hegewisch|Hegewisch]] (1807). It was highly popular and first placed the subject on a scientific basis. Hahn's writings had meanwhile created much enthusiasm among his countrymen, societies having been formed everywhere to promote the medicinal and dietetic use of water; and in 1804 Professor E.F.C. Oertel of [[Ansbach|Anspach]] republished them and quickened the popular movement by unqualified commendation of water drinking as a remedy for all diseases.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1898citingOertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hydropathy8thedcitingOertel/&gt;

[[File:Vincenz Priessnitz, supporter of hydrotherapy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vincenz Priessnitz]], who initiated the popular revival of hydrotherapy at Gräfenberg]]

==== Vincent Preissnitz (1799–1851) ====
Vincent Preissnitz was the son of a peasant farmer who, as a young child, observed a wounded deer bathing a wound in a pond near his home. Over the course of several days, he would see this deer return and eventually the wound was healed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later as a teenager, Preissnitz was attending to a horse cart, when the cart ran him over, breaking three of his ribs. A physician told him that they would never heal. Preissnitz decided to try his own hand at healing himself, and wrapped his wounds with damp bandages. By daily changing his bandages and drinking large quantities of water, after about a year, his broken ribs had been cured.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Preissnitz quickly gained fame in his hometown and became the consulted physician.

Later in life, Preissnitz became the head of a hydropathy clinic in Gräfenberg in 1826. He was extremely successful and by 1840, he had 1600 patients in his clinic including many fellow physicians, as well as important political figures such as nobles and prominent military officials. Treatment length at Preissnitz's clinic varied. Much of his theory was about inducing the above mentioned crisis, which could happen quickly, or could occur after three to four years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In accordance with the simplistic nature of hydropathy, a large part of the treatment was based on living a simple lifestyle. These lifestyle adjustments included dietary changes such as eating only very coarse food, such as jerky and bread, and of course drinking large quantities of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Preissnitz's treatments also included a great deal of less strenuous exercise, mostly including walking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ultimately, Preissnitz's clinic was extremely successful, and he gained fame across the western world. His practice even influenced the hydropathy that took root overseas in America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Sebastian Kneipp (1821–1897) ====
Sebastian Kneipp was born in Germany and he considered his own role in hydropathy to be that of continuing Preissnitz's work. Kneipp's own practice of hydropathy was even gentler than the norm. He believed that typical hydropathic practices deployed were "too violent or too frequent" and he expressed concern that such techniques would cause emotional or physical trauma to the patient. Kneipp's practice was more all encompassing than Preissnitz's, and his practice involved not only curing the patients' physical woes, but emotional and mental as well. 

Kneipp introduced four additional principles to the therapy: medicinal herbs, [[massages]], balanced nutrition, and "regulative therapy to seek inner balance".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locher, Pforr|first=Cornelia, Christof|year=2014|title=The Legacy of Sebastian Kneipp: Linking Wellness, Naturopathic, and Allopathic Medicine|url=|journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|volume=20|pages=521–526|via=|doi=10.1089/acm.2013.0423}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kneipp had a very simple view of an already simple practice. For him, hydropathy's primary goals were strengthening the constitution and removing poisons and toxins in the body. These basic interpretations of how hydropathy worked hinted at his complete lack of medical training. Kneipp did have, however, a very successful medical practice in spite of, perhaps even because of, his lack of medical training. As mentioned above, some patients were beginning to feel uncomfortable with traditional doctors because of the elitism of the medical profession. The new terms and techniques that doctors were using were difficult for the average person to understand. Having no formal training, all of his instructions and published works are described in easy to understand language and would have seemed very appealing to a patient who was displeased with the direction traditional medicine was taking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A significant factor in the popular revival of hydrotherapy was that it could be practised relatively cheaply at home. The growth of hydrotherapy (or 'hydropathy' to use the name of the time), was thus partly derived from two interacting spheres: "the hydro and the home".&lt;ref name=Marland&amp;Adams2009/&gt;

Hydrotherapy as a formal medical tool dates from about 1829 when [[Vincenz Priessnitz]] (1799–1851), a farmer of [[Lázně Jeseník|Gräfenberg]] in [[Silesia]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], began his public career in the paternal homestead, extended so as to accommodate the increasing numbers attracted by the fame of his cures.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

At Gräfenberg, to which the fame of Priessnitz drew people of every rank and many countries, medical men were conspicuous by their numbers, some being attracted by curiosity, others by the desire of knowledge, but the majority by the hope of cure for ailments which had as yet proved incurable. Many records of experiences at Gräfenberg were published, all more or less favorable to the claims of Priessnitz, and some enthusiastic in their estimate of his genius and penetration.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Spread of hydrotherapy===
[[File:Hydropathic applications at Graefenberg, per Claridge's Hydropathy book.jpg|thumb|upright|Hydropathic applications according to Claridge's Hydropathy book.]]
[[Captain R. T. Claridge]] was responsible for introducing and promoting hydropathy in Britain, first in London in 1842, then with lecture tours in Ireland and Scotland in 1843. His 10-week tour in Ireland included Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Dublin and Belfast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Ennis Turkish Baths 1869–1878|url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/ennis_turkish_baths_article.htm|last=Beirne|first=Peter|via=County Cork Library|pages= 12-7, see note 11|accessdate=30 October 2009 |work= The Other Clare |year= 2008 |volume= 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; over June, July and August 1843, with two subsequent lectures in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Anon. |year=1843|title=Hydropathy, or the Cold Water Cure|series=The Substance of Two Lectures, delivered by Captain Claridge, F.S.A., at the Queens Concert Rooms, Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sMoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22Capt.+Claridge%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Capt.%20Claridge%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other Englishmen preceded Claridge to Graefenberg, although not many. One of these was Dr. James Wilson, who himself, along with [[James Manby Gully|Dr James Manby Gully]], established and operated a water cure establishment at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] in 1842.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Water-Cure.

The fame of the water-cure establishment grew, and Gully and Wilson became well-known national figures. Two more clinics were opened at Malvern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malvernhealth.org.uk/about.html |title=History of Water Cures at Malvern |website= malvernhealth.org.uk |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009073345/http://www.malvernhealth.org.uk/about.html |archivedate=9 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous patients included [[Charles Darwin]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Lord Tennyson]] and [[Samuel Wilberforce]].&lt;ref name="swinton"/&gt; With his fame he also attracted criticism:
[[Sir Charles Hastings]], a physician and founder of the [[British Medical Association]], was a forthright critic of hydropathy, and Gully in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bradley |first1= J |last2= Depree |first2= M |title= A shadow of orthodoxy? An epistemology of British hydropathy, 1840–1858 |work= Medical History |year= 2003 |volume= 47 |pages= 173–94 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300056702|pmc= 1044596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the 1840s, hydropathics were established across Britain. Initially, many of these were small institutions, catering to at most dozens of patients. By the later nineteenth century the typical hydropathic establishment had evolved into a more substantial undertaking, with thousands of patients treated annually for weeks at a time in a large purpose-built building with lavish facilities – baths, recreation rooms and the like – under the supervision of fully trained and qualified medical practitioners and staff.&lt;ref name=BradleyDupreeDurie429/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Germany, France and America, and in [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], England, hydropathic establishments multiplied with great rapidity. Antagonism ran high between the old practice and the new. Unsparing condemnation was heaped by each on the other; and a legal prosecution, leading to a [[royal commission]] of inquiry, served but to make Priessnitz and his system stand higher in public estimation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Increasing popularity soon diminished caution whether the new method would help minor ailments and be of benefit to the more seriously injured. Hydropathists occupied themselves mainly with studying chronic invalids well able to bear a rigorous regimen and the severities of unrestricted crisis. The need of a radical adaptation to the former class was first adequately recognized by [[John Smedley (industrialist)|John Smedley]], a manufacturer of [[Derbyshire]], who, impressed in his own person with the severities as well as the benefits of the cold water cure, practised among his workpeople a milder form of hydropathy, and began about 1852 a new era in its history, founding at [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] a counterpart of the establishment at Gräfenberg.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Ernst Brand]] (1827–1897) of Berlin, Raljen and [[Theodor von Jürgensen]] of Kiel, and [[Carl von Liebermeister|Karl Liebermeister]] of Basel, between 1860 and 1870, employed the cooling bath in abdominal [[typhus]] with striking results, and led to its introduction to England by Dr [[Wilson Fox]]. In the [[Franco-German War]] the cooling bath was largely employed, in conjunction frequently with [[quinine]]; and it was used in the treatment of [[hyperpyrexia]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Hot baths===
[[File:Gerome baigneuses.jpg|thumb|upright|''Baigneuses'', oil on canvas, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824-1904)]]
Hydrotherapy, especially as promoted during the height of its Victorian revival, has often been associated with the use of cold water, as evidenced by many titles from that era. However, not all therapists limited their practice of hydrotherapy to cold water, even during the height of this popular revival.&lt;ref name=Gully1856/&gt;

The specific use of heat was however often associated with the [[Turkish bath]]. This was introduced by [[David Urquhart]] into England on his return from the East in the 1850s,&lt;ref name="DNBv58"/&gt; and ardently adopted by [[Richard Barter]].&lt;ref name=ShifrinDrCurtinsIreland/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShifrinStAnnsIreland/&gt; The Turkish bath became a public institution, and, with the morning tub and the general practice of water drinking, is the most noteworthy of the many contributions by hydropathy to public health.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Spread to the United States===
The first U.S. hydropathic facilities were established by Joel Shew&lt;ref name="AMB"&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Shew, Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and R. T. Trall in the 1840s.&lt;ref name=Wharton2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Appletonsbiog1888V5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Iacobbo2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=TrallHygienicSystem1956/&gt; Dr Charles Munde also established early hydrotherapy facilities in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1898p170/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mundegutenbergorg/&gt;&lt;ref name=MundeInternetArchivepvimissing/&gt;&lt;ref name=MundeInternetArchivepvipresent/&gt; Trall also co-edited the ''Water Cure Journal''.&lt;ref name=Horsell&amp;Trall/&gt;

By 1850, it was said that "there are probably more than one hundred" facilities, along with numerous books and periodicals, including the New York ''Water Cure Journal'', which had "attained an extent of circulation equalled by few monthlies in the world".&lt;ref name=Horsell&amp;Trall/&gt;  By 1855, there were attempts by some to weigh the evidence of treatments in vogue at that time.&lt;ref name=AlvaCurtis1855/&gt;

Following the introduction of hydrotherapy to the U.S., [[John Harvey Kellogg]] employed it at [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]], which opened in 1866, where he strove to improve the scientific foundation for hydrotherapy.&lt;ref name=Kellog1908/&gt; Other notable hydropathic centers of the era included the Cleveland Water Cure Establishment, founded in 1848, which operated successfully for two decades, before being sold to an organization which transformed it into an orphanage.&lt;ref name=ClevelandWaterCure/&gt;&lt;ref name=ClevelandJewishOrphanage/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At its height, there were over 200 water-cure establishments in the United States, most located in the northeast. Few of these lasted into the postbellum years, although some survived into the 20th century including institutions in Scott (Cortland County), Elmira, [[Clifton Springs Sanitarium|Clifton Springs]] and Dansville. While none were located in Jefferson County, the Oswego Water Cure operated in the city of [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]].&lt;ref name=SamaritanMedCenter/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
In November 1881, the ''British Medical Journal'' noted that hydropathy was a specific instance, or "particular case", of general principles of thermodynamics. That is, "the application of heat and cold in general", as it applies to physiology, mediated by hydropathy.&lt;ref name=BMJCongress/&gt; In 1883, another writer stated "Not, be it observed, that hydropathy is a water treatment after all, but that water is the medium for the application of heat and cold to the body".&lt;ref name=Crofts/&gt;

Hydrotherapy was used to treat people with [[mental illness]] in the 19th and 20th centuries&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Oybg_APowMC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Lytton+Malvern&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y67W8WkuTk&amp;sig=eEzoHdQgCfKbIVr1gqxtLNH3j-s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v7GdTc2yLKGG0QGak8nWBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Lytton%20Malvern&amp;f=false Edward Shorter, ''A history of psychiatry: from the era of the asylum to the age of Prozac'', Wiley, 1997. p.120.]&lt;/ref&gt; and before World War II, various forms of hydrotherapy were used to treat [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name=Stedman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baruch1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinsdale1910/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abbott1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=Urse1937/&gt; The basic text of the [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] fellowship, ''Alcoholics Anonymous'', reports that A.A. co-founder [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]] was treated by hydrotherapy for his alcoholism in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=AA2001/&gt;

===Recent techniques===
A subset of [[cryotherapy]] involves cold water immersion or ice baths, used by physical therapists, sports medicine facilities and rehab clinics. Proponents assert that it results in improved return of blood flow and byproducts of cellular breakdown to the lymphatic system and more efficient recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-241-285--12810-0,00.html |title=The Benefits of Ice Baths for Runners - Runner's World |date=1 August 2008 |work=Runner's World &amp; Running Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823020734/http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0%2C7120%2Cs6-241-285--12810-0%2C00.html |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternating the temperatures, either in a shower or complementary tanks, combines the use of hot and cold in the same session. Proponents claim improvement in circulatory system and lymphatic drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/lymphoma-000103.htm|title=Lymphoma|work=University of Maryland Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental evidence suggests that contrast hydrotherapy helps to reduce injury in the acute stages by stimulating blood flow and reducing swelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1466853X03001226|title=Alternating hot and cold water immersion for athlete recovery: a review | doi=10.1016/j.ptsp.2003.10.002|volume=5|pages=26–32|journal=Physical Therapy in Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
The growth of hydrotherapy, and various forms of hydropathic establishments, resulted in a form of tourism, both in the UK,&lt;ref name="Durie2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BradleyDupreeDurie426-437/&gt; and in Europe. At least one book listed English, Scottish, Irish and European establishments suitable for each specific malady,&lt;ref name=Linn1894/&gt; while another focused primarily on German spas and hydropathic establishments, but including other areas.&lt;ref name=Sutro1865/&gt;  While many bathing establishments were open all year round, doctors advised patients not to go before May, "nor to remain after October. English visitors rather prefer cold weather, and they often arrive for the baths in May, and return again in September. Americans come during the whole season, but prefer summer. The most fashionable and crowded time is during July and August".&lt;ref name=Linn1894p7/&gt; In Europe, interest in various forms of hydrotherapy and spa tourism continued unabated through the 19th century and into the 20th century,&lt;ref name=BMJWaterCureGermany/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1957/&gt; where "in France, Italy and Germany, several million people spend time each year at a spa."&lt;ref name=Weisz1995/&gt; In 1891, when [[Mark Twain]] toured Europe and discovered that a bath of spring water at [[Aix-les-Bains]] soothed his rheumatism, he described the experience as "so enjoyable that if I hadn't had a disease I would have borrowed one just to have a pretext for going on".&lt;ref name=Time1957/&gt;

This was not the first time such forms of spa tourism had been popular in Europe and the U.K. Indeed,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
in Europe, the application of water in the treatment of fevers and other maladies had, since the seventeenth century, been consistently promoted by a number of medical writers. In the eighteenth century, taking to the waters became a fashionable pastime for the wealthy classes who decamped to resorts around Britain and Europe to cure the ills of over-consumption. In the main, treatment in the heyday of the British spa consisted of sense and sociability: promenading, bathing, and the repetitive quaffing of foul-tasting mineral waters.&lt;ref name=BradleyDupreeDurie427/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A hydropathic establishment is a place where people receive hydropathic treatment. They are commonly built in [[spa town]]s, where [[mineral water|mineral-rich]] or [[hot spring|hot water]] occurs naturally.

Several hydropathic institutions wholly transferred their operations away from therapeutic purposes to become tourist [[hotels]] in the late 20th century whilst retaining the name 'Hydro'.

'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} While the second sense, of water as a form of torture is documented back to at least the 15th century,&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; the first use of the term ''water cure'' as a torture is indirectly dated to around 1898, by U.S. soldiers in the Spanish–American War,&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;  after the term had been introduced to America in the mid-19th century in the therapeutic sense, which was in widespread use.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1898/&gt; Indeed, while the torture sense of ''water cure'' was by 1900–1902 established in the American army,&lt;ref name=Kramer2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=lens/&gt; with a conscious sense of irony,&lt;ref name=Sturtz1907/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturtzscan/&gt; this sense was not in widespread use. ''Webster's'' 1913 dictionary cited only the therapeutic sense, ''water cure'' being synonymous with ''hydropathy'',&lt;ref name=Watercuredef1913/&gt; the term by which hydrotherapy was known in the 19th century and early 20th century.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1898/&gt;

The late 19th century expropriation of the term ''water cure'', already in use in the therapeutic sense, to denote the polar opposite of therapy, namely torture, has the hallmark of arising in the sense of irony. This would be in keeping with some of the reactions to water cure therapy and its promotion, which included not only criticism, but also parody and satire.&lt;ref name=HoodSatiricalreview/&gt;&lt;ref name=LarksShakespeareWaterCure/&gt;

{{update|date=November 2014}}
An '''inertial fusion power plant''' is intended to produce electric power by use of [[inertial confinement fusion]] techniques on an industrial scale. This type of power plant is still in a research phase.

Two established options for possible medium-term implementation of fusion energy production are [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]], being used in the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor|ITER]] international project, and [[laser]]-based inertial confinement, as used in the French [[Laser Mégajoule]] and in the American [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]].  [[Inertial confinement fusion]] ('''ICF'''), including [[heavy-ion inertial fusion]] ('''HIF'''), has been proposed as a possible additional means of implementing a fusion power plant.

== Overall principles of an Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) reactor ==
The operation of an IFE reactor is in some ways analogous to the operation of the [[Four-stroke engine|four stroke cycle]] of a [[internal combustion engine|petrol engine]]:
* intake of the fusion fuel (microcapsule) into the reactor chamber;
* compression of the microcapsule in order to initiate the fusion reactions;
* explosion of the plasma created during the compression stroke, leading to the release of fusion energy;
* exhaust of the reaction residue, which will be treated afterwards to extract all the reusable elements, mainly tritium.

To allow such an operation, an inertial fusion reactor is made of several subsets:
[[Image:Nif hohlraum.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Mockup of a golden hohlraum used in laser inertial confinement.]]
* the injection system, which delivers to the reaction chamber the fusion fuel capsules, and at the same time the possible devices necessary to initiate fusion:
** the container (''[[hohlraum]]''), intended to take the fuel capsule to a uniform very high temperature, mainly for laser and [[ion beam]] confinement techniques;
** the "wires array" and its power transmission line, for [[z-pinch]] confinement technique;
* the "driver" used to compress the fusion fuel capsules which, depending on the technique, can be [[laser]]s, an ion beam accelerator or a z-pinch device;
* the reaction chamber, built upon an external wall made of metal, or an internal blanket intended to protect the external wall from the fusion shockwave and radiation, to get the emitted energy, and to produce the tritium fuel;
* the system intended to process reaction products and debris.

{{Further2|An example of a planned IFE plant can be seen in the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility]] article}}

== IFE projects == &lt;!--linked from [[Template:Fusion methods]]--&gt;
{{Update|section|date=October 2014}}
Several projects of inertial fusion power plants have been proposed, including power production plans based on the following experimental devices, either in operation or under construction:
* in the [[United States]], the [[National Ignition Facility]] ([[laser confinement]]) and [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]] (z-pinch confinement) experiments
* in [[France]], the [[Megajoule laser]] experiment
* in [[Japan]] ([[Osaka]] University), the KONGOH experiment (laser confinement)
Only the US and French projects are based on z-pinch confinement; others are based on laser confinement techniques.

Livermore's IFE (LIFE) project was cancelled in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of June 2006, Megajoule and NIF lasers were not yet in complete service. Inertial confinement and laser confinement fusion experiments had not gone beyond the first phase. Around 2010, NIF and Megajoule were planned for completion.

==Project phases compared to magnetic confinement==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=March 2018}}
In the magnetic confinement field, the 2nd phase corresponds to the objectives of ITER, the 3rd to these of its follower DEMO, in 20 to 30 years, and the 4th to those of a possible PROTO, in 40 to 50 years. The various phases of such a project are the following:
* Burning demonstration: reproducible achievement of energy release
* High gain demonstration: experimental demonstration of the feasibility of a reactor with a sufficient energy gain
* Industrial demonstration: validation of the various technical options, and of the whole data needed to define a commercial reactor
* Commercial demonstration: demonstration of the reactor ability to work over a long period, while maintaining the requirements for safety, liability and cost.

The Devils Marbles are of great cultural and spiritual significance to the traditional [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] owners (Ree) of the land, and the reserve protects one of the oldest religious sites in the world as well as the natural rock formations found there. ''Karlu Karlu'' is the local Aboriginal term for both the rock features and the surrounding area. The Aboriginal term translates as ''round boulders'' and refers to the large boulders found mainly in the western side of the reserve.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Intro" /&gt; The origin of the English name for the same boulders is the following quote:

::''This is the Devil’s country; he’s even emptied his bag of marbles around the place!'' - [[John Ross (explorer)|John Ross]], [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]] expedition, 1870&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Intro" /&gt;

The area was originally named ''Devils Marbles Reserve'' in October 1961. The name was changed to ''Devil's Marbles Conservation Reserve'' on 21 September 1979 under the ''Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act''.&lt;ref name=register /&gt; In 1982, almost the entire reserve was registered as a sacred site by the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Intro" /&gt;

Ownership of Karlu Karlu/Devils Marbles was officially passed from the Parks and Wildlife Service of the Northern Territory back to the Traditional Owners at a ceremony held on the reserve in October 2008. The reserve is now leased back to the Parks Service under a 99-year lease and the site is jointly managed by rangers and Traditional Owners. Visitor access has not been affected.&lt;ref name=website /&gt; On 6 July 2011, the name ''Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve'' was assigned, corresponding with the joint management structure.&lt;ref name=register /&gt;

==Features==

The ''Devils Marbles'' are large [[granite|granitic]] boulders that form the exposed top layer of an extensive and mostly underground granite formation. The natural processes of [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] have created the various shapes of the boulders. Some of the boulders are naturally but precariously [[balancing rock|balanced]] atop one another or on larger rock formations, while others have been split cleanly down the middle by natural forces. The boulders are situated in a wide and shallow desert valley, and are found in scattered groups mainly in the western side of the reserve. A short access road leads directly into the boulder fields from the [[Stuart Highway]].&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Intro" /&gt;

Being one of the most widely recognised symbols of Australia’s outback, the Devils Marbles are also one of the most visited reserves in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Foreword" /&gt; The Parks and Wildlife Service recorded 96,172 visitors in 2007.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Visitors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve Joint Management Plan - Managing Visitors|url=http://parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/10096/devils_marbles_JMplan_feb09_managingvisitor.pdf|publisher=Parks and Wildlife Service of the Northern Territory (PDF file linked from "parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/manage/plans/tennant")|date=1 Feb 2009|accessdate=29 Jan 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516093234/http://parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/10096/devils_marbles_JMplan_feb09_managingvisitor.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visitation count increased to 137,500 by 2012.&lt;ref name="Visitors_by_year" /&gt; The peak season is in the cooler months from May to August.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Visitors" /&gt; The reserve is one of the main tourist attractions in the [[Barkly Tableland|Barkly region]] since it is easily seen and accessed just off the Stuart Highway, the major north/south road connecting [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and Alice Springs, and points further south.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Visitors" /&gt;

The Devils Marbles are accessible all year round with a network of pathways, information boards and a basic camping area. Rangers offer a program of live events at the site as part of their ''Territory Parks Alive'' program between May and September each year.&lt;ref name=website /&gt;

==Aboriginal significance==
[[Image:Devils Marbles.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of balanced boulders]]
Karlu Karlu are culturally and spiritually significant objects of the local Aboriginal people. Most of the conservation reserve is a Registered Sacred Site, protected under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act. Although Karlu Karlu is within country originally belonging to the [[Alyawarre]] people, all of the other local Aboriginal groups, which include the [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]], [[Warumungu people|Warumungu]] and [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] people, also have spiritual connections and responsibilities for the area.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Intro" /&gt;

Accounts of local Aboriginal people believing the boulders to be eggs of the mythical Rainbow Serpent are incorrect.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Visitors" /&gt; In reality, a number of traditional [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]] stories (none of which are about serpents) have Karlu Karlu as their setting, hence its great importance as a sacred site. These stories are alive and well and are passed on from generation to generation of Traditional Owners. Only a handful of stories are considered suitable to tell to uninitiated visitors.

One of the main Dreaming stories for the area which can be told to the public relates to how Karlu Karlu was created. This tradition tells of ''Arrange'', the Devil Man, who came from a hill nearby and travelled through the area. Whilst walking along, Arrange made a hair-string belt which is a kind of traditional adornment worn only by initiated men. As he was twirling the hair to make strings, he dropped clusters of hair on the ground.

The clusters turned into the big red boulders at Karlu Karlu that have become so famous today. On his way back to his hill, Arrange spat on the ground. His spit turned into the granite boulders in the central part of the reserve. Arrange finally returned to his place of origin, a hill called ''Ayleparrarntenhe'' where he remains today.&lt;ref name="DM_JMP_Intro" /&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Karlu Karlu 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Suspended boulder]]
The Devils Marbles constitute a [[erosion|degraded]] [[nubbin (landform)|nubbin]].&lt;ref name=Twidale1995&gt;{{cite journal |last=Twidale |first=C.R.|author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |date=1995 |title=Bornhardts, Boulders and Inselbergs |url= |journal=Cadernos do Laboratorio Xeolóxico de Laxe |publisher= |volume=20 |issue= |pages=347–380 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation is made of [[granite]] and are part of the top layer of a formation which penetrates the ground from below, like little geological islands in the [[desert]], surrounded by large amounts of [[sandstone]]. The granite was formed millions of years ago as a result of the hardening of [[magma]] within the Earth's crust. Thick layers of sandstone on top of the granite exerted extreme downward pressure on the granite. After some time, [[Tectonics|tectonic]] forces caused folding of the Earth's crust in the area, which lifted the granite and fractured the sandstone, allowing the granite to come closer to the surface. As the pressure diminished, the granite expanded causing cracks to form, and then the larger formations began to separate into big, square blocks.&lt;ref name=form&gt;{{cite web|title=Weathering: Types of Weathering|url=http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~pgore/geology/geo101/weather.htm|publisher=Georgia Perimeter College/Pamela J. W. Gore|date=5 Feb 2002|accessdate=29 Jan 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510224332/http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~pgore/geology/geo101/weather.htm|archivedate=2013-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next phase of the formation of the Marbles started when the blocks were exposed to [[water]].&lt;ref name=form /&gt; The surface of the blocks began to decay under the influence of the water and a layer of loose material surrounded the individual blocks. When the blocks came to the surface completely, the loose material was [[erosion|eroded]] away by water and wind.

The rounding of the granite blocks is a result of [[Weathering#Biogeochemical weathering|chemical]] and [[Weathering#Physical weathering|physical (also called mechanical) weathering]].&lt;ref name=form /&gt; Chemical processes cause the surface of the blocks to expand and contract, resulting in thin layers of rock coming off the boulder in a process called [[exfoliation joint|exfoliation]]. This process rounds the granite block because the chemical processes have more effect on areas with edges. The rock begins to look like it is made of layers like an [[onion]]. Only the outer few centimetres are affected by chemical weathering in a process called [[spheroidal weathering]].

The boulders are affected more deeply by the extreme temperature differences between day and night in the arid desert region where the reserve is located. During daylight hours the rocks expand slightly and after nightfall they contract slightly, repeating the process every 24 hours. These repeated cycles of expansion and contraction, called [[Weathering#Thermal stress|thermal stress weathering]], create cracks which sometimes go so deep that the boulder is completely split in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paradise, T. R.|doi=10.1130/0-8137-2390-6.39|title=Petra revisited: An examination of sandstone weathering research in Petra, Jordan in Special Paper 390: Stone Decay in the Architectural Environment|year=2005|isbn=0-8137-2390-6|volume=390|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Image:Flynn grave Alice Springs.jpg|thumb|right|John Flynn's Memorial with the replacement boulder, Alice Springs, 2002]]
One of the boulders was removed from the reserve in 1952 and taken to [[Alice Springs]] to form a memorial to [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]], the founder of the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|Royal Flying Doctor Service]]. The boulder was chosen as a symbol of his link to the [[outback]], but it became the source of a lengthy controversy. The boulder had unwittingly been removed from a sacred site of the Aboriginal women of the area. Eventually, after more than 45 years of negotiations, a boulder swap was arranged and the sacred boulder was removed from the grave and returned to its original place on 4 September 1999. The grave is now marked with a similar but non-sacred boulder donated by the [[Aranda people|Arrernte]] people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/johnflynnm.htm John Flynn Memorial Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''light leak''' is a hole or gap in the body of a camera, or other optical instrument, where light is able to "leak" into the normally light-tight chamber, [[exposure (photography)|exposing]] the film or sensor with extra light. This light is [[diffuse]], although parts within the camera may cast shadows or reflect it in a particular way. For most purposes this is considered a problem. Within the [[lomography]] movement it is seen as a positive effect, giving photos character.

One frequent source of light leaks in [[135 film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] cameras is around the film door due to degrading foam. Replacing the foam is a simple matter. [[Medium format (film)|Medium format]] [[system camera]]s or [[large format (photography)|large format]] cameras may have leaks between their various interchangeable parts or in old leather [[bellows]]. [[Electrical tape]] is often used to repair light leaks in these cases.

A light leak, considered as a problem, is a kind of [[stray light]]. It is possible to have a "virtual" light leak in spectral regions, like portions of the [[Infrared|IR]] spectrum at room temperature, where surfaces inside the system emit significant amounts of radiation.

They can be created and emulated in [[digital photography]] and videography, either during production or after. In the first instance, the photographer or videographer removes the camera lens while photographing or recording and overloads the [[image sensor]]. This is usually used to create leaks which can then be overlaid onto another image or video.&lt;ref name="Maroon Peak Media video"&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=April 13, 2016|title=How to make film light leaks with your digital camera.|medium=Internet video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA2KG0uYvPE|access-date=June 15, 2017||publisher=Maroon Peak Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or they can be created entirely digitally, with common photo-editing software packages such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], and overlaid into the image.&lt;ref name="Photoshop book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galer|first1=Mark|last2=Andrews|first2=Philip|title=Photoshop CS5: Essential Skills : a Guide to Creative Image Editing|date=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780240522142|page=438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5Gac7fUoOEC&amp;pg=PA438|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lignum nephriticum''''' ([[Latin]] for "kidney wood") is a [[traditional medicine|traditional]] [[diuretic]] that was derived from the [[wood]] of two [[tree]] [[species]], the narra (''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]'') and the Mexican kidneywood (''[[Eysenhardtia polystachya ]]''). The wood is capable of turning the color of water it comes in contact with into beautiful opalescent hues that change depending on light and angle, the earliest known record of the phenomenon of [[fluorescence]]. Due to this strange property, it became well known in [[Europe]] from the 16th to the early 18th-century [[Europe]]. Cups made from ''lignum nephriticum'' were given as gifts to [[Royal family|royalty]].&lt;ref name="garrison"/&gt; Water drunk from such cups, as well as imported powders and extracts from ''lignum nephriticum'', were thought to have great medicinal properties.&lt;ref name="barbieri"&gt;{{cite speech|first=Beniamino |last=Barbieri |title=A Short History of Fluorescence |event=Principles of Fluorescence Techniques |publisher=The Fluorescence Foundation |location=Champaign–Urbana, Il. |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=September 17, 2012 |url=http://www.fluorescence-foundation.org/lectures/chicago2011/lecture1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213715/http://www.fluorescence-foundation.org/lectures/chicago2011/lecture1.pdf |archivedate=March  3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecklund1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ecklund, Jon |title =The Incompleat Chymist: Being an Essay on the Eighteenth-Century Chemist in His Laboratory, with a Dictionary of Obsolete Chemical Terms of the Period |publisher =Smithsonian Institution Press|series =Smithsonian studies in history and technology, no. 33|year =1975|page=30|location=Washington|url =http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/HistoryTechnology/pdf_lo/SSHT-0033.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''lignum nephriticum'' derived from Mexican kidneywood was known as the '''''coatli''''', '''''coatl''''', or '''''cuatl''''' ("snake water") or '''''tlapalezpatli''''' ("blood-tincture medicine") in the [[Nahuatl language]]. It was traditionally used by the [[Aztec people]] as a diuretic prior to European contact. Similarly, the ''lignum nephriticum'' cups made from narra wood were part of the native industry of the [[Philippines]] before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. The cups were manufactured in southern [[Luzon]], particularly in the [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] region. The name of which was derived from the abundance of the narra trees, which was known as ''[[wikt:naga|naga]]'' in the [[Bikol language]] (literally "serpent" or "dragon").&lt;ref name="saff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Austin, Daniel F. |title =Baboquivari Mountain Plants: Identification, Ecology, and Ethnobotany|publisher =University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson, Arizona|year =2010|pages=143|isbn =9780816528370|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nnFVFdp0dWIC&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;ots=VT_MdFZskc&amp;dq=coatli%20plant&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=coatli%20plant&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Coatli (lignum nephriticum) - Florentine Codex f.203v.png|thumb|A depiction of ''coatli'' (''[[Eysenhardtia polystacha]]'') being harvested by an [[Aztec people|Aztec]] man in the [[Florentine codex]]]]
[[File:Narra wood.jpg|thumb|The deep red wood from the narra tree (''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]''), the source of ''lignum nephriticum'' cups]]
The first known description of the medicine appears in the ''Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva España'' (1560&amp;ndash;1564) by the Spanish [[Franciscan friar|Franciscan]] [[missionary]] and [[ethnographer]] [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]. In the most famous surviving manuscripts of the work, the [[Florentine Codex]], Sahagún called it by its [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name, ''coatli'', given by [[Aztec people|Aztec]] healers. He described its unusual property of turning the color of water that comes in contact with it to bright blue: "''...patli, yoan aqujxtiloni, matlatic iniayo axixpatli'' [...it is a medicine, and makes the water of blue color, its juice is medicinal for the urine]".&lt;ref name="barbieri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acuna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sahagun"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bernardino de Sahagún|de Sahagún, Bernardino]]|title =Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain. Volume III|year =1560–1564|page=231;f. 203v|url =https://archive.org/details/historiagenerald03saha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[physician]] and [[botanist]] [[Nicolás Monardes]] also independently described the medicine in his 1565 work ''[[Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales]]''.&lt;ref name="garrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lignum"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Muyskens | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1021/ed083p765 | last2 = Ed Vitz | title = The Fluorescence of ''Lignum nephriticum'': A Flash Back to the Past and a Simple Demonstration of Natural Substance Fluorescence | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 765 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2006JChEd..83..765M }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the origin of the name ''lignum nephriticum'', due to the use of the wood to treat [[liver]] and [[kidney]] ailments in [[New Spain]]. He described the wood as white in color. It was prepared by being sliced into very thin chips. The chips were then placed in clear spring water. After about half an hour, the water starts to turn a very pale blue, turning bluer as time passes. The water is then drunk as is or mixed with wine. He observed that despite the change in color, the wood itself imparts no taste to the water.&lt;ref name="saff"/&gt;

In 1570, [[Francisco Hernández de Toledo]], the court [[physician]] of [[King Philip II of Spain]], led what is considered the [[Francisco Hernández Expedition (1570-1577)|first scientific expedition]] to the [[Americas]]. When he returned to Spain in 1577, he gave testimony of the medicinal properties of ''lignum nephriticum'', as described by Monardes. However, he expressed uncertainty as to its origin, stating that while he was told the source plant was a shrub, he had personally also witnessed specimens that reached the size of very large trees.&lt;ref name="garrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saff"/&gt;
In 1646, [[Athanasius Kircher]], a [[German people|German]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[scholar]] residing in [[Rome]], published an account of his experiments on ''lignum nephriticum'' in his work ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ''. He conducted his experiments on a cup given to him as a gift from Jesuit missionaries in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="garrison"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fielding Hudson Garrison|Garrison, Fielding Hudson]]|title =An Introduction to the History of Medicine|publisher =W.B. Saunders Company|location=Philadelphia|year =1917|pages=283, 285|url =https://archive.org/details/introductiontohi00garruoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented that while previous authors only described the color of the water mixed with ''lignum nephriticum'' as blue, his own experiments actually showed that the wood turned the water into all kinds of colors, depending on the light. He later presented the cup to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]].&lt;ref name="saff"/&gt;

{{Quote|text=The wood of the tree thus described, when made into a cup, tinges water when poured into it at first a deep blue, the color of a [[Echium vulgare|Bugloss]] flower ; and the longer the water stands in it the deeper the color it assumes. If then the water is poured into a glass globe and held against the light, no vestige of the blue color will be seen, but it will appear to observers like pure clean spring water, limpid and clear. But if you move this glass phial toward a more shady place the liquid will assume a most delightful greenness, and if to a still more shady place, a reddish color ; and thus it will change color in a marvelous way according to the nature of its background. In the dark, however, or in an opaque vase, it will once more assume its blue color.|sign=[[Athanasius Kircher]]|source=''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ'' (1646)&lt;ref name="saff"/&gt;}}

A second cup was described by in 1650 by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[botanist]] [[Johann Bauhin]] in his great work ''Historia plantarum universalis''. He had received it under the name ''palum indianum'' from a colleague. Unlike the wood in Monardes' account, the wood the cup was made from was reddish in color. It was a [[Span (unit)|handspan]] in diameter, about {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, and adorned with variegated lines. Shavings from the same wood were included with the cup. Bauhin observed that when water was poured into the cup with the wood shavings, the water shortly turned into "a wonderful blue and yellow color, and when held up against the light beautifully resembled the varying color of the opal, giving forth reflections, as in that gem, of fiery yellow, bright red, glowing purple, and sea green most wonderful to behold." Bauhin believed that the wood was taken from a species of ash (''[[Fraxinus]]'').&lt;ref name="saff"/&gt;

In 1664, [[Robert Boyle]] explained the phenomenon to be dependent on [[pH]].&lt;ref name="garrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle"&gt;{{cite book|editor =[[Colin Macfarquhar|Macfarquhar, Colin]] |editor2=[[George Gleig|Gleig, George]]|title =Encyclopædia britannica: or, a dictionary of arts, sciences, and miscellaneous literature.

However, the botanical origin of wood used in ''lignum nephriticum'' was eventually lost in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="lignum"/&gt;

==Modern studies==
In 1915, the source of the wood was rediscovered by the [[American people|American]] botanist [[William Edwin Safford]]. He deduced that ''lignum nephriticum'' actually came from two species of trees that became confused as one. He identified the original traditional remedy described by Monardes as Mexican kidneywood, a native of [[Mexico]], while the cups which became famous in Europe were originally carved from narra wood by the inhabitants of southern [[Luzon]] from the [[Philippines]]. It was imported into Mexico through the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade and from there, introduced to Europe. Both species are members of the [[legume]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Fabaceae]].&lt;ref name="saff"&gt;{{cite book|author= [[William Edwin Safford|Safford, William Edwin]]|title =Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution|chapter =''Lignum nephriticum''|location=Washington|publisher =Government Printing Office|year =1916|page=271&amp;ndash;298|url =https://archive.org/download/annualreportofbo1915smitfo/annualreportofbo1915smitfo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lignum"/&gt;

It is now known that Sahagún's and Monardes' accounts are the earliest known records of the phenomenon of [[fluorescence]]. The unusual property of the wood was caused by the compound matlaline, which is the [[oxidation]] product of one of the [[flavonoid]]s found in the wood.&lt;ref name="acuna"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Acuña | first1 = A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17846">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Louisiana''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 3, 2010, there were nine Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three more sites have been proposed for entry on the list and eleven others have been cleaned up and removed from it.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

There are at least 35 named '''[[glaciers]]''' in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]]. At the end of the [[Little Ice Age]] about 1850, the area containing the national park had 150 glaciers. There are 25 active glaciers remaining in the park today. Since the latest interglacial period began 10,000 years ago, there have been regular climate shifts causing periods of glacier growth or melt-back. The glaciers are currently being studied to see the effect of [[global warming]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glacier_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that if current warming trends continue, there will be no glaciers left in the park by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glaciers / Glacial Features, Glacier National Park |url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/glaciers.htm |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7085">An energy company is a company which operates within the [[energy industry]], which can be involved in the production and sale of [[energy]], including [[fuel]] extraction, manufacturing, [[oil refinery|refining]] and distribution. The companies listed below are traded on public stock exchanges, as such state owned energy companies, such as [[Aramco]] are not included. However Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, [[Mohammed bin Salman]], revealed plans to float 5% of the shares of Aramco, creating a publicly traded company with a market capitalisation of around $2 trillion (almost three times that of [[Apple inc|Apple]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/17520ed0-d365-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/07/saudi-aramco-hires-moelis-historic-2-trillion-flotation/&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy industry can be sub-divided into further, more specific areas - such as: the [[petroleum industry]] ([[oil companies]], petroleum refiners, fuel transport and end-user sales at [[gas station]]s), gas and coal industry, as well as renewable energy companies. Also included are energy industry service companies as well as those which fall under the [[Energy service company]] umbrella.

==Independent energy companies==
* The following is a list of the '''top 20 independent energy companies''' ranked by [[Market Capitalization]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2016/03/30/the-worlds-largest-public-oil-and-gas-companies/#f7b3d0a31733&lt;/ref&gt;
* Note, market capitalisation is taken from those shares traded on the [[NYSE]], as indicated by the relevant ticker symbol.

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports.

* The [[2013 Mayflower oil spill]] occurred when [[ExxonMobil]]'s 20-inch Pegasus crude oil pipeline spilled near [[Mayflower, Arkansas]] on March 29, causing crude to flow through yards and gutters, and towards [[Lake Conway]]. Wildlife was coated in some places. Twenty-two houses were evacuated, due to the fumes and fire hazard. Some estimates say the total amount spilled could reach upwards of 300,000 gallons of [[diluted bitumen]] were spilled. Hook cracks and extremely low impact toughness in the LF-[[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] seam of the pipe were identified as causes of the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/rachel-maddow-mayflower-oil-spill-exxon_n_3047331.html?ir=Green |work=Huffington Post |first=Nick |last=Visser |title=Maddow Slams Exxon's 'Paper Towel' Cleanup Efforts |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412104754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/rachel-maddow-mayflower-oil-spill-exxon_n_3047331.html?ir=Green |archivedate=April 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkansasmatters.com/fulltext?nxd_id=649812 |title=Web Extra: Background on Pipeline that Ruptured Near Mayflower |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410125438/http://arkansasmatters.com/fulltext?nxd_id=649812 |archivedate=April 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/File/4%202013%205006H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_4%2002%2013.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thv11.com/news/article/271392/2/Exxon-Cause-of-pipeline-failure--manufacturing-defects |title=Exxon: Cause of pipeline failure 'manufacturing defects' |author= |date=July 10, 2013 |website=Thv11.com |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028010051/http://www.thv11.com/news/article/271392/2/Exxon-Cause-of-pipeline-failure--manufacturing-defects |archivedate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The workers were performing pipeline pigging operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/af39190844784b7eac485e85c9b9522d/WV--Gas-Explosion]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtov9.com/news/news/2nd-worker-dies-result-tyler-co-pipeline-explosion/nXNHz/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714111743/http://www.wtov9.com/news/news/2nd-worker-dies-result-tyler-co-pipeline-explosion/nXNHz/ |archivedate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 30, the Pegasus oil pipeline spilled a small amount of crude into a residential yard in Ripley County, Missouri, a month after the same pipe spewed thousands of barrels of crude in Arkansas. The Pegasus pipeline was out of service from the [[Mayflower, Arkansas]] spill, accounting for the minimal amount of oil spilled in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/01/exxon-pipeline-spill-idUSL2N0DI14U20130501 |agency=Reuters |title=Exxon says Missouri oil spills from already-ruptured Pegasus line |date=May 1, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924180945/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/01/exxon-pipeline-spill-idUSL2N0DI14U20130501 |archivedate=September 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 9, diesel fuel was detected to be leaking from a Marathon pipeline in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Over 20,000 gallons of diesel leaked, at a slow rate that was not detected by SCADA systems.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of the [[United States]] and [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''65 [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summits]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Alaska|State of Alaska]]'''.  Each of these peaks has at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].

[[Elevation|Topographic elevation]] is the vertical distance above the reference [[geoid]], a mathematical model of the Earth's [[sea level]] as an [[equipotential]] [[Gravity|gravitational]] surface.  The [[topographic prominence]] of a [[summit]] is the elevation difference between that summit and the highest or key [[col]] to a higher summit.  The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the minimum [[great-circle distance]] to a point of equal elevation.

This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  There are [[List of the ultra-prominent summits of the United States|126 ultra-prominent summits in the United States]].

If an elevation or prominence is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.

==Ultra-prominent summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Ultra-prominent summits}}
{{main|List of the most prominent summits of Alaska}}
Of the [[List of Ultras of the United States|126 ultra-prominent summits of the United States]], the following 65 (or 52%) rise in Alaska.  Four of these peaks lie on the international border with Yukon and two lie on the international border with British Columbia.

In 2008, Beaumont successfully broke the [[Around the world cycling record|world record for a circumnavigational bike tour of the World]]. To qualify for the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness world record]] Beaumont was required to travel an 18,000-mile route that passes through two approximately [[antipodes|antipodal]] points. The route began and ended in [[Paris]], France, riding through 20 countries across Europe, the Middle East, India, Asia, [[Australasia]] and North America. The bicycle used for the attempt was a [[Koga-Miyata]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedallingaround.com/equipment/ Web Site for the Round-the-World Record Attempt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517145246/http://www.pedallingaround.com/equipment/ |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Rohloff Speedhub|Rohloff internal gearing hub]]. The bike was loaded with {{convert|66|lb|kg}} of equipment such as tools, cameras and other equipment to support him during the journey. The new record was set at 194 days and 17 hours beating the previous record of 276 days and 19 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_world_cycling_record#Mark_Beaumont_(2008)|website=Wikipedia|title=Around the world cycling record}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Beaumont endured many hardships during his voyage. In [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] he was involved in a collision with a car and robbed later the same day, and elsewhere struggled with illnesses such as [[dysentery]].

As a result of breaking the world record, Beaumont raised £18,000 for charity.

Beaumont's video diaries of the journey formed the basis of a [[BAFTA]]-nominated documentary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/scotland/awards/bafta-scotland-awards-2008,1142,BA.html |title=BAFTA Nomination for David Peat's documentary |publisher=Bafta.org |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Man who Cycled the World'', which was broadcast by the [[BBC]] in August 2008.&lt;ref name="timesonline1"/&gt;

Beaumont's around-the-world cycling record was broken by [[Vin Cox]] on 1 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/7921388/British-man-sets-new-round-the-world-cycle-record.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph  | first=Alastair | last=Jamieson | title=British man sets new round-the-world cycle record | date=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Beaumont regained the [[Around the world cycling record|Guinness around-the-world cycling record]] in 2017 (see 'Around the World in 80 days' below)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_world_cycling_record#Mark_Beaumont_(2017)|website=Wikipedia|title=Around the world cycling record}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== BBC – ''Cycling the Americas'' ==
Beaumont cycled from Anchorage, Alaska, US to Ushuaia in Southern Argentina, arriving on 18 February 2010. In addition to cycling {{convert|13080|mi|km|0}} in 268 days, he climbed the highest peaks in [[North America|North]] and South America: [[Mount McKinley|Denali]] and [[Mount Aconcagua|Aconcagua]]. Along with commenting online throughout the journey, he recorded the adventure for a BBC One documentary series, ''The Man Who Cycled The Americas''. The first in the series of three episodes was broadcast on Tuesday, 23 March 2010 on BBC One. Beaumont bypassed Colombia and the [[Darien Gap]] on his journey.

==Around the World in 80 Days==
During Summer 2017, Beaumont completed a second global circumnavigation, similar to his first 10 years prior, known as the ''Around the World in 80 Days Artemis Challenge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisworldcycle.com |title=Artemis Around the World in 80 Days Challenge |publisher=artemisworldcycle.com |date= |accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The intention was to complete the trip in 80 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-39479386|title=Cyclist Mark Beaumont targets around the world in 80 days|date=2017-04-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the [[Jules Verne]] story ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisworldcycle.com/the-challenge/around-the-world-in-80-days/ |title=Artemis Around the World in 80 Days Challenge: About the Challenge |publisher=artemisworldcycle.com |date= |accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A support team traveled with him on his journey, providing nutritional, mechanical and logistical support. His target was to cover approximately {{convert|240|miles|km}} a day.&lt;ref name=bbc_41308524/&gt; He completed the journey one day ahead of schedule on 18 September, with a total time of 78 days, 14 hours, 40 minutes. This beat the previous around-the-world cycling record by 44 days.&lt;ref name=bbc_41308524&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-41308524|title=Cyclist Mark Beaumont breaks around the world record|work=BBC News|date=18 September 2017|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MrMarkBeaumont?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor|title=Officially made it round the world|publisher=Mark Beaumont (via Twitter)|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with Beaumonts original (2008) route, the trip started and finished in Paris, France, crossing Russia and Mongolia to Beijing, China (a more northerly route than in 2008), before echoing his original route across Australia and New Zealand. The route across North America was also a longer, more northerly route, before a final leg from Lisbon, Portugal back to Paris. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisworldcycle.com/the-route/|title=Artemis World Cycle - Live Tracker Map|website=www.artemisworldcycle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean rowing==
During the summer of 2011, Beaumont joined a team of six in rowing through the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]], as the BBC cameraman as well as on the oars. Their aim was to reach a 1996 location of the North Magnetic Pole. It is only in the last few years that the sea ice has melted enough for such a route to be attempted.

In early 2012, Beaumont joined another team in an attempt to break the world record for rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. After 27 days and over 2,000 miles into the expedition, they capsized and had to be rescued.

==Other endeavours==
In addition to being an accomplished cyclist, Beaumont is a [[skiing|skier]] and [[rowing (sport)|rower]]. In June 2009, he planned to participate in a 12-strong team attempt to row across the North Atlantic in a record-breaking 45 days. The team would have been led by [[Edinburgh]] stockbroker turned adventurer [[Leven Brown]] whose 14-man La Mondiale crew had beaten the record from the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] to Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/features/Cycling-hero-Mark-Beaumont-to.4795984.jp from Edinburgh's Evening News.] Retrieved 20 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boat he was going to use sank in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/article2425974.ece |title=Cycling hero Mark takes on the Americas |publisher=the Scottish Sun |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaumont was the first [[Olympic torch#Torches|torchbearer]] for day 26 of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] torch relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18422553 | work=BBC News | title=In pictures: Olympic torch relay day 26 | date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Beaumont planned to lead the World Cycle Challenge – the first fully supported group circumnavigation of the globe, with the aim of cycling {{convert|18010|mi|km|0}} in 245 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcyclechallenge.com/|title=The World Cycle Challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Beaumont set a new record in his "Africa Solo" challenge, cycling from Cairo to Cape Town in 42 days, and beating the previous record by 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/mark-beaumont-sets-new-africa-cycling-world-record-173145|publisher=[[Cycling Weekly]]|title=Mark Beaumont sets new Africa cycling world record|author=Chris Marshall-Bell|date=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bike he rode for this and the subsequent North Coast 500 challenge was a Koga Solacio which is on display at [[Edinburgh Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://road.cc/content/news/144912-mark-beaumont%E2%80%99s-koga-solacio-ready-cairo-cape-town-record-attempt|title=Mark Beaumont’s Koga Solacio for Cairo to Cape Town record attempt starting today|author=David Arthur|date=2015-04-10|publisher=road.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Beaumont set the record for completing the [[North Coast 500]] (a 518.7 mile route around Scotland) by bicycle in 37 hours 56 minutes and 44 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/watch-mark-beaumonts-epic-non-stop-ride-around-the-north-of-scotland-199001|title=Watch: Mark Beaumont’s epic non-stop ride around the north of Scotland|date=2015-11-06|publisher=[[Cycling Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effort was later beaten in 2016 by James McCallum, who completed the route in 31 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/cyclist-james-mccallum-demolishes-mark-beaumont-s-north-coast-500-record-1-4159139|title=Cyclist James McCallum demolishes Mark Beaumont’s North Coast 500 record|date=2016-06-20|publisher=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohomap.png|thumb|350px|World map showing the depth of the Moho.]]

The '''Mohorovičić discontinuity''' ({{IPA-sh|moxorôʋiːt͡ʃit͡ɕ|hr}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Max | last = Mangold | title = Aussprachewörterbuch | language = German | date = 2005 | publisher = [[Dudenverlag]] |edition = 6th | location = Mannheim | isbn = 9783411040667 | p=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually referred to as the '''Moho''', is the boundary between the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].

Named after the pioneering [[Croats|Croatian]] [[seismologist]] [[Andrija Mohorovičić]], the Moho separates both the [[oceanic crust]] and [[continental crust]] from underlying mantle.The Mohorovičić discontinuity was first identified in 1909 by Mohorovičić, when he observed that [[seismogram]]s from [[Depth of focus (tectonics)|shallow-focus]] [[earthquake]]s had two sets of [[P-wave]]s and [[S-wave]]s, one that followed a direct path near the Earth's surface and the other [[refraction|refracted]] by a high-velocity medium.&lt;ref name=McLeish&gt;{{cite book |title=Geological science |author=Andrew McLeish |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhkgwEvrVe8C&amp;pg=PA122 |isbn=0-17-448221-3 |date=1992 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moho lies almost entirely within the [[lithosphere]]; only beneath [[mid-ocean ridge]]s does it define the lithosphere–[[asthenosphere]] boundary. The Mohorovičić discontinuity is {{convert|5|to(-)|10|km|mi|sigfig=1}} below the [[ocean floor]], and {{convert|20|to(-)|90|km|mi|sigfig=1}} beneath typical continental crusts, with an [[average]] of {{convert|35|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=Monroe&gt;{{cite book |title=The changing Earth: exploring geology and evolution |author= James Stewart Monroe |author2=Reed Wicander |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFPMa4MxwJkC&amp;pg=PA216 |page=216 |isbn=0-495-55480-4 |edition=5th |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Refraction of P-wave.PNG|thumb|250px|Two paths of a P-wave, one direct and one refracted as it crosses the Moho.&lt;ref name=McLeish/&gt;]]
[[Image:Gros Morne moho.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Ordovician]] [[ophiolite]] in [[Gros Morne National Park]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. This rock which formed the Ordovician Moho is exposed on the surface.]]
Immediately above the Moho, the [[Velocity|velocities]] of primary seismic waves (P-waves) are consistent with those through [[basalt]] (6.7–7.2&amp;nbsp;km/s), and below they are similar to those through [[peridotite]] or [[dunite]] (7.6–8.6&amp;nbsp;km/s).&lt;ref name=Badescu&gt;{{cite book |title=Macro-engineering: a challenge for the future |page=169 |author=RB Cathcart |author2=MM Ćirković  |last-author-amp=yes |editor=Viorel Badescu |editor2=[[Richard Brook Cathcart]] |editor3=Roelof D Schuiling |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bZBEM31K1MC&amp;pg=PA169 |isbn=1-4020-3739-2 |date=2006 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; That suggests the Moho marks a change of composition, but the interface appears to be too even for any believable sorting mechanism{{clarify|date=December 2017}} within the Earth. Near-surface observations suggest such sorting produces an irregular surface.&lt;ref name=Howell&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to seismological research: history and development |author=Benjamin Franklin Howell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e1Cc-nqcGoC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=An+introduction+to+seismological+research:+history+and+development&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L1ofjy1Yqz&amp;sig=f2EwO2WwlTHb32XSoiawslIsTq8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SpEwU7ikAoiqyAHT44Fg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=77 ''ff'' |isbn=0-521-38571-7 |date=1990 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moho is characterized by a transition zone of up to 500 m thick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agu.org/books/gm/v013/GM013p0660/GM013p0660.pdf D.P. McKenzie - The Mohorovičić Discontinuity]&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Moho zones are exposed above-ground in numerous [[ophiolite]]s around the world.

==Exploration==
During the late 1950s and early 1960s the executive committee of the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] funded drilling a hole through the ocean floor to reach this boundary. However the operation, named [[Project Mohole]], never received sufficient support and was mismanaged{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}; the [[United States Congress]] canceled it in 1967. Soviet scientists at the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole|Kola Institute]] pursued the goal simultaneously; after 15 years they reached a depth of {{convert|12260|m|ft}}, the world's deepest hole, before abandoning their attempt in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/multimedia/2008/08/gallery_kola_borehole |title= How the Soviets Drilled the Deepest Hole in the World |work= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date= 2008-08-25 |accessdate= 2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching the discontinuity remains an important scientific objective. One proposal considers a rock-melting [[radioactive decay|radionuclide-powered]] capsule with a heavy [[tungsten]] needle that can propel itself down to the Moho discontinuity and explore [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]] near it and in the upper mantle.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese project [[Chikyu Hakken]] ("Earth Discovery") also aims to explore in this general area with the drilling ship, ''[[Chikyū]]'', built for the [[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program]] (IODP).

Plans called for the [[drillship|drill-ship]] ''[[JOIDES Resolution]]'' to sail from [[Colombo]] in [[Sri Lanka]] in late 2015 and to head for the [[Atlantis Bank]], a promising location in the southwestern Indian Ocean on the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]], to attempt to drill an initial bore hole to a depth of approximately 1.5 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The attempt did not even reach 1.3&amp;nbsp;km, but researchers hope to further their investigations at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''nuclear electromagnetic pulse''' (commonly abbreviated as nuclear EMP, or NEMP) is a burst of [[electromagnetic radiation]] created by [[nuclear explosion]]s. The resulting rapidly changing [[electric fields|electric]] and [[magnetic fields]] may couple with electrical and electronic systems to produce damaging current and [[voltage spike|voltage surges]]. The specific characteristics of any particular nuclear EMP event vary according to a number of factors, the most important of which is the [[altitude]] of the detonation.

The term "electromagnetic pulse" generally excludes optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) and ionizing (such as X-ray and gamma radiation) ranges. In military terminology, a nuclear warhead detonated tens to hundreds of kilometers above the Earth's surface is known as a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) device. Effects of a HEMP device depend on factors including the altitude of the detonation, [[nuclear weapons yield|energy yield]], [[gamma ray]] output, interactions with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] and [[electromagnetic shielding]] of targets.

== History ==
The fact that an electromagnetic pulse is produced by a nuclear explosion was known in the earliest days of nuclear weapons testing. The magnitude of the EMP and the significance of its effects, however, were not immediately realized.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;Broad, William J. "Nuclear Pulse (I): Awakening to the Chaos Factor", ''Science''. 29 May 1981 212: 1009&amp;ndash;1012&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|first United States nuclear test]] on 16 July 1945, electronic equipment was shielded because [[Enrico Fermi]] expected the electromagnetic pulse. The official technical history for that first nuclear test states, "All signal lines were completely shielded, in many cases doubly shielded. In spite of this many records were lost because of spurious pickup at the time of the explosion that paralyzed the recording equipment."&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, K.T., (Report LA-6300-H), Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. May 1976. p. 53 [https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00317133.pdf ''Trinity'']&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;During [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|British nuclear testing]] in 1952&amp;ndash;1953 instrumentation failures were attributed to "[[radioflash]]", which was their term for EMP.&lt;ref name="baum1"&gt;Baum, Carl E., ''IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility''. Vol. 49, No. 2. pp. 211–218. May 2007. [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/History/BaumReminiscences.pdf ''Reminiscences of High-Power Electromagnetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baum2"&gt;Baum, Carl E., ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', Vol. 80, No. 6, pp. 789–817. June 1992 [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/SDAN/0032.pdf "From the Electromagnetic Pulse to High-Power Electromagnetics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first openly reported observation of the unique aspects of high-altitude nuclear EMP occurred during the [[helium balloon]] lofted Yucca nuclear test of the [[Hardtack I]] series on 28 April 1958. In that test, the electric field measurements from the 1.7 kiloton weapon went off the scale of the test instruments and was estimated to be about 5 times the oscilloscope limits. The Yucca EMP was initially positive-going whereas low-altitude bursts were negative pulses. Also, the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the Yucca EMP signal was horizontal, whereas low-altitude nuclear EMP was vertically polarized. In spite of these many differences, the unique EMP results were dismissed as a possible [[wave propagation]] anomaly.&lt;ref name="yucca"&gt;Defense Atomic Support Agency. 23 September 1959. [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA369152 "Operation Hardtack Preliminary Report. Technical Summary of Military Effects]. Report ADA369152". pp. 346–350. &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear tests]] of 1962, as discussed below, confirmed the unique results of the Yucca high-altitude test and increased the awareness of high-altitude nuclear EMP beyond the original group of defense scientists. The larger scientific community became aware of the significance of the EMP problem after a three-article series on nuclear EMP was published in 1981 by [[William Broad|William J. Broad]] in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broad, William J. "Nuclear Pulse (II): Ensuring Delivery of the Doomsday Signal", ''Science''. 5 June 1981 212: 1116&amp;ndash;1120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broad, William J.

=== Starfish Prime ===
{{Main article|Starfish Prime}}
In July 1962, the US carried out the [[Starfish Prime]] test, exploding a 1.44 [[Nuclear weapon yield|megaton]] bomb {{convert|400|km}} above the mid-Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated that the effects of a [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] were much larger than had been previously calculated. Starfish Prime made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in [[Hawaii]], about {{convert|1445|km}} away from the detonation point, knocking out about 300 streetlights, setting off numerous burglar alarms and damaging a microwave link.&lt;ref&gt;Vittitoe, Charles N., [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/SDAN/0031.pdf ''Did High-Altitude EMP Cause the Hawaiian Streetlight Incident?''] Sandia National Laboratories. June 1989. &lt;/ref&gt;

Starfish Prime was the first success in the series of United States high-altitude nuclear tests in 1962 known as [[Operation Fishbowl]]. Subsequent tests gathered more data on the high-altitude EMP phenomenon.

The [[Operation Fishbowl#Bluegill Triple Prime|Bluegill Triple Prime]] and [[Operation Fishbowl#Kingfish|Kingfish]] high-altitude nuclear tests of October and November 1962 in Operation Fishbowl provided data that was clear enough to enable physicists to accurately identify the physical mechanisms behind the electromagnetic pulses.&lt;ref name="nbcreport"&gt;Longmire, Conrad L., ''NBC Report'', Fall/Winter, 2004. pp. 47–51. U.S. Army Nuclear and Chemical Agency   [http://www.futurescience.com/emp/NBC_Report_Fall_Winter04.pdf "Fifty Odd Years of EMP"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMP damage of the Starfish Prime test was quickly repaired due, in part, to the fact that the EMP over Hawaii was relatively weak compared to what could be produced with a more intense pulse, and in part due to the relative ruggedness (compared to today) of Hawaii's electrical and electronic infrastructure in 1962.&lt;ref name="tn353"&gt;[http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/TheoreticalPDFs/TN353.pdf Theoretical Notes – Note 353, March 1985, "EMP on Honolulu from the Starfish Event"] Conrad L. Longmire – Mission Research Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively small magnitude of the Starfish Prime EMP in Hawaii (about 5.6 kilovolts/metre) and the relatively small amount of damage (for example, only 1 to 3 percent of streetlights extinguished)&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Mario (1987) "Effect of the Fast Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse on the Electric Power Grid Nationwide: A Different View". IEEE Trans. Power Delivery, PWRD-2, 1199&amp;ndash;1222 {{arxiv|physics/0307127}}&lt;/ref&gt; led some scientists to believe, in the early days of EMP research, that the problem might not be significant. Later calculations&lt;ref name="tn353"/&gt; showed that if the Starfish Prime warhead had been detonated over the northern continental United States, the magnitude of the EMP would have been much larger (22 to 30 kV/m) because of the greater strength of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] over the United States, as well as its different orientation at high latitudes. These calculations, combined with the accelerating reliance on EMP-sensitive microelectronics, heightened awareness that EMP could be a significant problem.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

=== Soviet Test 184 ===
{{Main article|Soviet Project K nuclear tests}}
In 1962, the [[Soviet Union]] also performed three EMP-producing nuclear tests in space over Kazakhstan, the last in the "[[Soviet Project K nuclear tests]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zak, Anatoly "The K Project: Soviet Nuclear Tests in Space", [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/10736700600861418 ''The Nonproliferation Review''], Volume 13, Issue, 1 March 2006, pp. 143–150 &lt;/ref&gt; Although these weapons were much smaller (300 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kiloton]]) than the Starfish Prime test, they were over a populated, large land mass and at a location where the Earth's magnetic field was greater; the damage caused by the resulting EMP was reportedly much greater than in Starfish Prime. The [[geomagnetic storm]]–like E3 pulse from Test 184 induced a current surge in a long underground [[power line]] that caused a fire in the [[power plant]] in the city of [[Karaganda]].{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the level of this damage was communicated informally to US scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Loborev.txt Subject: US-Russian meeting – HEMP effects on national power grid &amp; telecommunications] From: Howard Seguine, 17 Feb. 1995 Memorandum for Record&lt;/ref&gt; For a few years US and Russian scientists collaborated on the HEMP phenomenon. Funding was secured to enable Russian scientists to report on some of the Soviet EMP results in international scientific journals.&lt;ref name="combatwmd"&gt;Pfeffer, Robert and Shaeffer, D. Lynn.

For one of the K Project tests, Soviet scientists instrumented a {{convert|570|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} section of telephone line in the area that they expected to be affected by the pulse. The monitored telephone line was divided into sub-lines of {{convert|40|to|80|km}} in length, separated by [[repeater]]s. Each sub-line was protected by [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and by [[Gas-filled tube|gas-filled]] [[overvoltage]] protectors. The EMP from the 22 October (K-3) nuclear test (also known as Test 184) blew all of the fuses and fired all of the overvoltage protectors in all of the sub-lines.&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt;

Published reports, including a 1998 IEEE article,&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt; have stated that there were significant problems with ceramic insulators on overhead electrical power lines during the tests. A 2010 technical report written for [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] stated that "Power line insulators were damaged, resulting in a short circuit on the line and some lines detaching from the poles and falling to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=Report Meta-R-320|title=The Early-Time (E1) High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Its Impact on the U.S. Power Grid."

== Characteristics ==
Nuclear EMP is a complex multi-pulse, usually described in terms of three components, as defined by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).&lt;ref name="iec.ch"&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/procgi.pl/www/iecwww.p?wwwlang=E&amp;wwwprog=cat-det.p&amp;wartnum=020728 Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), Part 2: Environment, Section 9: Description of HEMP environment – Radiated disturbance. Basic EMC publication], IEC 61000-2-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The three components of nuclear EMP, as defined by the IEC, are called "E1", "E2" and "E3".&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/congress/2004_r/04-07-22emp.pdf "Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack"] Volume 1: Executive Report 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iec.ch"/&gt;

=== E1 ===

The E1 pulse is the very fast component of nuclear EMP. E1 is a brief but intense electromagnetic field that induces high voltages in electrical conductors. E1 causes most of its damage by causing electrical [[breakdown voltage]]s to be exceeded. E1 can destroy computers and communications equipment and it changes too quickly (nanoseconds) for ordinary [[surge protector]]s to provide effective protection from it. Fast-acting surge protectors (such as those using [[Surge protector#Transient voltage suppression (TVS) diode|TVS diodes]]) will block the E1 pulse.

[[File:EMP mechanism.png|right|333px|thumb|The mechanism for a 400 km high-altitude burst EMP: gamma rays hit the atmosphere between 20–40 km altitude, ejecting electrons which are then deflected sideways by the Earth's magnetic field. This makes the electrons radiate EMP over a massive area. Because of the curvature and downward tilt of Earth's magnetic field over the USA, the maximum EMP occurs south of the detonation and the minimum occurs to the north.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA278230&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf ''Nuclear Environment Survivability'']. Report ADA278230. p. D-7. 15 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

E1 is produced when [[gamma radiation]] from the nuclear detonation [[ionization|ionizes]] (strips electrons from) atoms in the upper atmosphere. This is known as the [[Compton effect]] and the resulting current is called the "Compton current". The electrons travel in a generally downward direction at [[Special relativity|relativistic speeds]] (more than 90 percent of the speed of light). In the absence of a magnetic field, this would produce a large, radial pulse of [[electric current]] propagating outward from the burst location confined to the source region (the region over which the gamma photons are attenuated). The Earth's magnetic field exerts a force on the electron flow at a right angle to both the field and the particles' original vector, which deflects the electrons and leads to [[synchrotron radiation]]. Because the outward traveling gamma pulse is propagating at the speed of light, the synchrotron radiation of the Compton electrons adds [[Coherence (physics)|coherently]], leading to a radiated electromagnetic signal. This interaction produces a large, brief, pulse.&lt;ref name="longmire"&gt;Longmire, Conrad L. LLNL-9323905, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. June 1986 "[http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/TheoreticalPDFs/TN368.pdf Justification and Verification of High-Altitude EMP Theory, Part 1]" (Retrieved 2010-15-12)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several physicists worked on the problem of identifying the mechanism of the HEMP E1 pulse. The mechanism was finally identified by [[Conrad Longmire]] of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="nbcreport"/&gt;

Longmire gives numerical values for a typical case of E1 pulse produced by a second-generation nuclear weapon such as those of [[Operation Fishbowl]]. The typical gamma rays given off by the weapon have an energy of about 2 [[Electron Volt|MeV]] ([[Mega-|mega]]-electron volts). The gamma rays transfer about half of their energy to the ejected free electrons, giving an energy of about 1 MeV.&lt;ref name="longmire"/&gt;

In a vacuum and absent a magnetic field, the electrons would travel with a [[current density]] of tens of [[amperes]] per square metre.&lt;ref name="longmire"/&gt; Because of the downward tilt of the Earth's magnetic field at high [[latitudes]], the area of peak field strength is a U-shaped region to the equatorial side of the detonation. As shown in the diagram, for nuclear detonations in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], this U-shaped region is south of the detonation point. Near the [[equator]], where the Earth's magnetic field is more nearly horizontal, the E1 field strength is more nearly symmetrical around the burst location.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

At geomagnetic field strengths typical of the mid latitudes, these initial electrons spiral around the magnetic field lines with a typical radius of about 85 metres (about 280 feet). These initial electrons are stopped by collisions with air molecules at an average distance of about 170 metres (a little less than 580 feet). This means that most of the electrons are stopped by collisions with air molecules before completing a full spiral around the field lines.&lt;ref name="longmire"/&gt;

This interaction of the negatively charged electrons with the magnetic field radiates a pulse of electromagnetic energy. The pulse typically rises to its peak value in some 5 nanoseconds. Its magnitude typically decays by half within 200 nanoseconds. (By the IEC definition, this E1 pulse ends 1000 nanoseconds after it begins.)  This process occurs simultaneously on about 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; electrons.&lt;ref name="longmire"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;The simultaneous action of the electrons causes the resulting pulse from each electron to radiate coherently, adding to produce a single large amplitude, but narrow, radiated pulse.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

Secondary collisions cause subsequent electrons to lose energy before they reach ground level. The electrons generated by these subsequent collisions have so little energy that they do not contribute significantly to the E1 pulse.&lt;ref name="longmire"/&gt;

These 2 MeV gamma rays typically produce an E1 pulse near ground level at moderately high latitudes that peaks at about 50,000 volts per metre. The ionization process in the mid-[[stratosphere]] causes this region to become an electrical conductor, a process that blocks the production of further electromagnetic signals and causes the field strength to saturate at about 50,000 volts per metre. The strength of the E1 pulse depends upon the number and intensity of the gamma rays and upon the rapidity of the gamma ray burst. Strength is also somewhat dependent upon altitude.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

There are reports of "super-EMP" nuclear weapons that are able to exceed the 50,000 volt per metre limit by unspecified mechanisms. The reality and possible construction details of these weapons are classified and are, therefore, unconfirmed in the open scientific literature&lt;ref name="pry"&gt;March 8, 2005 "[https://web.archive.org/web/20121108204504/http://kyl.senate.gov/legis_center/subdocs/030805_pry.pdf Statement, Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, EMP Commission Staff, before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security]"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} 

=== E2 ===
The E2 component is generated by scattered gamma rays and inelastic gammas produced by [[neutron]]s. This E2 component is an "intermediate time" pulse that, by IEC definition, lasts from about 1 microsecond to 1 second after the explosion. E2 has many similarities to [[lightning]], although lightning-induced E2 may be considerably larger than a nuclear E2. Because of the similarities and the widespread use of lightning protection technology, E2 is generally considered to be the easiest to protect against.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;

According to the United States EMP Commission, the main problem with E2 is that it immediately follows E1, which may have damaged the devices that would normally protect against E2.

The EMP Commission Executive Report of 2004 states, "In general, it would not be an issue for critical infrastructure systems since they have existing protective measures for defense against occasional lightning strikes. The most significant risk is synergistic, because the E2 component follows a small fraction of a second after the first component's insult, which has the ability to impair or destroy many protective and control features. The energy associated with the second component thus may be allowed to pass into and damage systems."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170829024119/http://www.empcommission.org/docs/empc_exec_rpt.pdf Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack]. Volume 1. Executive Report. 2004. p. 6. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== E3 ===
{{main article|Geomagnetically induced current}}{{see also|Coronal mass ejection|Solar flare}}The E3 component is different from E1 and E2. E3 is a much slower pulse, lasting tens to hundreds of seconds. It is caused by the nuclear detonation's temporary distortion of the Earth's magnetic field. The E3 component has similarities to a [[geomagnetic storm]] caused by a solar flare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todaysengineer.org/2007/Sep/HEMP.asp High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP): A Threat to Our Way of Life], 09.07, By William A.

Written by Metatech Corporation for Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the similarity between solar-induced geomagnetic storms and nuclear E3, it has become common to refer to solar-induced geomagnetic storms as "Solar EMP".&lt;ref name="empact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empactamerica.org/solar_emp.php |title=EMPACT America, Inc. - Solar EMP |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726030320/http://www.empactamerica.org/solar_emp.php |archivedate=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Solar EMP," does not include E1 or E2 components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.protectgrid.com/glossary/e3/|title=E3 - ProtecTgrid|newspaper=ProtecTgrid|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generation ==

Factors that control weapon effectiveness include altitude, [[nuclear weapon yield|yield]], construction details, target distance, intervening geographical features, and local strength of the Earth's magnetic field.

=== Weapon altitude ===

[[File:High altitude EMP.gif|right|333px|thumb|How the peak EMP on the ground varies with the weapon yield and burst altitude. The yield here is the prompt [[gamma ray]] output measured in kilotons. This varies from 0.115–0.5% of the total weapon yield, depending on weapon design. The 1.4 Mt total yield 1962 [[Starfish Prime]] test had a gamma output of 0.1%, hence 1.4 kt of prompt gamma rays.  (The '''blue''' '[[ionization|pre-ionisation]]' curve applies to certain types of [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]], for which [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[x-ray]]s from the primary fission stage [[Ionization|ionise]] the atmosphere and make it electrically conductive before the main pulse from the thermonuclear stage.

United States Department of Defense.  &lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to an internet primer published by the [[Federation of American Scientists]]&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;[https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/emp.htm Federation of American Scientists. "Nuclear Weapon EMP Effects"]&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''A high-altitude nuclear detonation produces an immediate [[flux]] of gamma rays from the nuclear reactions within the device. These [[photon]]s in turn produce high energy free electrons by Compton scattering at altitudes between (roughly) 20 and 40 km. These electrons are then trapped in the Earth's magnetic field, giving rise to an [[Oscillation|oscillating]] electric current. This current is asymmetric in general and gives rise to a rapidly rising radiated electromagnetic field called an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Because the electrons are trapped essentially simultaneously, a very large electromagnetic source radiates [[coherence (physics)|coherently]]''.

: ''The pulse can easily span continent-sized areas, and this radiation can affect systems on land, sea, and air. ...  A large device detonated at 400–500 km (250 to 312 miles) over [[Kansas]] would affect all of the continental U.S. The signal from such an event extends to the visual horizon as seen from the burst point''.

Thus, for equipment to be affected, the weapon needs to be above the [[Line-of-sight propagation|visual horizon]].&lt;ref name="fas" /&gt;

The altitude indicated above is greater than that of the [[International Space Station]] and many [[low Earth orbit]] satellites. Large weapons could have a dramatic impact on [[satellite]] operations and communications such as occurred during Operation Fishbowl. The damaging effects on orbiting satellites are usually due to factors other than EMP. In the [[Starfish Prime]] nuclear test, most damage was to the satellites' solar panels while passing through radiation belts created by the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

For detonations within the atmosphere, the situation is more complex. Within the range of gamma ray deposition, simple laws no longer hold as the air is [[Ionization|ionised]] and there are other EMP effects, such as a radial electric field due to the separation of [[Compton scattering|Compton electron]]s from air molecules, together with other complex phenomena. For a surface burst, absorption of gamma rays by air would limit the range of gamma ray deposition to approximately 10 miles, while for a burst in the lower-density air at high altitudes, the range of deposition would be far greater.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

=== Weapon yield ===
Typical [[nuclear weapon yield]]s used during [[Cold War]] planning for EMP attacks were in the range of 1 to 10 [[Nuclear weapon yield|megatons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/security/has197010.000/has197010_1.HTM#39 U.S. Congressional hearing Transcript] H.S.N.C No. 105&amp;ndash;18, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; This is roughly 50 to 500 times the size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Physicists have testified at United States Congressional hearings that weapons with yields of 10 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kilotons]] or less can produce a large EMP.&lt;ref name="hasc"&gt;[http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/security/has280010.000/has280010_0.htm#48 U.S. Congressional hearing Transcript] H.A.S.C. No. 106&amp;ndash;31, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMP at a fixed distance from an explosion increases at most as the square root of the yield (see the illustration to the right). This means that although a 10 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kiloton]] weapon has only 0.7% of the energy release of the 1.44-[[Nuclear weapon yield|megaton]] Starfish Prime test, the EMP will be at least 8% as powerful. Since the E1 component of nuclear EMP depends on the prompt gamma ray output, which was only 0.1% of yield in Starfish Prime but can be 0.5% of yield in low yield pure [[nuclear fission]] weapons, a 10 kiloton bomb can easily be 5 x 8% = 40% as powerful as the 1.44 megaton Starfish Prime at producing EMP.&lt;ref name="glasstone.blogspot.com"/&gt;

The total prompt gamma ray energy in a fission explosion is 3.5% of the yield, but in a 10 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kiloton]] detonation the triggering explosive around the bomb core absorbs about 85% of the prompt gamma rays, so the output is only about 0.5% of the yield. In the [[Nuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] Starfish Prime the fission yield was less than 100% and the thicker outer casing absorbed about 95% of the prompt gamma rays from the pusher around the fusion stage. [[Nuclear weapon design#Fusion weapons|Thermonuclear weapons]] are also less efficient at producing EMP because the first stage can [[ionization|pre-ionize]] the air&lt;ref name="glasstone.blogspot.com"/&gt; which becomes conductive and hence rapidly shorts out the [[Compton scattering|Compton current]]s generated by the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] stage. Hence, small pure fission weapons with thin cases are far more efficient at causing EMP than most megaton bombs.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

This analysis, however, only applies to the fast E1 and E2 components of nuclear EMP. The [[geomagnetic storm]]-like E3 component of nuclear EMP is more closely proportional to the total energy yield of the weapon.&lt;ref name="empcnir"&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA484672 EMP Commission Critical National Infrastructures Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Target distance ===
In nuclear EMP all of the components of the electromagnetic pulse are generated outside of the weapon.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

For [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]]s, much of the EMP is generated far from the detonation (where the gamma radiation from the explosion hits the upper atmosphere). This electric field from the EMP is remarkably uniform over the large area affected.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}}

According to the standard reference text on nuclear weapons effects published by the U.S. Department of Defense, "The peak electric field (and its amplitude) at the Earth's surface from a high-altitude burst will depend upon the explosion yield, the height of the burst, the location of the observer, and the orientation with respect to the [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic field]]. As a general rule, however, the field strength may be expected to be tens of kilovolts per metre over most of the area receiving the EMP radiation."{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}}

The text also states that, "...&amp;nbsp;over most of the area affected by the EMP the electric field strength on the ground would exceed 0.5''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. For yields of less than a few hundred kilotons, this would not necessarily be true because the field strength at the Earth's tangent could be substantially less than 0.5''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;."{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}}

(''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the maximum electric field strength in the affected area.)

In other words, the electric field strength in the entire area that is affected by the EMP will be fairly uniform for weapons with a large gamma ray output. For smaller weapons, the electric field may fall at a faster rate as distance increases.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}}

== Effects ==
An energetic EMP can temporarily upset or permanently damage electronic equipment by generating high voltage and high current surges; semiconductor components are particularly at risk. The effects of damage can range from imperceptible to the eye, to devices literally blowing apart. Cables, even if short, can act as antennas to transmit pulse energy to equipment.&lt;ref name="metaR320"/&gt;

=== Vacuum tube vs. solid state electronics ===
Older, [[vacuum tube]] (valve) based equipment is generally much less vulnerable to nuclear EMP than [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] equipment, which is much more susceptible to damage by large, brief voltage and current surges. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Cold War]]-era military aircraft often had [[avionics]] based on vacuum tubes because solid-state capabilities were limited and vacuum-tube gear was believed to be more likely to survive.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt;

Other components in vacuum tube circuitry can be damaged by EMP. Vacuum tube equipment was damaged in the 1962 testing.&lt;ref name="euroem"/&gt; The solid state [[AN/PRC-77 Portable Transceiver|PRC-77]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] manpackable 2-way radio survived extensive EMP testing.&lt;ref name="PRC77"&gt;Seregelyi, J.S, et al. [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA266412&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Report ADA266412 "EMP Hardening Investigation of the PRC-77 Radio Set]" Retrieved 2009-25-11&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier PRC-25, nearly identical except for a vacuum tube final amplification stage, was tested in EMP simulators, but was not certified to remain fully functional.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

=== Electronics in operation vs. inactive ===
Equipment that is running at the time of an EMP is more vulnerable. Even a low-energy pulse has access to the power source, and all parts of the system are illuminated by the pulse. For example, a high-current arcing path may be created across the power supply, burning out some device along that path. Such effects are hard to predict, and require testing to assess potential vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="metaR320"&gt;Report Meta-R-320: "[https://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/reliability/cybersecurity/ferc_meta-r-320.pdf The Early-Time (E1) High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Its Impact on the U.S. Power Grid]" January 2010. Written by Metatech Corporation for Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Appendix: E1 HEMP Myths&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On aircraft ===
Many nuclear detonations have taken place using [[aerial bomb]]s. The [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] aircraft that delivered the nuclear weapons at [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] did not lose power from electrical damage, because [[electron]]s (ejected from the air by gamma rays) are stopped quickly in normal air for bursts below roughly {{convert|10|km}}, so they are not significantly deflected by the Earth's magnetic field.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.09}}

If the aircraft carrying the [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] bombs had been within the intense nuclear radiation zone when the bombs exploded over those cities, then they would have suffered effects from the [[photoinduced charge separation|charge separation]] (radial) EMP. But this only occurs within the severe blast radius for detonations below about 10&amp;nbsp;km altitude.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

During [[Operation Fishbowl]], EMP disruptions were suffered aboard a [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] photographic aircraft flying {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} from the {{convert|410|ktonTNT|abbr=on}} detonations at {{convert|48|and|95|km|abbr=on}} burst altitudes.&lt;ref name="glasstone.blogspot.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/emp-radiation-from-nuclear-space.html|title=EMP radiation from nuclear space bursts in 1962|last=Glasstone|first=Samuel|date=March 29, 2006|quote=Subsequent tests with lower yield devices [410 kt ''Kingfish'' at 95 km altitude, 410 kt ''Bluegill'' at 48 km altitude, and 7 kt ''Checkmate'' at 147 km] produced electronic upsets on an instrumentation aircraft [presumably the KC-135 that filmed the tests from above the clouds?] that was approximately 300 kilometers away from the detonations.}}&lt;!-- blog source was https://fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1997_h/h970716u.htm &amp;ndash; testimony to 1997 U.S. Congressional Hearings, Dr. George W. Ullrich, the Deputy Director of the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Special Weapons Agency --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The vital electronics were less sophisticated than today's and the aircraft was able to land safely.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

=== On cars ===
An EMP would probably not affect most cars, despite modern cars' heavy use of electronics, because cars' electronic circuits and cabling are likely too short to be affected. In addition, cars' metallic frames provide some protection. However, even a small percentage of cars breaking down due to an electronic malfunction would cause temporary traffic jams.&lt;ref name="metaR320" /&gt;

=== On small electronics ===
An EMP has a smaller effect the shorter the length of an electrical conductor; though other factors affect the vulnerability of electronics as well, so no cutoff length determines whether some piece of equipment will survive. However, small electronic devices, such as wristwatches and cell phones, would most likely withstand an EMP.&lt;ref name="metaR320" /&gt;

=== On humans and animals ===
Though voltages can accumulate in electrical conductors after an EMP, it will generally not flow out into human or animal bodies, and thus contact is safe.&lt;ref name="metaR320" /&gt;

== Post-Cold War attack scenarios ==

The United States EMP Commission was created by the [[United States Congress]] in 2001. The commission is formally known as the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170908212925/http://www.empcommission.org/ Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission brought together notable scientists and technologists to compile several reports. In 2008, the Commission released the "Critical National Infrastructures Report".&lt;ref name="empcnir" /&gt; This report describes the likely consequences of a nuclear EMP on civilian infrastructure. Although this report covered the United States, most of the information is applicable to other industrialized countries. The 2008 report was a followup to a more generalized report issued by the commission in 2004.&lt;ref name="empc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org" /&gt;

In written testimony delivered to the United States Senate in 2005, an EMP Commission staff member reported:

{{quote|The EMP Commission sponsored a worldwide survey of foreign scientific and military literature to evaluate the knowledge, and possibly the intentions, of foreign states with respect to electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. The survey found that the physics of EMP phenomenon and the military potential of EMP attack are widely understood in the international community, as reflected in official and unofficial writings and statements. The survey of open sources over the past decade finds that knowledge about EMP and EMP attack is evidenced in at least Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Egypt, Taiwan, Sweden, Cuba, India, Pakistan, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Iran, North Korea, China and Russia.

Many foreign analysts – particularly in Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia – view the United States as a potential aggressor that would be willing to use its entire panoply of weapons, including nuclear weapons, in a first strike. They perceive the United States as having contingency plans to make a nuclear EMP attack, and as being willing to execute those plans under a broad range of circumstances.

Russian and Chinese military scientists in open source writings describe the basic principles of nuclear weapons designed specifically to generate an enhanced-EMP effect, that they term "Super-EMP" weapons. "Super-EMP" weapons, according to these foreign open source writings, can destroy even the best protected U.S. military and civilian electronic systems.&lt;ref name="pry"/&gt;}}

The United States EMP Commission determined that long-known protections are almost completely absent in the civilian infrastructure of the United States and that large parts of US military services were less-protected against EMP than during the Cold War. In public statements, the Commission recommended making electronic equipment and electrical components resistant to EMP – and maintaining spare parts inventories that would enable prompt repairs.&lt;ref name="empc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empcnir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="med-emp"&gt;Ross, Lenard H., Jr. and Mihelic, F. Matthew, "[http://www.disastermedicinejournal.com Healthcare Vulnerabilities to Electromagnetic Pulse]" American Journal of Disaster Medicine, Vol. 3, No. 6, pp. 321–325. November/December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States EMP Commission did not look at other nations.{{Citation needed|date = August 2016}}

In 2011 the [[Defense Science Board]] published a report about the ongoing efforts to defend critical military and civilian systems against EMP and other nuclear weapons effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA550250.pdf "Survivability of Systems and Assets to Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States military services developed, and in some cases published, hypothetical EMP attack scenarios.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Miller, Colin R., Major, USAF "[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/bugs_ch12.pdf Electromagnetic Pulse Threats in 2010]" Air War College, Air University, United States Air Force, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the Los Alamos Laboratory started phase 0 of a multi-year study (through to phase 3) to investigate EMP's which prepared the strategy to be followed for the rest of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, M.K., Backhaus, S.N., Woodroffe, J.R., Henderson, M.G., Bos, R.J., Nelson, E.M. and Kelic, A., 2016. EMP/GMD Phase 0 Report, [http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-16-28380 A Review of EMP Hazard Environments and Impacts] (No. LA-UR-16-28380). Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the US department of energy published the "DOE Electromagnetic Pulse Resilience Action Plan"&lt;ref name="DOE2017"&gt;DOE and partners "[https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/DOE%20EMP%20Resilience%20Action%20Plan%20January%202017.pdf DOE Electromagnetic Pulse Resilience Action Plan]" DOE, January, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, Edwin Boston published a dissertation on the topic&lt;ref&gt;Boston Jr, E.J., 2017. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MsT.........47B Critical Infrastructure Protection: EMP Impacts on the US Electric Grid (Doctoral dissertation, Utica College)].&lt;/ref&gt; and the EMP Commission published "Assessing the threat from electromagnetic pulse (EMP)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1051492.pdf Assessing the threat from electromagnetic pulse (EMP)], the EMP Commission. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

They found that earlier reports had underestimated the effects of an EMP attack on the national infrastructure and highlighted issues with communications from the DoD due to the classified nature of the material and recommended that the DHS instead of going to the DOE for guidance and direction should directly cooperate with the more knowledgeable parts of the DOE. Several reports are in process of being released to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;William Graham, [http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/387148-trumps-actions-have-been-critical-to-defending-the-us-against-an "Trump's actions have been critical to defending the US against an EMP attack"], the Hill, May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Protecting infrastructure ==

The problem of protecting civilian infrastructure from electromagnetic pulse has been intensively studied throughout the European Union, and in particular by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons
Defence Committee, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmdfence/1552/1552.pdf ''Developing Threats: Electro-Magnetic Pulses (EMP)''] Tenth Report of Session 2010–12. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/communities/electromagnetics/triple-threat/index.cfm ''Extreme Electromagnetics – The Triple Threat to Infrastructure''], 14 January 2013 (Proceedings of a seminar) &lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, several [[Public utility|power utility companies]] in the United States have been involved in a three-year research program on the impact of HEMP to the United States power grid led by an industry non-profit organization, [[Electric Power Research Institute]] (EPRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728664-north-korea-has-given-electricity-industry-jolt-fear-americas-utilities-prepare|title=America’s utilities prepare for a nuclear threat to the grid|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=C701371B-3EE3-4C3B-BE6A-9F204016B6A4|title=Hearing of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee|last=|first=|date=May 4, 2017|website=www.energy.senate.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506071612/https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=C701371B-3EE3-4C3B-BE6A-9F204016B6A4|archive-date=2017-05-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=Sep 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction and popular culture ==
{{Main article|Electromagnetic pulse in fiction and popular culture}}
Especially since the 1980s, Nuclear EMP weapons have gained a significant presence in fiction and popular culture.

The popular media often depict EMP effects incorrectly, causing misunderstandings among the public and even professionals, and official efforts have been made in the United States to set the record straight.&lt;ref name="metaR320"/&gt; The [[United States Space Command]] commissioned science educator [[Bill Nye]] to produce a video called "Hollywood vs. EMP" so that inaccurate Hollywood fiction would not confuse those who must deal with real EMP events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tellyawards.com/winners/list/?l=M&amp;pageNum_winners=2&amp;totalRows_winners=453&amp;event=10&amp;category= 2009 Telly Award Winners, (Manitou Motion Picture Company, Ltd.)]&lt;/ref&gt; The video is not available to the general public.

{{orphan|date=October 2012}}

'''Ocean dredging''' was an [[oceanography]] technique introduced in the nineteenth century and developed by naturalist [[Edward Forbes]]. He would lay out the [[dredging|dredged]] material on the deck to examine, preserve and study it. The practice was chronicled in a remembrance of Forbes by [[William Jerdan]] in his 1866 book ''Men I Have Known''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Men I Have Known|author=Jerdan, W.|year=1866|location=London|publisher=George Routledge and Sons|url=https://archive.org/details/menihaveknown00jerdgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc.''' is an American company engaged in the salvage of deep-water shipwrecks.  Odyssey salvaged the U.S. Civil War era shipwreck of the [[SS Republic (1853)|SS ''Republic'']] in 2003 and recovered over 50,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts from the site nearly 1,700 feet deep. Odyssey has several shipwreck projects in various stages of development around the world, including the codenamed [[Black Swan Project]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/05/18/treasure.ship.ap/index.html?eref=rss_world Shipwreck yields historic riches -- $500M worth]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - [[CNN]], May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/6671975.stm Record wreck 'found off Cornwall'] - [[BBC News]], May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1998 and 2001, Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for [[HMS Sussex (1693)|HMS ''Sussex'']] and stated that it had located the shipwreck off Gibraltar at a depth of 821 metres. The English ship sank in a storm in 1694 during the [[Nine Years' War|War of the Grand Alliance]] as it was transporting 10 [[ton]]s of gold coins to buy the allegiance of the Duke of Savoy, [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II]], against [[France]].

In September 2002,&lt;ref name="date"&gt;[http://www.shipwreck.net/hmssussex.php, HMS Sussex Project Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Odyssey reached an agreement with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.
 
The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwreck.net/pr47.php, Sussex Project Moves Ahead], May 30, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwreck.net/gppr01.php, Odyssey Engages Gifford and Partners for Deep Ocean Archaeological Excavation], August 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS ''Republic''&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwreck.net/pr53.php, Odyssey Discovers Sidewheel Steamship], August 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which continued until early 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwreck.net/pr88.php, Odyssey Concludes Atlantic Operations and Moves to Mediterranean]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sussex'' agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the [[Council for British Archaeology]], [[Rescue (British Archaeological Trust)|Rescue]], and the [[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists|Institute of Field Archaeologists]], denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the "ransacking" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research.&lt;ref name="Digger"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bajr.org/DiggerMagazine/TheDigger30/article3.html  | title=GIFFORDS TO DIG 'BILLION DOLLAR' SITE | work=[http://www.bajr.org/diggermagazine/default.htm The Digger - the voice of the field archeologist] | date=May 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rescue"&gt;[http://www.rescue-archaeology.freeserve.co.uk/news/hms-sussex.html HMS Sussex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610184417/http://www.rescue-archaeology.freeserve.co.uk/news/hms-sussex.html |date=2007-06-10 }} - [[Rescue (British Archaeological Trust)|Rescue]], May 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBA"&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/conserve/sussex.html HMS Sussex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606233644/http://www.britarch.ac.uk/conserve/sussex.html |date=2007-06-06 }} - [[Council for British Archaeology|CBA]], May 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An [[early day motion]] was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.&lt;ref name="Digger"/&gt;

In December 2005 Odyssey began archaeological investigation of the site believed to be HMS ''Sussex''. The company adhered to the project plan submitted and accepted by the Sussex Archaeological Executive, a committee of archaeological consultants approved by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]. As of 2009, Odyssey had completed Phase 1A (the non-disturbance survey) and a substantial portion of Phase 1B (trial excavation of the site believed to be HMS ''Sussex'') to the satisfaction of the UK Government. Odyssey was authorized by HMG to complete phase 1B of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipwreck.net/pdf/OMEPapers1-SussexShipwreckProject.pdf, The HMS Sussex Shipwreck Project (Site E-82) Preliminary Report - Odyssey Paper 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Odyssey could complete Phase 1B of the ''Sussex'' project plan, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the [[Andalusia|Junta of Andalusia]] in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwreck.net/pr114.php, Odyssey Marine Provides Sussex Update], August 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In early June 2006, Odyssey provided clarification to Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the offices of the embassy of the United Kingdom. Odyssey then awaited final comments on the plan before resuming operations on the shipwreck believed to be that of the ''Sussex''.

In March 2007, Andalusia gave its assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archaeologists take part in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated was indeed the ''Sussex'' and not a Spanish vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/ultimo/busca/tesoro/HMS/Sussex/elpeputec/20070324elpepuult_1/Tes En busca del tesoro del 'HMS Sussex'] &lt;span style="font-size: 0.95em; font-weight: bold; color:#555; position: relative;"&gt;(Spanish&lt;!--I think--&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ELPAIS.com, 24 March 2007. Retrieved on 2007-05-20&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting for Andalusia to appoint an archaeologist to participate in the ''Sussex'' expedition, the company began operations on the "Black Swan" salvage (see below) and since then, Spain has rescinded all cooperation with the company.

== Frigate ''Mercedes'' ==

{{main|Black Swan Project}}
In May 2007, the company announced the salvage of 17 tons of mainly silver and some gold coins from a wreck in an undisclosed location "in international waters". The shipwreck was later proved to be that of the Spanish frigate ''[[Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml BBC Radio World Service Broadcast, "What Lies Beneath" First broadcast Friday 22 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; which blew up and sank in the [[Action of 5 October 1804]].&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/18/america/NA-GEN-US-Treasure-Ship.php?page=1 Shipwreck yields estimated $500 million in gold and silver coins] - [[International Herald Tribune]], May 18, 2007 [Obtained May 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery, Odyssey brought the coins and artifacts recovered into the jurisdiction of the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States Federal Court]] by filing an admiralty arrest pursuant to admiralty law. At that time, the Spanish government claimed that they believed the site was in Spanish territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-suspicious-over-163250m-treasure-haul-449767.html, Spain suspicious over £250m treasure haul - Independent UK, May 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]] has since conceded that claim and sought to claim the discovered treasure based on their belief that the ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' should be afforded sovereign immunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1738445,00.html - Spain Claims Sunken Treasure - TIME Magazine], May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2007, the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] seized the Odyssey Marine Exploration research vessel ''Ocean Alert'' {{convert|3.5|nmi|km|0}} off the European coast. The Spanish Civil Guard claims to be responsible for customs control and European Union borders in this region, under the EU [[Schengen Agreement]]. This, however, is disputed by the [[Government of Gibraltar]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] who claim that the ship was detained in [[international waters]] near Gibraltar and that Spain therefore had no legal authority to board the vessel without the express consent of the flag state of the ship—in this case, [[Panama]]. The Gibraltar Government stated that although this was a matter for the Government of Panama, they are "concerned that international shipping using Gibraltar port should be interfered with in this way in international waters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Brian | last=Reyes | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=ODYSSEY VESSEL FORCED TO ALGECIRAS BY GUARDIA CIVIL | date=2007-07-13 | publisher= | url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=11619 | work=[[The Gibraltar Chronicle]] | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5juVAoSpk?url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=11619 | archivedate=2009-09-19 | pages= | accessdate=2009-09-19 | language= | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. federal judge awarded the treasure to Spain in December 2009, on the ground that the ship remained the property of Spain, but Odyssey appealed the ruling. Finally, after a five-year legal battle, in February 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Odyssey Marine to relinquish the treasure to Spanish authorities. Spain's culture minister indicated the treasure would be divided among several national museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/spanish-treasure-comes-home-after-200-years.html LA Times article on Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, a U.S. district judge further ruled that Odyssey had acted in "bad faith", should have recognized Spain's right, and should thus reimburse $1 million in Spain's attorneys fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penn|first1=Ivan|title=Odyssey Marine ordered to pay Spain $1 million in Black Swan case|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/odyssey-marine-ordered-to-pay-spain-1-million-in-black-swan-case/2144658|accessdate=2 January 2016|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odyssey then issued a statement recognizing that this case was unusual and that the court ruling has clarified the applicable law, which Odyssey is committed to respecting.

== Other underwater searches ==
In 2009, Odyssey Marine Exploration's searches were the subject of the [[Discovery Channel]] program, [[Treasure Quest (TV series)|''Treasure Quest'']].  

In 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration was selected to salvage gold from the 1857 shipwreck of the [[SS Central America|SS ''Central America'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Odyssey Marine Exploration to salvage gold from 1857 shipwreck | date=5 May 2014 | publisher=[[Tampa Bay Times]] | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/odyssey-marine-exploration-to-salvage-gold-from-1857-shipwreck/2178347 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506045810/http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/odyssey-marine-exploration-to-salvage-gold-from-1857-shipwreck/2178347 | archivedate=6 May 2014 | df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial difficulties ==
Odyssey's stock price fell below $1 in 2014 and traded even lower in 2015.

In December 2015, Odyssey announced the sale of part of its assets to a company called [[Monaco Financials]] for $21 million. This capital allowed the company to reimburse a $11.7 million bank debt. Sold assets included the company's headquarters building in Florida, 50% of underwater mining business Neptune Minerals and a profit-sharing agreement on future shipwreck salvages. CEO Mark Gordon also stated that the company would refocus on underwater mining, while treasure hunting would remain "part of the mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trigaux|first=Robert|title=Day before bank loan due, Odyssey Marine sells part of business for $21 million|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/corporate/odyssey-marine-sells-part-of-business-for-21-million/2257960|accessdate=2 January 2016|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===

[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.

'''Río Frías Formation''' ({{lang-es|Formación Río Frías}}) is a [[Miocene|Middle Miocene]] [[geologic formation]] made up [[sedimentary rock]] located in [[Aysén Region]], western Patagonia. The formation crops out along the upper couse of [[Cisnes River]] ({{lang-es|Río Cisnes}}).&lt;ref name=MarshallSalinas1990&gt;Marshall &amp; Salinas, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marsupial]] fossils have been found in the formation.&lt;ref name=Marshall1990&gt;Marshall, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Friasian]] period in the [[South American Land Mammal Ages]] is named after the formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=displayInterval&amp;interval_no=728 Paleo Database: Friasian]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Río Frías Formation was discovered by Santiago Roth in the summer of 1897–98. Roth was a Swiss immigrant who had been sent to survey the area by [[Francisco Moreno]]. Moreno was director of [[La Plata Museum]] and was involved in the [[Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile)|Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case]] between Chile and Argentina, thus there was both a political and scientific motivation behind the exploration of Patagonia. Santiago Roth called the upper course of Río Cisnes for Río Frías being unaware that it was the same river. Further he thought this unexplored area to be in Argentina and not in Chile. This led the formation to acquire its name.&lt;ref name=MarshallSalinas1990/&gt; Roth sent fossils he collected from the formation to [[Florentino Ameghino]] who was active at La Plata. It was with this fossils Ameghino established the [[Friasian]] period.&lt;ref name=MarshallSalinas1990/&gt; Later research on &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar data revealed the base of the formation dating to 16.5 Ma, which means a slight overlap with the [[Santacrucian]] land mammal age (ending at 16.3 Ma).&lt;ref name=Bostelmann2012_p44&gt;Bostelmann et al., 2012, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The formation was deposited in a [[fluvial]] [[depositional environment|environment]], characterized by an  intermontane valley flanked by [[Cretaceous]] [[basement (geology)|basement]] rocks.&lt;ref name=Bellosi2014_p40&gt;Bellosi et al., 2014, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil quality reflects how well a soil performs the functions of maintaining [[biodiversity]] and productivity, partitioning water and solute flow, filtering and buffering, [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], and providing support for plants and other structures. [[Soil management]] has a major impact on soil quality. 

Soil quality in agricultural terms is measured on a scale of [[soil value]] (''Bodenwertzahl'') in [[Germany]].

Soil quality is related to soil function. Unlike water or air, for which established standards have been set, soil quality is difficult to define or quantify. Soil quality can be evaluated using the Soil Management Assessment Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherubin|first=Maurício Roberto|last2=Tormena|first2=Cássio Antônio|last3=Karlen|first3=Douglas L.|last4=Cherubin|first4=Maurício Roberto|last5=Tormena|first5=Cássio Antônio|last6=Karlen|first6=Douglas L.|date=00/2017|title=Soil Quality Evaluation Using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in Brazilian Oxisols with Contrasting Texture|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0100-06832017000100503&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciência do Solo|volume=41|doi=10.1590/18069657rbcs20160148|issn=0100-0683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spotted bamboo''' refers to several types of [[bamboo]] with stems that are mottled by dark spots, sometimes considered to be within the genus ''[[Phyllostachys]]'' and forms of ''Phyllostachys bambusoides'', also known as '''teardrop bamboo'''&lt;ref&gt;Cherrett, 16&lt;/ref&gt; and as '''mottled bamboo'''.  '''''Phyllostachys bambusoides'' forma. ''lacrima-deae''''' is widely encountered.

==Distribution==
''Phyllostachys bambusoides'' forma. ''lacrima-deae'', is native to [[Hunan]], [[Henan]], [[Jianxi]] and [[Zhejiang]], and especially the [[Jiuyi Mountains]] areas of [[China]].

==Uses==
The stems of the spotted bamboos are esteemed and cost-effective for making the handles of [[Ink brush|Chinese brushes]], used for calligraphy and painting.

Examples of brushes from the eighth century CE (corresponding to the [[Tang Dynasty]], in China) are preserved in the [[Shōsōin]], in Japan; in fact, the prestige value of this type of bamboo was evidently so high at the time that among the Shōsōin treasures are preserved objects made out of some sort of imitation spotted bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary origins==
Legend has it that when [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Emperor Shun]] died suddenly during a trip to [[Cangwu]], the tears of his two concubines, (the [[Xiang River goddesses]] Ehuang (娥皇) and Nüying (女英)) dropped onto surrounding bamboo and stained it forever.{{sfnp|Murck|2000|p=9}} Mottled bamboo is known for being a decorative plant. The Chinese name of {{CJKV|t=湘妃竹|s=湘妃竹|p=Xiāngfēi zhú}} originates from the legend. ''Xiang'' (湘) refers to the [[Xiang River]], where the story supposedly took place, ''fei'' (妃) means "concubine" and ''zhu'' (竹) means "bamboo", thus the "bamboo of the concubines by the Xiang River".

The term "mottled bamboo" is also used to describe online discussion board moderators in [[Mainland China]], because when the word for moderator (版主) is entered using the keyboard in [[Pinyin]], the word for mottled bamboo (斑竹) appears as the first option, as they sound very similar. Hence, mottled bamboo gradually became another way of calling a moderator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3807">The '''Stefan flow''', occasionally called '''Stefan's flow''', is a [[transport phenomenon]] concerning the movement of a [[chemical species]] by a flowing [[fluid]] (typically in the [[gas phase]]) that is induced to [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] by the production or removal of the species at an [[interface (chemistry)|interface]]. Any process that adds the species of interest to or removes it from the flowing fluid may cause the Stefan flow, but the most common processes include [[evaporation]], [[condensation]], [[chemical reaction]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], [[ablation]], [[adsorption]], [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], and [[desorption]]. It was named after the Austrian physicist, mathematician, and poet [[Joseph Stefan|Josef Stefan]] for his early work on calculating evaporation rates.

The Stefan flow is distinct from [[diffusion]] as described by [[Fick's law]], but diffusion almost always also occurs in multi-species systems that are experiencing the Stefan flow.&lt;ref&gt;Counter example?&lt;/ref&gt;  In systems undergoing one of the species addition or removal processes mentioned previously, the addition or removal generates a mean flow in the flowing fluid as the fluid next to the interface is displaced by the production or removal of additional fluid by the processes occurring at the interface. The transport of the species by this mean flow is the Stefan flow.  When concentration gradients of the species are also present, diffusion transports the species relative to the mean flow. The total transport rate of the species is then given by a summation of the Stefan flow and diffusive contributions.

An example of the Stefan flow occurs when a [[droplet]] of liquid evaporates in air.  In this case, the [[vapor]]/air mixture surrounding the droplet is the flowing fluid, and liquid/vapor boundary of the droplet is the interface. As heat is absorbed by the droplet from the [[environment (systems)|environment]], some of the liquid evaporates into vapor at the surface of the droplet, and flows away from the droplet as it is displaced by additional vapor evaporating from the droplet.  This process causes the flowing medium to move away from the droplet at some mean speed that is dependent on the evaporation rate and other factors such as droplet size and composition. In addition to this mean flow, a concentration gradient must exist in the neighborhood of the droplet (assuming an isolated droplet) since the flowing medium is mostly air far from the droplet and mostly vapor near the droplet.  This gradient causes Fickian diffusion that transports the vapor away from the droplet and the air towards it, with respect to the mean flow.  Thus, in the [[Frame of reference|frame]] of the droplet, the flow of vapor away from the droplet is faster than for the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working in the same direction as the mean flow.  However, the flow of air away from the droplet is slower than the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working to transport air back towards the droplet against the Stefan flow.  Such flow from evaporating droplets is important in understanding the combustion of liquid fuels such as diesel in internal combustion engines, and in the design of such engines. The Stefan flow from evaporating droplets and subliming ice particles also plays prominently in [[meteorology]] as it influences the formation and dispersion of clouds and precipitation.

Other named peaks in the small group are Gold Butte (6,512 feet), East Butte (with two peaks, the taller of which at 6,958&amp;nbsp;ft), and Mount Lebanon (5807&amp;nbsp;ft). 
The Sweet Grass Hills are an example of the island ranges that dot the central third portion of the state of [[Montana]]. These island ranges, completely surrounded by the 'sea' of plains and not geographically (or often geologically) part of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west, are "biological hotspots", containing more species than the prairie below.

==Formation and natural features==
[[File:MilkriverAB.JPG|thumb|The Sweetgrass Hills as seen from [[Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park]] in Canada.]]
The hills were formed in the early [[Paleogene]] period, and geologically are known as [[Stock (geology)|stocks]] - [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] [[igneous]] rock forced up from below and solidified. Because of uplift and erosion, the overlying rock formations have disappeared. The upper slopes of the hills have not been glaciated and would have stood above the [[Laurentide ice sheet|ice sheet]] that covered the area during the last [[ice age]].&lt;ref name="beatty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beaty |first=Chester |title=The Landscapes of Southern Alberta, A Regional Geomorphology |publisher=University of Lethbridge |location=Lethbridge, Alberta |year=1975 |isbn=&lt;!--none--&gt;}} pp.84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sweet Grass Hills are at a higher elevation than the surrounding prairie, temperatures are cooler and precipitation is higher. Forested areas, consisting mainly of [[Douglas fir]], are therefore able to grow on the hills' slopes.&lt;ref name = "beatty"/&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The Sweet Grass Hills are a [[sacred site]] of the [[Blackfoot]] aboriginal people who live on both sides of the [[49th parallel north]] which forms the [[Canada–United States border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Montana Magazine of Western History |volume=52 |number=1 |pages=2–17 |date=Winter 2002 |url=http://www.visitmt.com/history/Montana_the_Magazine_of_Western_History/Winter02/medicineline.htm |publisher=Montana Historical Society Press |location=Helena, Montana |author=Michael Hogue |title=Disputing the Medicine Line-The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876-1885 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902123242/http://visitmt.com/history/Montana_the_Magazine_of_Western_History/Winter02/medicineline.htm |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaDow |first=Beth |title=The medicine line : life and death on a North American borderland |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn= 0-415-92764-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=C.

A '''terrestrial gamma-ray flash''' ('''TGF''') is a burst of [[gamma ray]]s produced in Earth's atmosphere. TGFs have been recorded to last 0.2 to 3.5 [[millisecond]]s, and have [[energy|energies]] of up to 20 million [[electronvolt]]s. It is speculated that TGFs are caused by intense [[electric field]]s produced above or inside [[thunderstorm]]s. Scientists have also detected energetic [[positron]]s and [[electron]]s produced by terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Discovery ==

Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes were first discovered in 1994 by [[BATSE]], or Burst and Transient Source Experiment, on the [[Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]], a [[NASA]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name=Fishman-1994/&gt;  A subsequent study from [[Stanford University]] in 1996 linked a TGF to an individual [[lightning]] strike occurring within a few milliseconds of the TGF.  BATSE detected only a small number of TGF events in nine years (76), due to its having been constructed to study gamma ray bursts from outer space, which last much longer.

In the early 2000s, the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager ([[Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager|RHESSI]]) satellite observed TGFs with much higher energies than those recorded by BATSE.&lt;ref name=Smith-et-al-2005/&gt; The RHESSI data led scientists to estimate that approximately 50 TGFs occur each day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html|title=Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning|last=Administrator|first=NASA|date=2013-06-07|work=NASA|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than previously thought but still only representing a very small fraction of the total lightning on Earth (3-4 million lightning events per day on average). A few years later, scientists using NASA's [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], which was designed to monitor gamma rays, estimated that about 500 TGFs occur daily worldwide, but most go undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html|title=Fermi Catches Antimatter-Hurling Storms|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2015-06-26|work=NASA|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==

[[Image:TGF production by quasi-static fields.svg|thumb|Hypothetical TGF production above a thundercloud driven by decaying fields after a large lightning discharge.]]
Though the details of the mechanism are uncertain, there is a consensus forming about the physical requirements. It is presumed that TGF photons are emitted by electrons traveling at speeds very close to the speed of light that collide with the nuclei of atoms in the air and release their energy in the form of gamma rays ([[bremsstrahlung]] &lt;ref name=Koehn-2014a/&gt;).  Large populations of energetic electrons can form by avalanche growth driven by [[electric fields]], a phenomenon called [[relativistic runaway electron avalanche]] (RREA).&lt;ref name=Gurevich-1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dwyer-2003/&gt; The electric field is likely provided by lightning, as most TGFs have been shown to occur within a few milliseconds of a lightning event (Inan et al. 1996).&lt;ref name=Cummer-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inan-2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen-et-al-2006/&gt;  Beyond this basic picture the details are uncertain. Recent research has shown that electron-electron ([[Bremsstrahlung]]) &lt;ref name=Koehn-2014/&gt; leads first to an enrichment of high-energy electrons and subsequently enlarges the number of high-energy photons.

Some of standard theoretical frameworks have been borrowed from other lightning-associated discharges like [[upper-atmospheric lightning|sprites, blue jets, and elves]], which were discovered in the years immediately preceding the first TGF observations.  For instance, that field may be due to the separation of charges in a thundercloud ("DC" field) often associated with sprites, or due to the [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) produced by a lightning discharge, often associated with elves.  There is also some evidence that certain TGFs occur in the absence of lightning strikes, though in the vicinity of general lightning activity, which has evoked comparisons to blue jets.

[[Image:TGF production by EMP.svg|left|thumb|Hypothetical TGF production near a thundercloud driven by electromagnetic waves radiated by a large lightning current pulse.]]
The DC field model requires a very large thundercloud charge to create sufficient fields at high altitudes (e.g. 50–90&amp;nbsp;km, where sprites form).  Unlike the case of sprites, these large charges do not seem to be associated with TGF-generating lightning.&lt;ref name=Cummer-2005/&gt;  Thus the DC field model requires the TGF to occur lower down, at the top of the thundercloud (10–20&amp;nbsp;km) where a local field can be stronger.  This hypothesis is supported by two independent observations.  First, the spectrum of the gamma-rays seen by RHESSI matches very well to the prediction of relativistic runaway at 15–20&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Dwyer-Smith-2005/&gt; Second, TGFs are strongly concentrated around Earth's equator when compared to lightning.&lt;ref name=Williams-et-al-2006/&gt;  (They may also be concentrated over water compared to lightning in general.)  [[Thundercloud]] tops are higher near the [[equator]], and thus the gamma-rays from TGFs produced there have a better chance of escaping the atmosphere. The implication would then be that there are many lower-altitude TGFs not seen from space, particularly at higher latitudes.

[[Image:Tgf production near lightning.svg|thumb|Hypothetical TGF production within a thundercloud.]]
An alternative hypothesis, the EMP model,&lt;ref name=Inan-2005/&gt; relaxes the requirement on thundercloud charge but instead requires a large current pulse moving at very high speed.  The required current pulse speed is very restrictive, and there is not yet any direct observational support for this model.

Another hypothetical mechanism is that TGFs are produced within the thundercloud itself, either in the strong electric fields near the lightning channel or in the static fields that exist over large volumes of the cloud.  These mechanisms rely on extreme activity of the lightning channel to start the process (Carlson et al. 2010) or on strong feedback to allow even small-scale random events to trigger production.&lt;ref name=Dwyer-2008/&gt;

It has been suggested that TGFs must also launch beams of highly relativistic electrons and positrons which escape the atmosphere, propagate along Earth's magnetic field and precipitate on the opposite hemisphere .&lt;ref name=Dwyer-et-al-2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs-et-al-2011/&gt;  A few cases of TGFs on RHESSI, BATSE, and Fermi-GBM have shown unusual patterns that can be explained by such electron/positron beams, but such events are very unusual.

Calculations have shown that TGFs can liberate not only positrons, but also neutrons and protons.&lt;ref&gt;Köhn, C., Ebert, U.: Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons and protons associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.

Lett., 111, 115003&lt;/ref&gt; whereas there is no experimental confirmation of discharge related protons (2016). Recent research has shown that the fluence of these neutrons lies between 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; per ms and per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the detection altitude. The energy of most of these neutrons, even with initial energies of 20 MeV, decreases down to the keV range within 1 ms.&lt;ref name="KohnHarakeh"/&gt;

==Other research==
Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes pose a challenge to current theories of lightning, especially with the discovery of the clear signatures of [[antimatter]] produced in lightning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/49288/title/Signature_of_antimatter_detected_in_lightning Signature Of Antimatter Detected In Lightning – Science News]. Sciencenews.org (2009-12-05). Retrieved on 2012-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been discovered in the past 15 years that among the processes of lightning is some mechanism capable of generating [[gamma ray]]s, which escape the atmosphere and are observed by orbiting spacecraft. Brought to light by [[NASA]]'s Gerald Fishman in 1994 in an article in ''Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fishman | first1 = G. J. | last2 = Bhat | first2 = P. N. | last3 = Malozzi | first3 = R. | last4 = Horack | first4 = J. M. | last5 = Koshut | first5 = T. | last6 = Kouvelioton | first6 = C. | last7 = Pendleton | first7 = G.

TGFs are much shorter in duration, however, lasting only about 1 ms.

Professor Umran Inan of [[Stanford University]] linked a TGF to an individual lightning stroke occurring within 1.5&amp;nbsp;ms of the TGF event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=U.S. Inan|author2=S.C.

As quoted by [https://web.archive.org/web/20040609123606/http://elf.gi.alaska.edu/spr20010406.html#InanUS:theatg elf.gi.alaska.edu] Retrieved 2007-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; proving for the first time that the TGF was of atmospheric origin and associated with lightning strikes.

CGRO recorded only about 77 events in 10 years; however, more recently the [[Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager]] (RHESSI) spacecraft, as reported by David Smith of [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]], has been observing TGFs at a much higher rate, indicating that these occur about 50 times per day globally (still a very small fraction of the total lightning on the planet). The energy levels recorded exceed 20 MeV.

Scientists from [[Duke University]] have also been studying the link between certain lightning events and the mysterious gamma ray emissions that emanate from the Earth's own atmosphere, in light of newer observations of TGFs made by RHESSI. Their study suggests that this gamma radiation fountains upward from starting points at surprisingly low altitudes in thunderclouds.

Steven Cummer, from Duke University's [[Edmund T. Pratt Jr. School of Engineering|Pratt School of Engineering]], said, "These are higher energy gamma rays than those coming from the Sun. And yet here they are coming from the kind of terrestrial thunderstorm that we see here all the time."&lt;ref&gt;(Duke Today Staff) (2 May 2005) [https://today.duke.edu/2005/05/gammabolt.html "Gamma rays from thunderstorms?"] ''Duke Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early hypotheses of this pointed to lightning generating high electric fields and driving [[relativistic runaway electron avalanche]] at altitudes well above the cloud where the thin atmosphere allows gamma rays to easily escape into space, similar to the way [[upper-atmospheric lightning|sprites]] are generated. Subsequent evidence however, has suggested instead that TGFs may be produced by driving relativistic electron avalanches within or just above high thunderclouds. Though hindered by atmospheric absorption of the escaping gamma rays, these theories do not require the exceptionally intense lightning that high altitude theories of TGF generation rely on.

The role of TGFs and their relationship to lightning remains a subject of ongoing scientific study.

In 2009, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] in Earth orbit observed intense burst of gamma rays corresponding to positron annihilations coming out of a storm formation. Scientists wouldn't have been surprised to see a few positrons accompanying any intense gamma ray burst, but the lightning flash detected by Fermi appeared to have produced about 100 trillion positrons. This was reported by news media in January 2011, and had never been previously observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/110111-thunderstorms-antimatter-beams-fermi-radiation-science-space/ Thunderstorms Shoot Antimatter Beams Into Space].

The [[Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor]] (ASIM), an experiment dedicated to study TGFs, was launched to the [[International Space Station]] on 2 April 2018 and is scheduled to be mounted on the [[Columbus (ISS_module)#Research activities and payloads|Columbus External Payload Facility]] in late April 2018.&lt;ref name='BBC Halton'&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43585113 Hunting mystery giant lightning from space].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6704">The '''tetrahedral hypothesis''' is an [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] attempting to explain the arrangement of the [[Earth]]'s [[continent]]s and [[ocean]]s by referring to the geometry of a [[tetrahedron]]. Although it was a historically interesting theory in the late 19th and early 20th century, it was superseded by the concepts of [[continental drift]] and modern [[plate tectonics]].

==Theory==

This idea, described as ‘"ingenious" by geologist [[Arthur Holmes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Arthur Holmes]] |title=Principles of physical geology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUJRAAAAMAAJ |year=1965 |orig-year=1944 |publisher=Nelson |page=32 |isbn=0-17-448020-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is now of historical interest only, being finally refuted by that same Holmes (see reference 7). It attempted to explain apparent anomalies in the distribution of land and water on the Earth's surface:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= A. Z. Bukhari |title=Encyclopedia of nature of geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vef_5GExuUgC&amp;pg=PA109 |year=2005 |publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. Limited |isbn=978-81-261-2443-5 |chapter= Continental Drift |pages=109–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*More than 75% of the Earth's land area is in the [[northern hemisphere]].
*Continents are roughly triangular.
*Oceans are roughly triangular.
*The north pole is surrounded by water, the south pole by land.
*Exactly opposite the Earth from land is almost always water.
*The [[Pacific Ocean]] occupies about one third of the Earth's surface.

To understand its appeal, consider the "regular solids": the [[sphere]] and the 5-member set of [[Platonic Solids]]. The solid with the lowest number of sides is the [[tetrahedron]] (four equilateral triangles);  progressing through the hexahedron or [[cube]], the [[octahedron]], the [[dodecahedron]] and the [[icosahedron]] (20 sides), the sphere can be considered to have an infinite number of sides. All six regular solids share many symmetries.

Now, for each regular solid, we may relate its surface area and volume by the equation:
: &lt;math&gt;V = k\times A \times\sqrt{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where'' k'' is a characteristic of each solid, ''V'' its volume, and ''A'' its area. As we traverse the set in order of increasing number of faces, we find that k increases for each member;  it is 0.0227 for a tetrahedron and 0.0940 for a sphere. Thus the tetrahedron is the regular solid with the largest surface area for a given volume, and makes a reasonable endpoint for a shrinking spherical Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Physical Geography |publisher=APH Publishing |year=2004 |isbn= 978-81-7648-731-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXkdMyGF_wgC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84 |pages= 84–85 |author9=S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The law of least action … demands that the somewhat rigid crustal portion of the earth keep in contact with the lessening interior with the least possible readjustment of its surface. … a shrinking sphere tends by the law of least action to collapse into a tetrahedron, or a tetra-hedroid, a sphere marked by four equal and equidistant triangular projections; and the earth with its three about equal and equidistant double continental masses triangular southward with three intervening depressed oceans triangular northward, its northern ocean and southern continent, with land everywhere antipodal to water, realizes the tetrahedroid status remarkably.“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Tetrahedral Deformations and Intercontinental Torsions |author = [[Benjamin Kendall Emerson]] |work= Proceedings, American Philosophical Society |volume= 56 |number= 6 |year= 1917 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lULAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA445 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-1-4223-7253-1 |pages=445–472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is suggesting that a cooling spherical Earth might have shrunk to form a tetrahedron, with its vertices and edges forming the continents, and four oceans ([[Pacific Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]) on its faces.

By 1915 German [[Alfred Wegener]] (1880–1930) had proposed in his [[continental drift]] theory that land masses moved great distances over the Earth's history. Wegener was also at first met with hostile reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) |url= http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/wegener.html |work= [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] web site |publisher= University of California |year= 2006 |accessdate= August 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1920s Holmes had developed theories on what could cause the drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Origin of the Continents |author= [[Arthur Holmes]] |journal= Nature |date= June 6, 1925 |doi= 10.1038/115873a0 |pages= 873–874 |volume= 115 |issue=2901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Theory of Continental Drift: a Symposium on the Origin and Movement of Land Masses, both Inter-Continental and Intra-Continental, as proposed by Alfred Wegener |author= [[Arthur Holmes]] |journal= Nature |date= September 22, 1928 |doi= 10.1038/122431a0 |pages= 431–433 |volume= 122 |issue=3073}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[plate tectonics]] theory is now generally accepted to explain the dynamic nature of the Earth's surface; the tetrahedral shape plays no special role in modern theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Plate Tectonics: The Rocky History of an Idea  |url= http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/techist.html |work= [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] web site |publisher= University of California |year= 2006 |accessdate= August 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Explanations of details such as water to land ratios, the precise shape of continents and their sizes continue to be developed.

'''''Throwim Way Leg''''' is a book written by Australian zoologist and [[climate change]] activist [[Tim Flannery]]. It documents Flannery's experiences conducting scientific research in the highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]] and Indonesian [[Western New Guinea]]. The book describes the flora and fauna of the island and the cultures of the various tribes. The title is an anglicised spelling of the [[Tok Pisin|New Guinean Pidgin]] "Tromoi Lek," to go on a journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Tiangong-2''' ({{zh |c = {{linktext|天|宫|二|号}} |p = Tiāngōng èrhào |l = Celestial Palace 2}}) is a [[China|Chinese]] space laboratory and part of the [[Project 921-2]] [[space station]] program.  Tiangong-2 was launched on 15 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=de Selding |first=Peter B. |url = http://spacenews.com/china-prepares-assembly-of-its-space-station-invites-collaboration-through-u-n/ |title=China prepares assembly of its space station, invites collaboration through U.N. |date=20 June 2016|publisher=Space News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiangong-2 is neither designed nor planned to be a permanent orbital station; rather, it is intended as a testbed for key technologies that will be used in the [[Chinese large modular space station]], which is planned for launch between 2019 and 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-space-idUSKBN17U0GG China to begin construction of manned space station in 2019] Reuters April 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[China Manned Space Engineering Office]] published a brief description of Tiangong-2 and its successor [[Tiangong-3]] in 2008, indicating that at least two crewed spaceships would be launched to dock with Tiangong-2.&lt;ref name="ukg20110426"/&gt;

Tiangong-2 was originally expected to be launched by the [[China National Space Agency]] by 2015&lt;ref name="GBT"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gbtimes.com/china/china-launch-tiangong-2-and-cargo-spacecraft-2015 |title=China to launch Tiangong-2 and cargo spacecraft in 2015 |publisher=GB Times |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the prototype module [[Tiangong-1]], which was launched in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15089720 "Tiangong-1 launch betrays China's earthly ambitions"]. [[BBC]]. 29 September 2011. Retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Chinese officials stated that Tiangong-2 was scheduled to be launched by 2015.&lt;ref name=GBT/&gt;&lt;ref name=sdc20110307&gt;

The Space Review. 15 October 2009. Retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, its launch was postponed to September 2016.&lt;ref name=SpaceDaily-2014-09-11&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinas_Space_Station_is_Still_On_Track_999.html |title= China's Space Station is Still On Track |author= Morris Jones |publisher= SpaceDaily |date= 11 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for visits in October 2016 by the crewed mission [[Shenzhou 11]] and the uncrewed resupply craft [[Tianzhou (spacecraft)|Tianzhou]] were made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/China_to_launch_second_space_lab_in_2016_official_999.html |title= China to launch second space lab in 2016: official |date= 10 September 2014 |publisher= SpaceDaily |author= AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was successfully launched from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center|Jiuquan]] aboard a [[Long March 2F]] rocket on 15 September 2016.&lt;ref name=CCTV-2016-09-15&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goRzJM4PIEI |title= China successfully launches Tiangong-2 space lab |publisher= [[CCTV News]] |date= 15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shenzhou 11]] successfully docked with Tiangong-2 on 19 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cctv-america.com/2016/10/18/chinas-shenzhou-11-preparing-to-dock-with-tiangong-2-spacelab|title=China’s Shenzhou-11 successfully docks with Tiangong-2 spacelab|website=CCTV America|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboard the Shenzhou 11, launched from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] in the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] desert, were Commander [[Jing Haipeng]] and [[Chen Dong (astronaut)|Chen Dong]] who formed the inaugural crew for the space laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/20/two-crewed-space-stations-now-orbiting-earth-spacewatch|title=Two crewed space stations now orbiting Earth|last=Clark|first=Stuart|date=2016-10-20|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was China's first manned mission for more than three years.

During the 30 days the two astronauts were aboard Tiangong-2, they conducted a number of scientific and technical experiments on the physiological effects of [[weightlessness]], tests on human-machine collaboration on in-orbit maintenance technology and released an accompanying satellite successfully. Accompanying photography and near-distance fly-by observation were also carried out. They collected abundant data and made some achievements in programs of [[gamma-ray burst]] polarimeter, space cold [[atomic clock]] and preparation of new materials.&lt;ref name="shenzhou-11_land"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://china.org.cn/china/2016-11/19/content_39742416.htm |title=SCIO briefing on China's Tiangong 2 and Shenzhou 11 manned space mission |publisher=China.org.cn |accessdate=24 November 2016 |date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shenzhou 11 separated from the orbiting Tiangong-2 space lab on November 17, reentry module landed successfully at the expected site in central [[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]] at about 13:59 Beijing Time.&lt;ref name="shenzhou-11_land" /&gt;

On April 22, 2017, the cargo vessel [[Tianzhou-1]] successfully docked with Tiangong-2 marking the first successful docking and refuelling with the orbiting space laboratory.&lt;ref name="tianzhou-1" /&gt; It subsequently performed a second docking and refueling on June 15, 2017. On September 12, 2017, Tianzhou-1 performed the third and final docking and refuelling with Tiangong 2, with what is termed a fast docking which took 6.5 hours, rather than 2 days, to complete.&lt;ref name="gt-170912"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://gbtimes.com/chinas-tianzhou-1-cargo-craft-and-tiangong-2-space-lab-perform-final-orbital-docking |title=China's Tianzhou-1 cargo craft and Tiangong-2 space lab perform final orbital docking |publisher=GBTimes |date=12 September 2017 |accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Tiangong 2 performed orbital maneuvers lowering the orbit to 292 × 297 kilometers, likely in preparation for deorbiting. It has since returned to its usual orbit.&lt;ref name=EOL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/china-appears-to-be-preparing-to-deorbit-its-tiangong-2-space-lab/ |title=China appears to be preparing to deorbit its Tiangong 2 space lab |author=Andrew Jones |publisher=Spacenews |date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/tiangong-2-chinese-space-station-lowers-in-altitude-no-explanation |title=China's Space Station Got Weirdly Close to Earth For a Few Days And The Government Isn't Talking |author=Michelle Starr |publisher=Science Alert |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VISAR is a useful tool in determining the pressure-density relationship of a material known as the [[Rankine-Hugoniot conditions]] or simply the "Hugoniot".  

In recent years another time-resolved velocity measurement tool called [[laser Doppler velocimetry]] has achieved popularity in the shock physics community as an adjunct or replacement for VISAR.  This device is essentially a Displacement interferometer of the normal Michelson variety.  As such it requires extremely fast data acquisition devices (digital oscilloscopes with bandwidths of 10GHz or higher) and is limited in the range of velocities it can cover. As the surface moves, the reflected light interferes with itself and sinusoidal 'fringes' in light intensity are produced and recorded.  A cycle of light intensity or fringe count indicates a displacement of the surface corresponding to one wavelength of the light.  The rate at which these fringes occur is thus proportional to the velocity of the surface.  To derive a velocity history the fringe (displacement) data must be differentiated with respect to time, usually by Fourier Analysis.  This differentiation or FA step inevitably reduces the time resolution and accuracy of the velocity history.

The VISAR on the other hand is configured to 'optically differentiate' so that the light intensity variation due to interference varies sinusoidally with the '''velocity''' of the surface not the displacement.  Also called a 'Delay-Leg Interferometer,' it is an extremely clever device and remains the best and most accurate method for recording the velocity history of fast moving surfaces.

The original VISARs were built at the National Laboratories and had free-space beams on optical tables with discrete optical components such as beam-splitting pellicles, mirrors, quarter wave delay plates, glass etalons, high voltage photo-multiplier tubes, Argon ion lasers and so on. They required a fair amount of expertise to maintain.  

Modern versions such as the Mark IV-3000 from Martin, Froeschner &amp; Associates (mfaoptics.com) implement the same optical arrangement entirely in single-mode optical fibre with all solid state telecomm components such as InGaAs photodiodes, Er doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) and extremely high purity (&lt;2kHz linewidth) lasers.  Velocity resolution down to 0.01 m/s has been demonstrated with time resolution &lt;1ns.

In [[physics]], a '''wavefront''' is the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of [[Point (geometry)|point]]s characterized by propagation of positions of identical [[Phase (waves)|phase]]: propagation of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in 1D, a [[curve]] in 2D or a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] in 3D.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Principles of Physics'', P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, {{ISBN|0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For an electromagnetic wave, the wavefront is represented as a surface of identical phase, and can be modified with conventional optics.   For instance, a [[lens (optics)|lens]] can change the shape of optical wavefronts from planar  to spherical as the lens introduces a spatial phase variation across the beam shape.  

[[File:Plane wave wavefronts 3D.svg|right|thumb|The wavefronts of a [[plane wave]] are [[Plane (mathematics)|planes]].]]
[[File:Lens and wavefronts.gif|right|frame|]]

==Simple wavefronts and propagation==
Optical systems can be described with [[Maxwell's equations]], and linear propagating waves such as sound or electron beams have similar wave equations. However, given the above simplifications, [[Huygens' principle]] provides a quick method to predict the propagation of a wavefront through, for example, [[free space]]. The construction is as follows: Let every point on the wavefront be considered a new [[point source]]. By calculating the total effect from every point source, the resulting field at new points can be computed. Computational algorithms are often based on this approach. Specific cases for simple wavefronts can be computed directly. For example, a spherical wavefront will remain spherical as the energy of the wave is carried away equally in all directions. Such directions of energy flow, which are always perpendicular to the wavefront, are called [[ray (geometry)|rays]] creating multiple wavefronts.&lt;ref&gt;''University Physics – With Modern Physics (12th Edition)'', H.D. Young, R.A. Freedman (Original edition), Addison-Wesley (Pearson International), 1st Edition: 1949, 12th Edition: 2008, {{ISBN|0-321-50130-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-321-50130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of a wavefront is the [[plane wave]], where the rays are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to one another. The light from this type of wave is referred to as [[collimated]] light. The plane wavefront is a good model for a surface-section of a very large spherical wavefront; for instance, sunlight strikes the earth with a spherical wavefront that has a radius of about 150 million kilometers (1 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]). For many purposes, such a wavefront can be considered planar over distances of the diameter of Earth.

Wavefront travel with the speed of light in all directions in an isotropic medium.

==Wavefront aberrations==

{{Main article|Optical aberration}}

Methods utilizing wavefront measurements or predictions can be considered an advanced approach to lens optics, where a single focal distance may not exist due to lens thickness or imperfections. Note also that for manufacturing reasons, a perfect lens has a spherical (or toroidal) surface shape though, theoretically, the ideal surface would be ''aspheric''. Shortcomings such as these in an optical system cause what are called [[Aberration in optical systems|optical aberrations]]. The best-known aberrations include [[spherical aberration]] and [[Coma (optics)|coma]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition)'', R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However there may be more complex sources of aberrations such as in a large telescope due to spatial variations in the index of refraction of the atmosphere. The deviation of a wavefront in an optical system from a desired perfect planar wavefront is called the ''wavefront aberration''. Wavefront aberrations are usually described as either a sampled image or a collection of two-dimensional polynomial terms. Minimization of these aberrations is considered desirable for many applications in optical systems.

==Wavefront sensor and reconstruction techniques==

A [[wavefront sensor]] is a device which measures the wavefront aberration in a coherent signal to describe the optical quality or lack thereof in an optical system. A very common method is to use a [[Shack-Hartmann]] [[lenslet]] array. There are many applications that include [[adaptive optics]], optical metrology and even the measurement of the [[aberrations of the eye|aberrations]] in the [[human eye|eye]] itself. In this approach, a weak laser source is directed into the eye and the reflection off the [[retina]] is sampled and processed.

Alternative wavefront sensing techniques to the [[Shack-Hartmann]] system are emerging. Mathematical techniques like phase imaging or curvature sensing are also capable of providing wavefront estimations. These algorithms compute wavefront images from conventional brightfield images at different focal planes without the need for specialised wavefront optics. While Shack-Hartmann lenslet arrays are limited in lateral resolution to the size of the lenslet array, techniques such as these are only limited by the resolution of digital images used to compute the wavefront measurements.

Another application of software reconstruction of the phase is the control of telescopes through the use of adaptive optics. A common method is the Roddier test, also called wavefront curvature sensing. It yields good correction, but needs an already good system as a starting point.

'''Woodworking''' is the activity or skill of making items from [[wood]], and includes cabinet making ([[cabinetry]] and [[furniture]]), [[wood carving]], [[woodworking joints|joinery]], [[carpentry]], and [[woodturning]].

==History==
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 004.jpg|thumb|Ancient Egyptian woodworking]]
Along with [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[clay]] and animal parts, wood was one of the first materials worked by [[early human]]s. [[Lithic analysis|Microwear analysis]] of the [[Mousterian]] [[stone tool]]s used by the [[Neanderthal]]s show that many were used to work wood. The development of civilization was closely tied to the development of increasingly greater degrees of skill in working these materials.

[[File:Schreiner-1568.png|thumb|250px|Woodworking shop in Germany in 1568, the worker in front is using a [[bow saw]], the one in the background is [[plane (tool)|planing]].]]
Among early finds of wooden tools are the worked sticks from [[Kalambo Falls]], [[Clacton-on-Sea]] and [[Lehringen]]. The [[spear]]s from [[Schöningen]] ([[Germany]]) provide some of the first examples of wooden hunting gear. [[Flint]] tools were used for carving. Since [[Neolithic|Neolithic times]], carved wooden vessels are known, for example, from the [[Linear Pottery culture]] [[water well|well]]s at [[Kückhofen]] and [[Eythra]].

Examples of [[Bronze Age]] wood-carving include [[tree trunk]]s worked into [[coffin]]s from northern Germany and [[Denmark]] and wooden [[folding chair|folding-chair]]s. The [[List of archaeological sites by country|site]] of [[Fellbach-Schmieden]] in Germany has provided fine examples of wooden animal statues from the [[Iron Age]]. Wooden [[Cult image|idol]]s from the [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period are known from a sanctuary at the source of the [[Seine]] in [[France]].

===Ancient Egypt===
There is significant evidence of advanced woodworking in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Killen1994"&gt;{{cite book | title=Egyptian Woodworking and Furniture | publisher=Shire Publications | author=Killen, Geoffrey | year=1994 | isbn=0747802394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodworking is depicted in many extant ancient Egyptian drawings, and a considerable amount of ancient Egyptian [[furniture]] (such as stools, [[chair]]s, [[Table (furniture)|tables]], [[bed]]s, [[Chest (furniture)|chests]]) has been preserved. Tombs represent a large collection of these artefacts and the inner coffins found in the tombs were also made of wood. The [[metal]] used by the [[Egyptians]] for woodworking tools was originally [[copper]] and eventually, after 2000 BC [[bronze]] as [[ironworking]] was unknown until much later.&lt;ref&gt;Leospo, Enrichetta (2001), "Woodworking in Ancient Egypt", ''The Art of Woodworking'', [[Turin]]: [[Museo Egizio]], p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly used woodworking tools included [[axe]]s, [[adze]]s, [[chisel]]s, [[saw|pull saws]], and [[bow drill]]s. [[Mortise and tenon]] joints are attested from the earliest [[predynastic Egypt|Predynastic period]]. These joints were strengthened using pegs, [[Butt joint|dowels]] and [[leather]] or [[Rope|cord]] lashings. [[Animal glue]] came to be used only in the [[New Kingdom|New Kingdom period]].&lt;ref&gt;Leospo, pp.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians invented the art of [[Wood veneer|veneering]] and used [[varnish]]es for [[wood finishing|finishing]], though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native [[acacia]]s were used, as was the wood from the local [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore]] and [[tamarisk]] trees, [[deforestation]] in the [[Nile valley]] resulted in the need for the importation of wood, notably [[Cedrus libani|cedar]], but also [[Aleppo Pine|Aleppo pine]], [[buxus|boxwood]] and [[oak]], starting from the [[Second Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Leospo, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
Woodworking was essential to the Romans. It provided, sometimes the only, material for buildings, transportation, tools, and household items. Wood also provided pipes, dye, waterproofing materials, and energy for heat.&lt;ref name="Ulrich2008"&gt;{{cite book | title=Roman Woodworking | publisher=Yale University Press | author=Ulrich, Roger B. | year=2008 | isbn=9780300134605 | oclc=192003268}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}Although most examples of Roman woodworking have been lost,&lt;ref name="Ulrich2008" /&gt;{{rp|2}} the literary record preserved much of the contemporary knowledge. Vitruvius dedicates an entire chapter of his [[De architectura]] to timber, preserving many details.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;{{cite book | title=De architectura | author=Vitruvius | authorlink=Vitruvius | at=1:2.9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny, while not a botanist, dedicated six books of his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] to trees and woody plants, providing a wealth of information on trees and their uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural History | author=Pliny | authorlink=Pliny_the_Elder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient China===
The progenitors of Chinese woodworking are considered to be [[Lu Ban]] (魯班) and his wife Lady Yun, from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771 to 476 BC).  Lu Ban is said to have introduced the [[plane (tool)|plane]], chalk-line, and other tools to China. His teachings were supposedly left behind in the book ''Lu Ban Jing'' (魯班經, "Manuscript of Lu Ban"). Despite this, it is believed that the text was written some 1500 years after his death. This book is filled largely with descriptions of dimensions for use in building various items such as [[flower pot]]s, tables, [[altar]]s, etc., and also contains extensive instructions concerning [[Feng Shui]]. It mentions almost nothing of the intricate glue-less and nail-less [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] for which [[Chinese furniture]] was so famous.

==Modern day==
With the advances in modern technology and the demands of industry, woodwork as a field has changed. The development of Computer Numeric Controlled ([[CNC]]) Machines, for example, has made us able to mass-produce and reproduce products faster, with less waste, and often more complex in design than ever before. CNC Routers can carve complicated and highly detailed shapes into flat stock, to create signs or art.  Rechargeable power tools speed up creation of many projects and require much less body strength than in the past, for example when boring multiple holes. Skilled fine woodworking, however, remains a craft pursued by many. There remains demand for hand crafted work such as furniture and arts, however with rate and cost of production, the cost for consumers is much higher.

==Materials==
Historically, woodworkers relied upon the woods native to their region, until transportation and trade innovations made more exotic woods available to the craftsman. Woods are typically sorted into three basic types: [[hardwood]]s typified by tight [[wood grain|grain]] and derived from [[broadleaf]] trees, [[softwood]]s from [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] trees, and man-made materials such as [[plywood]] and [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]].

Hardwoods, botanically known as angiosperms, are deciduous and shed their leaves annually with temperature changes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardwooddistributors.org/blog/tag/differences-american-hardwoods-and-tropical-hardwoods/|title=differences american hardwoods and tropical hardwoods {{!}} Hardwood Distributors|website=www.hardwooddistributors.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Softwoods come from trees botanically known as gymnosperms, which are coniferous, cone-bearing, and stay green year round.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although a general pattern, softwoods are not necessarily always “softer” than hardwoods, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649|title=The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood|last=Stephen.|first=Corbett,|date=2012|publisher=Southwater|others=Freeman, John.|isbn=1780192207|location=Wigston|oclc=801605649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Softwood is most commonly found in the regions of the world with lower temperatures and is typically less durable, lighter in weight, and more vulnerable to pests and fungal attacks in comparison to hardwoods. They typically have a paler color and a more open grain than hardwoods, which contributes to the tendency of felled softwood to shrink and swell as it dries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Softwoods usually have a lower density, around 25-37lb/cu ft, which can compromise its strength.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Density, however, does vary within both softwoods and hardwoods depending on the wood's geographical origin and growth rate. However, the lower density of softwoods also allows it to have a greater strength with lighter weight. In the United States, softwoods are typically cheaper and more readily available and accessible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most softwoods are suitable for general construction, especially framing, trim, and finish work, and carcassing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51810586|title=Woodworking basics : mastering the essentials of craftsmanship|last=1951-|first=Korn, Peter,|date=2003|publisher=Taunton Press|isbn=156158620X|location=Newtown, CT|oclc=51810586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hardwoods are separated into two categories, temperate and tropical hardwoods, depending on their origin. Temperate hardwoods are found in the regions between the tropics and poles, and are of particular interest to wood workers for their cost-effective aesthetic appeal and sustainable sources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tropical hardwoods are found within the equatorial belt, including Africa, Asia, and South America. Hardwoods flaunt a higher density, around 65lb/cu ft as a result of slower growing rates and is more stable when drying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result of its high density, hardwoods are typically heavier than softwoods but can also be more brittle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While there are an abundant number of hardwood species, only 200 are common enough and pliable enough to be used for woodworking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowes.com/projects/build-and-remodel/lumber-buying-guide/project|title=Lumber Buying Guide|website=www.lowes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwoods have a wide variety of properties, making it easy to find a hardwood to suit nearly any purpose, but they are especially suitable for outdoor use due to their strength and resilience to rot and decay.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The coloring of hardwoods ranges from light to very dark, making it especially versatile for aesthetic purposes. However, because hardwoods are more closely grained, they are typically harder to work than softwoods. They are also harder to acquire in the United States and, as a result, are more expensive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Typically [[furniture]] such as tables and chairs is made using solid stock from hardwoods due to its strength and resistance to warping.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, they also have a greater variety of grain patterns and color and take a finish better which allows the woodworker to exercise a great deal of artistic liberty. Hardwoods can be cut more cleanly and leave less residue on sawblades and other woodworking tools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cabinet/fixture makers employ the use of [[plywood]] and other man made panel products.  Some furniture, such as the [[Windsor chair]] involve [[green woodworking]], shaping with wood while it contains its natural moisture prior to drying.

=== Common Softwoods Used for Furniture ===

==== Cedar ====
Cedars are strong, aromatic softwoods that are capable of enduring outdoor elements, the most common of which is the Western Red Cedar. Western Red Cedar can sustain wet environments without succumbing to rot, and as a result is commonly used for outdoor projects such as patios, outdoor furniture, and building exteriors. This wood can be easily found at most home centers for a moderate price.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/crafts/types-of-wood-for-woodworking/|title=Types of Wood for Woodworking - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fir ====
Fir, also known as Douglas Fir, is very inexpensive and common at local home centers. It has a characteristic straight, pronounced grain with a red-brown tint. However, its grain pattern is relatively plain and it does not stain well, so Fir is commonly used when the finished product will be painted. While commonly used for building, this softwood would also be suitable for furniture-making as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Common Hardwoods Used for Furniture ===

==== Ash ====
This hardwood is relatively easy to work with and takes stain well, but its white to light brown color with a straight grain is visually appealing on its own. However, ash is much more difficult to find than other common woods, and won’t be found at the local home center. Larger lumber yards should have it in stock.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Birch ====
Whether yellow or white birch, these hardwoods are stable and easy to work with. Despite this, Birch is prone to blotching when stained, so painting birch products is probably best. Birch is easily found at many home centers and is a relatively inexpensive hardwood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Cherry ====
Popular and easy to work with, cherry is in high demand for its reddish-brown color and ease of staining and finishing. Cherry likely won’t be at the local home center, but should be at a lumberyard for a somewhat expensive price.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This hardwood is a very common material for furniture, and is resistant to normal wear-and-tear, but it is best for indoor pieces.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://renolumber.com/2015/06/the-best-woods-for-diy-furniture/|title=The Best Woods for DIY Furniture|date=2015-06-10|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mahogany ====
A hardwood, mahogany has a trademark reddish-brown to deep-red tint and is known as “one of the great furniture woods.” However, mahogany is not typically grown in sustainable forests, and thus runs a steep price at local lumber yards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Oak ====
With two varieties, red and white, oak is known to be easy to work with and relatively strong. However, furniture makers often opt for white oak over red oak for its attractive figure and moisture-resistance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Depending on the kind needed, oak can probably be found at a local home center or a lumberyard for a bit pricier than other hardwoods.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Maple ====
With strength, sturdiness, and durability, maple is a common material for furniture for the bedroom and even china cabinets. Maple is moisture-resistant and frequently displays stand-out swirls in the wood grain, an aesthetically pleasing differentiator from other hardwoods. While most commonly a lighter color, maple also can take stains and paint well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Factors in Choosing Materials ===
There are many factors to consider when deciding what type of wood to use for a project. One of the most important is the workability of the wood: the way in which it responds when worked by hand or tools, the quality of the grain, and how it responds to adhesives and finishes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the workability of wood is high, it offers a lower resistance when cutting and has a diminished blunting effect on tools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Highly workable wood is easier to manipulate into desired forms. If the wood grain is straight and even, it will be much easier to create strong and durable glued joints. Additionally, it will help protect the wood from splitting when nailed or screwed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coarse grains require a lengthy process of filing and rubbing down the grain to produce a smooth result.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another important factor to be considered is the durability of the wood, especially in regards to moisture. If the finished project will be exposed to moisture (e.g. outdoor projects) or high humidity or condensation (e.g. in kitchens or bathrooms), then the wood needs to be especially durable in order to prevent rot. Because of their oily qualities, many tropical hardwoods such as teak and mahogany are popular for such applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Woods with good working properties&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ====

Alder (''Alnus'' glutinosa)

Basswood (''Tilia'' americana)

Obeah (''Triplochiton'' scleroxylon)

Pine (''Pinus)''

Western Cedar (''Thuja'' plicata'')''

==== Very durable woods&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ====
Teak (''Tectona'' grandis)

Iron (''Milicia excelsa)''

Jarrah (''Eucalyptus'' marginata)

Chestnut (''Castanea)''

Oak (''Quercus)''

Cedar (''Thuja)''

=== Woods used for carving ===
While many woods can be used for carving, there are some clear favorites, including Aspen, Basswood, Butternut, Black Walnut, and Oak.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardwooddistributors.org/blog/postings/top-hardwoods-for-carving/|title=Top Hardwoods for Carving {{!}} Hardwood Distributors|website=www.hardwooddistributors.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it has almost no grain and is notably soft, Basswood is particularly popular with beginner carvers. It is used in many lower-cost instruments like guitars and electric basses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Aspen is similarly soft, although slightly harder, and readily available and inexpensive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Butternut has a deeper hue than Basswood and Aspen and has a nice grain that is easy to carve, and thus friendly for beginners. It's also suitable for furniture.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While more expensive that Basswood, Aspen, and Butternut, Black Walnut is a popular choice for its rich color and grain.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lastly, Oak is a strong, sturdy, and versatile wood for carving with a defined grain. It's also a popular wood for furniture making.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
