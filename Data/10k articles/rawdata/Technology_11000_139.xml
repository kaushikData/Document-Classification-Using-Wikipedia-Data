The one exception is the Am79C940 MAC.
The Am7990 chip was fabricated in [[nMOS logic|NMOS]] technology and has no integrated [[Manchester code|Manchester]] encoder/decoder (ENDEC) nor does it have an integrated [[10BASE-T]] transceiver.

[[File:AMD Am7990 die.JPG|thumb|AMD Am7990 LANCE die shot.]]

== Compatibility ==
{{original research|section|date=November 2010}}
A later refabricated chip called the C-LANCE Am79C90 is made with 0.8 micrometre [[CMOS]] technology. The original NMOS version Am7990 and the CMOS Am79C90 version are differ in some details which may affect [[device driver]] compatibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The datasheet for the CMOS version writes that the CMOS and NMOS versions are the same. But the "Table B-1. Comparison Summary of the C-LANCE and LANCE Devices" in the [[datasheet]] shows they differ. These differences are not likely to require modifications of any device driver.&lt;!-- dault?, check datasheet! --&gt;

The PCnet family of Ethernet controllers (PCnet-[[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] II, PCnet-32, PCnet-[[Conventional PCI|PCI]] II and PCnet-FAST) is LANCE software compatible. This means you should be able use the original 16-bit software on these members of the PCnet family of single-chip Ethernet controllers.

== Features ==
The Am7990 can handle [[10BASE-5]] Type A, [[10BASE-2]] Type B, and 10BASE-T. Back-to-back packet reception with as little as 0,5 µs interframe spacing. [[Direct memory access|DMA]]/[[Bus mastering]] 24-bit (16M) address capable. Up to 128 ring buffers can be used.&lt;!-- "Up to 128 tasks may be queued up on a descriptor ring awaiting execution by the C-LANCE." --&gt; 48 byte receive/transmit FIFO&lt;!--CMOS has 48tx, 64rx  FIFO--&gt;. Operates with {{nowrap|5 volt DC 5%}} supply and logic. Features a [[Time-domain reflectometer]] (TDR) with a granularity of 30 meter&lt;!-- light speed/10 MHz page 35 --&gt;. {{nowrap|16,8 MHz}} maximum frequency.&lt;!-- 6 * tTCT * 99ns page 38 in datasheet --&gt; &lt;ref name="amd-17881-Am7990" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Free chip picture anyone? :-) --&gt;

Physically a [[Dual in-line package|DIP-48]] or [[Plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC-68]] package is used.&lt;!-- if you need to physically locate the chip on a board  --&gt;
CSR0 slave read data can cause timing violations on DAL lines.

== Chip bugs ==
The old LANCE (Rev. C) chips have a bug which causes garbage to be inserted in front of the received packet. The workaround is to ignore packets with an invalid destination address (garbage will usually not match). Of course, this precludes [[multicast]] support.&lt;ref name="fxr_watson_org_am7990"&gt;{{cite web|title=fxr.watson.org: sys/dev/le/am7990.c|url=http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/dev/le/am7990.c}} 090426 fxr.watson.org&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Amiga]] SANA-II network interface API has poor multicast support. And this chip bug might be the reason.

No capability for transmit buffer byte count of zero.
Receive lockup may occur if bus latency is large.
External loopback on a live network may cause reception of invalid loopback failure indications.
Receive descriptor zero byte count buffer interpreted as 4096 available bytes.
Will [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] computer memory every 1.6 [[Millisecond|ms]] for new packets to transmit.&lt;!-- page 30 datasheet --&gt;

'''American Safety Razor Company''' is a personal care brand founded in the early 20th century (1906) by a merging of the Gem Cutlery Company &amp; Ever-Ready and has been a principal competitor to [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] for a century and more. Unrelated to the Gillette company which also used the name '' 'American Safety Razor Company' '' in 1901 until 1904 before it was renamed for its founder, [[King C. Gillette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonough |first1=John |last2=Egolf |first2=Karen |title=The Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135949068 |page=673 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZLtCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Crowd at Ebbets Field.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gem Safety Razor advertised at the [[1920 World Series]] at [[Ebbets Field]].]]

===Star Safety Razor===
Frederick and Otto Kampfe were immigrants from [[Saxony]], Germany. In 1875 they applied for a U.S. patent and introduced the Star Razor, the first safety razor made in the United States. The brothers continued to improve their design and sold their products under the Star Safety Razor name in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=David|title=The Iron Age|date=November 18, 1915|page=1211|edition=Volume 96, Issues 15–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpUvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1211&amp;dq=Kampfe+brothers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBGoVChMI1ty4vd_5yAIVymw-Ch1Qywcs#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gem Cutlery Company===
Jerry Reichard, after working for the Kampfe Brothers for 23 years, leaves to start his own company – the Gem Cutlery Company in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Safety Razor Company: A Name To Reckon With |url=https://malegroomings.com/American-Safety-Razor-Company |website=malegroomings.com |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The source mentions Wikipedia as a source for some of its information|date=November 2018}} Its first product, the Gem Safety Razor, borrowed heavily from the Star Razor in design but soon outpaces the Star in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personna History|url=http://www.personna.com/about-us/history|website=personna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ever-Ready===
In 1903 Jerry Reichard leaves Gem Safety Razor Company to form yet another razor and blade producer, along with August Scheuber the company was briefly named 'Reichard &amp; Scheuber Manufacturing Company'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 769114|url=https://razors.click/patents/US769114/|website=razors.click}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it became 'The Yankee Company'. The Yankee Company made wedge-blade razors under the name Yankee, Mohican &amp; Winner.
The Yankee Company, is renamed Ever-Ready in 1905. Gem &amp; Ever-Ready merge in 1906 and is incorporated as the Personna American Safety Razor Company. In 1906, abandoning the wedge-blade design, they introduced the standard single edge rib-back blade that is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waits|first1=Robert K.|title=A Safety Razor Compendium|date=November 17, 2014|page=389|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4oX3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA389&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAGoVChMI58f96d74yAIVgTwmCh3IaQcj#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 Ever-Ready Shaving Brushes were first introduced and continued to be produced until the early 1990s.

===Safetee Soap Corporation===
In December 1919 The Safetee Soap Corporation formed as a subsidiary of American Safety Razor Corporation and produced a line of shaving soaps, creams, powders, talc and aftershave lotions to compliment the safety razor business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Printers' Ink|date=March 17, 1921|pages=20|edition=Volume 114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STwyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA10-PA20&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Safetee Soap line was [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] in pamphlets included in other ASR products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Safetee Soap Creates New Sales|date=January 1921|publisher=The American Cutler|pages=7–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiodAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Safety Razor Corporation===
Gem &amp; Ever-Ready merged with Star to become the American Safety Razor Corporation in 1919. It was chartered in Virginia, while razor and blade production remained in Brooklyn. By 1921, it had produced 1,800,000 safety razors; 110,000,000 razor blades; 1,000,000 shaving brushes; 2,000,000 cakes of shaving soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moodys Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities|date=1922|publisher=Moody Manual Company|edition=Volume 1; Volume 2, Part 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdk5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1232&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAmoVChMI58f96d74yAIVgTwmCh3IaQcj#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1942, it had introduced and popularized the phrase ''[[five o'clock shadow]]''. In 1953, it acquired the Pal, Treet and Personna brands after purchasing the Pal Blade Company. These two product names continue to be made today.
In 1954 the factory relocated to [[Staunton, Virginia]], after the Brooklyn City Planning Commission's planned civic center encroached on the factory with plans to redevelop the industrial area into office and residential use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Joshua Benjamin|title=Working-Class New York: Life and Labor Since World War II|date=2001|publisher=The New Press|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmwRBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgKahUKEwji76D55_jIAhXDOD4KHeZYCek#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The American Safety Razor factory building at 333 Jay Street then became the new campus for the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.

Seeking diversification [[Altria|Philip Morris]] acquires American Safety Razor in 1960. In 1963 American Safety Razor is the first maker of stainless steel blades, which were sold under the Personna brand name. In 1968, Philip Morris, purchased the Burma-Vita Company, makers of [[Burma-Shave]]. In 1970, the first blade made with tungsten steel was introduced, the Personna 74. In 1974 American Line Brand of industrial products was introduced, expanding the company into industrial blades. In 1977, executives purchased Personna American Safety Razor Company from Philip Morris in a management buyout.

[[Energizer]] bought the privately held American Safety Razor in 2011, when it filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Laura|title=Verona Energizer plant may shut down|url=http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2015/06/04/veronas-energizer-plant-could-face--shutdown/28469203/|website=newsleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, Energizer spun off the personal care division as Edgewell Personal Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edgewell History|url=http://edgewell.com/our-history/|website=edgewell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgewell announced the sale of its Personna Industrial Division to an investment group, which renamed it AccuTec Blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investment group purchases Personna Industrial Division|url=http://augustafreepress.com/investment-group-purchases-personna-industrial-division-verona-plant-to-remain-operational-continue-to-provide-150-jobs/|website=augustafreepress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">'''Anal bleaching''' is the process of [[skin whitening|lightening the color of the skin]] around the [[anus]]. It is done for cosmetic purposes, to make the color of the anus more uniform with the surrounding area. Some treatments are applied in an office or salon by a cosmetic technician and others are sold as cream that can be applied at home.

[[pornographic film actor|Pornography actresses]] were the first to undergo the anal bleaching process, in an effort to lighten the color of their anuses to match the rest of their skin,&lt;ref name=cosbut&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/advice/a3634/anal-bleaching-trend/ |title=The Scary New Butt Beauty Trend |work=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]] |date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been suggested by Kristina Rose that this is not the case.&lt;ref name=lawana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/columns/anal-bleaching-from-porn-trend-to-mainstream-un-necessary-evil-2529810 |title=Anal Bleaching: From Porn Trend to Mainstream (Un)Necessary Evil |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As [[Brazilian waxing]] became popular, due to the popularity of smaller swimsuits and lingerie, the spread of pornography into the mainstream, and endorsement of the procedure by celebrities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/the-new-full-frontal-has-pubic-hair-in-america-gone-extinct/249798/ |title=The New Full-Frontal: Has Pubic Hair in America Gone Extinct? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; women began noticing that their anuses were darker than the rest of their skin.&lt;ref name=cosbut /&gt;  The increase in the number of women engaging in anal sex has also contributed to women's concern over the appearance of their anus.&lt;ref name=cosbut /&gt;  To combat this perceived problem, genital bleaching began to gain appeal.&lt;ref name=lawana /&gt;  Gay men also make use of this procedure.&lt;ref name=marana /&gt;&lt;ref name=tvvbun /&gt;

The procedure was briefly shown in 2004 near the end of an episode ''[[Cosmetic Surgery Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/sep/19/features.review57 |title=Why actions speak louder |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One salon that performed the procedure received an increase in queries in 2005 attributed to an episode of ''[[Dr. 90210]]'' on [[E!]], when porn star [[Tabitha Stevens]] was filmed having her anus bleached.&lt;ref name=tvvbun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-07-05/columns/britesmile-for-bungholes/ |title=Britesmile for Bungholes  |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=5 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It garnered several mentions in movies such as ''[[Brüno]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/05/12/bruno-sacha-baron-cohen-anus-bleach/#.T5G_29XcyqI |title=Bruno on Anus: I'm Bleached and I'm Proud! |work=[[TMZ]] |date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'',&lt;ref name=cosbut /&gt; and in magazines.&lt;ref name=cosbut /&gt;&lt;ref name=marana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/advice/a712/anal-bleaching/ |title=Is Anal Bleaching for You? |work=[[Marie Claire]] |date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment was apparently first offered in the US in California in 2005; it was reported to be available at the same time in Australia.&lt;ref name=tvvbun /&gt;  Spas outside of Hollywood were slow to begin offering it as a beauty treatment, with just one New York spa offering the service by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/ass-you-like-it |title=Ass you like it  |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]] |date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creams are now sold for use at home,&lt;ref name=nexwhi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nextmagazine.com/content/once-you-go-white |title=Once You Go White |work=[[Next Magazine (New York City)|Next Magazine]] |date=18 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123161258/http://www.nextmagazine.com/content/once-you-go-white |archivedate=23 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and genital lightening is offered as a laser-based treatment in cosmetic surgery centers.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--I could link to a number of websites to support this, but I'm having trouble finding one that isn't a promotional primary source--&gt; Although the popularity of anal bleaching has not approached that of Brazilian waxing, it has garnered mainstream recognition over the past several years.&lt;ref name=lawana /&gt;

==Methods==
There are several methods to carry out the anal lightening process. The most common method is to simply use an at-home lotion or gel to target the darkened anal and genital area and gradually fade the darkened area over time. Most of the other methods that are used for skin lightening, like [[Hydroquinone#Skin depigmentation|hydroquinone]] used to lighten skin and usually found in products marketed to darker skinned people to even out their skin tone,&lt;ref name=tvvbun /&gt; and other popular methods like [[cryosurgery]] and laser lightening treatments, are also used for anal bleaching.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Risks==
Many of these [[cosmetics]] contained ingredients that would irritate the sensitive anal area, creating temporary discomfort and even burning, scarring, or [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]].&lt;ref name=nexwhi /&gt;

The process performed with creams containing [[Hydroquinone#Skin depigmentation|hydroquinone]] is banned in some countries, such as the member states of the EU.&lt;ref name=ctpa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefactsabout.org.uk/content.asp?menuid=32&amp;submenuid=136&amp;pageid=136&amp;menuname=Skin+lightening+products&amp;menu=sub |title=Skincare: Skin lightening products |work=Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123180529/http://www.thefactsabout.org.uk/content.asp?menuid=32&amp;submenuid=136&amp;pageid=136&amp;menuname=Skin+lightening+products&amp;menu=sub |archivedate=2015-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the [[FDA]] removed previous advice that stated hydroquinone was considered generally safe, as hydroquinone has been linked to [[ochronosis]], where skin becomes permanently discoloured and disfigured, and because it may also be a [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm203112.htm |title=Hydroquinone Studies Under The National Toxicology Program (NTP) |work=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, its use is not banned in the [[United States]] and it is still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=289 |title=Hydroquinone |work=[[Campaign for Safe Cosmetics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123171201/http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=289 |archivedate=2015-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other principal ingredients that are used in skin lightening cosmetics are [[arbutin]] and [[kojic acid]].&lt;ref name=ctpa/&gt;  Arbutin, often also called ''bearberry'', can be converted by the body into hydroquinone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/chem_background/exsumpdf/arbutin_508.pdf#search=Arbutin%20%20hydroquinone |title=Chemical Information Review Document for Arbutin [CAS No. 497-76-7] and Extracts from Arctostaphylos uva-ursi |work=[[National Toxicology Program]] |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Azelaic acid]] with products like [[aloe vera]] and [[vitamin C]] tablets is another method.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[Kojic acid]] was developed as a safer alternative to hydroquinone, however it is less effective at lightening and also [[carcinogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health24.com/Sex/Sexual-diversity/Backdoor-bleaching-20120721 |title=Backdoor bleaching |work=[[News24]] |date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laser-based and [[cryogenic]] anal or genital lightening does come with its own set of warnings. Results are not always consistent, the process may be a painful one, and those with darker skin tones may have issues with these processes {{Clarify|date=December 2014}}. Lasers also have the added disadvantage of leaving scars, so cryogenic skin lightening is the option usually used for the anal and genital area.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''AnswerDash''' is a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] [[software company]] that facilitates [[customer service]] for [[e-commerce]] businesses. AnswerDash was founded in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 2012 as a [[university spin-off|spin-off]] from the [[Information school]] of the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt; Its [[software-as-a-service]] utilizes [[machine learning]] to create databases of [[Context-sensitive help|context-sensitive support answers]] for [[end-user]]s of [[webpage]]s and [[mobile application]]s, thus reducing the need for human customer service.&lt;ref name="PSBJ35-48"/&gt; AnswerDash claims to be the first,&lt;ref name="GW13a"/&gt; and as of 2015 the world's leading provider of contextual point-and-click answer technology.&lt;ref name="YF15"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Qazzow_logo_(former_logo_of_AnswerDash).png|200px|thumb|left|The former logo of AnswerDash]]
The company was founded under name ″Qazzow″ in 2012 by three [[University of Washington]] employees:&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt; [[Jacob O. Wobbrock]], a [[professor]] and the director of Mobile &amp; Accessible Design Lab,&lt;ref name="uwj"/&gt; Andy Ko, an associate professor the director of Code &amp; Cognition Lab,&lt;ref name="uwa"/&gt; and Parmit Chilana, a [[research assistant]] and a [[graduate student]] at the time, now a professor at [[Simon Fraser University]].&lt;ref name="vb"/&gt; Jake Wobbrock assumed the responsibilities of [[CEO]], and Andy Ko became the company's [[Chief technology officer|CTO]].&lt;ref name="sed"/&gt; The idea of the key company's service stemmed from Parmit Chilana's [[dissertation]] on [[human–computer interaction]].&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt; Her research has highlighted a very high proportion (up to 95%) of users' questions that are triggered by something seen on a website and should benefit from contextual help.&lt;ref name="vb"/&gt;

In November 2013 the company received $500,000 seed investment from [[W Fund]] to further develop its contextual Q&amp;A service&lt;ref name="GW13a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uwn"/&gt; and in December 2013 additional $2.4 million from [[WRF Capital]] and [[Voyager Capital]] investment funds.&lt;ref name="GW13b"/&gt; In May 2014, the company re-branded itself to ″AnswerDash″ reacting to customers' confusion over the unusual sequence of letters in the original name.&lt;ref name="GW14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

In January 2015, Kevin Knoepp has replaced Andy Ko as AnswerDash new CTO.&lt;ref name="YF15a"/&gt; AnswerDash service came on-line in May 2015.&lt;ref name="SEA15"/&gt; At the same time, after serving as a CEO for three years, Jake Wobbrock stepped down as the CEO. His performance was generally favored by [[Board of directors|the board]], but Wobbrok has admitted his tendency to focusing on interesting scientific details that might not be relevant to business success.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Wobbrock was replaced by William Colleran, a former CEO [[Impinj]].&lt;ref name="YF16"/&gt;

By the end of 2015 the company has "matured dramatically".&lt;ref name="GW15"/&gt; After announcing the successful deployment of its software to [[Zendesk]],&lt;ref name="xc"/&gt; in September AnswerDash raised additional $2.9 million.&lt;ref name="GW15"/&gt; In 2016, AnswerDash has recorded the biggest jump in [[GeekWire]] 200 rating, a ranked index of [[Pacific Northwest]] [[Startup company|startups]].&lt;ref name="GW16"/&gt;

== Services ==   
Offered under [[SaaS]] model by subscription, the service aims to eliminate the need for separate FAQs or ″help islands" offering contextual answers to end-users' questions.&lt;ref name="CIO"/&gt; The service can be used on [[website]]s, [[web application]]s, and [[mobile application]]s. It employs a [[Natural language processing|natural-language engine]] and [[machine learning]] technology that allows website and application owners to build the database of answers in a matter of several days.&lt;ref name="vb"/&gt;
  
In addition, AnswerDash utilizes [[data mining]] technology to provide business owners with valuable analytics on their consumers' behavior that leads to further improvement of their e-commerce services.&lt;ref name="sbt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PDSSE"/&gt; AnswerDash claims to reduce the need of traditional [[customer support]] by 30 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name="YF16"/&gt;

The '''baseload'''&lt;ref name="baseload"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baseload|title=Definition of "baseload"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''base load''') on a grid is the minimum level of demand on an [[electrical grid]] over a span of time, for example, one week.  This demand can be met by unvarying power plants,&lt;ref name="fink78" /&gt; [[dispatchable generation]],&lt;ref name="pembina"/&gt; or by a collection of smaller [[intermittent energy source]]s,&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; depending on which approach has the best mix of low cost, availability and high reliability in any particular market. The remainder of demand, varying throughout a day, is met by dispatchable generation, [[load following power plant]]s, and [[peaking power plant]]s, which can be turned up or down quickly, [[operating reserve]], [[demand response]] and [[energy storage]].

When the cheapest power was from large coal and nuclear plants which could not be turned up or down quickly, they were used to generate baseload, since it is constant, and they were  called "baseload plants." Large standby reserves were needed in case of sudden failure of one of these large plants.&lt;ref name="fink78"&gt; Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty (ed), ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers'', Eleventh Edition, Mc-Graw Hill, 1978 {{ISBN|9780070209749}}, pp. 12-16 through 12-18 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vortex"&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://www.energyvortex.com/energydictionary/baseload_plant.html  |title=Energy Dictionary - Baseload plant |publisher=EnergyVortex.com  |date=  |accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unvarying power plants are no longer always the cheapest way to meet baseload. The grid now includes many wind turbines which have such low marginal costs that they can bid lower prices than coal or nuclear, so they can provide some of the baseload when the wind blows. Using wind turbines in areas with varying wind conditions, and supplementing them with solar in the day time, dispatchable generation and storage, handles the intermittency of individual wind sources.&lt;ref name="pembina" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt;

Barroso |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8213-8822-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed adjustments are known as the [[unit commitment problem in electrical power production]].

While historically large power grids used unvarying power plants to meet the base load, there is no specific technical requirement for this to be so.  The base load can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of [[intermittent power source]]s and [[dispatchable generation]].&lt;ref name="pembina"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pubs.pembina.org/reports/TheBasicsOnBaseload.pdf |title=The Basics on Base Load: Meeting Ontario’s Base Load Electricity Demand with Renewable Power Sources |last=Peters |first=Roger, Cherise Burda |date=2007-09-01 |website=Pembina Institute |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Archer |first=Cristina L. |last2=Jacobson |first2=Mark Z. |date=November 2007 |title=Supplying Baseload Power and Reducing Transmission Requirements by Interconnecting Wind Farms |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2007JAMC1538.1 |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology |language=EN |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1701–1717 |doi=10.1175/2007jamc1538.1 |issn=1558-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unvarying power plants can be coal, nuclear, [[combined cycle]] plants, which may take several days to start up and shut down,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-baseload-power-is-doomed/|title=Why baseload power is doomed {{!}} ZDNet|last=Nelder|first=Chris|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[Geothermal power|geothermal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/10/scaling-geothermal-for-reliable-baseload-power-50159.html  |title=Scaling Geothermal for Reliable Baseload Power|publisher=renewableenergyworld.com  |date=2007-10-05  |accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[biogas]], [[biomass]], [[Solar_thermal#Heat_storage|solar thermal with storage]] and [[ocean thermal energy conversion]]. 

Supply interruptions can affect all plants from breakdowns, and also hydroelectric plants from [[drought]]s, coal plants if their coal stockpiles freeze, and gas plants from pipeline leaks and closures.

The desirable attribute of [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchability]] applies to some gas plants, wind (through [[Blade_pitch#Wind_turbines|blade pitch]]) and hydroelectricity. Grid operators also use ''curtailment'' to shut plants out of the grid when their energy is not needed.&lt;ref name="curt1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bird |first=Lori |last2=Lew |first2=Debra |last3=Milligan |first3=Michael |last4=Carlini |first4=E.

There are 195,000 megawatts of grid storage installed world-wide; 94% is [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]; 2% is in batteries.&lt;ref name="storage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects |title=DOE Global Energy Storage Database |website=www.energystorageexchange.org |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pumped storage uses cheap power at times of low demand, usually night, to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, then lets it drop back through turbines during peak demand times, usually in the day. Availability of solar power in peak hours of the day can reduce the need for storage. The [[Bath County Pumped Storage Station|biggest storage facility]] in the world is on the Virginia-West Virginia border, with 50% more capacity than the [[Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name="ryan"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thinkprogress.org/the-inside-story-of-the-worlds-biggest-battery-and-the-future-of-renewable-energy-8984e81283c/ |title=The Inside Story Of The World’s Biggest ‘Battery’ And The Future Of Renewable Energy |last=KORONOWSKI |first=Ryan |date=2013-08-27 |work=ThinkProgress |access-date=2018-05-16 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

Grid operators solicit bids to find the cheapest sources of electricity over short and long term buying periods.&lt;ref name="alj"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/5/electricity-auctionpricespowerbillsconsumers.html |title=OPINION: How electricity auctions are rigged to favor industry |last=Johnston  |first=David Cay |date=2014-05-29 |work=Al Jazeera |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear and coal plants  have very high [[fixed costs]], high [[plant load factor]] but very low [[marginal costs]], though not as low as solar, wind, and hydroelectric.  On the other hand, peak load generators, such as [[natural gas]], have low fixed costs, low plant load factor and high marginal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aF7lWf14H2EC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=hydro+base+load&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qAfGeztoow&amp;sig=9ZbHwDwDOUmzcBhXyZdmp7SU3bw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result |title=Ontario Hydro at the Millennium: Has Monopoly's Moment Passed?  |author=Ronald J. Daniels  |publisher=Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press  |year=1996  |accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal and nuclear power plants do not change production to match power consumption demands since it is more economical to operate them at constant production levels. Use of higher cost combined-cycle plants or combustion turbines is thus minimized, and these plants can be cycled up and down to match more rapid fluctuations in consumption.  Some nuclear power stations, such as those [[nuclear power in France|in France]], do operate as [[load following power plant]]s and alter their output to meet varying demands.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Development, June 2011, page 10 from http://www.oecd-nea.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-nea.org/|title=Nuclear Development|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-nea.org|publisher=Nuclear Energy Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Different plants and technologies may have differing capacities to increase or decrease output on demand: nuclear plants are generally run at close to maximum output continuously (apart from maintenance, [[Nuclear fuel|refueling]] and periodic refurbishment), while coal-fired plants may be cycled over the course of a day to meet demand.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Plants with multiple generating units may be used as a group to improve the "fit" with demand, by turning units on and off.

According to [[National Grid plc]] [[chief executive officer]] [[Steve Holliday]] in 2015, baseload is "outdated", as microgrids would become the primary means of production, and large powerplants relegated to supply the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energypost.eu/interview-steve-holliday-ceo-national-grid-idea-large-power-stations-baseload-power-outdated/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910134728/http://www.energypost.eu/interview-steve-holliday-ceo-national-grid-idea-large-power-stations-baseload-power-outdated/ |title=Steve Holliday CEO National Grid: baseload is outdated |date=11 September 2015 |archivedate=10 September 2016 |author=Karel Beckman |work=EnergyPost.eu |accessdate=6 October 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]] of the [[Daily Telegraph]] wrote that, with advances in energy storage, 'there ceases to be much point in building costly "[[baseload]]" power plants' and goes on to argue 'Nuclear reactors cannot be switched on and off as need demands - unlike gas plants. They are useless as a back-up for the decentralized grid of the future, when wind, solar, hydro, and other renewables will dominate the power supply'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/10/holy-grail-of-energy-policy-in-sight-as-battery-technology-smash/ |title= Holy Grail of energy policy in sight as battery technology smashes the old order |first= Ambrose |last= Evans-Pritchard |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7837">The '''bomber gap''' was the [[Cold War]] belief that the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Long Range Aviation]] department had gained an advantage in deploying [[jet aircraft|jet-powered]] [[strategic bomber]]s. Widely accepted for several years, the gap was used as a political [[talking point]] in the [[United States]] to justify a great increase in [[defense spending]].

One result was a massive buildup of the [[US Air Force]] bomber fleet, which peaked at over 2500 bombers to counter the perceived Soviet threat. Surveillance flights by the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft indicated that the bomber gap did not exist.

Realizing that the belief in the gap was an extremely effective funding source, the US military fabricated a series of similarly-nonexistent Soviet military advances. That tactic is now known as [[policy by press release]]. Some of the claims were a [[nuclear aircraft|nuclear-powered bomber]],&lt;ref&gt;''Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber'', Aviation Week, 1 December 1958, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[VTOL]] [[Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar|flying saucers]],&lt;ref&gt;''Is this the real Flying Saucer?'', Look, Volume 19, 14 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and, only a few years later, the [[missile gap]].

==Appearance ==
On February 15, 1954, ''[[Aviation Week]]'' published an article describing new Soviet jet bombers capable of carrying a [[nuclear bomb]] from their bases to the US.&lt;ref&gt;''Pictures Reveal Reds' New "Sunday Punch"'', Aviation Week, 15 Feb. 1954, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was the [[Myasishchev M-4]] ''Bison''. Over the next year and a half, the rumors were debated publicly in the press and soon in [[US Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;''Congress Gets Red Plane Facts'', Aviation Week, 22 February 1954, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Aviation Day deception==
Adding to the concerns was an infamous event in July 1955. At the [[Soviet Aviation Day]] demonstrations at the [[Tushino Airfield]], ten Bison bombers were flown past the reviewing stand, flew out of sight, quickly turned around, and then flew past the stands again with eight more. That presented the illusion that there were 28 aircraft in the flyby. Western analysts, extrapolating from the illusionary 28 aircraft, judged that by 1960, the Soviets would have 800.&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T. A. | year=1998 | page=193 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Air Force raises numbers of bombers==
At the time, the Air Force had just introduced its own strategic jet bomber, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]], and the shorter-range [[B-47 Stratojet]] was still suffering from a variety of technical problems that limited its availability. Its staff started pressing for accelerated production of the B-52 but also grudgingly accepted calls for expanded air defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dean-boys.com/551aew/navy_air_defence.htm Guarding the Cold War Ramparts: The U.S. Navy's Role in Continental Air Defense]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force was generally critical of spending effort on defense after it had studied the results of the [[World War II]] bombing campaigns and concluded that British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s pre-war thinking on the fruitlessness of air defense was mostly correct: "[[The bomber will always get through]]." Like the British, the US Air Force concluded that money would better be spent on making the offensive arm larger to deter an attack. The result was a production series consisting of thousands of aircraft. Over 2,000 B-47s and almost 750 B-52s were built to match the imagined fleet of Soviet aircraft.

==Disproval of gap==
{{Disputed section|1956 overflight of Engels|date = February 2017}}

US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] had always been skeptical of the gap. However, with no evidence to disprove it, he agreed to the development of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] to find out for sure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldwar.org/articles/50s/bomber_gap.asp Bomber Gap]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first U-2 flights started in 1956. One early mission, Mission 2020, flown by [[Martin Knutson]] on July 4, 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spyflight.co.uk/u2.htm Lockheed U-2 mission history]&lt;/ref&gt; flew over [[Engels-2]] airfield, near [[Saratov]], and photographed 20 [[M-4 Bison]] bombers on the ramp. Multiplying by the number of Soviet bomber bases, the intelligence suggested the Soviets were already well on their way to deploying hundreds of aircraft. The U-2 had actually photographed the entire Bison fleet; there was no bomber at any of the other bases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-8/knutson2.html Interview with Martin Knutson]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar missions over the next year finally proved that. At least in official circles, the gap had been disproved.{{r|heppenheimer1998}}

Other newly declassified information indicates that Engels was never overflown, and nothing was confirmed about Bison aircraft numbers until December 1959&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP61S00750A000500040115-4.pdf (U) Heavy Bomber Targets], CIA-RDP61S00750A000500040115-4, Central Intelligence Agency, May 21, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Mission 8005 Submitted 18 December 1959] (Document title of Mission 8035 is in error, see copy), CIA-RDP78B05700A000400200005-1, Central Intelligence Agency, December 21, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T05693A000300050001-4.pdf ODE 8005], CIA-RDP78T05693A000300050001-4, Central Intelligence Agency, December 13, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The downward revision in Bison numbers was caused by new information from the factories that was received in 1958. It showed that production rate had slowed down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP61-00549R000200010002-1.pdf Validity of Hevy Bomber Estimate in NIE 11-4-57], CIA-RDP61-00549R000200010002-1, Central Intelligence Agency, April 11, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79R00904A000400030035-9.pdf Recent Evidence on Bison Production] (Top Secret), CIA-RDP79R00904A000400030035-9, Central Intelligence Agency, July 9, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was later discovered, the M-4 was unable to meet its original range goals and was limited to about {{convert|8000|km|sp=us}}. Unlike the US, the Soviets still lacked overseas bases in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and so the M-4 could not attack the US and then land at a friendly airbase. Interest in the M-4 waned, and a total of only 93 were produced before the assembly lines were shut down in 1963.

The vast majority were used as tankers or maritime reconnaissance aircraft; only the original ten shown at the air show and nine newer 3MD13 models served on nuclear alert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/bomber/m-4.htm Myasishchev 'Bison']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', the notion of a "bomber gap" is parodied when the character of Buck Turgidson (a Pentagon general) declares that the US "must not allow a mineshaft gap" in discussing the use of mineshafts as nuclear [[fallout shelters]].
*In one episode of U.S. television situation comedy ''[[That '70s Show]]'', "Who Wants It More", [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna]] and [[Eric Forman|Eric]] do a report in his bedroom for school on the arms race between the superpowers. After several "[[foreplay|study breaks]]" in which they [[make out]], the two disagree over the "bomber gap." Donna incorrectly suggests that the Soviets started the arms race with the bomber gap; after Eric corrects her, she refuses further "study breaks."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">The '''Cloaca Circi Maximi''' or '''Cloaca Circi''' was a sewer in ancient Rome.

It was originally a small stream fed by various sources from around the [[Porta Capena]] right through the valley between the [[Palatine Hill]] and [[Aventine Hill]], running down to the [[river Tiber]]. According to tradition, games and horse races were held in this vallery from right after the founding of Rome in the 8th century. Over the centuries the [[Circus Maximus]] was built over the stream, with a channel named Euripus running across it halfway and two bridges carrying the track over it. The channel also served as the spina down the middle of the track.

Under [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus]] the circus and its surroundings were greatly enlarged, covering over the channel, which became a sewer. It was connected to a tunnel modelled on that of the [[Cloaca Maxima]] and now terminated on the Tiber upstream of the Cloaca Maxima.

[[File:15-09-26-RalfR-WLC-0280.jpg|thumb|upright]]
A '''cocktail strainer''' is a metal [[Bar (counter)|bar]] accessory used to remove [[Ice cubes|ice]] from a [[cocktail|mixed drink]] as it is poured into the [[cocktail glass|serving glass]].  A type of [[sieve]], the strainer is placed over the mouth of the glass or [[cocktail shaker|shaker]] in which the beverage was prepared; small holes in the device allow only [[liquid]]s to pass as the beverage is poured.

There are two common types of strainers.  The '''Hawthorne strainer''' is a disc (called the "rim") with a handle and two or more stabilizing prongs.  A metal [[Spring (device)|spring]] fixed around the edge of the rim rolls inward to fit inside the glass.  The rim of the strainer does not need to touch the rim of the glass, as the spring inside filters out the ice.  

The '''Julep strainer''' is shaped like a [[Bowl (vessel)|bowl]] with a handle, and will fit tightly into a mixing glass or shaker when inserted at the proper angle.  Liquid passes through holes or slits in the bowl.

[[Image:Core drill 06 2005.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Truck mounted core drill]]

A '''core drill''' is a [[drill]] specifically designed to remove a cylinder of material, much like a [[hole saw]]. The material left inside the drill bit is referred to as the ''core''.

Core drills used in metal are called [[annular cutter]]s.  Core drills used for concrete are generally called Diamond Core Drills and are water cooled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coptool.com/diamond-core-bits-vs-carbide-core-bits-concrete-drilling/ |title=Diamond Core Bits vs Carbide Core Bits |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For drilling masonry, carbide core drills can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qrents.com/docs/concdrilling.htm |title=Concrete Drilling Tutorial |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest core drills were those used by the [[ancient Egyptians]], invented in 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="Delleur"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques W. Delleur|title=The Handbook of Groundwater Engineering, Second Edition|date=12 December 2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8493-4316-2|page=7 in chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core drills are used for many applications, either where the core needs to be preserved (the drilling apparatus used in obtaining a [[core sample]] is often referred to as a corer), or where drilling can be done more rapidly since much less material needs to be removed than with a standard bit.  This is the reason that diamond-tipped core drills are commonly used in construction to create holes for pipes, manholes, and other large-diameter penetrations in [[concrete]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]].

Core drills are used frequently in [[exploration diamond drilling|mineral exploration]] where the coring may be several hundred to several  thousand feet in length.  The core samples are recovered and examined by geologists for mineral percentages and stratigraphic contact points.  This gives exploration companies the information necessary to begin or abandon mining operations in a particular area.[[File:Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core.JPG|thumb|Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core and analyzing contacts and other structural features.]]

Before the start of World War Two, Branner Newsom, a California mining engineer, invented a core drill that could take out large diameter cores up to 16 feet in length for mining shafts.  This type of core drill is no longer in use as modern drill technology allows standard drilling to accomplish the same at a much cheaper cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boone |first=Andrew R. |title=He Bores Bigger Holes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=popular+science+1943+there%27s+one+thrill+no+soldier&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NlvOTJj2EIPMnAeRwYT-Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |date=December 1943 |journal=Popular Science |pages=104&amp;ndash;107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Core drills come with several power choices including electric, pneumatic, hydraulic (all of which require power sources, such as a generator).

==Technology==

Crunchfish integrates touchless functions in for e.g. smartphones and the technology is portable to other mobile platform devices. Their [[gesture recognition]] technology can be used in
mobile phones, tablets&lt;ref name="share between tablets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsinsight.com/our-services/video/1624|title=Mobile World Congress 2013: Crunchfish user interface A Swedish company offers a new way to control devices.|accessdate=2013-08-23|publisher=CCS Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DTVs equipped with a front-facing camera. Typical uses for Crunchfish touchless technology are devices in an [[intelligent home]] as smartphones, tablets, [[Digital TV]], games and other home electronics that have a built-in standard camera.&lt;ref name="crunchfish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crunchfish.com/#our-product |title=TOUCHLESS A3D™ SOFTWARE|date=2013-03-10|publisher=Crunchfish |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture based functionality adds alternative options to a standard [[touch interface]]. The user can for example put a [[tablet computer|tablet]] in front of him/her and be free to do mid-air gesture with both hands and interacting with a [[Digital media player|media player]] without touching it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TFi38FUNjk |title=Touchless Concept Movie - powered by Crunchfish A3D™|date=2013-03-25|publisher=Crunchfish on Youtube |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smartphone users can answer and reject phone calls, start slideshows in photo gallery, use video scrubber etc. without touching the device. The device can pause a video playback if the users look away from the screen.

Crunchfish's Touchless A3D software is able to detect and track objects (fingers, hand gestures and face movements) in three dimensions based on the video stream from an embedded standard camera in e.g. a mobile device.&lt;ref name="crunchfish" /&gt;

'''DECtalk''' was a [[speech synthesizer]] and [[text-to-speech]] technology developed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in 1984,&lt;ref name=dectalkpreannounce1984 /&gt; based largely on the work of [[Dennis H. Klatt|Dennis Klatt]] at [[MIT]], whose source-filter algorithm was variously known as KlattTalk or MITalk.&lt;ref name=klatt&gt;

==About==
The first DECtalk units were seen in 1984.  They were standalone units that connected to any device with an [[asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous]] [[serial port]].  These units were also able to connect to the telephone system by having two telephone jacks.  One connected to a phone line, the other to a telephone.   The DECtalk units could recognize and generate any telephone [[touch tone]].  With that capability the units could be used to automate various telephone-related tasks by handling both incoming and outgoing calls.  This included acting as an interface to an email system and the capability to function as an alerting system by utilizing the ability to place calls and interact via touch tones with the person answering the phone.

Later units were produced for PCs with [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus slots.  In addition, various software implementations were produced, most notably the DECtalk Access32.  Certain versions of the synthesizer were prone to undesirable characteristics.  For example, the [[alveolar stop]]s were often assimilated as sounding more like [[dental stop]]s.  Also, versions such as Access32 would produce faint electronic beeps at the end of phrases.

In the [[Digital Equipment Corporation#Final years|final years of DEC]], early/mid-2000,&lt;ref&gt;

==In technology and culture== 
*The DECtalk engine was notably used in the US [[National Weather Service]]'s first "Console Replacement System" (CRS) installations in the late 1990s for [[NOAA Weather Radio]]. {{as of|2003}} it had all but been replaced by a far more modern engine called [[Speechify]]. The so-called "Perfect Paul" voice (a DECtalk "preset" for a default understandable male voice) still does [[Station identification]]s on many NWR stations.&lt;ref&gt;

*One of the early uses was a "text to voice" system that read an individual's emergency medical information (medications, allergies, doctor, insurance and contact info stored in a database) to hospitals telephoning in about patients presenting at emergency rooms. The company, Med-Fax, created by David Grober in 1986, used the DECtalk on an IBM platform, making it one of the early cross platform applications (DEC to IBM).       
*DECtalk had a number of built-in voices which were identified by the following names: Perfect Paul (the default voice), Beautiful Betty, Huge Harry, Frail Frank, Kit the Kid, Rough Rita, Uppity Ursula, Doctor Dennis and Whispering Wendy. In addition the voices were editable by adjusting various parameters (such as throat size, crossover frequencies, etc.)       
*DECtalk understood phonetic spellings of words, allowing customized pronunciation of unusual words. These phonetic spellings could also include a tone indicator which DECtalk would use when enunciating the phonetic components. This allowed DECtalk to sing.        
*In addition, all the electronic voices in the movie '''Back to the Future II''' were created by personnel from the Digital Equipment Corporation's San Diego office, using the DECtalk [[Text-to-speech|TTS]] system.
*DECtalk can be used as part of a [[speech generating device]] for those unable to speak. A notable user was [[Stephen Hawking]], who was unable to speak due to a combination of severe disabilities caused by [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] as well as an emergency [[tracheotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and came to be associated with the unique voice of the device. In 2011, Hawking's research assistant Sam Blackburn said Hawking still used a version of DECtalk identified on its board as the "Calltext 5010" manufactured in 1988 by SpeechPlus, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6855">'''Digital control''' is a branch of [[control theory]] that uses [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer]]s to act as system controllers.
Depending on the requirements, a digital control system can take the form of a [[microcontroller]] to an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] to a standard desktop computer.
Since a digital computer is a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] system, the [[Laplace transform]] is replaced with the [[Z-transform]].
Also since a digital computer has finite precision (''See [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]''), extra care is needed to ensure the error in coefficients, [[Analog to digital converter|A/D conversion]], [[digital to analog converter|D/A conversion]], etc. are not producing undesired or unplanned effects.

The application of digital control can readily be understood in the use of [[feedback]].
Since the creation of the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer|first digital computer]] in the early 1940s the price of digital computers has dropped considerably, which has made them key pieces to control systems for several reasons:
*Inexpensive: under $5 for many microcontrollers
*Flexible: easy to configure and reconfigure through software
*Scalable: programs can scale to the limits of the memory or storage space without extra cost
*Adaptable: parameters of the program can change with time (''See [[adaptive control]]'')
*Static operation: digital computers are much less prone to environmental conditions than [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, etc.

== Digital Controller Implementation ==
A digital controller is usually cascaded with the plant in a feedback system. The rest of the system can either be digital or analog.

Typically, a digital controller requires:
*[[Analog to digital converter|A/D conversion]] to convert analog inputs to machine readable (digital) format
*[[Digital to analog converter|D/A conversion]] to convert digital outputs to a form that can be input to a plant (analog)
*A program that relates the outputs to the inputs

=== Output Program ===
*Outputs from the digital controller are functions of current and past input samples, as well as past output samples - this can be implemented by storing relevant values of input and output in registers. The output can then be formed by a weighted sum of these stored values.

The programs can take numerous forms and perform many functions
*A [[digital filter]] for [[low-pass filter]]ing
*A [[state space (controls)|state space]] model of a system to act as a [[state observer]]
*A [[telemetry]] system

=== Stability ===
Although a controller may be stable when implemented as an analog controller, it could be unstable when implemented as a digital controller due to a large sampling interval. During sampling the aliasing modifies the cutoff parameters. Thus the sample rate characterizes the transient response and stability of the compensated system, and must update the values at the controller input often enough so as to not cause instability.

When substituting the frequency into the z operator, regular stability criteria still apply to discrete control systems. [[Nyquist stability criterion|Nyquist criteria]] apply to z-domain transfer functions as well as being general for complex valued functions. Bode stability criteria apply similarly.
[[Jury stability criterion|Jury criterion]] determines the discrete system stability about its characteristic polynomial.

=== Design of digital controller in s-domain ===
The digital controller can also be designed in the s-domain (continuous). The [[Arnold Tustin|Tustin]] transformation can transform the continuous compensator to the respective digital compensator. The digital compensator will achieve an output which approaches the output of its respective analog controller as the sampling interval is decreased.

&lt;math&gt; s = \frac{2(z-1)}{T(z+1)} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Tustin transformation deduction ====
Tustin is the [[Padé table|Padé&lt;sub&gt;(1,1)&lt;/sub&gt;]] approximation of the exponential function &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} z &amp;= e^{sT} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt; :

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z &amp;= e^{sT}   \\
  &amp;= \frac{e^{sT/2}}{e^{-sT/2}} \\
  &amp;\approx \frac{1 + s T / 2}{1 - s T / 2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

And its inverse

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{1}{T} \ln(z)  \\
  &amp;= \frac{2}{T} \left[\frac{z-1}{z+1} + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^3  + \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^5  + \frac{1}{7} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^7 + \cdots \right] \\
  &amp;\approx  \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\
  &amp;=  \frac{2}{T} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We must never forget that the digital control theory is the technique to design strategies in discrete time, (and/or) quantized amplitude (and/or) in (binary) coded form to be implemented in computer systems (microcontrollers, microprocessors) that will control the analog (continuous in time and amplitude) dynamics of analog systems. From this consideration many errors from classical digital control were identified and solved and new methods were proposed:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">'''George W. Snyder''' (1780–1841) was a [[watchmaker]] and [[inventor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58929973|title=George Reynolds Snyder, Sr|last=|first=|year=2012|work=Find A Grave|page=|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George W. Snyder was a 19th-century reel maker from [[Paris, Kentucky|Paris]], [[Kentucky]]. He is credited for inventing the very first American-made [[fishing reel]] in 1820.

==George Snyder (fly reels)==

===Kentucky Reel===
Snyder's reel was designed for fly fishing, and named the Kentucky Reel. Without [[patent]] or trademark protection, the Kentucky reel was quickly copied by many others, including Meek, Milam, Sage, Hardman and Gayle. These artisans were trained in Jewelry fabrication and were experienced in cutting gears, constructing small parts, and doing precision work. In time, the Kentucky Reel was mass-produced by the emerging factories located in the Northeast, where they could be produced at a fraction of the cost and time required for hand-built construction. The availability of more affordable fly reels greatly stimulated the sales and popularity of fly fishing equipment, and was soon applied to bait casting reels, resulting in a surge in the popularity of fishing as a pastime among all levels of American society.&lt;ref&gt;Land, Bill. ORCA, "Reel History." Accessed December 6, 2011. http://orcaonline.org/reel_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;George Snyder was born in the same county as [[Daniel Boone]]—[[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks, Pa]]. He later went to [[Paris, Kentucky|Paris, Ky]]., then called Hopewell, about 1803, and died there on February 10, 1841, aged sixty years. He was a skillful watchmaker and silversmith; being
a good practical angler, and seeing the necessity for a rapid multiplying reel for black-bass fishing with the live minnow, he proceeded to invent one. Snyder's first reel was made for his own use, about 1810. He afterward made reels for members of his club, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall. James A., "Evolution of the 'Kentucky Reel'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The New York Reel==
During the middle of the 19th century, another fly reel was invented in New York City.  The "New York Reel" was usually made out of brass or nickel silver, and it was much heavier than the Kentucky Reel.  It had a serpentine crank or a "ball-handle".&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Charles. "Learning How to Fish." Accessed December 6, 2011. http://www.howtofishguide.com/tackle/history-fishing-reel.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gutenberg Museum''' is one of the oldest museums of printing in the world, located opposite the [[Mainz Cathedral|cathedral]] in the old part of [[Mainz]], Germany. It is named after [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of printing from movable metal type in Western Europe. The collections include printing equipment and examples of printed materials from many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
A group of people founded the museum in 1900, 500 years after [[Johannes Gutenberg]]’s birth, to honor the inventor and present his technical and artistic achievements to the public at large. They also aimed to exhibit the writing and printing of as many different cultures as possible.

Publishers, manufacturers of printing machines and printing houses donated books, apparatus and machines, which formed the basis of the collection. In its first few years the museum was part of the city library, meaning that the most beautiful and characteristic volumes from the library’s extensive collection could be requisitioned for the museum. Visitors were thus presented with a survey of almost 500 years of the printed book. In time the museum expanded to include sections on printing techniques, book art, job printing and ex-libris, graphics and posters, paper, the history of writing of all cultures of the world and modern artists’ books.

The Gutenberg Museum was originally laid out in two rooms at the Kurfürstliches Schloß ([[Electoral Palace Mainz]]), which also accommodated the city library. The museum moved into the new library building on the Rheinallee in 1912. The same year, 1925, saw the installation of a reconstruction of Gutenberg’s workshop which soon became one of the museum’s main attractions. Type founding, typesetting and printing could now be demonstrated visually. The replica of Gutenberg’s printing press, rebuilt according to the 15th- and 16th-century woodcuts, proved an object of great interest to visitors and was henceforth shown at a large number of exhibitions all over the world.

In 1927 the museum was able to move into the ''[[Zum Römischen Kaiser]]'' (1664), one of the most beautiful buildings in Mainz. This is now where the museum’s administration, the restoration workshop, library and Gutenberg Society are housed. The Late Renaissance building was heavily bombed in 1945; the museum’s contents had been stored in a safe place and thus remained intact. In 1962, the restoration of the Römischer Kaiser was complete. A new, modern exhibition building was also opened in the place where once the guest house ''König von England'' stood.

==Acquisitions==
The museum made several important acquisitions in the following years, among them a second [[Gutenberg Bible]], the Shuckburgh Bible in two volumes (1978), and two block books printed using wooden formes and today extremely rare. Another major change was the introduction of the museum’s educational unit in 1989. In 2000, the old museum building was restored and extended.

}}

The '''Hawks family''' (c.1750 – 1889) was one of the largest and most powerful British dynasties to arise during the [[Industrial Revolution|British Industrial Revolution]]. It owned several companies in the [[Northern England|North]] and the [[City of London]] - including '''Hawks and Co.''', '''Hawks, Crawshay, and Stanley''', and '''Hawks, Crawshay and Sons''' - all of which featured the Hawks name in the company name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Hawks_and_Co|title=Hawks and Co, Grace's Guide to British Industrial History|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had iron manufacture and engineering as their main enterprises.

The Hawks company reached the apogee of its power in the early [[Victorian period]], during which it employed over 2000 persons, and its reputation for engineering and bridge building was worldwide. Its [[Gateshead]] factories were termed New Deptford and New Woolwich after the location of two of its warehouses on the [[River Thames]], [[Deptford]] and [[Woolwich]]. The company owned its own ships, which it used to transport its manufacture. It built the striking [[High Level Bridge]] across the [[River Tyne]] that was opened by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1849, bridges as far afield as [[Constantinople]] and [[India]], and lighthouses in [[France]]. It produced [[ironclad warships]] and other materials for the [[Royal Navy]] to exponential profits during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and completed several large contracts for the [[East India Company]]. It also produced the first [[iron]] boat, the Vulcan, in 1821.

Several members of the Hawks family were involved in [[merchant banking]], several in [[Freemasonry]], and several in the advocacy of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig free-trade politics]]. Notable members included Sir Robert Shafto Hawks (1768-1840); Joseph Hawks {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DL|JP}} (1791-1873), merchant banker and Sheriff of Newcastle; George Hawks (1801-1863), [[Freemason]] and [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Grand Master of the Grand Cross Chapter of the Holy Temple of Jerusalem 
(Knights Templar)]], and Mayor of Gateshead; Mary Hawks (b.1829), who was the wife of [[Richard Clement Moody]], the founder of [[British Columbia]]; and [[Richard Stanley Hawks Moody|Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody]] (1854-1930).

The family developed areas of [[London|West London]], including [[Pembroke Square, London|Pembroke Square, Kensington]].
[[File:Newcastle Tyne Bridges, 19th June 1967.jpg|thumb| The [[High Level Bridge]] (left) built by the Hawks dynasty]]

The poet [[Joseph Skipsey]] worked for the Hawks company, at their Gateshead ironworks, from 1859 to 1863, until one of his children was killed in a fatal accident at the works in 1863. The job was obtained for Skipsey by [[James Thomas Clephan]], the editor of the ''Gateshead Observer''.

==Foundation==

The Hawks company was established by William Hawks (1708–1755), who worked for [[Ambrose Crowley|Sir Ambrose Crowley]], [[Sheriff of London]]. In the late 1740s, Hawks established a set of workshops on waste ground along the river at Gateshead. When Hawks died - at Gateshead on 23 February 1755 - the works passed to the eldest son, William Hawks (bap. 1730, d. 1810), who, with his first wife, Elizabeth Dixon,  established the Hawks' industrial empire. William (d.1810) formed a partnership with Thomas Longridge (bap. 1751, d. 1803), in 1770, and shortly afterwards acquired a plating forge at [[Beamish, County Durham]], which was the first of four separate metalworking sites operated by Hawks and Longridge along Beamish Burn.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt;

In the 1780s, a forge at Lumley, in [[County Durham]], and slitting and rolling mills, on the [[River Blyth, Northumberland|River Blyth]] in  Northumberland, were acquired by the company.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Hawks family&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Highlevelqueenvic.png|thumb|The inauguration of the High Level Bridge by HM Queen Victoria on 28 September 1849]]

By 1790, the works at Gateshead consisted of a substantial industrial complex that produced steel, anchors, heavy chains, steam-engine components, and a great diversity of smaller iron wares. The supply of ironware to the [[Board of Admiralty]] became a speciality. The firm's products were transported by the Gordon and Stanley families, the latter of whom had links to the old ordnance industry of the [[Weald]] and the naval yards of the [[River Thames]] and the [[Medway]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt; The family also owned the [[Bedlington Ironworks]] during this period.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt;

==Height: 1810 - 1880==
On 4 December 1810, the estate and works of William Hawks passed to his surviving sons: George Hawks (1766–1820) of Blackheath, Sir Robert Shafto Hawks (1768–1840),  and John Hawks (1770–1830).&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt;
 
The Hawks Company built Hawks Cottages in the 1830s in the Saltmeadows district of Gateshead for its workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/statue-of-the-week-4613575|title=The Journal, Statue of the Week, George Hawks|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Hawks works covered 44 acres by the end of the 1830s, and employed between 800 and 900 persons.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt; At the time of the visit of the British Association to Newcastle in 1863, it employed 1500 people, and owned 92 marine engines and 58 land engines, which together provided 5000 horse power, and 33 puddling furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore and Legend| page=30 | year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===The Vulcan===
The first iron boat to be built, which was a rowing boat that was named the Vulcan, was constructed, in 1821, at the Hawks's ironworks. When Sir Robert Shafto Hawks was informed of the purpose for which Samuel Tyne, the boat's inventor, had purchased iron from the Hawks company, he proffered all of the iron required for the task free of charge. Sir Robert arranged for cannons to be fired at the launch of the boat, which subsequently won races against wooden boats of the same capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore and Legend| page=30 | year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore and Legend| page=92 | year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]], 1826, when, laden with 12 persons including the rowers of the Vulcan, a boat accompanying the Mayor's barge down the river was hit by a steam vessel, two of the Vulcan's rowers were killed, and the Vulcan was subsequently abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore and Legend| page=30 | year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore and Legend| page=92 | year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products===
At around the year 1842, the Hawks company erected a cast iron bridge at [[York]], which spans the river [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]] in one arch of 172 feet in width. They company also reconstructed the [[Rowland Burdon (died 1838)|Rowland Burdon]] iron bridge at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which consists of a single arch of a width of 237 feet. The company also constructed the wrought iron gates for the [[Northumberland]] Docks; the iron lighthouses at [[Gunfleet]], [[Harwich]], and [[Calais]]; and the iron pier at [[Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore and Legend| page=30 | year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also built bridges in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Welford| first = Richard  | title = Monuments and Tombstones in the Church of St. Nicholas, Newcastle-upon-Tyne| page=21 | year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Middlebrook| first = S.  | title = Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

==Decline==

Hannah, Lady Hawks (d. 1863), the widow of Sir Robert Shafto Hawks, and her two sons sold their shares, in 1840, to George Crawshay a member of a prominent iron-making family of south Wales,. George Crawshay had been bought out of his family's iron merchanting business in London by his brother, [[William Crawshay II]]. The business developed by William Hawks had been divided between his three eldest surviving sons in 1810.  When he was able to acquire the shares of Joseph Hawks, the only surviving son of George Hawks of Blackheath, he obtained a second third of the company. The Bedlington works passed eventually to a cousin of the Hawkses, Michael Longridge (1785–1853), a pioneer of railway technology, and an associate of [[Robert Stephenson]], under whose superintendence the works became a training ground for a generation of celebrated engineers; including Sir [[Daniel Gooch]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt;

The dominant influence over the firm of Hawks, Crawshay &amp; Sons in its last years was George Crawshay (1821–1896), the son of George Crawshay and his wife, Like George Hawks, George Crawshay became a considerable political figure in the north-east. However, Crawshay's management of the company was incompetent: he devoted much of his time to political pursuits and failed to modernize the company, which manufactured diverse products by diverse processes, to enable it to outcompete the newer specialist companies. The specialist companies, such as those owned by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong]] and the William Galloway, the nail manufacturer, flourished as the Hawks company declined.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt;

In 1889, New Greenwich was suddenly closed, and Hawks, Crawshay, and Sons was liquidated. The circumstances surrounding the closure are mysterious: all of the firm's creditors were paid in full, but every single document of the company's archive was systematically destroyed by burning.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks family"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennison |first=Robert |last2=Scott |first2=Austin |date=2008 |title=The Ironworks of Hawks Crawshay &amp; Sons, Gateshead: 1748–1889|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/175035208X258329?journalCode=yhet19 |journal=Transactions of the Newcomen Society |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages= |doi= |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council| first = A.W.  | title = A Short History of Gateshead| page=| publisher=| year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Csöves villámfeszítő.png|thumb|Jedlik's tubular voltage generator]]
An '''impulse generator''' is an electrical apparatus which produces very short high-voltage or high-current surges. Such devices can be classified into two types: impulse voltage generators and impulse current generators. High impulse voltages are used to test the strength of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. Also, steep-front impulse voltages are sometimes used in nuclear physics experiments. High impulse currents are needed not only for tests on equipment such as lightning arresters and fuses but also for many other technical applications such as lasers, thermonuclear fusion, and plasma devices.

== Jedlik's tubular voltage generator ==

In 1863 Hungarian physicist [[Ányos Jedlik]] discovered the possibility of voltage multiplication and in 1868 demonstrated it with a "tubular voltage generator", which was successfully displayed at the [[Vienna World Exposition]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html |title=Innovators and Innovations |last=Sipka |first=László |date=Summer 2001 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |issue=162 |volume=XLII |journal=Hungarian Quarterly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095831/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early form of the impulse generators now applied in nuclear research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = Vista Books| isbn = 0962842206| last = Sisa| first = Stephen| title = The spirit of Hungary: a panorama of Hungarian history and culture| page = 308 |  location = Morristown, N.J| date = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury of the World Exhibition of 1873 in Vienna awarded his voltage multiplying condenser of [[Cascade connection (capacitors)|cascade connection]] with prize "For Development". Through this condenser, Jedlik framed the principle of surge generator of cascaded connection. (The Cascade connection was another important invention of Ányos Jedlik.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |title=Instituto IDEAL [English&amp;#93; |publisher=Instituto IDEAL [English] |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322223457/http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellotrade.com/energosolar/electronic-engineering.html |title=Electronic Engineering Manufacturer &amp; Wholesale Supplier From Hungary - Energosolar |publisher=Hellotrade.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marx generator ==
One form is the [[Marx generator]], after E. Marx who first proposed it in 1923. This consists of multiple capacitors that are first charged in parallel through charging resistors by a high-voltage, direct-current source and then connected in series and discharged through a test object by a simultaneous spark-over of the spark gaps. The impulse current generator comprises many capacitors that are also charged in parallel by a high-voltage, low-current, direct-current source, but it is discharged in parallel through resistances, inductances, and a test object by a spark gap.

==Governor General==
Payette was announced on July 13, 2017, as Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]]'s recommendation to be the [[List of Governors General of Canada|29th]] [[Governor General of Canada]]. Her term was scheduled to begin October 2, 2017, after the completion of briefings from the incumbent, [[David Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julie Payette named Governor General|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/julie-payette-named-governor-general/|website=Maclean's|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her salary was set at $290,660 per annum and an official residence at Rideau Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former astronaut Julie Payette to be Canada's next governor general|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/governor-general-canada-julie-payette-1.4201614|date=July 12, 2017|website=CBC|accessdate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement was made, Johnston issued a statement congratulating Payette and welcoming "a Canadian of extraordinary achievement, admired by all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message Following the Announcement of Canada's 29th Governor General|url=https://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=16942&amp;lan=eng|website=The Governor General of Canada|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the designate, Payette had her first official meeting with Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on September 20, 2017, at [[Balmoral Castle]] when she was also invested as an Extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada (CC), an Extraordinary Commander of the Order of Military Merit (CMM) and a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces (COM) by Her Majesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=16999&amp;lan=eng|title=The Governor General of Canada|first=The Office of the Secretary to the Governor|last=General|website=Gg.ca|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payette was installed as Canada's 29th Governor General on October 2, 2017. Afterwards, she urged Canadians to work together on issues such as climate change, migration and poverty. "Anyone can accomplish anything and rise to the challenge as long as they are willing to work with others, to let go of the personal agenda, to reach a higher goal and to do what is right for the common good. This is exactly what I hope my mandate as the Governor General will reflect," Payette said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/payette-governor-general-investiture-1.4313299|title=Julie Payette pushes strength of team work, power of dreams in debut speech as GG|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Canadian Science Policy Conference the next month, she argued strongly for greater public acceptance of science, saying that too many people believe in astrology, deny climate change, and believe that "maybe taking a sugar pill will cure cancer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadian Governor General's Defense of Science 'A Breath of Fresh Air'|last=Frazier|first=Kendrick|date=March–April 2018|work=Skeptical Inquirer|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] concerning climate change, commented that her remarks were "refreshing". George Dvorsky from Gizmodo.org stated '"Her words were a breath of fresh air"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Canadian Governor General's Defense of Science 'A Breath of Fresh Air'|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|pages=12–13|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-evaluating the role of GG===
As she was completing her first year as the viceregal representative in September 2018, Payette faced some criticism about controversial comments she had made against those who believe in creationism and those who did not believe in climate change.  Maintaining her position on the issues, Payette emphasized the importance of debate and critical thinking but admitted that she was still growing into her role and needed more time to adapt to the position. "I learned that you have to be careful about how you say things, but not what you say," she added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 30, 2018 |title=Gov. Gen. Julie Payette on what she learned from her controversial comments on science, religion and climate|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/governor-general-julie-payette-climate-speech-lessons-1.4805004 |work=CBC |access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, she offered an additional explanation to CPAC. "I made a speech as I had as an astronaut and I'm not an astronaut any longer, I'm governor general. I represent all Canadians. I've learned those lessons."&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |date=September 30, 2018 |title=It's not easy being GG; Payette tries to reassure staff as criticism mounts ceremony|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/payette-governor-general-anniversary-2018-1.4844727 |work=CBC |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks later, she faced criticism about her work ethic, with some suggesting that she had not devoted enough time and dedication to the role of GG and had not visited several of the provinces in her nearly 12-month tenure.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' published specifics confirming the more numerous appearances her two predecessors had made per year.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"&gt;{{cite news |date=September 21, 2018 |title=Gov.

Gen. Julie Payette faces questions over her workload and schedule |url=https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/09/23/gov-gen-julie-payette-faces-questions-over-her-workload-and-schedule.html |work=Toronto Star |access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' opinion piece offered this conclusion on Payette's tenure to date. "Canadians need to know that the Governor-General is fulfilling her duties. Her biggest challenge right now is to convince us that she is worthy of our trust".&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"/&gt;

Later in September, the GG's office confirmed that Payette would not preside over the 2018 Governor General's History Awards ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 26, 2018 |title=Julie Payette doesn't plan to preside over 2018 Governor General's History Awards ceremony|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/julie-payette-wont-preside-over-2018-governor-generals-history-awards-ceremony |work=National Post |access-date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been only one of several traditional roles that she would not fulfill; a full plan for her involvement in such discretionary responsibilities with various organizations was to be published but was not yet available at the time.

On September 27, Payette acknowledged the articles that had painted an "unfavourable image of our work" in an e-mail to staff, expressed regret about the effect of the criticisms on morale, and assured them that she was "very proud of all we have achieved together to date".&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

This is a list of [[Architectural lighting design|Lighting Design]] software for use in analyzing [[photometrics]], [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] (Building Information Modeling), and [[3D modeling]].  The software is typically used by importing the structural design via [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] files.  Then lighting elements are inserted.  And finally, the lighting objects are associated with a photometry via IES files. The photometry of a light fixture describes the way it distributes its light into space. Once this process is completed, the [[illuminance]] and [[luminance]] produced by each fixture in the space can be calculated. The output is typically a diagram indicating these by means of colors or numbers. This typically is the goal of technical photometry software.

In marketing and higher-level design, 3D photometric analysis is useful to give a graphical (no numerics) output of a proposed design.

[[File:NES-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nintendo developed its MMC chip line for use in the NES's cartridges to offload processing and expand the system's capabilities.]]
'''Multi-memory controllers''' or '''memory management controllers'''&lt;ref name="np"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why Game Paks Never Forget | work=Nintendo Power | publisher=Nintendo | issue=20 | date=Mar–Apr 1991 | pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''MMC''') are different kinds of special [[Microprocessor|chips]] designed by various [[video game developers]] for use in [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s. These chips extend the capabilities of the original [[Video game console|console]] and make it possible to create NES games with features the original console cannot offer alone.

These chips are also known as ''mappers''.

==List of MMC chips==

===UNROM===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[Pro Wrestling (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Pro Wrestling]]'',&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;{{rp|29}} ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'', ''[[Mega Man (video game)|Mega Man]]'', ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''

Early NES MMCs are composed of [[7400 series]] discrete logic chips.&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The UNROM, implemented with two such chips, divides the program space into two 16 KB banks. The MMC allows a program to [[Bank switching|switch one bank]] while keeping one bank always available.&lt;ref name="nesdevwiki_unrom"&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/UxROM UxROM from NESdevWiki] Retrieved on 2009-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a dedicated ROM chip to hold graphics data (called CHR by Nintendo), games using UNROM store graphics data on the program ROM and copy it to a RAM on the cartridge at run time.&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

===MMC1===
[[File:Nintendo-NES-Tetris-Cartridge-Board.jpg|link=File:Nintendo-NES-Tetris-Cartridge-Board.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tetris]] cartridge showing an MMC1B1 chip.]]
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Mega Man 2]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', and more.
The MMC1 is Nintendo's first custom MMC [[integrated circuit]] to incorporate support for saved games and multi-directional scrolling configurations.&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;{{rp|p.30}}
The chip comes in at least five different versions: ''MMC1A'', ''MMC1B1'', ''MMC1B2'', ''MMC1B3'' and ''MMC1C''. The differences between the different versions are slight, mostly owing to savegame memory protection behavior. The MMC1 chip allows for switching of different memory banks. Program ROM can be selected in 16KB or 32KB chunks, and character [[Read-only memory|ROM]] can be selected in 4KB or 8KB chunks. An unusual feature of this memory controller is that its input is [[Serial communication|serial]], rather than [[Parallel communication|parallel]], so 5 sequential writes (with [[bit shifting]]) are needed to send a command to the [[Integrated circuit|circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC1 MMC1 from NESdevWiki] Retrieved on 2009-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMC2===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]]''
The MMC2 is only used in  ''Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!'' and the later rerelease which replaced [[Mike Tyson]]. A single 8KB bank of program ROM can be selected (with the remaining 24KB locked) and character ROM can be selected in ''two pairs'' of 4KB banks, which would be automatically switched when the video hardware attempts to load particular graphic tiles from memory, thus allowing a larger amount of graphics to be used on the screen without the need for the game itself to manually switch them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC2 Nintendo MMC2 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMC3===
[[Image:MMC3B 01.jpg|thumb|right|The MMC3 chip, soldered onto a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] containing ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and others.]]
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[Mega Man 3]]'', ''[[Mega Man 4|4]]'', ''[[Mega Man 5|5]]'', ''[[Mega Man 6|6]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''&lt;sup&gt;NA/EU&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and more.
The MMC3 is Nintendo's most popular MMC chip. It comes in MMC3A, B, and C revisions. The MMC3 adds a [[scanline]] based [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] counter to make split screen scrolling easier to perform (mainly to allow the playfield to scroll while the status bar remains motionless at the top or bottom of the screen), along with two selectable 8KB program ROM banks and two 2KB+four 1KB selectable character ROM banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3 Nintendo MMC3 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMC4===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi|Fire Emblem]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem Gaiden]]'', and ''[[Famicom Wars]]''
This chip is only used in three games, all of which were released only for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in Japan, and were developed by [[Intelligent Systems]]. Functionally, it is nearly identical to the MMC2, with the only difference being that the MMC4 switches program ROM in 16KB banks instead of 8KB banks and has support for a battery-backed SRAM to save game data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC4 Nintendo MMC4 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMC5===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]''&lt;sup&gt;NA/EU&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Just Breed]]'', ''[[Metal Slader Glory]]'', ''[[Gun Sight|Laser Invasion]]'', ''[[Uchuu Keibitai SDF]]'', ''[[Nobunaga no Yabou - Bushou Fuuun Roku|Nobunaga's Ambition II]]'', ''[[Nobunaga no Yabou - Sengoku Gunyuu Den]]'', ''[[Bandit Kings of Ancient China]]'', ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms II]]'', ''[[Daikoukai Jidai|Uncharted Waters]]'', ''[[Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Gray Wolf]]'', ''[[Gemfire]]'', ''[[L'Empereur]]'', ''[[Ishin no Arashi]]'', ''[[Shin 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong - Yakuman Tengoku]]''

The MMC5 is Nintendo's largest MMC. It was originally also the most expensive. Only [[Koei]] used this chip regularly. The chip has 1 KB of extra [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], two extra [[square wave]] sound channels, one extra [[PCM]] sound channel, support for vertical split screen scrolling, improved graphics capabilities (making 16,384 different tiles available per screen rather than only 256, and allowing each individual 8x8-pixel background tile to have its own color assignment instead of being restricted to one color set per 2x2 tile group), highly configurable program ROM and character ROM bank switching, and a scanline-based IRQ counter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC5 Nintendo MMC5 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMC6===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[StarTropics]]'', ''[[Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II]]''
The MMC6 is similar to the MMC3, with an additional 1 KB of RAM which can be saved with battery backup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC6 Nintendo MMC6 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famicom Disk System===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: [[Akumajo Dracula]], ''[[Arumana no Kiseki]]'', ''[[Ai Senshi Nicol]]'', ''[[Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit]]'', ''[[Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa]]'', ''[[Crackout (video game)|Crackout]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Double Dribble (video game)|Double Dribble]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Dracula II - Noroi no Fuuin|Dracula II]], ''[[Falsion]]'', ''[[Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo]]'', ''[[Kid Icarus]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[KiKi KaiKai]]'', ''[[Meikyuu Jiin Dababa]]'', ''[[Metroid]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Pro Wrestling (NES video game)|Pro Wrestling]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Relics - Ankoku Yousai]]'', ''[[Risa no Yōsei Densetsu]]'', ''[[Shin Onigashima]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (FDS release), ''[[The Mysterious Murasame Castle]]'', ''[[Vs. Excitebike]]'', ''[[Yūyūki]]'', ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, and more.
The [[Famicom Disk System]]'s [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] is an extended audio chip, which supports one channel of single-cycle (6-bit × 64 step) [[table-lookup synthesis|wavetable-lookup synthesis]] with a built in [[phase modulation|phase modulator]] (PM) for sound generation similar to [[frequency modulation synthesis]].

===AOROM===
*Manufacturer: [[Nintendo]]
*Games used in: ''[[Battletoads]]'', ''[[Wizards &amp; Warriors]]'', ''[[Cobra Triangle]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]''
The A*ROM MMC, named after the AMROM, ANROM, and AOROM cartridge boards that use it, was developed by [[Chris Stamper]] of [[Rare (company)|Rare]], and manufactured by Nintendo. It is found in games developed by Rare for Nintendo, Tradewest, GameTek, Acclaim, and Milton Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardtable.txt List of NES games with publisher and board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827175333/http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardtable.txt |date=27 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses 32 KB ROM switch and a CHR RAM. Unlike other chips, it uses one screen mirroring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/AOROM AOROM – NESdevWiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party chips==
As Nintendo's NES licensing program allowed North America and Europe distribution to include only first-party hardware in its cartridges, these third party chips were supposed to be used only in Japan. However, some of them had been found in a few North American cartridges as well.

===VRC1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/VRC1|title=VRC1 - Nesdev wiki|website=wiki.nesdev.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
* Manufacturer: Konami, Jaleco (SS8805)
* Games used in: ''Exciting Boxing, Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Douchuu, Jajamaru Ninpouchou, King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch, Moero!! Junior Basket: Two on Two, Tetsuwan Atom, and more''

===VRC2===
*Manufacturer: Konami
*Games used in: ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures (video game)|Tiny Toon Adventures]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Akumajō Special: Boku Dracula-kun]]''
The VRC2 is a chip from Konami that allows program ROM to be switched in 8KB banks, and character ROM to be switched in 1KB banks. This MMC has two known revisions: VRC2a and VRC2b.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/VRC2 Konami VRC2 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===VRC3===

[[Image:VRCIV 2-TYPE 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The VRC4.]]
*Manufacturer: [[Konami]]
*Games used in: ''[[Gradius II]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Crisis Force]]'', Bio Miracle:Boku tte Upa, Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2'', WaiWai World, WaiWai World 2, Twinbee 3

===VRC6===
[[Image:vrc6.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The VRC6.]]
*Manufacturer: [[Konami]]
*Games used in: ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Akumajō Densetsu]]'', ''[[Mōryō Senki MADARA]]'', ''[[Esper Dream|Esper Dream II]]''
The VRC6 (Virtual Rom Controller) is an advanced MMC chip from Konami, supporting bank switching for both program code and graphics as well as a CPU cycle–based [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] counter, which can also act as a scanline counter. The chip also contains support for three extra sound channels (two [[square wave]]s of eight [[duty cycle]]s each, and one [[sawtooth wave]]). It is used in ''Akumajō Densetsu'' (the Japanese version of ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]''), while the Western version uses the MMC5 from Nintendo. Since the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] does not allow cartridges to add additional sound channels, the Famicom version's soundtrack was reworked to follow those specifications; thus, the soundtrack on the Western version is implemented by the five sound channels built into the stock NES.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking the NES for Shovel Knight|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidDAngelo/20140625/219383/Breaking_the_NES_for_Shovel_Knight.php|publisher=''[[Gamasutra]]''|last=D'Angelo|first=David|date=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VRC7===
[[Image:KVRC7.JPG|thumb|The VRC7 with a post-processor for the FM synthesis]]
*Manufacturer: [[Yamaha]]
*Games used in: ''[[Lagrange Point (video game)|Lagrange Point]]'', ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Trouble in Wackyland]]''
The VRC7 is a very advanced MMC chip from Konami, not only supporting bank switching and IRQ counting equivalent to the VRC6 but also containing a [[YM2413]] derivative providing 6 channels of [[FM Synthesis]] audio. This advanced audio is used only in the Famicom game ''Lagrange Point''; while the Japanese version of ''Tiny Toon Adventures 2'' also used the VRC7, it does not make use of the extended audio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/VRC7 Konami VRC7 from NESdevWiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namco 163===
*Manufacturer: [[Namco]]
*Games used in: ''[[Erika to Satoru no Yume Bōken]]'', ''[[Final Lap]]'', ''[[King of Kings (1988 video game)|King of Kings]]'', ''[[Mappy Kids]]'', ''[[Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II]]'', ''[[Namco Classic II]]'', ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game series)|Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms II]]'', ''[[Yokai Dochuki]]'', ''[[Rolling Thunder (video game)|Rolling Thunder]]''&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Top Striker''
The 163 has been only used in games exclusive to Japan. Its capabilities were a little better than Nintendo's MMC3. A variant contained extra sound hardware that plays 4-bit wave samples. It supports 1 to 8 extra sound channels, but audible [[aliasing]] appears when a sufficiently large number of channels are enabled.

===FME-7===
*Manufacturer: [[Sunsoft]]
*Games used in: ''[[Batman: Return of the Joker]]'', ''[[Hebereke]]'', ''[[Gimmick!]]'', and more.
The FME-7 is a memory mapping circuit developed by Sunsoft for use in NES and Famicom cartridges. It switches program ROM in 8KB banks and switches the character ROM 1KB banks. It also contains hardware to generate [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] signals after a specified number of CPU [[clock cycle]]s, thus achieving split-screen effects with minimal use of processing power. A special version of this MMC, labeled as "SUNSOFT 5B" rather than "FME-7", contains a version of the widely used [[Yamaha YM2149]]. This sound generation hardware is used on only one Famicom title: ''[[Gimmick!]]''.

===SUNSOFT-4===
[[Image:SUNSOFT-4 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|SUNSOFT-4]]
*Manufacturer: [[Sunsoft]]

==Unlicensed MMCs==
Some individual ([[Homebrew (video games)#Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)|homebrew]]) and unlicensed developers have made custom MMCs for the NES, most of which simply expand the available memory.

===228===
*Manufacturer: [[Active Enterprises]]
*Games used in: ''[[Action 52]]'', ''[[Cheetahmen II]]''
228 is a simple bank switching MMC developed for use in the games ''Action 52'' and ''Cheetahmen II''. It does not have a nametable control bit. In the ''Action 52'' multicart, it also contains a small 16-bit register area that contains the old menu selection when exiting a game.

'''Metal clay''' is a [[crafting|crafting medium]] consisting of very small particles of metal such as [[silver]], [[gold]], bronze, or [[copper]] mixed with an [[organic binder]] and water for use in making [[jewelry]], [[bead]]s and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any [[Modelling clay|soft clay]], by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired in a variety of ways such as in a [[kiln]], with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it.  The binder burns away, leaving the pure [[sintering|sintered]] metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as [[bronze]], [[sterling silver]], and [[steel]] also are available.

==History==
Metal clay first came out in Japan in 1990&lt;ref name="Morikawa patent"&gt;{{US patent|5328775}} citing May 18, 1990 (19900518) [JP] Japan 2- 128447.&lt;/ref&gt; to allow craft jewelry makers to make sophisticated looking jewelry without the years of study needed to make fine jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Musante|first=Lynda S. |oclc=410210887 |author2=Maria Nerius |date=2000  |title=Jewelry making for fun &amp; profit: Make money doing what you love! |publisher=[[Random House|Random House Digital, Inc.]] |location= |isbn=0-7615-2044-9 |page=ii-iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5dmsKNFOKYC&amp;pg=PT5 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silver metal clay==

Fine silver metal clay results in objects containing 99.9% pure silver, which is suitable for enameling. Lump metal clay is sold in sealed packets to keep it moist and workable. The silver versions are also available as a softer paste in a pre-filled syringe which can be used to produce extruded forms, in small jars of slip and as paper-like sheets, from which most of the moisture has been removed. Common brands of silver metal clay include Precious Metal Clay (PMC) and Art Clay Silver (ACS).

Metal clay artists looking for more strength in their silver creations can also mix PMC fine silver clay with an equal part of PMC Sterling clay.&lt;ref&gt;960: An alloy of sterling PMC |url=http://celiefagojewelry.blogspot.com/2014/02/960-new-alloy-of-sterling-pmc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The firing of this alloy is found to be up to {{convert|898|°C}} for two hours.

Another available alloy, EZ960 Sterling Silver Metal Clay was invented by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay™ and COPPRclay™. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at {{convert|913|°C}} for 2 hours, full ramp. No carbon required. Its shrinkage rate is smaller than other clays, at 10–11%.

===Precious Metal Clay (PMC)===
PMC was developed in the early 1990s in Japan by [[metallurgist]] Masaki Morikawa.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Precious Metal Clay by Mary Ann Devos (C)2003 published by Wardell Publications Inc {{ISBN|0-919985-36-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[solid phase|solid-phase]] [[sintered]] product of a [[Powder metallurgy|precious metal powder]] used to form a precious metal article,&lt;ref name="Morikawa patent"/&gt; the material consists of microscopic particles of pure silver or fine gold and a water-soluble, non-toxic, organic binder that burns off during firing. Success was first achieved with gold and later duplicated with silver. 
The PMC brand includes the following products:
* The original formula of PMC, now called "standard": fired at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for 2 hours, shrinks by 30% during firing.
* PMC+ &amp; PMCflex: fired at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for 10 minutes or {{convert|800|°C|°F}} for 30 minutes; shrinks 15%, due to a particle size reduction. PMC+ is also available in sheet form which can be worked like paper; for example, for [[origami]].
* PMC3: fired at {{convert|599|°C|°F}} for 45 minutes or {{convert|699|°C|°F}} for 10 minutes; shrinks by 10%. It can also be fired using a [[butane torch]] by heating it to [[Thermal radiation#Properties|orange heat]] for at least 2 minutes. It has a longer working life than the older formulations. It is also available in slip and paste forms which can be painted onto the surface of an object to be used as a mold.
* Aura 22: a 22-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] [[gilding]] material, a gold paste intended to be painted onto the surface of silver PMC pieces, or ready-made silver objects.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight, Tim. "What's New?" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, p42-45, 4p&lt;/ref&gt;
* PMC Pro: a harder product which is only 0.900 fineness silver, hence it cannot be [[Silver hallmarks|hallmarked]] as [[sterling silver]]. It also requires kiln firing in a tub of [[activated carbon]] for 1 hour at {{convert|760|°C|°F}}.
* PMC Sterling: is fired at {{convert|815|°C}} and shrinks by 10–20%. Because of the copper content in this formula, firing is a two-step process; step one is an open-shelf firing and step two requires a firing pan with activated carbon media.

===Art Clay Silver (ACS)===
ACS was developed by AIDA Chemical Industries, also a Japanese company. ACS followed PMC Standard with their Art Clay Original clay (more like PMC+ than PMC Standard), which allows the user to fire with a handheld torch or on a gas hob. Owing to subtle differences in the binder and suggested firing times, this clay shrinks less than the PMC versions, approximately 8–10%.

Further developments introduced the Art Clay Slow Dry, a clay with a longer working time. Art Clay 650 and Art Clay 650 Slow Dry soon followed; both clays can be fired at {{convert|650|°C|°F}}, allowing the user to combine the clay with glass and sterling silver, which are affected negatively by the higher temperatures needed to fire the first generation clays. AIDA also manufacturers Oil Paste, a product used only on fired metal clay or milled fine silver, and Overlay Paste, which is designed for drawing designs on glass and porcelain.

In 2006 AIDA introduced the Art Clay Gold Paste, a more economical way to work with gold. The paste is painted onto the fired silver clay, then refired in a kiln, or with a torch or gas stove. When fired, it bonds with the silver, giving a 22-carat gold accent. The same year also saw Art Clay Slow Tarnish introduced, a clay that tarnishes less rapidly than the other metal clays.

==Base metal clays==
Lump metal clay in bronze was introduced in 2008 by Metal Adventures Inc. and in 2009 by Prometheus. Lump metal clays in copper were introduced in 2009 by Metal Adventures Inc. and Aida. Because of the lower cost, the bronze and copper metal clays are used by artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | journal = Metal Clay Artist Magazine
 | pages = 7
 | volume = 1
 | issue = 3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; more often than the gold and silver metal clays in the American market place. The actual creation time of a bronze or copper piece is also far greater than that of its silver counterpart.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Base metal clays, such as bronze, copper, and steel metal clays are best fired in the absence of oxygen to eliminate the oxidation of the metal by atmospheric oxygen. A means to accomplish this –- to place the pieces in activated carbon inside a container – was developed by Bill Struve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | date = July 2008
 | journal = Art Jewelry
 | pages = 30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powders==
Metal clays are also available as dry powders to which water is added to hydrate and kneaded to attain a clay consistency.  One advantage to the powders are their unlimited shelf life. The first silver clay in powder form was released in 2006 as Silver Smiths' Metal Clay Powder.&lt;ref&gt;MCPsilver999 | url=http://www.metalclaypowder.com |&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years base metal clays by Hadar Jacobson and Goldie World released several variation containing copper, brass, and even steel.

[[File:IBM PC 5150.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An [[IBM]] computer with a green monochrome monitor]]

A '''monochrome monitor''' is a type of [[cathode-ray tube|CRT]] [[computer monitor]] which was very common in the early days of computing, from the 1960s through the 1980s, before color monitors became popular. They are still widely used in applications such as computerized [[cash register]] systems, owing to the age of many registers. '''Green screen''' was the common name for a monochrome monitor using a [[green]] "P1" [[phosphor]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunkerofdoom.com/tubes/crt/crt_phosphor_research.pdf |title=Cathode Ray Tube Phosphors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant in the early-to-mid-1980s, they succeeded [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] [[computer terminal|terminals]] and preceded color CRTs and later [[Liquid-crystal display|LCDs]] as the predominant visual output device for computers.

== Design ==

Unlike color monitors, which display text and graphics in multiple colors through the use of alternating-intensity red, green, and blue [[phosphor]]s, monochrome monitors have only one color of phosphor (''mono'' means "one", and ''chrome'' means "color"). All text and graphics are displayed in that color. Some monitors have the ability to vary the brightness of individual [[pixels]], thereby creating the illusion of depth and color, exactly like a black-and-white television.

Typically, only a limited set of brightness levels was provided to save [[display memory]] which was very expensive in the '70s and '80s. Either normal/bright or normal/dim (1 bit) per character as in the [[VT100]] or black/white per pixel in the [[Macintosh 128K]] or black, dark gray, light gray, white (2bit) per pixel like the [[NeXT MegaPixel Display]].

Monochrome monitors are commonly available in three colors: if the [[Phosphor#Standard phosphor types|P1 phosphor]] is used, the screen is green monochrome. If the [[Phosphor#Standard phosphor types|P3 phosphor]] is used, the screen is amber monochrome. If the [[Phosphor#Standard phosphor types|P4 phosphor]] is used, the screen is white monochrome (known as "paper white"); this is the same phosphor as used in early television sets.
An amber screen was claimed to give improved ergonomics, specifically by reducing eye strain; this claim appears to have little scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grandjean|first1=E|title=Ergonomics in Computerized Offices|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-85066-350-1|year=1986|chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the color amber is a softer light, and would be less disruptive to a user's circadian rhythm. 

== Usage ==
Well-known examples of early monochrome monitors are the [[VT100]] from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], released in 1978, the Apple Monitor III in 1980, and the [[IBM 5151]], which accompanied the [[IBM PC]] [[IBM 5150|model 5150]] upon its 1981 release.

The 5151 was designed to work with the PC's [[Monochrome Display Adapter|Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA)]] text-only [[graphics card]], but the third-party [[Hercules Graphics Card]] became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution [[bitmap]]ped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from [[spreadsheet]]s like [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM [[Color Graphics Adapter]] 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] and [[Video Graphics Array]] standards in the late 1980s, for [[dual-monitor]] applications.

== Clarity ==
Pixel for pixel, the monochrome monitors produce sharper text and images than color [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors. This is because a monochrome monitor is made up of a continuous coating of phosphor and the sharpness can be controlled by focusing the electron beam; whereas on a color monitor, each pixel is made up of three phosphor dots (one red, one blue, one green) separated by a mask. Monochrome monitors were used in almost all [[dumb terminal]]s and are still widely used in text-based applications such as computerized cash registers and [[point of sale]] systems because of their superior sharpness and enhanced readability.

Some green screen displays were furnished with a particularly full/intense phosphor coating, making the characters very clear and sharply defined (thus easy to read) but generating an afterglow-effect (sometimes called a "ghost image") when the text [[scroll]]ed down the screen or when a screenful of information was quickly replaced with another as in [[word processing]] page up/down operations. Other green screens avoided the heavy afterglow-effects, but at the cost of much more [[pixel]]ated character images. The 5151, amongst others, had brightness and contrast controls to allow the user to set their own compromise.

The ghosting effects of the now-obsolete green screens have become an eye-catching visual shorthand for computer-generated text, frequently in "futuristic" settings.  The opening titles of the first [[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]] film and the [[Matrix source code]] of the [[Matrix trilogy]] [[science fiction film]]s prominently feature computer displays with ghosting green text.  Green text is also featured in [[Dharma Initiative#Station 3: The Swan|the Swan]]'s computer in ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' series.

== Screen burn ==

Monochrome monitors are particularly susceptible to [[screen burn]] (hence the advent, and name, of the [[screensaver]]), because the phosphors used are very high intensity. Another effect of the high-intensity [[phosphors]] is an effect known as "ghosting", wherein a dim afterglow of the screen's contents is briefly visible after the screen has been blanked. This has a certain place in [[popular culture|pop culture]], as evidenced in movies such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.

This ghosting effect is deliberate on some monitors, known as "long persistence" monitors. These use the relatively long decay period of the phosphor glow to reduce flickering and eye strain.

'''NFPA 1123''', subtitled ''Code for Fireworks Display'' is a code administered, copyrighted, and published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA).  NFPA 1123 is the registered trademark of an American consensus [[standardization|standard]] which, like many NFPA documents, is systematically revised on a three year cycle.

The standard, despite its title, is not a [[legal code]], it is not published as an instrument of law and has no statutory authority unless adopted by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). The standard, widely adopted in the United States, is however deliberately crafted with language suitable for mandatory application to facilitate adoption into law by those empowered to do so.

==Document Scope==
The scope of the document is described as below on the NFPA website:

"Document Scope:  1.1.1 This code shall apply to the construction, handling, and use of fireworks and equipment intended for outdoor fireworks display. It also shall apply to the general conduct and operation of the display. (See definition 1.4.21, Fireworks Display.) 1.1.2 This code shall not apply to the manufacture, transportation, or storage of fireworks at a manufacturing facility. Similarly, this code shall not apply to the testing of fireworks under the direction of its manufacturer, provided permission for such testing has been obtained from the authority having jurisdiction, which shall be in accordance with NFPA 1124, Code for the Manufacture, Transportation, and Storage of Fireworks and Pyrotechnic Articles. 1.1.3 This code shall not apply to the use of consumer fireworks by the general public. 1.1.4 This code shall not apply to the transportation, handling, or use of fireworks by the armed forces of the United States. 1.1.5 This code shall not apply to the transportation, handling, or use of industrial pyrotechnic devices or fireworks, such as railroad torpedoes, fusees, automotive, aeronautical, and marine flares, and smoke signals. 1.1.6 This code shall not apply to the use of pyrotechnic devices or materials in the performing arts at distances less than those specified in this code and used in conformance with NFPA 1126, Standard for the Use of Pyrotechnics before a Proximate Audience. 1.1.7 This code shall not apply to the use of flame special effects in the performing arts when used in conformance with NFPA 160, Standard for Flame Effects before an Audience. 1.1.8 This code shall not apply to the sale and use of model rockets, model rocket motors, motor reloading kits, pyrotechnic modules, or components used in conformance with NFPA 1122, Code for Model Rocketry, or other propulsion devices as classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as Rocket Motors (UN0186), or Cartridges, power device (UN0275). 1.1.9 This code shall not apply to the use of explosives, firearms, or flammable special effects used in motion pictures, television, or other entertainment industries." [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=1123]

==History==
The NFPA 1123 was created to help prevent damage of property and the injury or death of individuals during outdoor firework displays.

'''Neurolixis''' is a biopharmaceutical company focused on novel drugs for the treatment of human [[central nervous system]] diseases.

Neurolixis Inc. was founded in 2011 and is managed by two pharmaceutical industry professionals, Mark A. Varney, PhD (Chief Executive Officer) and Adrian Newman-Tancredi, PhD, DSc (Chief Scientific Officer). The company's therapeutic focus is on CNS disorders including Parkinson's disease, neurological orphan disorders, depression and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurolixis.com/home.html |title=neurolixis.com |publisher=neurolixis.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172109/http://neurolixis.com/home.html |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has offices in Southern California and in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.castres-mazamet.com/html/poles-sud/50/#7/z&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Neurolixis announced that it had in-licensed two clinical-phase drugs from [[Pierre Fabre Group|Pierre Fabre Laboratories]], a French pharmaceutical company. The drugs ([[befiradol]] and [[F-15599]]) are targeted to the treatment of dyskinesia in [[Parkinson's disease]] and to breathing deficits in [[Rett syndrome]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://neurolixis.com/images/stories/nlx_pf_license_23sept13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurolixis has been awarded a series of research grants by the [[Michael J. Fox Foundation]] to undertake research examining the effects of novel, highly selective and efficacious serotonergic drugs targeting [[5-HT1A receptor]]s in brain regions relevant to therapeutic properties in Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/funded-grants.php?institution=Neurolixis,%20Inc |title=Parkinson's Disease Grants funded by the Michael J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10309">'''Nuclear criticality safety''' is a field of [[nuclear engineering]] dedicated to the prevention of [[nuclear and radiation accidents]] resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]].&lt;ref name="Knief"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knief |first=Ronald A. |title=Nuclear Criticality Safety: Theory and Practice |year=1985 |publisher=[[American Nuclear Society]] |isbn=0-89448-028-6 |pages=236 |url=http://www.new.ans.org/store/i_300020 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |format=Softcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear [[Critical mass|criticality]] safety is concerned with mitigating the consequences of a nuclear [[criticality accident]]. 
A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve [[fissile]] material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of [[radiation]]. Nuclear criticality safety practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in [[fissile material]] operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. A common practice is to apply a double contingency analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur. For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material. Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis. These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or [[Fault-tolerant system|fault-tolerant plant designs]], or, if such designs are not practicable, by [[administrative controls]] such as operating procedures, job instructions and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes that could lead to a nuclear criticality accident.

==Principles==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
A system will be exactly critical if the rate of neutron production from fission is exactly balanced by the rate at which neutrons are either absorbed or lost from the system due to leakage. Safely subcritical systems can be designed by ensuring that the potential combined rate of absorption and leakage always exceeds the potential rate of neutron production. (this is a textbook explanation, similar to electron "clouds" being taught in highschool, and is misleading.)

The parameters affecting the criticality of the system may be remembered using the phrase MAGICMERV, where each letter constitute a parameter important to nuclear criticality safety. It is important to note that these parameters are not independent from one another. For example, as you increase mass of a unit, its geometry and volume are also changing. 
[[File:Plutonium ring.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The hollow ring shape of this plutonium ingot favors neutron leakage and thus reduces the likelihood of criticality.]]

'''&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt;ass''': The probability of fission increases as the total number of fissile nuclei increases. The relationship is not linear. If a fissile body has a given size and shape but varying density and mass, there is a threshold below which criticality can not occur. This threshold is called the [[critical mass]].

'''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;bsorption''': Absorption removes neutrons from the system. Large amounts of absorbers are used to control or reduce the probability of a criticality. Good absorbers are boron, [[cadmium]], [[gadolinium]], silver, and [[indium]].

'''&lt;big&gt;G&lt;/big&gt;eometry/shape''' of the fissile material: If neutrons escape (leak from) the fissile system they are not available to cause [[Nuclear fission|fission events]] in the fissile material. Therefore, the shape of the fissile material affects the probability of occurrence of fission events. A shape with a large surface area, such as a thin slab, favors leakage and is safer than the same amount of fissile material in a small, compact shape such as a cube or sphere.

'''&lt;big&gt;I&lt;/big&gt;nteraction of units''': [[Neutron]]s leaking from one unit can enter another. Two units, which by themselves are sub-critical, could interact with each other to form a critical system. The distance separating the units and any material between them influences the effect.

'''&lt;big&gt;C&lt;/big&gt;oncentration/Density''': Neutron reactions leading to scattering, capture or fission reactions are more likely to occur in dense materials; conversely neutrons are more likely to escape (leak) from low density materials.

'''&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt;oderation''': Neutrons resulting from fission are typically fast (high energy). These fast neutrons do not cause fission as readily as slower (less energetic) ones. Neutrons are slowed down ([[Moderator (Nuclear Reactor)|moderated]]) by collision with atomic nuclei. The most effective moderating nuclei are hydrogen, [[deuterium]], beryllium and carbon. Hence hydrogenous materials including oil, polyethylene, water, wood, paraffin, and the human body are good moderators. Note that moderation comes from collisions; therefore most moderators are also good reflectors.

'''&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;nrichment''': The probability of a neutron reacting with a fissile nucleus is influenced by the relative numbers of fissile and non-fissile nuclei in a system. The process of increasing the relative number of fissile nuclei in a system is called [[Enriched uranium|enrichment]]. Typically, low enrichment means less likelihood of a criticality and high enrichment means a greater likelihood.

'''&lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;eflection''': When neutrons collide with other atomic particles (primarily nuclei) and are not absorbed, they are scattered (i.e. they change direction). If the change in direction is large enough, neutrons that have just escaped from a fissile body may be deflected back into it, increasing the likelihood of fission. This is called ‘reflection’. Good reflectors include hydrogen, [[beryllium]], carbon, lead, uranium, water, polyethylene, concrete, [[Tungsten carbide]] and steel.

'''&lt;big&gt;V&lt;/big&gt;olume''': For a body of fissile material in any given shape, increasing the size of the body increases the average distance that neutrons must travel before they can reach the surface and escape. Hence, increasing the size of the body increases the likelihood of fission and decreases the likelihood of leakage. Hence, for any given shape (and reflection conditions - see below) there will be a size that gives an exact balance between the rate of neutron production and the combined rate of absorption and leakage. This is the critical size.

'''Temperature''' is another parameter that affects the criticality of the system. This particular parameter is less common for the criticality safety practitioner, as in a typical operating environment, where the variation in temperature is minimal, or where the increase in temperature does not adversely affect the criticality of the system, often, it is assumed that room temperate is bounding of the actual temperature of the system being analyzed. This is however only an assumption, it is important for the criticality safety practitioner to understand where this not apply, such as high temperature reactors, or low temperature cryogenic experiments.

==Calculations and analyses==
To determine if any given system containing [[fissile]] material is safe, its neutron balance must be calculated. In all but very simple cases, this usually requires the use of computer programs to model the system geometry and its material properties.

The analyst describes the geometry of the system and the materials, usually with conservative or pessimistic assumptions. The density and size of any neutron absorbers is minimised while the amount of fissile material is maximised. As some moderators are also absorbers, the analyst must be careful when modelling these to be pessimistic. Computer codes allow analysts to describe a three-dimensional system with boundary conditions. These boundary conditions can represent real boundaries such as concrete walls or the surface of a pond, or can be used to represent an artificial infinite system using a periodic boundary condition. These are useful when representing a large system consisting of many repeated units.

Computer codes used for criticality safety analyses include COG (US),&lt;ref&gt;[http://cog.llnl.gov/ COG(US)]&lt;/ref&gt; MONK (UK),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answerssoftwareservice.com/monk/ MONK(UK)]&lt;/ref&gt; KENO (US),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/radiation_transport_criticality/codes.shtml KENO(US)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MCNP]] (US),&lt;ref&gt;[https://mcnp.lanl.gov/ MCNP(US)]&lt;/ref&gt; and CRISTAL (France).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cristal-package.eu/GB/Cristal.asp CRISTAL (France)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720154713/http://www.cristal-package.eu/GB/Cristal.asp |date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burnup credit==
Traditional criticality analyses assume that the [[fissile]] material is in its most reactive condition, which is usually at maximum [[Enriched uranium|enrichment]], with no irradiation. For [[spent nuclear fuel]] storage and transport, burnup credit may be used to allow fuel to be more closely packed, reducing space and allowing more fuel to be handled safely. In order to implement burnup credit, fuel is modeled as irradiated using pessimistic conditions which produce an isotopic composition representative of all irradiated fuel. Fuel irradiation produces [[actinides]] consisting of both neutron absorbers and [[fissionable]] isotopes as well as [[fission products]] which [[neutron absorber|absorb neutrons]].

In fuel storage pools using [[burnup]] credit, separate regions are designed for storage of fresh and irradiated fuel. In order to store fuel in the irradiated fuel store it must satisfy a loading curve{{citation needed|reason=it is not obvious what this means|date=October 2014}} which is dependent on initial enrichment and irradiation.

'''Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano''' is a [[Venice|Venetian]] company that produces [[glass art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts | first = Philippe | last = Garner | publisher = Galahad Books | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-88365-641-8 | page = 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably Roman murrine, [[mosaic]]s and [[chandelier]]s.

The company was formed in 1919 by a merger of Pauly &amp; C (founded 1902) and the Compagnia di Venezia e Murano (founded 1866). It has since expanded in 1932 with the acquisition of MVM Cappellin and in 1990 by the addition of the drawings and back catalogues of Toso Vetri d’Arte. The company maintains retail showrooms as well as exhibiting antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Venetian Glass: The Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu Collection | first = David Revere | last = McFadden |author2=Susan Sacks |author3=Marino Barovier |author4=Susanne K.

==History==

===Compagnia di Venezia e Murano===
Compagnia di Venezia e Murano began as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati &amp;C.]] in London in 1866 under the direction of Vicenza attorney [[Antonio Salviati]] and with the backing of two British men: archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]] and antiquarian Sir William Drake. The company was dedicated to using ancient techniques and utilized master glassblowers in its efforts to do so. It called in specialists from other fields like [[goldsmith]]ing and [[engraver|engraving]] to ensure authenticity and employed artist [[Giuseppe Devers]] to teach the techniques of enamelling and heat-applied glass gilding to company artisans. Archaeologist Layard was particularly interested in the mosaic glass techniques of Roman and pre-Roman artists, and he spent years personally overseeing the work of the company's technicians and glassblowers in attempting to revive those techniques. In 1872, the company was successful, managing to replicate the type of glass commonly known as "murrina" (plural, "murrine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Studio Glass, 1960-1990: An Interpretive Study | first = Martha Drexler | last = Lynn | publisher = Hudson Hills | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55595-239-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b4KhNlxnyOEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=murrina+glass&amp;as_brr=3 | page = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Il Museo vetrario di Murano e la annessa Scuola di disegno negli anni 1882-1884 |author=G.

The company was renamed Venice and Murano Glass and Mosaic Company Limited in 1872, and, in 1877, Layard purchased Salviati's interest so that Salviati could pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Art &amp; design in Europe and America, 1800-1900 | first = Simon | last = Jervis |author2=Albert Museum | publisher = E.P. Dutton | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-525-48352-7 | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company quickly earned a reputation for quality original glass art and reproductions as well as its many mural mosaics in [[Great Britain]] and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 238, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the murrine produced by Compagnia di Venezia e Murano was included in its exhibit at the International Exhibition in Paris, which was the chief attraction in Italian glass.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In its observations of the display, the United States Commission to the Paris exposition commented not only on "Roman murrhine glass", but also particularly on the mural glass mosaics, the "perfection of which" had "engaged the earnest attention of the company."&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaics produced by the company during the time period are still in existence in diverse areas such as Gonville and Caius College Chapel in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; [[St Paul's Within the Walls]] in Rome, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Westminster Cathedral]] in London, [[Old South Church]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] the [[Chamberlain Memorial]] in Birmingham, [[Palazzo Barbarigo]] and the [[Senate House (Kingston, New York)|Senate House]] rooms in the United States. The last specimen, a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]], was produced and donated in 1866.

Through the last years of the 19th century, Compagnia di Venezia e Murano took part in many other displays. Prior to the 1878 exhibition in Paris, it had shown at the [[Maritime Exhibition]] in Naples and the Trieste Exhibition in 1871 and at the International Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, where it won 13 prizes for decorative arts. It unveiled a new focus in 1881 with the display of the first of its glass phoenixes at the National Exhibition in Milan. It exported several thousand works for display at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, also setting up a [[kiln]] so that the public could observe the company's glass blowing techniques. In 1895, it exhibited at the first [[Venice Biennale]] (an event at which it would also feature later), with artisan Vincenzo Moretti taking prizes and artisan Attilio Spaccarelli earning special note for his engraving.

1900 saw a change in the company when its British owners sold their interest to a businessman from Venice named Tosolini, who was the owner of shops in St. Mark's Square. Under Tosoloni's ownership, the company stopped production in 1909, though it continued commercial distribution at St. Mark's Square.

===Merger with Pauly &amp; C===
[[File:Ponte dei consorzi.JPG|thumb|upright|Ponte dei Consorzi, front entry of Palazzo Cappello Trevisan in Venice.]]
Pauly &amp; C was formed in 1903 by Emilio Pauly, Alessandro Hirscber Hellman, Vittorio Emanuele Toldo and Ernesto Graziadei, opening showrooms in [[Palazzo Trevisan Cappello]], which would remain the headquarters of the company until its closure in 2007 for restoration. In 1919, Pauly &amp; C. and Compagnia di Venezia e Murano were both purchased by the Milan Società Anonima Sanitaria, which resold them the following year to Gaetano Ceschina of [[Milan]]. The newly merged company, retitled to its present name, continued display in its previous locations of St. Mark's Square and the Palazzo Trevisan Cappello. In 1925, the merged company resumed production of glassworks on Murano and began exhibiting again at the Monza Tirennale.

===Post-merger growth and development===
The company grew in 1933 with the acquisition of Maestri Vetrai Muranesi Cappellin, or MVM Cappellin, a glass company formed in 1925 by Paolo [[Venini]] and Giacomo Cappellin, which transferred to them rights to the works and designs of the MVM Cappellin artists such as [[Vittorio Zecchin]] and [[Carlo Scarpa]]. The company expanded into commissioned chandeliers, with notable pieces from the period being placed in such locations as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] in Rome; the [[Vatican Palace]], and the [[Amalienborg Palace|Royal Palace in Copenhagen]]. More recently, interior lighting has been designed for such places as the Palazzo Bezzi in [[Ravenna]] and the Al Assawi family palace. In 1990, the company again expanded with the acquisition of [[Toso Vetri d’Arte]] glassworks.

===Transition===
Ceschina sold his interest in the company in 1963 to the Barbon family, who retained it until 1976, when they sold to Andrea Boscaro. Boscaro owned the company for almost 30 years before 2005.

==Artistic associations==
The company has a long history of association with international artisans. In the period following [[World War II|the second World War]], the company undertook long-term associations with master glassblowers [[Anzolo Fuga]] and [[Alfredo Barbini]], engraver [[Francesco Andolfato]] and painter [[Enzo Scarpa]]. Shorter associations include sculptor [[Napoleone Martinuzzi]] in the 1960s, painter [[Libero Vitali]] in 1971, architect [[Franz Prati]] between 1996 and 1997, and fashion designer [[Romeo Gigli]] in 1997. In the later 1990s, the company also featured exclusive designs by [[Heinz Oestergaard]], [[Maria Teresa Lorella Gnutti]] and [[Berit Johansson]], whose association with the company persisted. Since the turn of the century, associations have included Venetian sculptor [[Livio de Marchi]] and Chinese artist [[Xiao Fan Ru]].

==Museum display==
Glass art produced by Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano is on display in a number of museums. Among them:

*The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], UK
*The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], USA

'''PostScript''' ('''PS''') is a [[page description language]] in the [[electronic publishing]] and [[desktop publishing]] business.  It is a [[Type system|dynamically typed]], [[concatenative programming language]] and was created at [[Adobe Systems]] by [[John Warnock]], [[Charles Geschke]], Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and Bill Paxton from 1982 to 1984.

== History ==
The concepts of the PostScript language were seeded in 1976 when [[John Warnock]] was working at [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]], a [[computer graphics]] company. At that time John Warnock was developing an interpreter for a large three-dimensional graphics database of [[New York Harbor]]. Warnock conceived the Design System language to process the graphics.

Concurrently, researchers at [[Xerox PARC]] had developed the first [[laser printer]] and had recognized the need for a standard means of defining page images. In 1975-76 [[Bob Sproull]] and [[William Newman (computer scientist)|William Newman]] developed the Press format, which was eventually used in the [[Xerox Star]] system to drive laser printers. But Press, a data format rather than a language, lacked flexibility, and PARC mounted the [[Interpress]] effort to create a successor.

In 1978 Warnock left Evans &amp; Sutherland and joined Xerox PARC to work with [[Martin Newell (computer graphics)|Martin Newell]].  They rewrote Design System to create the interpretive language, J &amp; M or JaM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Masterminds of Programming|last=Biancuzzi|first=Federico|last2=Warden|first2=Shane|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=9780596515171|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 16. PostScript}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for "John and Martin") which was used for [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] design and the investigation of type and graphics printing. This work later evolved and expanded into the Interpress language.

Warnock left with [[Chuck Geschke]] and founded [[Adobe Systems]] in December 1982. They, together with Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and [[Bill Paxton (computer scientist)|Bill Paxton]] created a simpler language, similar to Interpress, called PostScript, which went on the market in 1984. At about this time they were visited by [[Steve Jobs]], who urged them to adapt PostScript to be used as the language for driving laser printers.

In March 1985, the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] was the first printer to ship with PostScript, sparking the [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) revolution in the mid-1980s. The combination of technical merits and widespread availability made PostScript a language of choice for graphical output for printing applications. For a time an [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] (sometimes referred to as a [[Raster Image Processor|RIP]] for Raster Image Processor) for the PostScript language was a common component of laser printers, into the 1990s.

However, the cost of implementation was high; computers output raw PS code that would be interpreted by the printer into a raster image at the printer's natural resolution. This required high performance [[microprocessor]]s and ample [[computer memory|memory]]. The LaserWriter used a 12&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68000]], making it faster than any of the Macintosh computers to which it attached. When the laser printer engines themselves cost over a thousand dollars the added cost of PS was marginal.  But as printer mechanisms fell in price, the cost of implementing PS became too great a fraction of overall printer cost; in addition, with desktop computers becoming more powerful, it no longer made sense to offload the rasterisation work onto the resource-constrained printer. By 2001, few lower-end printer models came with support for PostScript, largely due to growing competition from much cheaper non-PostScript ink jet printers, and new software-based methods to render PostScript images on the computer, making them suitable for any printer; [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], a descendant of PostScript, provides one such method, and has largely replaced PostScript as ''[[de facto]]'' standard for electronic document distribution.

On high-end printers, PostScript processors remain common, and their use can dramatically reduce the CPU work involved in printing documents, transferring the work of rendering PostScript images from the computer to the printer.

=== PostScript Level 1 ===
The first version of the PostScript language was released to the market in 1984. The suffix ''Level 1'' was added when Level 2 was introduced.

=== PostScript Level 2 ===
PostScript Level 2 was introduced in 1991, and included several improvements: improved speed and reliability, support for in-RIP separations, [[Image compression|image decompression]] (for example, [[JPEG]] images could be rendered by a PostScript program), support for composite [[fonts]], and the form mechanism for caching reusable content.

=== PostScript 3 ===
PostScript 3 (Adobe dropped the "level" terminology in favor of simple versioning) came at the end of 1997, and along with many new dictionary-based versions of older operators, introduced better color handling and new filters (which allow in-program compression/decompression, program chunking, and advanced error-handling).

PostScript 3 was significant in terms of replacing the existing proprietary color electronic prepress systems, then widely used for magazine production, through the introduction of smooth shading operations with up to 4096 shades of grey (rather than the 256 available in PostScript Level 2), as well as DeviceN, a [[color space]] that allowed the addition of additional ink colors (called [[spot color]]s) into composite color pages.

== Use in printing ==

=== Before PostScript ===
Prior to the introduction of PostScript, printers were designed to print character output given the text&amp;mdash;typically in [[ASCII]]&amp;mdash;as input. There were a number of technologies for this task, but most shared the property that the [[glyph]]s were physically difficult to change, as they were stamped onto [[typewriter]] keys, bands of metal, or optical plates.

This changed to some degree with the increasing popularity of [[dot matrix printer]]s. The characters on these systems were drawn as a series of dots, as defined by a [[typeface|font]] table inside the printer. As they grew in sophistication, dot matrix printers started including several built-in fonts from which the user could select, and some models allowed users to upload their own custom glyphs into the printer.

Dot matrix printers also introduced the ability to print [[raster graphics]]. The graphics were interpreted by the computer and sent as a series of dots to the printer using a series of [[escape sequence]]s. These [[printer control language]]s varied from printer to printer, requiring program authors to create numerous [[device driver|drivers]].

[[Vector graphics]] printing was left to special-purpose devices, called [[plotter]]s. Almost all plotters shared a common command language, [[HPGL]], but were of limited use for anything other than printing graphics. In addition, they tended to be expensive and slow, and thus rare.

=== PostScript printing ===
Laser printers combine the best features of both printers and plotters. Like plotters, laser printers offer high quality line art, and like dot-matrix printers, they are able to generate pages of text and raster graphics.  Unlike either printers or plotters, however, a laser printer makes it possible to position high-quality graphics and text on the same page.  PostScript made it possible to fully exploit these characteristics, by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer.

PostScript went beyond the typical printer control language and was a complete programming language of its own. Many applications can transform a document into a PostScript program whose execution will result in the original document. This program can be sent to an [[Interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] in a printer, which results in a printed document, or to one inside another application, which will display the document on-screen. Since the document-program is the same regardless of its destination, it is called ''device-independent''.

PostScript is noteworthy for implementing on-the fly [[rasterization]]; everything, even text, is specified in terms of straight lines and cubic [[Bézier curve]]s (previously found only in [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications), which allows arbitrary scaling, rotating and other transformations. When the PostScript program is interpreted, the interpreter converts these instructions into the dots needed to form the output. For this reason PostScript interpreters are occasionally called PostScript [[Raster Image Processor|raster image processor]]s, or RIPs.

=== Font handling ===
{{main|PostScript fonts}}
Almost as complex as PostScript itself is its handling of [[typeface|fonts]]. The font system uses the PS graphics primitives to draw glyphs as curves, which can then be rendered at any [[Image resolution|resolution]]. A number of [[typographic]] issues had to be considered with this approach.

One issue is that fonts do not actually scale linearly at small sizes; features of the glyphs will become proportionally too large or small and they start to look wrong. PostScript avoided this problem with the inclusion of [[font hinting]], in which additional information is provided in horizontal or vertical bands to help identify the features in each letter that are important for the rasterizer to maintain. The result was significantly better-looking fonts even at low resolution; it had formerly been believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task.

At the time, the technology for including these hints in fonts was carefully guarded, and the hinted fonts were compressed and encrypted into what Adobe called a ''[[Type 1 Font]]'' (also known as ''PostScript Type 1 Font'', ''PS1'', ''T1'' or ''Adobe Type 1''). Type 1 was effectively a simplification of the PS system to store outline information only, as opposed to being a complete language (PDF is similar in this regard). Adobe would then sell licenses to the Type 1 technology to those wanting to add hints to their own fonts. Those who did not license the technology were left with the ''[[Type 3 Font]]'' (also known as ''PostScript Type 3 Font'', ''PS3'' or ''T3''). Type 3 fonts allowed for all the sophistication of the PostScript language, but without the standardized approach to hinting.

The [[Type 2 font]] format was designed to be used with [[Compact Font Format]] (CFF) charstrings, and was implemented to reduce the overall font file size. The [[CFF/Type 2 font|CFF/Type2]] format later became the basis for handling PostScript outlines in [[OpenType]] fonts.

The [[CID-keyed font]] format was also designed, to solve the problems in the [[OCF/Type 0 font]]s, for addressing the complex Asian-language ([[CJK]]) encoding and very large character set issues. The CID-keyed font format can be used with the Type 1 font format for standard CID-keyed fonts, or Type 2 for CID-keyed OpenType fonts.

To compete with Adobe's system, Apple designed their own system, [[TrueType]], around 1991. Immediately following the announcement of TrueType, Adobe published the specification for the Type 1 font format. Retail tools such as Altsys [[Fontographer]] (acquired by [[Macromedia]] in January 1995, owned by [[FontLab]] since May 2005) added the ability to create Type 1 fonts. Since then, many free Type 1 fonts have been released; for instance, the fonts used with the [[TeX]] typesetting system are available in this format.

In the early 1990s there were several other systems for storing outline-based fonts, developed by [[Bitstream Inc.|Bitstream]] and [[METAFONT]] for instance, but none included a general-purpose printing solution and they were therefore not widely used.

In the late 1990s, Adobe joined Microsoft in developing [[OpenType]], essentially a functional superset of the Type 1 and TrueType formats. When printed to a PostScript output device, the unneeded parts of the OpenType font are omitted, and what is sent to the device by the driver is the same as it would be for a TrueType or Type 1 font, depending on which kind of outlines were present in the OpenType font.

=== Other implementations ===
In the 1980s, Adobe drew most of its revenue from the licensing fees for their implementation of PostScript for printers, known as a [[raster image processor]] or ''RIP''.  As a number of new [[RISC]]-based platforms became available in the mid-1980s, some found Adobe's support of the new machines to be lacking.

This and issues of cost led to third-party implementations of PostScript becoming common, particularly in low-cost printers (where the licensing fee was the sticking point) or in high-end typesetting equipment (where the quest for speed demanded support for new platforms faster than Adobe could provide). At one point,  Microsoft licensed to Apple a PostScript-compatible interpreter it had bought called [[TrueImage]], and Apple licensed to Microsoft its new font format, [[TrueType]].  Apple ended up reaching an accord with Adobe and licensed genuine PostScript for its printers, but TrueType became the standard [[outline font]] technology for both Windows and the Macintosh.

Today, third-party PostScript-compatible interpreters are widely used in printers and multifunction peripherals (MFPs).  For example, [[CSR plc]]'s IPS PS3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.csr.com/products/120/ips-ps3 | title = IPS PS3 | publisher = CSR | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120724005159/http://www.csr.com/products/120/ips-ps3 | archivedate = 2012-07-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreter, formerly known as PhoenixPage, is standard in many printers and MFPs, including those developed by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and sold under the [[LaserJet]] and Color LaserJet lines.  Other third-party PostScript solutions used by print and MFP manufacturers include Jaws&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws-postscript-interpreter/ | title = Jaws | publisher = Global graphics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Harlequin RIP]], both by [[Global Graphics]].  A [[free software]] version, with several other applications, is [[Ghostscript]].  Several compatible interpreters are listed on the Undocumented Printing Wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page_description_languages/postscript | publisher = Undocumented Printing | format = wiki | title = Formats | contribution = Page description languages: Postscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic, inexpensive laser printers do not support PostScript, instead coming with drivers that simply rasterize the platform's native graphics formats rather than converting them to PostScript first.{{cn|date=July 2015}}  When PostScript support is needed for such a printer, Ghostscript can be used. There are also a number of commercial PostScript interpreters, such as [[TeleType Co.]]'s T-Script.

== Use as a display system ==
{{main|Display PostScript|NeWS}}
PostScript became commercially successful due to the introduction of the [[graphical user interface]], allowing designers to directly lay out pages for eventual output on laser printers. However, the GUI's own graphics systems were generally much less sophisticated than PostScript; Apple's [[QuickDraw]], for instance, supported only basic lines and arcs, not the complex [[B-spline]]s and advanced region filling options of PostScript. In order to take full advantage of PostScript printing, applications on the computers had to re-implement those features using the host platform's own graphics system. This led to numerous issues where the on-screen layout would not exactly match the printed output, due to differences in the implementation of these features.

As computer power grew, it became possible to host the PS system in the computer rather than the printer. This led to the natural evolution of PS from a printing system to one that could also be used as the host's own graphics language. There were numerous advantages to this approach; not only did it help eliminate the possibility of different output on screen and printer, but it also provided a powerful graphics system for the computer, and allowed the printers to be "dumb" at a time when the cost of the laser engines was falling. In a production setting, using PostScript as a display system meant that the host computer could render low-resolution to the screen, higher resolution to the printer, or simply send the PS code to a smart printer for offboard printing.

However, PostScript was written with printing in mind, and had numerous features that made it unsuitable for direct use in an interactive display system. In particular, PS was based on the idea of collecting up PS commands until the &lt;code&gt;showpage&lt;/code&gt; command was seen, at which point all of the commands read up to that point were interpreted and output. In an interactive system this was clearly not appropriate. Nor did PS have any sort of interactivity built in; for example, supporting hit detection for mouse interactivity obviously did not apply when PS was being used on a printer.

When [[Steve Jobs]] left Apple and started [[NeXT]], he pitched Adobe on the idea of using PS as the display system for his new workstation computers. The result was [[Display PostScript]], or DPS. DPS added basic functionality to improve performance by changing many string lookups into 32 bit integers, adding support for direct output with every command, and adding functions to allow the GUI to inspect the diagram. Additionally, a set of "bindings" was provided to allow PS code to be called directly from the [[C programming language]]. NeXT used these bindings in their [[NeXTStep]] system to provide an [[object oriented]] graphics system. Although DPS was written in conjunction with NeXT, Adobe sold it commercially and it was a common feature of most [[Unix workstation]]s in the 1990s.

[[Sun Microsystems]] took another approach, creating [[NeWS]]. Instead of DPS's concept of allowing PS to interact with C programs, NeWS instead extended PS into a language suitable for running the entire GUI of a computer. Sun added a number of new commands for timers, mouse control, interrupts and other systems needed for interactivity, and added [[data structure]]s and language elements to allow it to be completely object oriented internally. A complete GUI, three in fact, were written in NeWS and provided for a time on their workstations. However, the ongoing efforts to standardize the [[X11]] system led to its introduction and widespread use on Sun systems, and NeWS never became widely used.

== The language ==
PostScript is a [[Turing-complete]] programming language, belonging to the [[concatenative programming language|concatenative]] group. Typically, PostScript programs are not produced by humans, but by other programs. However, it is possible to write computer programs in PostScript just like any other programming language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tinaja.com/post01.shtml PostScript Library]. Don Lancaster's Guru's Lair.&lt;/ref&gt;

PostScript is an [[Interpreted language|interpreted]], [[Stack-oriented programming language|stack-based]] language similar to [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] but with strong dynamic [[Type system|typing]], data structures inspired by those found in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[scoped memory]] and, since language level 2, [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. The language syntax uses [[reverse Polish notation]], which makes the order of operations unambiguous, but reading a program requires some practice, because one has to keep the layout of the [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] in mind. Most ''operators'' (what other languages term ''functions'') take their arguments from the stack, and place their results onto the stack. ''[[Literal (computer science)|Literal]]s'' (for example, numbers) have the effect of placing a copy of themselves on the stack. Sophisticated data structures can be built on the ''array'' and ''dictionary'' types, but cannot be declared to the type system, which sees them all only as arrays and dictionaries, so any further typing discipline to be applied to such user-defined "types" is left to the code that implements them.

The character "%" is used to introduce comments in PostScript programs. As a general convention, every PostScript program should start with the characters "%!PS" as an [[interpreter directive]] so that all devices will properly interpret it as PostScript.

=== "Hello world" ===
A [[Hello World program]], the customary way to show a small example of a complete program in a given language, might look like this in PostScript (level 2):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=postscript&gt;
 %!PS
 /Courier             % name the desired font
 20 selectfont        % choose the size in points and establish 
                      % the font as the current one
 72 500 moveto        % position the current point at 
                      % coordinates 72, 500 (the origin is at the 
                      % lower-left corner of the page)
 (Hello world!) show  % stroke the text in parentheses
 showpage             % print all on the page
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

or if the output device has a console

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=postscript&gt;
 %!PS
 (Hello world!) =
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Units of length ===

PostScript uses the [[Point (typography)|point]] as its unit of length. However, unlike some of the other versions of the point, PostScript uses exactly 72 points to the inch. Thus:

: {{math|1=1 point = {{sfrac|1|72}} inch = {{sfrac|25.4|72}} mm = {{sfrac|127|360}} mm = 352.777…  micrometers}}

For example, in order to draw a vertical line of 4&amp;nbsp;cm length, it is sufficient to type:

 0 0 moveto 
 0 113.385827 lineto stroke

More readably and idiomatically, one might use the following equivalent, which demonstrates a simple procedure definition and the use of the mathematical operators &lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang="postscript"&gt;
/cm {72 mul 2.54 div} def               % 1 inch = 2.54 cm exactly
 0 0 moveto
 0 4 cm lineto stroke
&lt;/source&gt;
Most implementations of PostScript use [[single-precision]] reals (24-bit mantissa), so it is not meaningful to use more than 9 decimal digits to specify a real number, and performing calculations may produce unacceptable round-off errors.

[[File:Putchers.jpg|right|thumb|George Whittaker collecting salmon from putchers at [[Goldcliff, Newport|Goldcliff]], circa 1923]]
'''Putcher fishing''' is a type of fishing (usually of [[salmon]]) which employs a large number of '''putcher''' baskets, set in a fixed wooden frame, against the [[tide]] in a river [[estuary]], notably on the [[River Severn]], in [[England]] and South East [[Wales]]. Putchers are placed in rows, standing four or five high, in a wooden "rank" set out against the incoming and/or outgoing tides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salmonboats.co.uk/1252.html Putcher Use in the Severn Estuary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally the putcher was made of [[hazel]] rods with withy ([[willow]]) plait, both materials being grown locally on the [[Caldicot and Wentloog Levels]]. Modern baskets made of [[steel]] or [[aluminium]] wire were introduced in the 1940s and 1950s.

==History==
The trapping of fish is probably one of the oldest known forms of fishing. The exact origin of putcher fishing along the River Severn is not known, but a memorial song recorded in 1663 mentions two fixed engines operating "between the Hill and the Pile" – undoubtedly references to Hill Farm and the Pill Reen or "Monksditch" at [[Goldcliff]]. Evidence for the use of putchers in medieval times has recently been revealed during construction of the [[Second Severn Crossing]] &lt;ref&gt;Goldbold, R.C. and Turner, R.C. (with contributions by Hillam, J., Johnson, S. and O'Sullivan, A.), ''Medieval Fishtraps in the Severn Estuary, Medieval Archaeology'', '''Vol 38''', 1994, pp 19-54. Publisher: Maney. ISSN 0076-6097.&lt;/ref&gt;

A salmon fishery of some kind was probably in operation at the time of the [[Priory]] at Goldcliff and then passed, at the time of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]], to [[Eton College]]. In the 1920s there were ranks holding some 2,400 baskets. The revenue from this enterprise provided an endowment to the Church of the Blessed Virgin at Eton. In addition, fresh salmon were provided for the breakfast of the scholars at the college. The fishery was owned for much of the later part of the twentieth century by Mr John Williams who employed one full-time fisherman Mr Wyndham Howells. The lease for the fishery was subsequently taken over by a [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] fishmonger. The fishery at Porton was acquired in 1902 by the [[Pontypool]] Park Estate and was for many years run during the fishing season run by Mr Keyte, a member of a long-established family of Goldcliff farmers.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, J. Geraint, ''Commercial Salmon Fishing in Welsh Rivers. Folk Life - Journal of the Society of Folk Life Studies'', '''Vol 9''', 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fish traps in Wales==
During the later half of the twentieth century numerous fixed weirs, installed in rivers and shores throughout Wales for the purpose of catching fish, fell into disuse. In addition to fixed traps, however, Wales had a large number of removable traps, also known as "hecks", "crucks", "cribs" and "inscale". The basket traps used at [[Goldcliff]] and Porton in the [[Severn Estuary]] were known as "putchers".&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

Fishing for salmon using many of these devices was forbidden in England and Wales by the Salmon Fishery Acts of 1861 and 1865, except under grant or charter, or by the right of "immemorial usage". Indeed, Special Constables were appointed by the Act of 1865 to enquire into the legality of all "fixed engines" being used to catch salmon. Only if proven legal would the constables then issue a certificate of legality. In this way the number, size and position of all salmon weirs became fixed for all time.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

==Goldcliff and Porton==
In South East Wales the baskets at Porton and Goldcliff came under the jurisdiction of the [[River Usk|Usk]] River Authority and were permitted to be used as "privileged fixed engines". Two others at nearby [[Undy]] and [[Redwick, Newport|Redwick]], also on the shoreline of the [[Severn Estuary]], fell out of use on the 1930s. The [[River Wye|Wye]] River Authority operated a weir of 500 baskets at [[Beachley]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and a number of other weirs were operated by the Severn River Authority on both sides of the [[River Severn]].

From 1913 to 1950 fisherman George Whittaker was employed at the Goldcliff Fishery, first by Mr Fennell and later by Mr Burge. Whittaker was to become a notable source of information about putcher fishing there.&lt;ref name="Hando"&gt;[[Fred Hando|Hando, F.J.]], (1958) "Out and About in Monmouthshire", R. H. Johns, Newport&lt;/ref&gt; The Putchers at Goldcliff were traditionally open in weave, being constructed from [[hazel]] rods and [[willow|withy]] saplings cut in the autumn from a {{convert|6|acre|ha|adj=on}} withy plantation at [[Llanwern]]. The baskets were made and repaired by the fishermen themselves during the closed season between 14 August and 1 May. The wooden putcher was gradually superseded, from 1942, by galvanised [[steel]] wire baskets and then later by baskets of [[aluminium]] wire, both of which were more [[seawater]] resistant. After 1952 the baskets at Goldcliff and Porton were exclusively aluminium, although the traditional measurements were strictly adhered to by the modern manufacturers. The galvanised putchers with {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} square mesh were supplied flat and wired into shape by the fishermen. The aluminium putchers, with a diamond mesh, were supplied ready-formed, although at Goldcliff they were strengthened with additional wire bands. All-wire putchers were fixed to the wooden ranks by means of the two staples hammered into the wooden rails on the ranks.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

==Somerset==
Since the 18th century salmon fisheries were associated with the Clifford estate at Yearsey and Black Rock at West Stretcholt. By the mid 19th century the de Mauley family claimed three sites in the [[River Parrett]] near [[Pawlett]], [[Cannington, Somerset|Cannington]], and Black Rock where four men had 1,000 putchers, also called "butts". Between 1868 and 1873 the number of licensed butts fell from 1,360 to 450. Salmon putchers remained in the river in 1920 and were sold with the de Mauley estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=A.

==Putcher construction==

Willow was harvested using traditional methods of [[pollarding]], where a tree would be cut back to the main trunk. New shoots of willow, called "withies", would grow out of the trunk and these would be cut periodically for use.

In 1970 a few dozen of the traditional willow baskets were made and installed by the fishermen at Goldcliff. To make a putcher by hand, a low bench was used approximately {{convert|18|in|mm}} high and {{convert|24|in|mm}} square into which 9 holes were made, in a circle {{convert|10|in|mm}} in diameter. Green [[willow|withy]] or [[hazel]] rods were then split into three using an oak cleaver held in the maker’s hand.&lt;ref name="Hando"/&gt; The split lengths were then inserted into the holes to make a conical shape and a withy ring was plaited round them close to the surface of the bench. Nine shorter rods, either complete or in thirds, were then inserted into the ring, with two more rings being plaited around to secure them, one halfway up and another near the top. A nose ring was then plaited. The putcher was then pulled out of the bench, the nose ring attached and a spiral `worm' was added from the narrow end to the middle.&lt;ref name="Hando"/&gt;  A base ring was woven at the end of the basket. Any longer rods could then be trimmed and the basket was ready for use. The basket was expected to last for two fishing seasons, possibly also for a third following repair.

==Ranks==
[[File:Old putcher rank on Portland Grounds - geograph.org.uk - 936832.jpg|thumb|The remains of an old putcher rank, where baskets were placed to allow fish to swim in at high tide and for the fishermen to retrieve them at low tide; at [[Whitson]] near [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Wales]]]]
A strong timber frame or "rank" was required to hold the rows of putchers, built across the main tidal flow of the river. The fish, with fins trapped by the weave and unable to easily swim backwards, were then trapped in the conical baskets. The very high difference between high and low tide in the Severn Estuary enabled the ranks to be long and thus economically productive. Goldcliff originally had three ranks – the "Flood", the "Ebb" and the "Putt", able to carry a total of 2,327 baskets.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; A number of smaller baskets were especially constructed to fill any smaller spaces in the rank. Although there was no great advantage to be had from trapping smaller fish, the lack of any holes in the rank presented a more complete "wall of traps" through which it was more difficult for any fish to pass. The single putcher rank at Porton could carry some 600 baskets. Although the fishermen’s intimate knowledge of the seasonal height of the tides meant wasted that un-submerged baskets were not set, once fixed the baskets were typically removed only if the fish could not be released, or to allow repairs. 

The uprights of the ranks were generally made of green [[larch]] or green [[elm]], some {{convert|15|ft|m}} long and from 8 to {{convert|9|in|mm}} in diameter and sunk into the foreshore by between 6 and {{convert|8|ft|m}}. Green timber was preferred as the salt seawater would preserve it and allow use for perhaps up to ten years. Elm tended to be more durable then larch, although all would eventually start to rot from the top and would need to be replaced. Some poles at Goldcliff, probably those at the seaward ends of the ranks, were reported to have lasted for forty years. The post holes were bored using a rock [[auger (drill)|auger]] and bar, with the debris removed using a long-handle implement called a "spoon". The uprights were then beaten into the ground, in pairs, five feet apart, using an iron lined [[taxus|yew]] beetle.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

Between each pair of upstream and downstream uprights a space of six feet was left for laying the baskets, with each pair braced with diagonals and transverse beams top and bottom. To the outside of this structure horizontal rails were then nailed, the first some {{convert|18|in|mm}} from the ground, and then at regular two foot intervals above  Two or three narrow gaps were left in the lower rails to allow access. Rows of baskets were then stapled to the rails, at a downward angle of about 20 degrees. All the baskets in a rank would point the same way, with the open end set either against the incoming or outgoing tide. Added strength was given to some ranks by using angled props against the front post of every fourth pair.

==Fishing practices==
[[File:Fishing at the falls - Julien Harneis - February 28, 2007 - 1.jpg|thumb|Conical baskets on a wooden frame are also used elsewhere; here, [[Wagenya]], to catch the fish thrown downstream by rapids at the [[Boyoma Falls]] (aka: ''Stanley'' or ''Kisangani falls'') on the [[Lualaba River]], near [[Kisangani]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. As in the UK, fishing spots are inherited.]]
For reasons of religious observance, until the early years of the nineteenth century, the putchers' open ends had to be closed at least between noon on Saturday until 6 am the following Monday. The practice suggested strongly the origins of the fishery with the [[Benedictine]] Priory at Goldcliff.

On normal fishing days, as soon as the tide had exposed the baskets, they needed to be inspected by the fisherman who used a pronged staff to push any trapped fish back towards the basket entrance. Returning along the other side of the rank, the fish were then collected in a sack. At Goldcliff a bicycle, with trays front and back, was used to make collection easier. Running repairs could also be carried out at the same time with hammer and nails.

Fish from the ebb-ranks were by necessity fresher than those taken from the flood-ranks, since on the latter the tide had to both rise and fall before the fishermen could collect the catch.
 
Since the fisherman would need to work with the tides, inspection and collection needed to occur around the clock and thus the brick workshop was equipped with bed and cooking equipment. A fish store was also required where the freshly collected fish could be stored in tight-lidded lead-lined boxes packed with broken ice. The fish from both Goldcliff and Porton were sent to [[Billingsgate Fish Market|Billingsgate]] market in London. The Porton fishery was also equipped with a smokery at one time, using [[oak]] shavings, but this venture was apparently not long lasting.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

The "kype", a basket similar to the putcher but more elaborate, for catching [[shrimp]] and [[eel]], seems also to have been constructed for use at Goldcliff.&lt;ref name="Hando"/&gt;

'''Quasi-crystals''' are [[Supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular aggregates]] exhibiting both [[crystalline]] (solid) properties as well as amorphous, [[Liquid crystal|liquid-like]] properties.
 
[[Self-organization#Self-organization in chemistry|Self-organized]] structures termed "quasi-crystals" were originally described in 1978 by the Israeli scientist [[Valeri A. Krongauz]] of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], in the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper, ''Quasi-crystals from irradiated photochromic dyes in an applied electric field''. ''&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal|last= V. A. Krongauz|first=|author2=E. S. Goldburt |title=Quasi-crystals from irradiated photochromic dyes in an applied electric field,|journal=Nature|date=5 January 1978|volume=271|issue=5640|pages=43–45|doi=10.1038/271040b0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v271/n5640/abs/271043a0.html|accessdate=24 April 2014|bibcode = 1978Natur.271...40V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Formation of merocyanine dipoles upon irradiation.jpg|thumb|Scheme 1. Formation of merocyanine dipoles upon irradiation]]

In his 1978 paper Krongauz coined the term “Quasi-Crystals” for the new self-organized colloidal particles . The Quasi-crystals are supramolecular aggregates manifesting both crystalline properties e.g. [[Bragg scattering]], as well as amorphous, liquid-like properties i.e.  drop-like shapes, fluidity, extensibility and elasticity in electric field. The supramolecular Quasi-crystals  are produced in photochemical reaction by exposing solutions of photochromic [[spiropyran]] molecules to UV radiation. The ultraviolet light induces the conversion of the spiropyrans to [[merocyanine]] molecules that manifest [[electric dipole moment]]s. (see Scheme 1).  The quasi-crystals have external shape of submicron globules and their internal structure consists of crystals enveloped by an [[Amorphous solid|amorphous matter]](see Fig. 1). The crystals are formed by [[self-assembled]] stacks of the merocyanine molecular dipoles aligning themselves in a parallel manner, while amorphous envelopes consist of the same merocyanine dipoles aligned in an anti-parallel manner (Fig.1, Scheme2).&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=V.

Later Krongauz described unusual phase transitions of molecules composedof [[mesogen]]ic and spiropyran moieties, which he named "quasi-liquidcrystals."

[[File:Caspian Sea from orbit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eutrophication]], which is often caused by overabundance of reactive nitrogen, is apparent as increased [[turbidity]] in the northern part of the [[Caspian Sea]], imaged from orbit.]]
'''Reactive nitrogen''' ("Nr") is a term used for a variety of [[nitrogen compounds]] that support growth directly or indirectly.  Representative species include the gases [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), as well as the anion [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Most of these species are the result of [[intensive farming]], especially the (mis)use of fertilizers.  Although required for life, nitrogen is stored in the biosphere in an unreactive ("unfixed") form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which supports on a few life forms.  Reactive nitrogen is however "fixed" and is readily converted into protein, which supports life, leading to depletion of oxygen in fresh waters by [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sutton | first1 = Mark A. | last2 = Bleeker | first2 = Albert | year = 2013 | title = Environmental science: The shape of nitrogen to come | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438| pages = 435–437 | doi = 10.1038/nature11954 | pmid=23426258| bibcode = 2013Natur.494..435S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactive nitrogen compounds==
In the environmental context, reactive nitrogen compounds include the following classes:
*oxide gases: [[nitric oxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[nitrous oxide]].  Containing oxidized nitrogen, mainly the result of industrial processes and [[internal combustion engine]]s.
*anions: [[nitrate]], [[nitrite]].  Nitrate is a common component of fertilizers, e.g. [[ammonium nitrate]]. 
*amine derivatives: [[ammonia]] and [[ammonium]] salts, [[urea]].  Containing reduced nitrogen, these compounds are components of fertilizers.
All of these compounds enter into the [[nitrogen cycle]].

As a consequence, an excess of Nr can affect the environment relatively quickly. This also means that nitrogen-related problems need to be looked at in an integrated manner.&lt;ref&gt;http://international.vrom.nl/pagina.html?id=37594 {{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robot economics''' is the study of the market for [[robot]]s. Robot markets function through the interaction of robot makers and robot users. As (in part) a factor of production, robots are complements and/or substitutes for other factors, such as labor and (non-robot) capital goods. Another part of robot economics considers the effects of the introduction of robots on the markets for those other factors and on the products that robots help produce.

Robots are spreading throughout the economy, in fields such as agriculture, medicine and retail.

== Markets ==

=== Agriculture ===

The use of robots in agriculture began with automated milking systems.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Behavioral Foundations of the Law of Supply and Demand: Human Convergence and Robot Randomness|journal = Experimental Economics|date = 2002-12-01|issn = 1386-4157|pages = 179–208|volume = 5|issue = 3|doi = 10.1023/A:1020871917917|first = Paul J.|last = Brewer|first2 = Maria|last2 = Huang|first3 = Brad|last3 = Nelson|first4 = Charles R.|last4 = Plott}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, agricultural robots have begun to be used in harvesting, pruning, seeding, spraying and materials handling.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Medicine ===

Medical robots can be categorized in five segments: surgery, rehabilitation, non-invasive radiosurgery, hospital and pharmacy and others. Robot-assisted surgery can improve accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Health Economics of Bladder Cancer: An Updated Review of the Published Literature|journal = PharmacoEconomics|date = 2014-07-24|issn = 1170-7690|pages = 1093–1104|volume = 32|issue = 11|doi = 10.1007/s40273-014-0194-2|pmid = 25056838|first = Christina|last = Yeung|first2 = Tuan|last2 = Dinh|first3 = Joseph|last3 = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, medical robots can increase costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/1471-0528.12836|pmid = 24810140|title = Economic evaluation of robot-assisted hysterectomy: A cost-minimisation analysis|journal = BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|volume = 121|issue = 12|pages = 1546–53|year = 2014|last1 = Teljeur|first1 = C|last2 = O'Neill|first2 = M|last3 = Moran|first3 = PS|last4 = Harrington|first4 = P|last5 = Flattery|first5 = M|last6 = Murphy|first6 = L|last7 = Ryan|first7 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market was valued at $1,781 million in 2013. Hospital and pharmacy robots segment grew fastest.

=== Retail ===
Robots can be used in retail for helping customers find items, keep track of product inventory on shelves, and even interact with customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techemergence.com/robots-in-retail-examples/|title=Robots in Retail - Examples of Real Industry Applications -|date=2017-07-06|work=TechEmergence|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SEVEN Networks, Inc.''' is a privately funded [[United States|American]] corporation founded in 2000. It had about 265 employees in 2010.&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;{{Cite news |title= 2 Straight Out of 10 for Seven |author= Monica Alleven |date= December 14, 2010 |work= Wireless Week |url= http://www.wirelessweek.com/News/2010/12/2-Straight-Out-10-for-Seven-Business/ |accessdate= June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the company has research and development centers in [[Texas]] and [[Finland]].

SEVEN [[mobile messaging]] products are [[turnkey]] multi-device, multi-service [[computer software]] for operators and device manufacturers. The company claims its products have a desktop-like experience for core messaging applications like [[email]], [[instant messaging]]s and [[social networking]].

==History==

The company was formerly known as Leap Corporation and changed its name to SEVEN Networks, Inc. in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Company Overview of SEVEN Networks, Inc. |work= Business Week web site |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=715608 |accessdate= June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2004 the company was selected for FierceWireless' list of 15 promising and innovative wireless startups of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/special-reports/seven Fiercewireless], retrieved 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 2005, CEO [[Bill Nguyen]] had left to start another company.&lt;ref name="fast"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Bill Nguyen: The Boy in the Bubble |date= October 19, 2011 |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1784823/bill-nguyen-boy-bubble |work= Fast Company |accessdate= June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, the company announced [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] as a customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=2916 Mobileburn], retrieved 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the company expanded its products to support email services, added mobile instant messaging applications, analytics and [[social networking]].
In 2010, the company announced it was selected by [[Samsung Electronics]] to provide [[push technology]] for Samsung Social Hub, a social networking and integrated messaging  service available on several of the company’s handsets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2010/SEVENSignsGlobalAgreementwithSamsungElectronicstoPowerIntegratedMessagingandSocialNetworkingonMobileDevices.php SEVEN Press Release], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the company claimed in a press release to have more than eight million accounts  actively synchronized on mobile devices using its software.&lt;ref name="ww"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2010/SEVENReportsaFullYearofProfitabilityasCompanysUserBaseContinuestoGrowFasterthanMarket.html Seven Press Release], retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, the company announced [[Verizon Wireless]] as a customer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/press-releases/verizon-wireless-expands-push-services-using-seven-networks-technology FierceWireless], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and also announced Open Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=203580 Light Reading Mobile], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the company announced a combined email, instant messaging and social media product, Ping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://androinica.com/2012/01/seven-launches-ping-the-ultimate-free-push-based-social-messaging-app-for-android/ Androinica], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Channel==

The Open Channel software product line focuses on mobile traffic management and optimization. There are Open Channel products for wireless signaling optimization, carrier network policy enforcement, and [[mobile data offloading]].&lt;ref name="RCR Wireless"&gt;[http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20130226/networks/mwc-2013-getting-handle-network-intelligence/ RCR Wireless], retrieved 04 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Open Channel was launched in February 2011 to help carriers manage the impact of [[push technology]] for message notifications on their networks. It works by monitoring all requests for data from [[smartphone]] applications, such as [[Facebook]], [[email]], [[Twitter]], which make up to hundreds of requests per hour, with only a small fraction of them actually returning data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20110125/ENABLERAPPS/110129977/seven-networks-optimization-tool-reduces-data-traffic-improves RCR Wireless News], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform acts as a buffer in the network, determining when content for a particular app is available and then allowing the phone to get that content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connectedplanetonline.com/3g4g/news/MWC-Network-optimization-gets-specific-0131/index.html Connected Planet Online], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;   Early tests estimated [[mobile devices]] might reduce their time on a network by up to 40 percent and mobile traffic by up to 70 percent while boosting battery life by up to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2011/01/25/in-smartphones-seven-finds-a-new-heaven/ GigaOM], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Channel is transparent to connected applications and requires no changes or special integration by mobile developers. Additionally, it does not require changes to the network and can work in conjunction with new standards for fast network dormancy, smart signaling and other network optimizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intomobile.com/2011/01/28/seven-open-channel/ IntoMobile], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Open Channel received the [[GSMA]] Global Mobile Award for Best Mobile Technology Breakthrough in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmworld.com/newsroom/press-releases/2011/6034.htm GSM World], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Open Channel added offerings for policy enforcement and offloading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/seven-provide-signaling-optimization-north-american-carrier/2013-02-25 FierceBroadbandWireless], retrieved 04 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Also in early 2013, Toronto-based wireless operator Public Mobile selected Open Channel to manage network signaling and help reduce service costs stemming from non-optimized mobile applications and unnecessary data traffic that was creating excess network congestion.&lt;ref name="RCR Wireless"/&gt;

In September 2015, Open Channel was made available directly to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seven.com/2015/02/09/open-channel-for-everyone/ SEVEN Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile Messaging==

The System SEVEN software allows consumers and enterprises to access information, such as business and personal email, calendar, corporate directories, personal contacts, and documents, as well as allows users to deliver mobile data, applications, and services to a portfolio of devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seven Crunchbase], retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; SEVEN's push notification platform, System SEVEN, is deployed as a [[SaaS]]  (software-as a service) solution. SEVEN Mobile Email&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobilityarena.com/system-seven-an-efficient-push-email-solution/ Mobility Arena], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and SEVEN Mobile IM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2009/SEVENAddsIMtoItsPush-enabledMobileMessagingPortfolio.php SEVEN Press Release], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; are SEVEN's own applications built on top of its push platform and its Ping Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://androinica.com/2012/01/seven-launches-ping-the-ultimate-free-push-based-social-messaging-app-for-android/ Androinica], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; allow operators and device manufacturers to use the SEVEN push notification technology for messaging services and mobile applications. They provide mobile operators and device manufacturers with a solution for integrated messaging services.

System SEVEN mobile email is a server-assisted solution, where access to user's email account appears to originate from IP addresses hosted by SEVEN (208.87.200.0 - 208.87.207.255)&lt;ref&gt;[http://whois.arin.net/rest/net/NET-208-87-200-0-1/pft ARIN Online], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; or its customers. Although done with user's permission, email service providers may flag these as potential hacking attempts and have raised security concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ip-address-lookup-v4.com/ip/208.87.200.187 IP Address Lookup], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; most recently with Microsoft Outlook for Android and iOS&lt;ref&gt;[http://exchangeserverpro.com/outlook-for-ios-and-android/ Exchangeserverpro], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slurry wall''' is a [[civil engineering]] technique used to build [[reinforced concrete]] walls in areas of soft earth close to open water, or with a high [[groundwater]] table.&lt;ref name=GwSlurryWall1994&gt;
{{cite news| url = http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/gwprimer/slurry/slurry.html| title = Slurry Walls| publisher = [[Virginia Tech]]| year = 1994| accessdate = 2012-01-05| quote = | page = | author = Gutberle| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cee.vt.edu%2Fewr%2Fenvironmental%2Fteach%2Fgwprimer%2Fslurry%2Fslurry.html&amp;date=2012-01-05| archivedate = 2012-01-05| df = }} &lt;/ref&gt; This technique is typically used to build diaphragm (water-blocking) walls surrounding [[tunnel]]s and open cuts, and to lay [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]].

==Construction==
While a trench is excavated to create a form for a wall, it is simultaneously filled with [[slurry]] (usually a mixture of [[bentonite]] and water).  The dense but liquid slurry prevents the trench from collapsing by providing outward pressure, which balances the inward hydraulic forces and also retards water flow into the trench.

Slurry walls are typically constructed by starting with a set of guide walls, typically {{convert|1|m}} deep and {{convert|0.5|m}} thick. The guide walls are constructed on the ground surface to outline the desired slurry trench and guide the excavation machinery. Excavation is done using a special clamshell-shaped [[excavator|digger]] or a [[hydromill trench cutter]], suspended from a crane. The excavator digs down to design depth (or bedrock) for the first wall segment.  The excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed.  The trench is at all times kept filled with slurry to prevent its collapse, but the liquid filling allows the excavation machinery and excavation spoil to be moved without hindrance.

Once a particular length of trench is reached, a [[rebar|reinforcing cage]] is lowered into the slurry-filled pit and the pit is filled with [[concrete]] from the bottom up using [[tremie]] pipes. The heavier concrete displaces the bentonite slurry, which is pumped out, filtered, and stored in tanks for use in the next wall segment, or recycled. 

Slurry walls are successively extended to enclose an area, blocking water and softened earth from flowing into it.  Once the concrete has hardened, excavation within the now concrete-wall-enclosed area can proceed. To prevent the concrete wall from collapsing into the newly open area, temporary supports such as [[Tieback (geotechnical)|tieback]]s or internal crossbeams are installed. When completed, the structure built within the walled-off area supports the wall, so that tiebacks or other temporary bracing may be removed.
Stability of the trench is essential in trench cutting.
Usage of bentonite with precise density prevents collapse of trench walls

==History==
The slurry wall technique was first introduced during the excavation of [[Milan Metro Line 1|Line 1 on the underground rapid transit system]] of [[Milan, Italy]] by the company ICOS (Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate) just after the end of World War II. This new technology became an important component of the top-down tunnelling method also known as ''Metodo Milano'' ("Milan method").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Primo by Ex Libris -|url = http://www.primo.polimi.it/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=base&amp;afterPDS=true&amp;docId=|accessdate = 2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Slurry wall construction was used to construct the [[the Bathtub|"bathtub"]] that surrounded the foundations of most of the [[World Trade Center site]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Looking to a Wall That Limited the World Trade Center’s Devastation|author=  David W.

Slurry walls were also used extensively in Boston's later [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]] tunnel project.

A '''synthetic vision system''' (SVS) is a [[computer-mediated reality]] system for aerial vehicles, that uses [[3D computer graphics|3D]] to provide pilots with clear and intuitive means of understanding their flying environment. 

Synthetic vision is also a generic term, which may pertain to computer vision systems using artificial intelligence methods for visual learning, see "Synthetic Vision using Volume Learning and Visual DNA".

==Functionality==

Synthetic vision provides [[situational awareness]] to the operators by using terrain, obstacle, geo-political, hydrological and other databases. A typical SVS application uses a set of databases stored on board the aircraft, an image generator computer, and a display. Navigation solution is obtained through the use of [[GPS]] and inertial reference systems.

Highway In The Sky (HITS), or Path-In-The-Sky, is often used to depict the projected path of the aircraft in perspective view. Pilots acquire instantaneous understanding of the current as well as the future state of the aircraft with respect to the terrain, towers, buildings and other environment features.

==History==

Synthetic vision was developed by [[NASA]] and the U.S. Air Force in the late 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780002119.pdf |authors= Knox et al. |title= Description of Path-In-The-Sky Contact Analog Piloting Display |publisher= NASA |work= Technical Memorandum 74057 |date= October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980s in support of advanced cockpit research, and in 1990s as part of the [[Aviation Safety Program]]. Development of the [[High Speed Civil Transport]] fueled NASA research in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 1980s, the USAF recognized the need to improve cockpit situation awareness to support piloting ever more complex aircraft, and pursued SVS (also called pictorial format avionics) as an integrating technology for both manned and remotely piloted systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a149252.pdf |authors= Way et al. |title= Pictorial Format Display Evaluation |publisher= USAF |work= AFWAL-TR-34-3036 |date= May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulations and remotely piloted vehicles===

In 1980 the [[FS1 Flight Simulator]] by [[Bruce Artwick]] for the [[Apple II]] microcomputer introduced recreational uses of synthetic vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website= Flight Simulator History |url= http://fshistory.simflight.com/fsh/index.htm |title= Introduction |author= Jos Grupping |date= 2001}}{{self-published-inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Himatcockpit2.jpg|thumb|[[HiMAT]] Remotely Piloted Aircraft Cockpit with Synhthetic Vision Display]]

NASA used synthetic vision for [[remotely piloted vehicle]]s (RPVs), such as the High Maneuvability Aerial Testbed or [[HiMAT]].&lt;ref name=Sarrafian1984/&gt; According to the report by NASA, the aircraft was flown by a pilot in a remote cockpit, and control signals up-linked from the flight controls in the remote cockpit on the ground to the aircraft, and aircraft telemetry downlinked to the remote cockpit displays (see photo). The remote cockpit could be configured with either nose camera video or with a 3D synthetic vision display. SV was also used for simulations of the HiMAT. Sarrafian reports that the test pilots found the visual display to be comparable to output of camera on board the RPV.&lt;ref name=Sarrafian1984&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/87986main_H-1246.pdf |author= Sarrafian, S |title= Simulator Evaluation of a Remotely Piloted Vehicle Lateral Landing Task Using a Visual Display |publisher= NASA |work= Technical Memorandum 85903 |date= August 1984 |doi= 10.2514/6.1984-2095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1986 [[RC Aerochopper]] simulation by [[Ambrosia Microcomputer Products, Inc.]] used synthetic vision to aid aspiring RC aircraft pilots in learning to fly. The system included joystick flight controls which would connect to an Amiga computer and display.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, D: "RC Aerochopper Owners Manual", Ambrosia Microcomputer Products, Inc., 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The software included a three-dimensional terrain database for the ground as well as some man-made objects. This database was basic, representing the terrain with relatively small numbers of polygons by today's standards. The program simulated the dynamic three-dimensional position and attitude of the aircraft using the terrain database to create a projected 3D perspective display. The realism of this RPV pilot training display was enhanced by allowing the user to adjust the simulated control system delays and other parameters.

Similar research continued in the U.S. military services, and at Universities around the world. In 1995-1996, North Carolina State University flew a 17.5% scale F-18 RPV using [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]] to create the three-dimensional projected terrain environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110194220/http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/research/flight_research/f18/index.html |publisher= North Carolina State University |title= Flight Research (The F18 Project)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In flight ===

[[Image:NASA Synthetic Vision Display.jpg|thumb|right|width{160}px|A synthetic vision system that was tested by [[NASA]] in a [[Gulfstream V]] business jet in 2004.]]

In 2005 a synthetic vision system was installed on a Gulfstream V test aircraft as part of NASA's "Turning Goals Into Reality" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Turning Goals into Reality 2005 Award Winners|url= https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/aero/events/tgir/2005/safety.htm |work= NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the experience gained during that program led directly to the introduction of certified SVS on future aircraft. NASA initiated industry involvement in early 2000 with major avionics manufacturers. 

Eric Theunissen, a researcher at [[Delft University of Technology]] in the Netherlands, contributed to the development of SVS technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Theunissen/publication/268554590_Guidance_Situation_Awareness_and_Integrity_Monitoring_with_an_SVSEVS/links/56bc8bff08ae08d7a6bbf3e9/Guidance-Situation-Awareness-and-Integrity-Monitoring-with-an-SVS-EVS.pdf |authors= Theunissen et al. |title= Guidance, Situation Awareness and Integrity Monitoring with an SVS+EVS |work= AIAA GNC Conference Proceedings |date= August 2005 |doi= 10.2514/6.2005-6441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2007 and early 2008, the FAA certified the Gulfstream Synthetic Vision-[[Primary flight display]] (SV-PFD) system for the [[Gulfstream IV|G350/G450]] and [[Gulfstream G550|G500/G550]] business jet aircraft, displaying 3D color terrain images from the [[Honeywell]] [[Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System|EGPWS]] data overlaid with the PFD symbology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.gulfstreamnews.com/news/gulfstream-scores-double-first-as-federal-aviation-administration-certifies-evs-ii-and-synthetic-vision-primary-flight-display |date= January 28, 2008 |publisher= Gulfstream |title= Gulfstream scores double first as federal aviation administration certifies EVS II and synthetic vision primary flight display}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It replaces the traditional blue-over-brown [[artificial horizon]].

In 2017, [[Avidyne Corporation]] certified Synthetic Vision capability for its [[air navigation]] avionics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://generalaviationnews.com/2017/03/13/avidyne-certifies-synthetic-vision-for-fms-line/ |title= Avidyne certifies synthetic vision for FMS line |date= 2017-03-13 |work= General Aviation News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other [[glass cockpit]] systems such as the [[Garmin G1000]] and the [[Rockwell Collins]] Pro Line Fusion offer synthetic terrain.

Lower-cost, non-certified avionics offer synthetic vision like apps available for Android or iPad [[tablet computer]]s from ForeFlight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.foreflight.com/products/foreflight-mobile/synthetic-vision/ |title= Global synthetic vision |publisher= ForeFlight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garmin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://newsroom.garmin.com/press-release/aviation/garmin-pilot-app-adds-3-d-synthetic-vision-capability |title= Garmin Pilot App Adds 3-D Synthetic Vision Capability |date= February 20, 2014 |publisher= Garmin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hilton Software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hiltonsoftware.co |title= Hilton Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often '''task lighting''' refers to increasing [[illuminance]] to better accomplish a specific activity. However, the illuminance level is not the only factor governing visibility. [[Contrast (vision)|Contrast]] is also important, and a poorly positioned light source may cause contrast reduction, resulting in loss of visibility. The most important purpose of task lighting in the office is not increasing illuminance, but improving contrast. General lighting can be reduced because task lighting provides focused light where needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|title=Energy Efficiency in the Federal Government: Government by Good Example?|date=May 1991|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=48|url=http://ota.fas.org/reports/9117.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different strategies for task lighting exist. The three main approaches are:
* Localized average lighting, where a lamp supplies both ambient light and task light
* Freely adjustable task light such as a [[gooseneck]], [[balanced-arm lamp]], or swing-arm light. 
* Asymmetric task light, where the lamp is placed at the side of the work area
There are also other approaches to task lighting, for example under-shelf [[luminaire]]s. 

Other instances of task lighting are in machinery, where a specific work area needs illumination, and in workshops, where a task light may illuminate the actual working area. Special instances of task lighting are examination and operation lights for [[medicine]] and [[surgery]], as well as the [[dentist]]'s lamp. Task lamps are also used for many home tasks such as sewing, reading, small repairs, model construction, crafts, writing, and many other activities. The actual task may range from very small up to about as far as you may reach with your hands or available tools. Lighting of larger areas is beyond the scope of task lighting.

== Task lighting ==

=== Localized average lighting ===
Localized lighting consists of a luminaire that provides ambient light as well as task light. Often it is an uplighter with a light source that is directed downward. It is intended to be mounted immediately over the workplace,
lusu

=== Fixed task lighting ===
Fixed task lighting refers to a non-movable light source dedicated to lighting a specific task. In kitchens, a homeowner may install several [[Recessed light|recessed "can" lights]] or under cabinet lighting to provide clear lighting onto the counters for cutting and preparing food. Having proper lighting when working with sharp knives is a critical component of injury prevention. Another form of fixed task lighting may simply be a table lamp positioned over one's reading chair.

=== Freely adjustable task lights ===
The main feature of the freely adjustable task light is evident; one may adjust it freely at any whim or to suit one's needs. The lamp presents few limits to how one may position or orient the light. A freely adjustable lamp may include means for glare control, as a honeycomb or parabolic louvre that restricts the light output angle. 

A common form of home task lighting is a goose-neck lamp or swing arm light fixture. The adjustable neck allows light to be focused on the exact task needed, and the swing-arm wall sconces can be positioned next to a bed or chair, and adjusted to shine light on a printed page. Free standing, adjustable desk lamps are commonly used in home office applications.

=== Magnifying Task Lights ===
Some task lights also come with built in magnifying glasses for detailed tasks. It is hard to overstate the benefits of having focused light alongside magnification for small, precise operations such as model building, sewing, or other high-detail activities. Dentists often use a task light with magnification to perform dental cleanings.

=== Asymmetric task lighting ===
The asymmetric task light is intended to be placed at the side of the actual task. The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1½' to the side of the lamp head. It mostly has an arm system that holds the lamp head horizontally irrespective of the arm movement - a ''parallel arm''. Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than other lamps. In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control ([http://web.comhem.se/~u77479609/better_lamp.html#properly_glare_protected ref:1]).

== Home task lighting==
Task lighting can also be applied to home uses. Many people benefit from dedicated lighting for specific tasks such as [[cooking]], [[sewing]], [[reading (process)|reading]], or paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Types of Lighting|url=https://www.americanlightingassoc.com/Lighting-Fundamentals/3-Types-of-Lighting.aspx|website=American Lighting Association|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home task lighting can be found in fixed or adjustable forms.

== Contrast reduction ==
Contrast reduction in the office workplace refers to reading objects having decreased contrast compared to an estimated ideal contrast. If a lamp is placed so that printed letters reflect some of the light, their contrast against the paper background will decrease. This happens when a light source is reflected as in a mirror from the print into the eyes of the observer. A poorly placed lamp may render text illegible, regardless of illuminance level. For older persons, increased lighting and contrast is a necessary aid to performing daily tasks such as paying bills or reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Lighting|url=http://www.amd.org/better-lighting-for-macular-degeneration/|website=AMD.org|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transistor]]s are simple devices with complicated behavior. In order to ensure the reliable operation of circuits employing transistors, it is necessary to [[Scientific modelling|scientifically model]] the physical phenomena observed in their operation using '''transistor models'''. There exists a variety of different [[Model (abstract)|models]] that range in complexity and in purpose. Transistor models divide into two major groups: models for device design and models for circuit design.

==Models for device design==
The modern transistor has an internal structure that exploits complex physical mechanisms. Device design requires a detailed understanding of how device manufacturing processes such as [[ion implantation]], [[Atomic diffusion|impurity diffusion]], [[Thermal oxidation|oxide growth]], [[Annealing (metallurgy)#Diffusion annealing of semiconductors|annealing]], and [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]] affect device behavior. [[Semiconductor process simulation|Process models]]  simulate the manufacturing steps and provide a microscopic description of device "geometry" to the [[Semiconductor device modeling|device simulator]]. "Geometry" does not mean readily identified geometrical features such as a planar or wrap-around gate structure, or raised or recessed forms of source and drain (see Figure 1 for a [[NVRAM#The floating-gate transistor|memory device]] with some unusual modeling challenges related to charging the floating gate by an avalanche process). It also refers to details inside the structure, such as the doping profiles after completion of device processing.
[[File:FAMOS esq.png|thumbnail|Figure 1: Floating-gate avalanche injection memory device FAMOS]]
With this information about what the device looks like, the device simulator models the physical processes taking place in the device to determine its electrical behavior in a variety of circumstances: DC current-voltage behavior, transient behavior (both large-signal and small-signal), dependence on device layout (long and narrow versus short and wide, or interdigitated versus rectangular, or isolated versus proximate to other devices). These simulations tell the device designer whether the device process will produce devices with the electrical behavior needed by the circuit designer, and is used to inform the process designer about any necessary process improvements. Once the process gets close to manufacture, the predicted device characteristics are compared with measurement on test devices to check that the process and device models are working adequately.

Although long ago the device behavior modeled in this way was very simple{{snd}} mainly drift plus diffusion in simple geometries{{snd}} today many more processes must be modeled at a microscopic level; for example, leakage currents in junctions and oxides, complex transport of carriers including [[velocity saturation]] and ballistic transport, quantum mechanical effects, use of multiple materials (for example, [[SiGe#SiGe Transistors|Si-SiGe]] devices, and stacks of different [[high-κ_dielectric|dielectrics]]) and even the statistical effects due to the probabilistic nature of ion placement and carrier transport inside the device. Several times a year the technology changes and simulations have to be repeated. The models may require change to reflect new physical effects, or to provide greater accuracy. The maintenance and improvement of these models is a business in itself.

These models are very computer intensive, involving detailed spatial and temporal solutions of coupled partial differential equations on three-dimensional grids inside the device.&lt;ref name=Jacoboni&gt;

Such models are slow to run and provide detail not needed for circuit design. Therefore, faster transistor models oriented toward circuit parameters are used for circuit design.

==Models for circuit design==
Transistor models are used for almost all modern [[electronic design]] work. [[Analog circuit]] [[Electronic circuit simulation|simulators]] such as [[SPICE]] use models to predict the behavior of a design. Most design work is related to [[integrated circuit design]]s which have a very large tooling cost, primarily for the [[photomask]]s used to create the devices, and there is a large economic incentive to get the design working without any iterations. Complete and accurate models allow a large percentage of designs to work the first time.

Modern circuits are usually very complex. The performance of such circuits is difficult to predict without accurate computer models, including but not limited to models of the devices used. The device models include effects of transistor layout: width, length, interdigitation, proximity to other devices; transient and DC [[current-voltage characteristic]]s; parasitic device capacitance, resistance, and inductance; time delays; and temperature effects; to name a few items.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;

====Physical models==== 
: These are [[Semiconductor device modeling|models based upon  device physics]], based upon approximate modeling of physical phenomena within a transistor.  Parameters within these models are based upon physical properties such as oxide thicknesses, substrate doping concentrations, carrier mobility, etc. In the past these models were used extensively, but the complexity of modern devices makes them inadequate for quantitative design. Nonetheless, they find a place in hand analysis (that is, at the conceptual stage of circuit design), for example, for simplified estimates of signal-swing limitations.

====Empirical models==== 
: This type of model is entirely based upon [[curve fitting]], using whatever functions and parameter values most adequately fit measured data to enable simulation of transistor operation.  Unlike a physical model, the parameters in an empirical model need have no fundamental basis, and will depend on the fitting procedure used to find them. The fitting procedure is key to success of these models if they are to be used to extrapolate to designs lying outside the range of data to which the models were originally fitted. Such extrapolation is a hope of such models, but is not fully realized so far.

===Small-signal linear models===  
[[Small-signal model|Small-signal]] or [[Linear system|linear]] models are used to evaluate [[BIBO stability|stability]], [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[Electronic noise|noise]] and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], both in the conceptual stages of circuit design (to decide between alternative design ideas before computer simulation is warranted) and using computers.  A small-signal model is generated by taking derivatives of the current-voltage curves about a bias point or [[Q-point]].  As long as the signal is small relative to the nonlinearity of the device, the derivatives do not vary significantly, and can be treated as standard linear circuit elements. 
A big advantage of small signal models is they can be solved directly, while large signal nonlinear models are generally solved iteratively, with possible [[Numerical ordinary differential equations#Analysis|convergence or stability]] issues.  By simplification to a linear model, the whole apparatus for solving linear equations becomes available, for example, [[simultaneous equations]], [[determinant]]s, and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]] (often studied as part of [[linear algebra]]), especially [[Cramer's rule]]. Another advantage is that a linear model is easier to think about, and helps to organize thought.

====Small-signal parameters====
A transistor’s parameters represent its electrical properties.  Engineers employ transistor parameters in production-line testing and in circuit design.  A group of a transistor’s parameters sufficient to predict circuit [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] are components in its [[small-signal model]].

A number of different [[two-port network]] parameter sets may be used to model a transistor.  These include:

* [[Two-port network#ABCD-parameters|Transmission parameters]] (T-parameters),
* [[Bipolar junction transistor#h-parameter model|Hybrid-parameters]] (h-parameters),
* [[z-parameters|Impedance parameters]] (z-parameters),
* [[y-parameters|Admittance parameters]] (y-parameters), and
* [[S-parameters|Scattering parameters]] (S-parameters).

Scattering parameters, or S parameters, can be measured for a transistor at a given bias point with a [[Network analyzer (electrical)#S-parameter measurement with vector network analyzer|vector network analyzer]].  S parameters can be [[Two-port network#Interrelation of parameters|converted to another parameter set]] using standard [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]] operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Virtual reality sex''' (in short: VR sex) is a technology that allows the user to receive tactile sensations from remote participants, or fictional characters through the use of computer-controlled [[sex toys]]. Usually the user also wears a [[virtual reality headset]] so he/she can see and interact with the partner.

==Examples==

===BKK Cybersex Cup===
The BKK Cybersex Cup consists of a [[virtual reality headset]] and masturbation cup. It also comes with a mobile app which allows the users to customize their own 3D girlfriend based on their preferred body, skin tone, hairstyle and outfit. The masturbation cup has a built in motion sensor which is capable of simulating the movement and transmission of the action via Bluetooth to any smartphone that runs the 3D girlfriend app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ean-online.com/company-news/crowdfunging-campaign-for-bkk-cybersex-cup/ |title=Crowdfunding Campaign for BKK Cybersex Cup – EAN Online Erotic Industry News |publisher=Ean-online.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Mandy Stadtmiller2015-05-30 03:04:23 UTC |url=http://mashable.com/2015/05/29/virtual-reality-sex/#tG.aEr8Wkkqn |title=Virtual reality sex is coming — and the toys are already here |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/for-science-i-tested-one-of-the-worlds-first-virtual-reality-sex-toys |title=For Science, I Tested the Latest Virtual Reality Sex Toy |publisher=VICE |date=2015-11-27 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VirtuaDolls===
The American company Eos created the VirtuaDolls which consists a silicone sheath into which a man inserts his [[penis]]. In concert with a mechanized gripper for “intelligent stroke movement,” this allows for the VirtuaDolls controller to sync up the sensation to the action. For immersive experience, it also comes with six interchangeable sleeves with different textures to allow for varying sensations and contains a pressure sensor that determines the occupant’s position within the sheath. An optional vacuum attachment adds suction capabilities and an easy-clean system. The VirtuaDolls controller is also bundled with a video game titled ''Girls of Arcadia'' in which users carry out missions to rescue girls and are rewarded by the end of the missions in having sex with them. In January 2016, the company launched an [[Indiegogo]] campaign to raise funds for the product, but after being swamped with orders, the creators suspended the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jasper Hamill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/virtual-reality-male-sex-toy-7299079 |title=Makers of 'mindblowing' sex robot with virtual vagina swamped with orders - Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulton |first=Will |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/virtuadolls-indiegogo/ |title=Why VirtuaDolls VR Porn Controller Suspended Its Indiegogo |publisher=Digital Trends |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, it was relaunched on Indiegogo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris |first=Tatiana |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/the-adult-vr-game-controller-virtuadolls-is-back-on-indiegogo-3433313 |title=The adult VR game controller 'VirtuaDolls' is back on IndieGoGo |publisher=Gamezone.com |date=2016-02-05 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Fireworks Championship''' was held in [[Oman]] in 2010 over three successive weekends and featured six firework companies. A reported 750,000 spectators attended the competition which ultimately was won by French company Lacroix Ruggieri.

The Oman World Fireworks Championship 2010 was part of the 40th [[National Day]] Celebrations of the Sultanate of Oman. The competition was held at [[Al Qurum Natural Park]], located in the city of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. Each pyromusical display was broadcast live over radio.

'''XADO Snipex''' is a line of large-caliber sniper rifles manufactured by [[XADO]] company ([[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]).

XADO company has been designing and manufacturing [[weapons]] since 2014. The prototype of the first Ukrainian rifle for long-range target shooting Snipex Rhino Hunter [[.50 BMG]] was officially presented at an exhibition in 2016. In 2017, the models Snipex M75 12.7x108 and Snipex 14.5x114 were displayed to the public. In 2018, the manufacturer presented the flagship model of the Snipex series — [[12.7×108mm|12.7×108]] caliber single-shot rifle Snipex M100 with automatic case ejection.

== Snipex M ==

'''Snipex M''' — [[single-shot]] rifles with automatic case ejection. Caliber: .50 BMG (12.7x99) or 12.7×108. Barrel length: 750; 850; 1,000; 1,100; 1,200&amp;nbsp;mm.

=== Construction ===
The weapon has the [[bullpup]] design, where the bolt carrier group is located behind the trigger. The rifle has short recoil. The inertia system provides operation of the automatics. Barrel locking is achieved through a rotating bolt.

Low-level recoil when shooting. Recoil reduction is achieved due to the originally designed inertia recoil system, which includes moving spring-loaded assemblies, and two hydraulic shock absorbers located horizontally on both sides of the barrel, on the same level as the upper receiver. Barrel locking is achieved through a rotating bolt.

The rifle is designed for shooting resting and, to that end, is fitted with collapsible bipods and an additional rear support under the buttstock. The rifle is elevated on the bipods (barrel axis is located below mounting points of the bipods). A specially designed additional support provides the possibility of rough and precise adjustment.

The rifle is equipped with a special grip safety, which is located directly above the pistol grip on both sides of the weapon.
Own-produced barrel. As the manufacturer claims, barrel quality provides shooting accuracy of at least 0.5 MOA. Barrel operation life is stated to amount to 5,000 shots. The rifle is equipped with two [[Picatinny rail]]s. The top rail with a 35 MOA gradient is located along the entire upper receiver length.

The most critical parts of the rifle are chrome-plated to ensure the maximum service life and reliability.

Extra durable Cerakote coating is applied to the rifle.
