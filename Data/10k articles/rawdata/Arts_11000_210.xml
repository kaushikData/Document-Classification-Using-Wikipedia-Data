'''Adelaide Anne Procter''' (30 October 1825&amp;nbsp;– 2 February 1864) was an English poet and [[philanthropist]]. She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless, and was actively involved with [[feminist]] groups and journals. Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 38.

Procter's literary career began when she was a teenager; her poems were primarily published in [[Charles Dickens]]'s periodicals ''[[Household Words]]'' and ''[[All the Year Round]]'' and later  published in book form. Her charity work and her conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]] appear to have strongly influenced her poetry, which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness, poverty, and [[fallen woman|fallen women]].

Procter was the favourite poet of [[Queen Victoria]]. Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century; [[Coventry Patmore]] called her the most popular poet of the day, after [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how [[Women in the Victorian era|Victorian women]] expressed otherwise repressed feelings.

==Life==
Adelaide Anne Procter was born at 25 [[Bedford Square]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet [[Bryan Procter|Bryan Waller Procter]] and his wife Anne (''née'' Skepper).&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Gregory (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The family had strong literary ties: novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] enjoyed her visits to the Procter household,&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 5"&gt;Gregory (1998), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and Procter's father was friends with poet [[Leigh Hunt]], essayist [[Charles Lamb]], and novelist [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref name="O'Gorman"&gt;O'Gorman (2004), 314.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being acquainted with poet [[William Wordsworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2004), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and critic [[William Hazlitt]].&lt;ref name=H&amp;W1&gt;Hickok and Woodall (1998), 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Family friend [[Bessie Rayner Parkes|Bessie Rayner Belloc]] wrote in 1895 that "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of the house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens {{sic}}, the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1999), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and actress [[Fanny Kemble]] wrote that young Procter "looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... [with] a preter-naturally {{sic}} thoughtful, mournful expression for such a little child".&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 5" /&gt;

Dickens spoke highly of Procter's quick intelligence. By his account, the young Procter mastered without difficulty the subjects to which she turned her attention:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When she was quite a young child, she learnt with facility several of the problems of [[Euclid]]. As she grew older, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages ... piano-forte ... [and] drawing. But, as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study, it was her way to lose interest in it, and pass to another.&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3"&gt;Dickens (1866), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A voracious reader,&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; Procter was largely self-taught, though she studied at [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] in Harley Street in 1850.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; The college had been founded in 1848 by [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], a [[Christian Socialist]]; the faculty included novelist [[Charles Kingsley]], composer [[John Hullah]], and writer [[Henry Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victoria regia, poetry and prose (1861).djvu|left|thumb|upright|alt= Book cover showing a large, deep blue volume. The words "Victoria Regia" are prominent in the center, in a large, heavy, old-fashioned font, with gold embossed lettering. The title is surrounded by gold-embossed scrolls.|The 1861 edition of the ''Victoria Regia'', edited by Procter]]
Procter showed a love of poetry from an early age, carrying with her while still a young child a "tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll".&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, "Ministering Angels", appeared in ''Heath's Book of Beauty'' in 1843.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's ''[[Household Words]]'' under the name "Mary Berwick", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens did not learn "Berwick's" identity till the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's publication began Procter's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in ''Household Words'' and 7 poems in ''[[All the Year Round]]'',&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled ''Legends and Lyrics''. She was also published in ''Good Words'' and ''Cornhill.''&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal ''Victoria Regia'', which became the showpiece of the [[Victoria Press]], "an explicitly feminist publishing venture".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Rayner Parkes Belloc gives the date as 1849; Dickens as 1851 in his "Introduction" to the 1866 edition of ''Legends and Lyrics''. The introduction was read and approved by Procter's mother; Gill Gregory therefore argues that Dickens's date is the correct one (Gregory [1998], 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Procter converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Following her conversion, Procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes. She became a member of the [[History of feminism#The ladies of Langham Place|Langham Place Group]], which set out to improve conditions for women, and was friends with [[feminist]]s [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] (later Bessie Rayner Belloc) and [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]], later Barbara Bodichon.&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Procter helped found the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'' in 1858 and, in 1859, the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women,&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; both of which focused on expanding women's economic and employment opportunities. Though on paper Procter was merely one member among many, fellow-member [[Jessie Boucherett]] considered her to be the "animating spirit" of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her third volume of poetry, ''A Chaplet of Verses'' (1861), was published for the benefit of a Catholic Night Refuge for Women and Children that had been founded  in 1860 at Providence Row in [[East End of London|East London]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter became engaged in 1858, according to a letter that her friend [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote to his daughters that year. The identity of Procter's fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her German biographer Ferdinand Janku, the engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by Procter's fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Gill Gregory suggests that Procter may have been a [[lesbian]] and in love with [[Matilda Hays]], a fellow member of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women;&lt;ref name="Gregory25"&gt;Gregory (1998), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; other critics have called Procter's relationship with Hays "emotionally intense."&lt;ref name=H123&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter's first volume of poetry, ''Legends and Lyrics'' (1858) was dedicated to Hays and that same year Procter wrote a poem titled "To M.M.H."&lt;ref&gt;Later published in ''Legends and Lyrics'' as "A Retrospect".&lt;/ref&gt; in which Procter "expresses love for Hays ... [Hays was a] novelist and translator of [[George Sand]] and a controversial figure ... [who] dressed in men's clothes and had lived with the sculptor [[Harriet Hosmer]] in Rome earlier in the 1850s."&lt;ref name="Gregory25" /&gt; While several men showed interest in her, Procter never married.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter fell ill in 1862; Dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work, which "appears to have unduly taxed her strength".&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 9; Lennox (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to improve her health by taking a [[Water cure (therapy)|cure]] at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] failed.&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt; On 3 February 1864, Procter died of [[tuberculosis]], having been bed-ridden for almost a year.&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 1"&gt;Gregory (1998), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was described in the press as a "national calamity".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gray (1999), 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt;

==Literary career==
Procter's poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work; homelessness, poverty, and [[fallen women]] are frequent themes. Procter's prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress the misery of the conditions under which the poor lived, as do poems such as "The Homeless Poor":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that very street, at that same hour,&lt;br /&gt;
In the bitter air and drifting sleet,&lt;br /&gt;
Crouching in a doorway was a mother,&lt;br /&gt;
With her children shuddering at her feet.

She was silent&amp;nbsp;– who would hear her pleading?&lt;br /&gt;
Men and beasts were housed&amp;nbsp;– but she must stay&lt;br /&gt;
Houseless in the great and pitiless city,&lt;br /&gt;
Till the dawning of the winter day. (51–58)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Procter's Catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols;&lt;ref name=H127&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter often uses references to the Virgin Mary, for example, to "introduce secular and Protestant readers to the possibility that a heavenly order critiques Victorian gender ideology's power structure."&lt;ref name=H127 /&gt;

Procter wrote several poems about war (the majority of poems published on this topic in ''Household Words'' were by Procter&lt;ref&gt;Markovits (2005), 472.&lt;/ref&gt;), although she rarely deals directly with the topic, preferring to leave war "in the background, something to be inferred rather than stated."&lt;ref name=M473&gt;Markovits (2005), 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these poems portray conflict as something "that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions."&lt;ref name=M473 /&gt;

According to critic Gill Gregory, Procter "does not overtly ponder the vexed question of the poet, particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame",&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; unlike many other women poets of the time, such as [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]. Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes, particularly working-class women, and with "emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality,&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2006), 82, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Francis O'Gorman, does so with "peculiar strength"; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification, holding "emotional energy [in tension] ... against complications and nuances."&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Procter's language is simple; she expressed to a friend a "morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and her poetry is marked by "simplicity, directness, and clarity of expression".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter was "fabulously popular"&lt;ref name="Gray682"&gt;Gray (1999), 682.&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-19th century; she was [[Queen Victoria]]'s favourite poet&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 1" /&gt; and [[Coventry Patmore]] stated that the demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet, excepting [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Readers valued Procter's poems for their plainness of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Belloc (1895), 173.&lt;/ref&gt; although they were considered "not so very original in thought; [their merit is that] they are indeed the utterances 'of a believing heart', pouring out its fulness."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1868), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter herself expressed little ambition about her work: her friend Bessie Raynor Belloc thought that Procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father's, and quoted Procter as saying that "Papa is a poet. I only write verses."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc (1895), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter's popularity continued after her death; the first volume of ''Legends and Lyrics'' went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year.&lt;ref name="Gray682" /&gt; Many of her poems were made into hymns&lt;ref name="Lennox"&gt;Lennox (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise set to music.  Among these was "[[The Lost Chord]]", which [[Arthur Sullivan]] set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them "stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Poetry'', 1938, quoted in Psomiades (2000), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a "model middle-class domestic angel"&lt;ref name=H125&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "fragile and modest saint"&lt;ref name=H&amp;W520&gt;Hickok and Woodall (1998), 520.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than as an "active feminist and strong poet."&lt;ref name=H&amp;W520 /&gt; Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter "extinguished modern interest" in her, it also "has helped rescue Procter from the kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon|Letitia Landon]]."&lt;ref name=Mason81&gt;Mason (2006), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern critics have given Procter's work little attention. The few critics who have examined Procter's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to [[Isobel Armstrong]], Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong (1996), 251, 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis O'Gorman cites "A Legend of Provence" as an example of a poem with this kind of "double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm."&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman (2004), 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 130; Mason (2006), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful,&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2004), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1996), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender, arguing that the "range and formal inventiveness of this illuminatingly representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored."&lt;ref name="Gray682" /&gt;

'''Alexandre Cabanel''' ({{IPA-fr|kabanɛl|lang}}; 28 September 1823, Montpellier – 23 January 1889) was a [[France|French]] [[Painting|painter]]. He painted historical, classical and religious subjects in the academic style. He was also well known as a portrait painter. According to ''Diccionario Enciclopedico Salvat'', Cabanel is the best representative of the [[L'art pompier]] and [[Napoleon III]]'s preferred painter.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Enciclopedico Salvat, 1982, Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Cabanel entered the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts in Paris]] at the age of seventeen,
and  studied with [[François-Édouard Picot]]. He exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] for the first time in 1844, and won the [[Prix de Rome]] scholarship in 1845 at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Facos|first=Michelle|authorlink=Michelle Facos|title=An Introduction to Nineteenth Century Art|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabanel was elected a member of the Institute in 1863. He was appointed professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1864 and taught there until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Hook|first=Bailey|title=Angels of Art: Women and Art in American Society, 1876-1914|year=1996|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was closely connected to the Paris Salon:  "He was elected regularly to the Salon jury and his pupils could be counted by the hundred at the Salons. Through them, Cabanel did more than any other artist of his generation to form the character of ''belle époque'' French painting".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Art'' (1996) vol. 5, pp. 341–344&lt;/ref&gt; His refusal together with [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] to allow the [[impressionism|impressionist]] painter [[Édouard Manet]] and many other painters to exhibit their work in the Salon of 1863 led to the establishment of the [[Salon des Refusés]] by the French government. Cabanel won the Grande Médaille d'Honneur at the Salons of 1865, 1867, and 1878.

A successful [[Academic art|academic]] painter, his 1863 painting ''[[The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)|The Birth of Venus]]'' is one of the best known examples of 19th-century academic painting. The picture was bought by the emperor [[Napoleon III]]; there is also a smaller replica (painted in 1875 for a banker, John Wolf) at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. It was given to them by Wolf in 1893.

'''Alice Guy-Blaché''' (July 1, 1873 – March 24, 1968) was a pioneer filmmaker, active from the late 19th century, and one of the first to make a narrative fiction film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Guy-Blaché|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alice-guy-blach%C3%A9-37846#death-and-legacy|website=Biography.com|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1906 she was probably the only female filmmaker in the world. &lt;ref&gt;https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-alice-guy-blache/ accessdate=25 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; She experimented with Gaumont's [[Chronophone]] sound syncing system, color tinting, interracial casting, and special effects. She was a founder and artistic director of the [[Solax Studios]] in Flushing, New York, in 1908. In 1912 Solax invested $100,000 for a new studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, the center of American filmmaking prior to the establishment of Hollywood. That same year she made the film ''[[A Fool and His Money (1912 film)|A Fool and His Money]]'', with a cast of only [[African-American]] actors. The film is now at the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the [[American Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://afifest.afi.com/2002/sections/a-fool-and-his-money access date+ 25 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
In 1865,&lt;ref&gt;Archives de Paris, Marriages, 18 Juilliet 1865, Clichy Hauts de Seine, 4 E/CLI_66.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice's father, Emile Guy, an owner of a bookstore and publishing company in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]], married Marie Clotilde Franceline Aubert. The couple returned to Santiago after the wedding in Paris. In early 1873, Marie and Emile lived in Santiago, with Alice's four siblings.

There was a devastating smallpox epidemic in Chile in 1872 and 1873.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, South America, Terrible Ravages of Small-Pox on the West Coast, September 26, 1872. British Medical Journal, vol. 1, 1875&lt;/ref&gt; Emile and Marie Guy brought all four of their children back to Paris where Alice was born. In her autobiography, Alice refers to her mother's attempt to make sure "one of her children should be French". Her father returned to Chile soon after her birth, and her mother followed a few months later. Alice was entrusted to her grandmother in [[Carouge, Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Aubert, her grandfather, died October 11, 1872&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of three or four, Alice's mother returned from Chile and took Alice with her back to South America.

At the age of six, Alice was taken back to France by her father to attend school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart (also known as the Faithful Companions of Jesus) on the French side of the Swiss border in Veyrier, France (arrondissement of Viry). (Her sisters were already there.) Alice and her sister, Rose, were moved to a convent in Ferney a few years later and then brought back to Paris. When Alice was 17, her father died on January 5, 1891 of unknown causes. &lt;ref&gt;Archives de Paris, Deces 6e arr. 5 Janvier 1891 V4E5962&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her father's death, Alice trained as a typist and stenographer, a new field at the time, to support herself and her widowed mother. She landed her first stenography-typist job at a varnish factory. In March 1894, she began working at the 'Comptoir général de la photographie' owned by Felix-Max Richard. [[Léon Gaumont]] would later take over and head the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alice Guy Blaché: Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrick, Janelle, Alice &amp; Eiffel&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Alice Guy was hired by Felix-Max Richard to work for a camera manufacturing and photography supply company as a secretary. The company changed hands in 1895 due to a court decision against Felix-Max Richard who sold the company to four men: [[Gustave Eiffel]], Joseph Vallot, Alfred Besnier, and Leon Gaumont. Gustave Eiffel was president of the company, and Leon Gaumont, thirty years Eiffel's junior, was the manager. The company was named after Gaumont because Eiffel was the subject of a national scandal regarding the Panama Canal.&lt;ref&gt;Les premieres annees de la societe L. Gaumont et Cie, Correspondance commercialed de Leon Gaumont 1895-1899. Corcy, Malthete, Mannoni, Laurent, Meusy, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; L. Gaumont et Cie became a major force in the fledgling motion-picture industry in France. Alice continued to work at Gaumont et Cie, a decision that led to a pioneering career in filmmaking that spanned more than 25 years and involved her directing, producing, writing and/or overseeing more than 700 films.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=32905|title=The Lost Garden: The Life and Cinema of Alice Guy-Blaché|publisher=Nfb.ca|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she initially began working for Léon Gaumont as his secretary, she began to become familiar with myriad clients, relevant marketing strategies, and the company's stock of cameras. She also met a handful of pioneering film engineers such as [[Georges Demenÿ]] and [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]].&lt;ref name="Guy1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Guy|title=The Memoirs of Alice Guy Blaché|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEYIAQAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-3104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guy and Gaumont attended the "surprise"&lt;ref name="Entretiens avec Alice Guy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachy|first1=Victor|title=Entretiens avec Alice Guy|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumière event on March 22, 1895. It was the first demonstration of film projection, an obstacle that Gaumont and the Lumières (as well as Edison) were racing to solve. They screened one of their early films ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory]]'', and it only consisted of a simple scene of workmen leaving the Lumière plant in Lyon. Bored with the idea of captured film only being used for the scientific and/or promotional purpose of selling cameras in the form of "demonstration films", she was confident that she could incorporate fictional story-telling elements into film. She asked Gaumont for permission to make her own film, and he granted it.

Alice Guy's first film, and arguably the world's first narrative film, was called ''[[La Fée aux Choux]]'' (''The Fairy of the Cabbages'') or ''The Birth of Infants'', in 1896. The scene Alice described does not match either the 1900 version or the 1902 version that have been discovered. Alice said she filmed the first version in 1896. A July 30, 1896 newspaper describes a "chaste fiction of children born under the cabbages in a wonderfully framed chromo landscape" and provides other details that confirm Alice's description of her first film.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Blas, 30 July 1896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrick, Janelle, ''Alice &amp; Eiffel, A New History of Early Cinema and the Love Story Kept Secret for a Century'', pp. 193-203, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrick, Janelle, La Fée aux Choux, Alice Guy's Garden of Dreams, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 1896 to 1906, Guy was Gaumont's head of production and is generally considered to be the first filmmaker to systematically develop [[narrative]] filmmaking. She was probably the only female director from 1896 to 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-alice-guy-blache|title=Alice Guy Blaché – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her earlier films share many characteristics and themes with her contemporary competitors, such as the Lumières and [[Méliès]]. She explored dance and travel films, often combining the two, such as ''Le Bolero'' performed by Miss [[Saharet]] (1905) and ''Tango'' (1905). Many of Guy's early dance films were popular in music-hall attractions such as the [[serpentine dance]] films &amp;ndash; also a staple of the Lumières and [[Thomas Edison]] film catalogs.&lt;ref name="Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1906, she made ''The Life of Christ'', a big budget production for the time, which included 300 extras. In addition to this, she was one of the pioneers in the use of audio recordings in conjunction with the images on screen in Gaumont's "[[Sound-on-disc|Chronophone]]" system, which used a vertical-cut disc synchronized to the film. She employed some of the first special effects, including using double exposure, [[Masking_(art)#Film|masking techniques]], and running a film backwards.&lt;ref name="McMahan2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alison McMahan|title=Alice Guy Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoGCsatYi5sC|date=1 January 2002|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-5158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solax==
[[File:Still from Alice Guy-Blaché - film Two little strangers - 1912 - Solax - EYE FOT414158.jpg|thumb|Still from ''Two Little Rangers'' (1912)]]
In 1907, Alice Guy married [[Herbert Blaché]] who was soon appointed the production manager for Gaumont's operations in the United States. After working with her husband for Gaumont in the U.S., the two struck out on their own in 1910, partnering with George A. Magie in the formation of [[The Solax Company]], the largest pre-Hollywood studio in America.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name="McMahan2002"/&gt; 

With production facilities for their new company in [[Flushing, New York|Flushing, Queens, New York City]], her husband served as production manager as well as cinematographer, and Alice Guy-Blaché worked as the artistic director and directed many of its releases. Within two years, they had become so successful that they invested more than $100,000 into new and technologically advanced production facilities in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]]. Many early [[film studio]]s were based in Fort Lee at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Koszarski|first=Richard|title=Fort Lee: The Film Town|place=Rome, Italy|publisher=John Libbey Publishing|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w0r8YKan04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Fort+Lee:+the+film+town+Door+Richard+Koszarski|isbn=0-86196-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Fort Lee Film Commission|url=http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html|title=Fort Lee Film Commission|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fort Lee Film Commission|title=Fort Lee Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViR3b72xkK0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Fort+Lee+Birthplace+of+the+Motion+Picture+Industry|isbn=0-7385-4501-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was mentioned in publications of the era that Guy-Blaché placed a large sign in her studio that read: 'Be Natural'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Alice Guy and her husband divorced several years later, and with the rise of the more hospitable and cost-effective climate in [[Hollywood]], their film partnership also ended.

Alice Guy-Blaché's marriage meant that she had to resign from her position working with Gaumont. The couple was sent by the Gaumont company to Cleveland to facilitate the franchise of Gaumont equipment. Early in 1908, the couple went to [[New York City|New York]] where Guy gave birth to her daughter, Simone in September 1908.&lt;ref name=AGB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aliceguyblache.com|title=Alice Guy-Blaché profile|publisher=Aliceguyblance.com|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Guy became the first woman to run her own studio when she created Solax in Gaumont's Flushing studio. In 1912, when Guy was pregnant with her second child, she built a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and continued to complete one to three films a week. To focus on writing and directing, Guy made her husband the president of Solax in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Moving Picture World, 14 June 1913, p. 1140&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after taking the position, Herbert Blaché started a film company called Blaché Features, Inc. For the next few years, the couple maintained a personal and business partnership, working together on many projects. In 1918, Herbert Blaché left his wife and children to pursue a career in [[Hollywood]]. &lt;ref name=AGB/&gt; Alice Guy-Blaché almost died from the Spanish flu pandemic in October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mme Blache Ill, The Film Daily, 27 October 1918, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Following her illness, she joined Herbert in Hollywood in 1919.
 
Alice Guy-Blaché directed her last film in 1919. In 1921, she was forced to auction her film studio and other possessions in bankruptcy. Alice and Herbert were officially divorced in 1922. She returned to France in 1922 and never made a film again.&lt;ref name=AGB/&gt;

==Death==
Alice Guy-Blaché never remarried, and in 1964 she returned to the United States to stay with one of her daughters. On March 24, 1968, at the age of 94, Guy died in a nursing home&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;McMahan, Alison J. (1997).

==Legacy and tributes==
In the late 1940s, Guy-Blaché wrote an autobiography, and in 1976 it was published in French. It was translated into English in 1986 with the help of her daughter Simone and daughter-in-law Roberta Blaché and film writer [[Anthony Slide]].

Guy-Blaché was tremendously concerned with her unexplained absence from the historical record of the film industry. She was in constant communication with colleagues and film historians correcting previously made and supposedly factual statements about her life. She crafted lengthy lists of her films as she remembered them, with the hope of being able to assume creative ownership and get legitimate credit for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=The Great Adventure: Alice Guy Blaché, Cinema Pioneer|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guy-Blaché is considered by some to have been the first female filmmaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nofilmschool.com/2017/03/alice-guy-blache-worlds-first-woman-filmmaker|title=Alice Guy-Blaché, the World's First Female Filmmaker, Wrote, Directed, and Produced Over 700 Films|author=Justin Morrow|website=No Film School|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1896 to 1920, she directed over 1,000 films, some 350 of which survive, and 22 of which are feature-length films. 

Guy was one of the first women (along with [[Lois Weber]]) to manage and own her own studio: [[The Solax Company]]. Few of her films survive in an easily viewable format.

In 1953, Guy was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]], the highest non-military award France offers. On March 16, 1957, she was honored in a [[Cinématheque Française]] ceremony that went unnoticed by the press.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

In 2002, [[Circle X Theatre]] in Los Angeles produced ''Laura Comstock’s Bag-punching Dog'', a musical about the invention of cinema, and Alice Guy was a lead character. The musical was written by [[Jillian Armenante]], Alice Dodd, and [[Chris Jeffries]]. 

In 2004, the only existing historic marker dedicated to Alice Guy-Blaché in the United States was unveiled on the location of her Solax Studio in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] by the Fort Lee Film Commission. 

In 2010 the Academy Film Archive preserved Alice Guy-Blaché's short film ''The Girl in the Armchair.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=&amp;filmmaker=Blache&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an off Broadway production of ''Flight''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectflight.com|title=Flight|publisher=Pacific Performance Project East|year=2012|accessdate=23 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044038/http://projectflight.com/|archive-date=2013-12-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiered at the Connelly Theatre, featuring a fictionalized portrayal of Alice Guy-Blaché as a 1913 documentary filmmaker. Also in 2011, the Fort Lee Film Commission successfully lobbied the [[Directors Guild of America]] to accept Alice Guy-Blaché as a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/community/214341771_Fort_Lee_Film_Commission_helps_induct_first_female_filmmaker_to_New_Jersey_Hall_of_Fame.html#sthash.7bVIXcJL.dpuf|title=North.Jersey.com|author=Svetlana Shkolnikova|work=NorthJersey.com|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, for the centennial of the founding and building of Guy-Blaché's Solax Studio in Fort Lee, the Fort Lee Film Commission raised funds to replace her grave marker in Maryrest Cemetery in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]]. The new marker includes the Solax studio logo and indicates her role as a cinema pioneer.

She was the subject of a [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary ''The Lost Garden: The Life and Cinema of Alice Guy-Blaché'' by director [[Marquise Lepage]], which received Quebec's [[Gemeaux Award]] for Best Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lost Garden: The Life and Cinema of Alice Guy-Blaché|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=32905|work=Collection|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, film scholar Alison McMahan published ''Alice Guy Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/alice-guy-blache-9781501302688/|title=Alice Guy Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema|website=Bloomsbury Press|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Guy-Blaché was inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="New Jersey Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/community/214341771_Fort_Lee_Film_Commission_helps_induct_first_female_filmmaker_to_New_Jersey_Hall_of_Fame.html#sthash.7bVIXcJL.dpuf|title=New Jersey Hall of Fame|author=Svetlana Shkolnikova|work=NorthJersey.com|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Golden Door Film Festival]] gives an award named in her honor.

In 2017, the documentary film ''[[Be Natural (film)|Be Natural]]'', by [[Pamela B. Green]], dealt with Guy-Blaché's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/be-natural-untold-story-alice-guy-blache-review-1111465|title='Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blache': Film Review {{!}} Cannes 2018 |date=13 May 2018 |author= Leslie Felperin |access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Maya art''' refers to the material arts of the [[Maya civilization]], an eastern and south-eastern [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that took shape in the course of the later [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic Period]] (500 BCE to 200 CE). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.

==Mayan art history==
Following the nineteenth and early-twentieth century publications on Maya art and archaeology by [[John Lloyd Stephens|Stephens]], [[Frederick Catherwood|Catherwood]], [[Alfred Maudslay|Maudslay]], [[Teoberto Maler|Maler]] and [[Désiré Charnay|Charnay]] that for the first time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments, the 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden´s 'A Study of Maya Art' - now over a century ago - laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography).&lt;ref&gt;Spinden 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the ´material arts´, such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff 1950&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Kubler|Kubler's]] 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), concluded a period of gradual increase of knowledge that was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.

Starting in the early 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms - first of all Palenque - came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical interpretation joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff as well as the mythological approach initiated by [[Michael D. Coe|M.D. Coe]], with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in ''The Blood of Kings'', written together with art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|M. Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Miller 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1973, 1975, 1978, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style,&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek and Hales 1981&lt;/ref&gt; thereby revealing even more of a hitherto barely known spiritual world.

As to subsequent developments, important issues in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by [[Karl Taube]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Miller and Taube 1993; Taube et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops,&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994&lt;/ref&gt; the representation of bodily experience and the senses in Maya art,&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units.&lt;ref name="Stone and Zender 2011"&gt;Stone and Zender 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1992, Looper 2003, Simmons Clancy 2009, O'Neil 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Martin 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{main|Maya architecture}}

[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] 
[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]

The layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.

Among the various types of structures should be mentioned:
*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).
*Courtyards and palaces.
*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house &lt;ref&gt;Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible council house in Copan.
*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   
*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].
 
Among the structural ensembles are:
*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;
*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;
*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.

In the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).

The northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucatan) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture&lt;ref&gt;Gendrop 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucatan from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].

==Stone sculpture==
{{see also|Maya stelae}}
[[File:Cancuenpanel3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cancuen]], panel 3, seated king with two subordinates. Second half 8th century.]]
[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] 
The main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.

*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.
*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart and Stuart 2008&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.
*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 89&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192&lt;/ref&gt; and may have functioned as altars.
*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. 
*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.
*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).
*'''Stone sculpture in the round''', represented by statuary, such as the seated Copan scribe and small stelas from Toniná; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the maize deities from a Copan façade; and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Copán, that were integral parts of architectural design.

==Wood carving==
[[File:WLA metmuseum Maya Wood Mirror Bearer 6th century.jpg|thumb|upright|120px|Possible mirror bearer, wood, 6th century]]
It is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Coe et al. 1961&lt;/ref&gt; with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box covered with a long hieroglyphic inscription from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)| Tortuguero]]. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.

==Stucco modeling==
[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]
[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]
At least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.
 
Several solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.&lt;ref&gt;newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun&lt;/ref&gt; An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.

Often, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle and Houston 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures&lt;ref&gt;V.E. Miller 1991&lt;/ref&gt; reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;see Yadeun 1993:108-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].

Unique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 168&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.

==Mural painting==
[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]
[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]
Although, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucatán's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1982; Gann 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[Río Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1995&lt;/ref&gt; usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).

A bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Tajín]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and bookmaking==
{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}
[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]
The Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2017), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Kerr 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. Today, [[Maya codices|three codices]] (the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices), all of the Post-Classic period, are still in existence; the authenticity of a fourth one (the [[Grolier Codex]]) remains doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.

Besides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.
 
Hieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.&lt;ref name="Stone and Zender 2011"/&gt; Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').

==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==
{{main|Maya ceramics}}
[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]
[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]
Unlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 92&lt;/ref&gt; and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.

Made without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]&lt;ref&gt;Just 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Vase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.

Sculptural ceramic art includes [[censer|incense burners]] and hand or mold-made figurines sometimes used as ocarinas. The profusely decorated, elongated Classic incense burners from the kingdom of Palenque - evolved from Early-Classic models - show the modeled face of a deity (usually the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]]) or of a king. The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Figurines, many of them mold-made, are often of an amazing liveliness and realism. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].

==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==
[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]
[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]
It is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.

Among other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].&lt;ref&gt;Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131&lt;/ref&gt; Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Trik 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied arts and body decoration==
{{see also|Maya textiles}}
Textiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994: 331&lt;/ref&gt; must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Body decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2006: 18-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==
[[File:Nationalmuseum für Archäologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]
There are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections. The [[Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies]] lists over 250 museums in its Maya Museum database,&lt;ref&gt;Ros.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Association of Mayanists]] lists just under 50 museums in Europe alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wayeb.org/resources-links/museums-collections/|title=Museums &amp; Collections - Wayeb|author=|date=|website=wayeb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico City]], the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|Museo Nacional de Antropología]] contains an especially large selection of Maya artifacts.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of regional museums in Mexico hold important collections, including the [[Museo de las Estelas "Román Piña Chan"]] in [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]],&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"/&gt; the [[Museo Regional de Yucatán "Palacio Cantón"]] in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], and the [[Museo Regional de Antropología "Carlos Pellicer Camera"]] in [[Villahermosa]], Tabasco.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important museum collections in Guatemala are those of the [[Museo Popol Vuh]] and the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]], both in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"/&gt; Notable museums with collections of Maya artifacts include the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. The [[Museum of Cultures (Basel)|Museum der Kulturen]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], holds a number of wooden lintels from Tikal; the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnologisches Museum]] in [[Berlin]] holds a broad selection of Maya artifacts. In [[Belgium]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Musées royaux d'art et d'histoire]] in [[Brussels]] houses an important collection.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]] contains a notable selection of Maya ceramics,&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"/&gt; while the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in [[Ohio]] has one of the most extensive Maya collections in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"/&gt; The [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museo de América]] in [[Madrid]] hosts a large selection of artifacts from Palenque; it is also home to the Madrid Codex.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"/&gt; Other notable European museums are the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], home to the Leyden Plate, and the [[Rietberg Museum]] in [[Zürich]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"/&gt;

The '''Apollon Theatre''' (Greek: ''θέατρο "Απόλλων'' ''Theatro Apollon'') is a [[theatre]] in [[Patras|Patras, Greece]]. Designed by the famous [[Germany|German]] architect [[Ernst Ziller]], it was completed in 1872. The Apollon is located east of [[Georgiou I Square]], one of Patras' popular squares. The theatre is a micrograph of the [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]] and is the oldest existing enclosed theatre of the same era. The Apollon Theatre has been  the main stage of the [[Patras Municipal and Regional Theatre]] since 1988, and can hold up to 300 people.

==History==
The Apollon Theatre began construction on February 11, 1871, and opened on October 10, 1872.  The construction was paid for by various residents of Patras. The main erection committee included [[Theodor Hamburger]] (president), [[Dimitrios Patrinos]], K. Lappas and A. Chrysanthis.

Other sponsors included the then-[[mayor of Patras]], [[Georgios Roufos]], [[Gustavos Clauss]], Hamburger, Langouras, the Triantis Brothers, Panagiotis Brothers, father of [[Dimitrios Gounaris]], Epameinondas Maximos, father of [[Dimitrios Maximos]]

The Apollon Theatre is one of only four neoclassic theatres that survive in Greece (the other three are the [[Malliaropouleio Theatre]] in [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]], which opened in 1910, the [[Theater Apollon, Syros|Apollo Theatre]] in [[Syros]], opened in 1864 and the [[Piraeus Municipal Theatre]] in [[Piraeus]], opened in 1895).

An '''artisan''' (from {{lang-fr|artisan}}, {{lang-it|artigiano}}) is a [[skilled worker|skilled craft worker]] who makes or creates things by [[handicraft|hand]] that may be [[wikt:functional|functional]] or strictly [[decorative]], for example [[furniture]], [[decorative arts]], [[sculpture]]s, [[clothing]], [[jewellery]], [[artisanal food|food items]], household items and [[tools]] or even mechanisms such as the handmade clockwork [[Mechanical watch|movement]] of a [[watchmaker]]. Artisans practice a [[craft]] and may through experience and [[aptitude]] reach the expressive levels of an [[artist]].

The adjective "artisanal" is sometimes used in describing hand-processing in what is usually viewed as an industrial process, such as in the phrase ''[[artisanal mining]]''. Thus,  "artisanal" is sometimes used in [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] as a [[buzz word]] to describe or imply some relation with the crafting of handmade food products, such as [[bread]], [[beverages]] or [[artisanal cheese|cheese]]. Many of these have traditionally been handmade, [[rural]] or [[pastoral]] goods but are also now commonly made on a larger scale with automated [[mechanization]] in [[factories]] and other industrial areas.

Artisans were the dominant producers of [[consumer products]] before the [[Industrial Revolution]]. 

In [[ancient Greece]], artisans were drawn to [[agora]]s and often built workshops nearby.&lt;ref name="liag"&gt;{{cite book |title=Life in Ancient Greece |last=Peppas  |first=Lynn |year=2005 |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |isbn=0778720357 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WzwDfP5mIWYC |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval artisans==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the term "artisan" was applied to those who made things or provided services. It did not apply to unskilled [[manual labour]]ers. Artisans were divided into two distinct groups: those who operated their own businesses and those who did not. Those who owned their businesses were called [[Master craftsman|masters]], while the latter were the [[Journeyman|journeymen]] and [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]]. One misunderstanding many people have about this social group is that they picture them as "workers" in the modern sense: employed by someone. The most influential group among the artisans were the masters, the business owners. The owners enjoyed a higher social status in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;History of Western Civilization, Boise State University  {{cite web|url=http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/medsoc/23.shtml |title=Document No.23 |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061228/http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/medsoc/23.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shokunin ==
Shokunin is a Japanese word for "artisan" or "craftsman", which also implies a [[pride]] in one's own work. In the words of shokunin [[Tashio Odate]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Shokunin means not only having technical skill, but also implies an attitude and social consciousness... a social obligation to work his best for the general welfare of the people, [an] obligation both material and spiritual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Art of Fine Tools|last = Nagyszalanczy|first = Sandor|publisher = Taunton Press|year = 2000|isbn = 1561583618|location = |pages = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Traditionally, shokunin honoured their tools of trade at New Year's – the sharpened and taken-care of tools would be placed in a [[tokonoma]] (a container or box still found in Japanese houses and shops), and two rice cakes and a tangerine (on top of rice paper) were placed on top of each toolbox, to honour the tools and express gratitude for performing their task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The-Twa-Corbies.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] of the Scots ballad "[[The Twa Corbies]]"]]
A '''ballad''' {{IPAc-en|'|b|æ|l|ə|d}} is a form of verse, often a [[narrative]] set to [[music]]. Ballads derive from the medieval [[Music of France|French]] ''chanson balladée'' or ''[[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]'', which were originally "danced songs". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later [[medieval]] period until the 19th century. They were widely used across [[Europe]], and later in [[Australia]], [[North Africa]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated, in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines.

Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet [[Broadside (music)|broadsides]]. The form was often used by [[poet]]s and [[composer]]s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular [[love song]] and is often used for any love song, particularly the [[sentimental ballad]] of [[pop music|pop]] or [[rock music|rock]].

==Origins==
[[File:Here begynneth a gest of Robyn Hode.png|thumb|upright|A sixteenth-century printed ballad, the [[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]]]
The ballad derives its name from medieval [[French language|French]] dance songs or "ballares" ([[Latin|L]]: ''ballare'', to dance),&lt;ref&gt;W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Harvard, 1944; 2nd edn., 1972), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; from which 'ballet' is also derived, as did the alternative rival form that became the French [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (1972, Penguin, 1976), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1944, Harvard, 1972), pp. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt; As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as [[Beowulf]].&lt;ref name=Houseman1952&gt;J. E. Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Musically they were influenced by the [[Minnesinger]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (Penguin 1972, 1976), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in [[England]] is "[[Judas (ballad)|Judas]]" in a 13th-century [[manuscript]].&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"&gt;A. N. Bold, ''The Ballad'' (Routledge, 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that the two words, ballad and ballet, are both derived from the French language.

==Ballad form==
{{See also|AABA form}}
Ballads were originally written to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.&lt;ref name="British Literature pg 610"&gt;"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Most northern and west European ballads are written in [[ballad stanza]]s or [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) of alternating lines of [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) [[tetrameter]] (eight syllables) and iambic [[trimeter]] (six syllables), known as [[Common metre#Variants|ballad meter]]. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.&lt;ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"&gt;D. Head and I. Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in this stanza from "[[Lord Thomas and Fair Annet]]":

The '''horse''' | fair '''Ann''' | et '''rode''' | up'''on''' |&lt;br /&gt;
He '''amb''' | led '''like''' | the '''wind''' |,&lt;br /&gt;
With '''sil''' | ver '''he''' | was '''shod''' | be'''fore''',&lt;br /&gt;
With '''burn''' | ing '''gold''' | be'''hind''' |.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

There is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish ''romanceros'', which are [[octosyllabic]] and use [[Literary consonance|consonance]] rather than rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballads usually are heavily influenced by the regions in which they originate and use the common dialect of the people. [[Scotland]]'s ballads in particular, both in theme and language, are strongly characterised by their distinctive tradition, even exhibiting some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as travel to the [[Fairy]] Kingdom in the [[Scots language|Scots]] ballad "Tam Lin".&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Ballads" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', pp. 610-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballads do not have any known author or correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Thomas Percy]] (1729–1811) to publish volumes of popular ballads.&lt;ref name="British Literature pg 610"/&gt;

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise, and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic.&lt;ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"/&gt; Themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/980|title=Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in Eighteenth-Century Britain {{!}} Reviews in History|website=www.history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a [[refrain]], sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:Scott's Minstrelsy Of The Scottish Border.JPG|thumb|A copy of [[Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] ''The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border''.]]
Scholars of ballads have been divided into "communalists", such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and the [[Brothers Grimm]], who argue that ballads are originally communal compositions, and "individualists" such as [[Cecil Sharp]], who assert that there was one single original author.&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/&gt; Communalists tend to see more recent, particularly printed, broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre, while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hawkins-Dady, ''Reader's Guide to Literature in English'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
The transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure 'folk memory' or 'immemorial tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Finnegan, ''Oral Poetry: Its Nature, Significance and Social Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802) the romantic poet and historical novelist [[Walter Scott]] argued a need to 'remove obvious corruptions' in order to attempt to restore a supposed original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations 'incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.' Similarly, John Robert Moore noted 'a natural tendency to oblivescence'.&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of transmission on the English Ballads", ''Modern Language Review'' 11 (1916), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott, transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity' compared to their oral counterparts.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Classification==
[[File:Illustration to the ballad Young Beckie from "Some British Ballads".jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''[[Young Bekie]].'']] European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.

===Traditional ballads===
{{See also|Child Ballads}}
The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' indicates that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is [[Wynkyn de Worde|Wynkyn de Worde's]] collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.&lt;ref name=Sweers2005&gt;B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early collections of English ballads were made by [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) and in the [[Roxburghe Ballads]] collected by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], 1st (1784), which paralleled the work in Scotland by [[Walter Scott]] and [[Robert Burns]].&lt;ref name=Sweers2005/&gt; Inspired by his reading as a teenager of ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' by [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], Scott began collecting ballads while he attended Edinburgh University in the 1790s. He published his research from 1802 to 1803 in a three-volume work, ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. Burns collaborated with [[James Johnson (engraver)|James Johnson]] on the multi-volume ''[[Scots Musical Museum]]'', a miscellany of folk songs and poetry with original work by Burns. Around the same time, he worked with [[George Thomson (musician)|George Thompson]] on ''[[A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice]]''.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=E. David |title=Victorian Songhunters: The Recovery and Editing of English Vernacular Ballads and Folk Lyrics, 1820-1883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1tI8sPaqBwC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=August 30, 2017|date=April 13, 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-7417-7|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Northern English and Southern Scots shared in the identified tradition of [[Border ballads]], particularly evinced by the cross-border narrative in versions of "[[The Ballad of Chevy Chase]]" sometimes associated with the Lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel [[Richard Sheale]].&lt;ref name="Gregory2006"&gt;D. Gregory, '"The Songs of the People for Me": The Victorian Rediscovery of Lancashire Vernacular Song', ''Canadian Folk Music/Musique folklorique canadienne'', 40 (2006), pp. 12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ganev,''Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in 18th Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; James Davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use (at least in England) of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enterprise.gre.ac.uk/news/articles/2011/gmi-ballads-talk]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}}

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by [[Svend Grundtvig]] and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor [[Francis James Child]].&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/&gt; They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; The traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground Victorian magazine ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the traditional ballad, these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Joudrey, "Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad," ''Victorian Poetry'' 54.4 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadsides===
{{Main article|Broadside (music)}}
[[File:Tragical Ballad 18th century.png|right|thumb|An 18th-century broadside ballad: ''The tragical ballad: or, the lady who fell in love with her serving-man''.]]
Broadside ballads (also known as 'broadsheet', 'stall', 'vulgar' or 'come all ye' ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune title, as well as an alluring poem.&lt;ref&gt;E. Nebeker, [http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/page/heyday-of-the-broadside-ballad "The Heyday of the Broadside Ballad"], ''English Broadside Ballad Archive, University of California-Santa Barbara'', retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration (as well as tune title). These later sheets could include many individual songs, which would be cut apart and sold individually as "slip songs." Alternatively, they might be folded to make small cheap books or "chapbooks" which often drew on ballad stories.&lt;ref&gt;G. Newman and L. E. Brown, ''Britain in the Hanoverian Age, 1714–1837: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997), pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Tessa Watt estimates the number of copies sold may have been in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;T. Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety, 1550-1640'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sold by travelling [[chapmen]] in city streets or at fairs.&lt;ref&gt;M. Spufford, ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and Its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, marriage, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary ballads===
Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the [[Romantic movement]] from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]] in Scotland collected and wrote their own ballads. Similarly in England [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] produced a collection of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' in 1798 that included Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads and tried to imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature'', p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in Germany [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] cooperated with [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Williams, ''The Life of Goethe'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2001), pp. 106-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling's "[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]" (1892-6) and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1897).&lt;ref&gt;S. Ledger, S. McCracken, ''Cultural Politics at the Fin de Siècle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian poet [[Christina Rossetti]] used ballad forms to explore spiritual and moral issues and to discuss the stereotypical treatment and representation of men and women's roles in society.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Ballad operas==
{{Main article|Ballad opera}}
[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Act III Scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]
In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]], partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50485/ballad-opera "Ballad opera"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728, with a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[John Christopher Pepusch]], both of whom probably influenced by [[Paris]] ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas d'Urfey]] (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kidson, ''The Beggar's Opera: Its Predecessors and Successors'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title ''Polly''. [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like [[Isaac Bickerstaffe|Isaac Bickerstaffe's]] ''Love in a Village'' (1763) and [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert and Sullivan's]] early works like ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' as well as in the modern musical.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wren, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Art of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht|Bertolt Brecht's]] (1928) ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.&lt;ref&gt;K. Lawrence, ''Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-century "British" Literary Canons'' (University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy|Peter Bellamy's]] ''The Transports'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Aby and P. Gruchow, ''The North Star State: A Minnesota History Reader'', (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2002), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.&lt;ref&gt;L. Lehrman, ''Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-bibliography'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Europe==

===Native American ballads===
[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] outside the town of Talcott in [[Summers County, West Virginia]]]]
Native American ballads are ballads that are native to North America (not to be confused with ballads performed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]).&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), pp. 14-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include '[[The Streets of Laredo]]', which was found in Britain and Ireland as 'The Unfortunate Rake'; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in North America, including among the best known, '[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]' and '[[Jesse James (folk song)|Jesse James]]'.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by [[George Malcolm Laws]], although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/&gt;

===Blues ballads===
{{Main article|Blues ballad}}
The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed [[the blues]] musical format.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/&gt; The most famous blues ballads include those about [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Casey Jones]].&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt;

===Bush ballads===
{{Main article|Bush ballad}}
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''The Old Bush Songs'']]
The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentimental ballads==
{{Main article|Sentimental ballad}}
Sentimental ballads, sometimes called "tear-jerkers" or "drawing-room ballads" owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early "[[Tin Pan Alley]]" music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]] (descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]], but with [[sheet music|printed music]], and usually newly composed). Such songs include "Little Rosewood Casket" (1870), "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]" (1892) and "[[Danny Boy]]".&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; The association with sentimentality led to the term "ballad" being used for slow [[love song]]s from the 1950s onwards. Modern variations include "[[jazz ballads]]", "[[pop ballads]]", "[[R&amp;B ballads]]" and "[[power ballads]]".&lt;ref name=Cohen2005p297&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Healthy feet.JPG|thumb|Barefooted person leaving footprints behind.]]
'''Barefoot''' is the most common term for the state of not wearing any [[footwear]].

Wearing footwear is an exclusively human characteristic, however some animals held by humans are also issued with footwear, such as horses and, more rarely dogs and cats. There are health benefits and some risks associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides protection from cuts, abrasions, bruises, and impacts from objects on the ground or the ground texture itself, as well as from [[frostbite|frost]] or [[Thermal burn|heat burns]],  and parasites like [[hookworm]] in extreme situations. However, shoes can limit the flexibility, strength, and mobility of the foot and can lead to higher incidences of flexible flat foot, bunions, hammer toe, and [[Morton's neuroma]]. Walking and running barefoot results in a more natural gait, allowing for a more rocking motion of the foot, eliminating the hard heel strike and therefore generating less collision force in the foot and lower leg.&lt;ref name="Lieberman_DE"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature08723| title = Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners| year = 2010| last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D.

There are many sports that are performed barefoot, most notably [[gymnastics]] and [[martial arts]], but also [[beach volleyball]], [[barefoot running]], [[barefoot hiking]], and [[barefoot waterskiing|water skiing]]. In modern language, someone who tends not to wear shoes in public or is participating in the aforementioned sports may be described as a '''barefooter'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barefoot water skiing: an illustrated guide to learning and mastering the sport|year=1988|publisher=World Publications, Incorporated|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6I2WE5XWIQ8C&amp;q=barefooter&amp;dq=barefooter|author1=Scarpa, R |author2=Dorner, T. |isbn=978-0-944406-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallack|first=R.M.|title=Run for Life: The Anti-Aging, Anti-Injury, Super-Fitness Plan to Keep You Running to 100|year=2009|publisher=Sky Horse Publishing|isbn=978-1-60239-344-8|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pkjcENkpO6cC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=barefooter#v=onepage&amp;q=barefooter&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in ancient times, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Hindu]]s, and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] often went barefoot, as the inhabited terrain mostly mandated no practical necessity for footwear.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless [[sandal]] known as a ''Cleopatra'', which did not provide any practical protection for the foot. Athletes in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] participated barefoot and generally unclothed.&lt;ref name="ancient_olympics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unearthing the First Spartan Boys where not allowed to wear shoes to toughen their feet and allow stronger dexterity in their toes Olympics|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=July 19, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728000414/http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|archivedate=2010-07-28|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who eventually conquered the Greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture, did not adopt the Greek perception of footwear and clothing. [[Clothing in ancient Rome|Roman clothing]] explicitly including footwear was seen as a sign of power and as a necessity of living in a civilized world; accordingly slaves usually were to remain barefoot.&lt;ref name="Frazine_Richard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazine|first=Richard Keith|title=The Barefoot Hiker|year=1993|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=0-89815-525-8|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/?id=edsITVCd2G0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=barefoot+hiker&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many references to shoes being worn in the [[Bible]].

Going barefoot was seen as a marker of poverty and the lowest social class, as well as being the mark of a prisoner (see below).&lt;ref name="Frazine_Richard"/&gt; In the 15th century, [[chopine]]s were created in [[Turkey]] and were usually 7–8&amp;nbsp;inches (17.7–20.3&amp;nbsp;cm) high. These shoes became popular in [[Venice]] and throughout Europe as a [[status symbol]] revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century royalty, such as [[Catherine de Medici]] and [[Mary I of England]], started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, even men wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as "well-heeled".&lt;ref name="high_heels"/&gt;

Bare feet have come to symbolize innocence or childhood in a glorifying perception of freedom from real-life requirements. The connection to childhood and innocence, as well as the simple joys of country life, are embodied in the poem "[[The Barefoot Boy]]" by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], published in 1855.&lt;ref name="Whittier_John"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravitch|first=Diane|title=The American reader: words that moved a nation| year=2000| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=0-06-273733-3| pages=140–43| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZhJQCsOCgGgC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=the+barefoot+boy+by+john+greenleaf+whittier&amp;q=the%20barefoot%20boy%20by%20john%20greenleaf%20whittier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the book ''[[Dancing Barefoot (book)|Dancing Barefoot]]'' by ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' actor [[Wil Wheaton]] features five short stories that chronicle his journey from childhood and youth through to maturity and self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="Wheaton_Wil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheaton|first=Wil|title=Dancing Barefoot|year=2004|publisher=Monolith Press|isbn=0-596-00674-8|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gDG67vii624C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dancing+barefoot&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious aspects===
In most religions, the exposure of bare feet is regarded as a sign of humility and subjection. Some religious practitioners have taken a vow of Gospel poverty, while there are certain convents where going barefoot is obligatory ([[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]], [[Poor Clares]], [[Colettine Poor Clares]]). With regard to the use of footwear as a display of status, the religious and common art of many cultures throughout the world shows a person without shoes symbolizing either extreme poverty or the state of captivity and unfree servitude.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|year=2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=barefoot+middle+ages&amp;q=barefoot%20middle%20ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thailand]], Master Jinshen, a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, walks {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}} per day barefoot as a reminder to others who pursue a material life to protect and be concerned for [[Mother Nature]]. He states that he does this to follow Buddhist rules, to lead the people to the path of virtue, and to develop his Buddhist spirit.&lt;ref name="Buddhist_Monk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lin|first=You Hsueh|title=Thai monk walks million miles on barefoot|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20100213-198496.html|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[Asia One News]]|date=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary in Judaism and some Christian denominations to go barefoot while mourning.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Some Christian churches practice barefoot [[pilgrimage]] traditions, such as the ascent of [[Croagh Patrick]] in Ireland at night while barefoot (although the nighttime part is no longer encouraged).&lt;ref name="Castlebar_News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayo Mountain Rescue Team appeal to pilgrims for safety on holy mountain|url=http://www.castlebar.ie/news/article_2671.shtml|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=Castlebar News|date=July 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many religions, it is common to remove shoes when entering a place considered holy. For example, in the [[Book of Exodus]], [[Moses]] was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush:

{{cquote|Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy ground ({{bibleverse|Exodus|3:5|KJV}}).}}

Anyone entering a [[mosque]] or a [[Hindu temple]], including a visitor, is expected to remove his or her shoes; racks for the storage of shoes are usually provided at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goseasia.about.com/od/travelplanning/a/mosque-dos-and-donts.htm|title=Mosque etiquette|work=Southeast Asia travel|publisher=about.com|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html|title=Worship in Hindu temples|publisher=pujaonline|accessdate=10 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625094917/http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html#|archive-date=2012-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foot washing]], or ceremonial washing of others' feet, is associated with humility in Christianity, and Jesus Christ is recorded in the [[New Testament]] as washing the feet of his disciples to serve them during the [[Last Supper]]. Christians who practice foot washing today do so to bring them closer to Jesus and to fill them with a sense of humility and service. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] show their respect and humility for the [[Pope]] by kissing his feet. In a similar manner, Hindus show love and respect to a [[guru]] by touching his bare feet (called [[pranam]]). It is customary to show one's respect by walking barefoot around [[Raj Ghat]], the monument to [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Both United States President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] paid him this honor.&lt;ref name="Barefoot_Bush"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barefoot Bush pays tribute to Mahatma|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Barefoot-Bush-pays-tribute-to-Mahatma/articleshow/1436126.cms|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=The Times of India|date=March 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Imperial Japan]]ese period, removing one's shoes in the presence of a person of higher status was a sign of showing one's own humility, subordination, and respect towards their status.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt;

Christian congregations of men and women that go entirely barefoot or wear sandals include the [[Discalced]], like the [[Discalced Carmelites]] (1568), the [[Congregation of the Feuillants|Feuillants]] ([[Cistercians]], 1575), the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarians]] (1594), the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]] (1604), and the [[Passionist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many branches of [[Romani culture]] across the world, it is traditional for women to dance barefoot.

===Firewalking===
[[Firewalking]] is the practice of walking barefoot over hot coals. It has been practiced by many people and cultures in all parts of the world, with the earliest known reference dating back to [[Iron Age India]] – c. 1200 BC.&lt;ref name="Willey_David"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willey|first=David|title=Firewalking Myth vs Physics|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=June 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606040454/http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html| archivedate= 6 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used as a [[rite of passage]], as a test of an individual's strength and courage, or, in religion, as a test of one's faith. Today, it is often used in corporate and team-building seminars and self-help workshops as a confidence-building exercise. Firewalking implies the belief that the feat requires the aid of a supernatural force, strong faith, or on an individual's ability to focus on "mind over matter".&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Modern physics has largely debunked this, showing that the amount of time the foot is in contact with the ground is not enough to induce a burn, combined with the fact that [[coal]] is not a very good conductor of heat.&lt;ref name="Willey_David"/&gt;

===Australia===
It is common for Australians, particularly young people, to be barefoot in public places, especially during summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/season-of-the-shoeless/story-e6frg8h6-1226732901337 |title=Season of the shoeless |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] launched a summer advertisement in 2012 featuring a customer running barefoot through the hot carpark to the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2012/11/mcdonalds-gets-set-for-summer.html |title=McDonald's gets set for summer with launch of 'Do Summer' campaign via DDB Sydney  |publisher=Campaignbrief.com Australia|date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some rural and remote areas, such as the [[Northern Territory]], Western NSW, regional Queensland and many islands, students often attend school barefoot. On [[Lord Howe Island]] the [[Lord Howe Island Board]] has described the fact pupils at the government-run Lord Howe Island Central School are allowed to attend school barefoot as a part of the "island lifestyle" and a "community asset".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhib.nsw.gov.au/sites/lordhowe/files/public/images/documents/lhib/Community/lhi%20community%20strategy%20final%20august%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lord Howe Island Community Strategy |publisher=Lhib.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being barefoot in public is more common during warmer months, and often accepted as a social norm, however this does not extend to metropolitan cities such as London, but more for rural areas and more common for young children and teenagers. Some British schools also allow children to attend school barefoot in warmer months, and encourage it for indoor and outdoor physical education lessons. The [[National Health Service]] has recommended that people "go barefoot or wear open-toed sandals whenever you can in the hot weather...to help stop your feet getting sweaty and smelly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/foothealth/Pages/Summerfeet.aspx |title=Summer feet tips  |publisher=Nhs.uk Choices|date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa barefoot walking in public is part of the predominantly white Afrikaans speaking culture, although English speaking people also often walk barefoot in public, especially in the summer months and in cities such as Cape Town.
The National Guidelines on School Uniform list shoes as an optional item&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=8NYok1lRKBs%3D&amp;tabid=453&amp;mid=469 |title=Schedule : National Guidelines on School Uniform |publisher=Education.gov.za |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Draft Guidelines state "Pupils, especially in lower grades, should also
be permitted to attend without shoes in hot weather". Most children attend school barefoot. In many schools, the dress codes either encourage kids to attend school barefoot or prefer kids to attend school barefoot, especially in the summer months.
Some South African schools have sport uniforms where bare feet are compulsory, such as primary school rugby. Another sport where bare feet for kids are compulsory is "tou trek" or tug of war. Being barefoot in public is generally tolerated.  In South African shopping malls, stores, and events, it is not an uncommon sight to see barefoot adults, kids and especially teenagers and young adults.

=== United States ===
In some parts of the United States, where [[taboos]] against barefoot walking are strong, it is common for people to wear the same shoes indoors and outdoors, and for guests to keep their shoes on when visiting other people's houses. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Imprisonment and slavery ==

Removing the footwear and making a captive go barefoot has been one of the first conventional methods to tag and identify [[prisoner]]s in most civilizations. It was a usual feature and often the principle element of early [[prison uniform]]s. The visual aspect of bare feet is therefore used to contrast the conventional appearance as footwear is regarded an obligatory clothing feature in urbanized cultures.

Besides the indicatory aspect going in bare feet restricts the freedom of action in many situations. A barefooted person is therefore disadvantaged opposite a shod person in many practical respects. This aspect is often used to exercise physical control over individuals in captivity.

A barefoot person is usually disadvantaged in a physical confrontation against shod individuals. Drastically more severe injuries can be sustained especially by a kicking person outfitted with footwear in contrast to a person in bare feet. For this reason shoes are considered [[deadly weapon]]s by [[penal law]]s of most countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Bare feet on the other hand present an opportune and vulnerable target for the application of force. These effects are usually desired by correctional or police officers primarily in confrontational situations with antagonistic individuals. The risk of personal injury is therefore notably reduced and the situation can often be resolved more efficiently.

Another main objective is preventing and counteracting potential attempts of [[prison escape]].
Without the protection of the feet that shoes provide, the locomotion of an unshod person is more difficult in the majority of exterior environments, so a potential fugitive is easier to retrieve in many cases. Detainees are often discouraged from attempting escape by this measure alone.&lt;ref name="Tewksbury escape"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police capture man who escaped from Tewksbury police station.|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_18259469|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A barefoot person experiences certain discomfort in daily life situations. The desire to be protected from the common inconveniences of the ground, mostly due to coarse textures or adverse temperatures, prompted humans to make use of footwear in [[ancient history]]. Incidentally the traditional visual appearance of civilized societies was established, including footwear as an obligatory feature.
A forced exclusion from the conveniences and also appearance of footwear typically creates an frequent awareness of being vulnerable, therefore it can have an intimidating effect on a person. The enforcement of bare feet often creates a consciousness of being powerless and degraded notably on prisoners, as they typically cannot relieve this situation on their own.&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=July 18, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=June 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the practical effects are typically achieved effortlessly, keeping captives or prisoners barefoot has been cross-culturally practiced since antiquity.&lt;ref name="Biblical studies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblical studies: Footwear.|url=https://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/stichwort/27353/|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also commonly practiced to identify [[slavery|slaves]] in former times.

===Slave codes===
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Barefooted oriental slaves (''Jean-Léon Gérôme – The Slave Market'')]]
[[File:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|Barefooted slaves in North America, 1780s]]

Since ancient times, it is a common practice in civil societies to wear footwear as a standard feature. In contrast to this convention, ''slave codes'' often decreed that slaves go barefoot. For example, the [[Cape Town]] slave code stated that "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes."&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/public_info/P/82884/3/|publisher=westerncape.gov.za|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history, as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot.&lt;ref name="slavery_brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery in Brazil.|url=http://histclo.com/act/work/slave/am/cou/bra/sab-sla.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing]accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To quote Brother Riemer (1779): "[the slaves] are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted." &lt;ref name="living_conditions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living conditions of slaves.|url=http://surinamslavery.blogspot.com/2008/10/chapter-6-living-conditions-of-slaves.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing]accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoes have been regarded as badges of freedom and signs of empowerment since early human history, while going barefoot designated a rather low social rank, often having the status of an unfree person. Using the symbolic meaning of shoes to display a respectable social status and also being vested with authority, people have ceremonially been issued with footwear as is mentioned in the bible "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:22|KJV}})". Forcing individuals to go barefoot by taking away their shoes and disallowing or hindering them to be worn accordingly has the reversed meaning. While since ancient societies the standard form of appearance commonly includes footwear as an implicit feature, the imagery or bare feet is often used to indicate submission, subjugation or dependence, in certain contexts also being disarmed or disempowered. &lt;br&gt;Therefore, this detail has become an informal and sometimes even formal law in societies practicing slavery. A barefooted human could be unmistakably identified as unfree and be attributed with the lowest social status on the spot. As a consequence appearing barefooted in any social situation was proscribed for common citizens and strictly avoided. &lt;br&gt;In many US states this perception is prevalent to this day as everyday shoes are typically also worn in the private space and being barefooted is effectively placed under taboo (see [[Barefoot#Cultural aspects|above]]).

In certain societies this rule pertains to this day where slavery is still unofficially practiced.

In several countries of the world [[prison]] inmates have to remain barefoot under regulatory constraint.
In history this was common practice in most civilizations as bare feet were commonly received as a characteristic of unfree individuals. It also marked the first means of visually marking [[prisoner]]s in terms of a [[prison uniform]].

This is current practice in [[China]],&lt;ref name="www.clearharmony.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearharmony.net/articles/The_Chinese_Prison_System_I_Know-a23068.html|title=The Chinese Prison System I Know|author=A Falun Dafa practitioner in Guangxi Province of China|work=clearharmony.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zimbabwe]],&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meldrum 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/may/12/pressandpublishing.observercampaignpressfreedom|title=My night in Mugabe's stinking jail|author=Andrew Meldrum|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/chatter/zimbabwes-jails-full-human-kindness|title=Zimbabwe's jails: full of human kindness?|work=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]],&lt;ref name="Meldrum 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phaseloop.com/foreignprisoners/case-steve_willcox01.html|title=Foreign Prisoners Support Service|work=phaseloop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/trip-inside-phuket-prison-photo-special/ |title=A Trip Inside Phuket Prison: Photo Special |publisher=Phuket Wan |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208131350/http://phuketwan.com/tourism/trip-inside-phuket-prison-photo-special/ |archive-date=2015-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uganda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatchesinternational.org/?p=66|title=Open Minds, Closed Doors: Prison Education in Uganda|work=DI News|access-date=2014-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084805/http://www.dispatchesinternational.org/?p=66|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/750184/Barefoot-prisoners-bury-Uganda-cult-bodies.html?pg=all|title=Barefoot prisoners bury Uganda cult bodies|date=20 March 2000|work=DeseretNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.byliner.com/robert-j-rosenthal/stories/inside-a-ugandan-prison-a-nightmare-comes-to-life|title=Inside a Ugandan Prison, a Nightmare Comes to Life|last=Rosenthal|first=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert Jon Rosenthal|date=January 1982|website=byliner.com|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007013357/http://byliner.com/robert-j-rosenthal/stories/inside-a-ugandan-prison-a-nightmare-comes-to-life|archivedate=October 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]] it was common practice during the [[Nazism|Nazi-era]] to keep especially female prisoners uniformly barefoot. In particular camps the women also had to perform forced labor in their bare feet, at times even under adverse weather conditions. This was implemented as means to intimidate the detained individuals and dampen renitency as well as to reduce the expenses for clothing items. It was also part of the then prevalent practice in Nazi-Germany to victimize prisoners.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Women of Ravensbrück Concentration Camp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Rochelle G. |last=Saidel |title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbruck Concentration Camp |url=

Within women's penitentiaries in [[socialism|socialist]] [[East Germany]] (German Democratic Republic) especially [[political prisoner]]s who were regarded as opponents of the regime could have their footwear seized and be detained barefoot as an aggravation of their penalty.&lt;ref name="DDR-Gefängnis Hoheneck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/familie/article1924314/Das-Unrecht-verfolgt-mich-bis-an-mein-Lebensende.html|title=DDR-Gefängnis Hoheneck: 'Das Unrecht verfolgt mich – bis an mein Lebensende'  |author=Maggie Riepl|date=10 March 2012|work=Berliner Morgenpost |location= Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earmarking of captives by forcing them to go in bare feet was also practiced specifically on imprisoned women in parts of the United States until the early 20th century. It was then common practice by penal institutions particularly in [[Texas]] to exclude female prisoners from being issued with any kind of footwear, by this means keeping them barefoot throughout. Contrary to this measure adequate shoes were provided for male convicts as a matter of course. There were no apparent security motives for this unequal treatment; it was however practiced to point out the evident [[hierarchy]] between male and female detainees. The according structure of subordination of the female prisoners also towards the male convicts was therefore showcased in an evident and palpable way. It also conformed to the notion of the criminal courts, who widely saw prisoners as official slaves of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/prisons-and-prisoners-rights/prisoners-rights|title=Prisoners' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522040456/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/prisons-and-prisoners-rights/prisoners-rights|archive-date=2016-05-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this an [[analogy]] to actual former slaves was drawn, who were often forced to remain barefoot as well (see above). As going shoeless is placed under a more or less strict social taboo in most regions of the US (see above), being forced to go entirely barefoot determined the degradation to the lowest social rank for the incarcerated women. This arbitrary and victimizing measure was an apparent token for the general [[discrimination]] against incarcerated women, who unlike male prisoners did not have the right to claim legal remedies at that time.&lt;ref name="Gendered Justice in the American West: Women Prisoners in Men's Penitentiaries"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anne M. |last=Butler |title=Gendered Justice in the American West: Women Prisoners in Men's Penitentiaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4IdxKAdM8cC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women in Prison: A Reference Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |title= Women in Prison: A Reference Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpSjVQ0u9zwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women in the American West"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gordon Moris Bakken |author2=Brenda Farrington |title=Encyclopedia of Women in the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9zIeyugktEC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present ISIS usually deprives their captives of footwear, presumably in order to identify them more readily and prevent escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestgore.com/execution/isis-video-truckloads-men-lead-to-slaughter-execution/|title=ISIS removes shoes of captives|work=smh.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bible there are multiple passages stating that a potent way to inflict humiliation on another human being lies in taking away his or her shoes and forcing the individual to go barefoot. Ritual customs therefore consisted of publicly taking away a disgraced person's shoes. This resulted in the individual being defamed as a "barefooter" culminating in the loss of social standing. On the other hand, taking off the shoes of one's own will and voluntarily exposing one's bare feet is regarded as a token of submission and humility by the bible. This included the subjection under higher powers as well as a mundane authority. Therefore, it was concluded to be imperative that prisoners or captives were to be kept barefoot and in light clothing as a token of their subjugation.&lt;ref name="Biblical studies"/&gt;

===Inquisition and witch trials===
During the era of the Catholic [[Inquisition]] it was commonly believed that women practicing [[witchcraft]] had their ability to use sinister powers largely diminished if they were forced to remain barefoot. As a consequence first of all the just arrested woman routinely had her footwear taken away, ensuring that her feet remained unclothed at all events. Due to interpretations of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' it was believed that in case a witch was not strictly kept in her bare feet she could still cast a spell on people by just looking at them. As the prosecutors wanted to avoid any risk, it was seen to it that the bare feet of the accused woman were constantly visible, so to convince themselves at any moment.

During questioning or in court the accused women often had to stand on a consecrated spot with the soles of their bare feet touching the sanctified area. This was believed to completely inhibit any of their purported magic powers. Accordingly, the women were forbidden to look at the prosecutors when their bare feet were not strictly in place. To further ensure safety they were often lead in walking backwards when facing the prosecution. They were allowed to turn around only if their bare feet could clearly be seen to be within the bounded spot.
As the accused women naturally could not use any magic while they were tried, this assumption became an accepted doctrine.
Accordingly, contemporary depictions about inquisition proceedings or similar situations portray the tried women barefooted in almost every case.&lt;ref name=Memminger&gt;''Das verhexte Kloster: Nach den Akten dargestellt'' (trans. ''The bewitched cloister: portrayed according to official records'') by [[Anton Memminger]], published 1904. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporal punishment==
[[File:Foot whipping.JPG|thumb|Demonstration of "bastinado"]]
The [[Sole (foot)|soles]] of a person's bare feet also serve as a target for [[corporal punishment]], commonly referred to as "bastinado" ([[foot whipping]]). This method is mainly used in the context of penal functions and situations of detention or incarceration.

The practice of foot whipping is still officially employed in several [[Middle East]]ern nations where the term ''falaka'' is customary. In history, bastinado was frequently practiced in Western countries as well. Among others, it was commonly used in [[Germany|German]] territories, where it was employed until the end of the [[Nazism|Nazi-era]], mainly within the [[reformatory]] and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] system. In certain facilities it even continued to be used during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="kurier.at"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimmersdorf: 270 Schläge auf die Fußsohlen|url=http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/wimmersdorf-270-schlaege-auf-die-fusssohlen/30.980.261|work=kurier.at| accessdate=2014-03-03|trans-title=Wimmersdorf: 270 blows on the soles of the feet|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Berichte_ueber_Folter_in_Kinder-Heim_auf_der_Hohen_Warte-Schwere_Vorwuerfe-Story-316489|title=Berichte über Folter in Kinder-Heim auf der Hohen Warte|work=krone.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rejali&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' von Darius Rejali.

The beatings usually aim at the muscular tissue within the vaults of the foot ([[longitudinal arch of the foot]]), omitting the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are highly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of [[nerve|nerve endings]].

As bastinado causes substantial suffering for the victim while [[physical evidence]] remains largely undetectable after some time, it is frequently used for [[interrogation]] and [[torture]] in rogue regimes as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' by Darius Rejali. pp. 275f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and entertainment==
Many singers and dancers perform on stage barefoot. The classical dance of [[Cambodia]] had its roots in the holy dances of the legendary seductresses (''[[apsaras]]'') of ancient Cambodia and attained its high point during the [[Angkor]] period in its interpretations of the Indian epics, especially the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Cambodian dancers were well-born women of the king's harem and danced barefoot, with the feet turned outwards and the legs slightly bent at the knee to cushion the movements of the upper body. The unimpeded movement of the foot was essential to the art. When the land was invaded by the Thai, the dancers were taken to the Thai court, where their art was adapted and continued to flourish.&lt;ref name="Cambodian_Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Colet, John|author2=Joshua Eliot|author3=Abigail Vertigan |year=2002 |title=Cambodian Handbook |publisher=Footprint |isbn=1-903471-40-0 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3nVUxKL29ZwC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambodia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Ian |year=2000 |title=Cambodia |publisher=Oxfam GB |isbn=0-85598-430-9 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bK11j2IdbC0C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barefoot dance movement of the early 20th century challenged the received laws of classical dance and the broader laws of social decorum. For decades, the bare foot had been perceived as obscene, and no matter how determined barefoot dancers were to validate their art with reference to spiritual, artistic, historic, and organic concepts, barefoot dancing was inextricably linked in the public mind with indecency and sexual taboo. In 1908, [[Maud Allan]] shocked and fascinated London theatre-goers with her barefoot dance of desire in ''Salome'', and scandalous tributes positioned her as the embodiment of lust. For many, barefoot dancing represented not only the freedom and horror of modern sexuality but the progress and decline of high culture.&lt;ref name="Benstock"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Benstock, Shari |editor2=Ferriss, Suzanne |year=2001 |title=Footnotes: On Shoes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0-8135-2870-4 |pages=276–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tUK8BP7OOJQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Footnotes:+On+Shoes&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isadora Duncan (grayscale).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] performing barefoot during her 1915–18 American tour]]
[[California]]n [[Isadora Duncan]] revolutionized dance in the Western world by jettisoning the [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] and the [[pointe shoe]] of classical [[ballet]] and scandalized audiences by performing works of her own choreography in flowing draperies and bare feet. She anticipated the modern [[women's liberation movement]] by urging women to rid themselves of corsets and matrimony.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{cite book |author=Needham, Maureen |year=2002 |title=I See America Dancing: Selected Readings, 1685–2000 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-06999-4|page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=powGjotbu9kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=I+See+America+Dancing:+Selected+Readings,+1685-2000&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan divorced the bare foot from perceptions of obscenity and made a conscious effort to link barefoot dancing to ideals such as "nudity, childhood, the idyllic past, flowing lines, health, nobility, ease, freedom, simplicity, order, and harmony". She believed her utopian dance vision and program would ameliorate the perceived ills of modern life and restore the world to the imagined perfection of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="Benstock" /&gt;

The 1954 film ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' tells the fictional story of Maria Vargas (portrayed by [[Ava Gardner]]), a Spanish [[cabaret]] dancer of simple origins who frequently went barefoot. She was cast in a movie by writer and director Harry Dawes (portrayed by [[Humphrey Bogart]]) and became a major star. In 1978, [[Ina Garten]] purchased a specialty food store in [[The Hamptons]] named ''[[Barefoot Contessa]]'', after the movie. She liked the name because it went well with her simple and elegant cooking style. She sold the store in 1999 and wrote her first book, ''The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'', which became one of the best-selling cookbooks of the year. She would go on to write more cookbooks and, in 2002, started production of a television show on the [[Food Network]], also named the ''Barefoot Contessa'', which continues to run.&lt;ref name="Ina_Garten"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ina Garten (biography)|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html|publisher=[[Food Network]]|accessdate=July 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630134851/http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, many singers, primarily females, have performed barefoot, a trend that continues in the early 21st century. One of the first singers to become well known for singing barefoot on stage was [[Sandie Shaw]], who became known as the "Barefoot Pop Princess of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="Roberts_David"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=David|title=British Hit Singles &amp; Albums|edition=19th|year=2006|location=London|publisher= Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=495|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5fZvPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn=1904994105&amp;cd=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Buffett]] is known for performing barefoot at concerts, promoting an island/beach bum lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Carter_Lauren"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter |first=Lauren |title=Jimmy Buffett a god to lei persons |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/general/view/20100619jimmy_buffett_a_god_to_lei_persons/srvc=home&amp;position=also |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627125640/http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/general/view/20100619jimmy_buffett_a_god_to_lei_persons/srvc%3Dhome%26position%3Dalso |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |newspaper=[[Boston Herald|The Edge]] |date=June 19, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesária Évora]] of [[Cape Verde]] was known as the "Barefoot Diva" for her habit of performing without shoes.&lt;ref name="Barefoot_Diva"&gt;{{cite news|title=French honour for 'barefoot diva' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7879515.stm|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performers known for performing barefoot onstage or in music videos include [[Ian Gillan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/interviews/Deep-Purple-interview/|title=Deep Purple: On the chairlift with...|last=English|first=Neil|date=2016-02-04|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Patti LaBelle]],&lt;ref name="Brescia_Joe" /&gt; [[Joss Stone]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Shakira]],&lt;ref name="Shakira"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shakira's barefoot stage demands|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1253048.php/Shakira_s_barefoot_stage_demands|accessdate=July 10, 2010|newspaper=[[Monsters and Critics]]|date=January 29, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100724153854/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1253048.php/Shakira_s_barefoot_stage_demands| archivedate= 24 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Wilson]], [[Björk]]&lt;ref name="Brescia_Joe" /&gt;, [[Katharine McPhee]], [[Sophie B.

There are risks and benefits associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides some protection from puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns as well as abrasions, bruises, heat burns, electrical shock, and [[frostbite]]—but studies of people who habitually walk barefoot have consistently found that these problems are minimal, with only about 0.89% of barefoot people having any kind of foot complaint linked to walking barefoot (including temporary conditions such as abrasions) or having the tops of the feet uncovered.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Feet that have never worn shoes rarely exhibit problems such as bunions, corns, and "[[Flat feet|fallen arches]]",&lt;ref name="2300 children"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao UB, Joseph B |title=The influence of footwear on the prevalence of flat foot.

Walking barefoot results in a more natural gait. People who are used to walking barefoot tend to land less forcefully, eliminating the hard heel strike and generating much less collision force in the foot and lower leg.&lt;ref name="NYmag"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sternbergh |first=Adam |title=You Walk Wrong. |url=http://nymag.com/health/features/46213/ |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |newspaper=New York Magazine |date=April 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422191147/http://nymag.com/health/features/46213/ |archivedate=April 22, 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study found that shoes may increase stress on the knee and ankle, and suggested that adults who walked barefoot may have a lower rate of [[osteoarthritis]],&lt;ref name="ShakoorN"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shakoor N, Block JA |title=Walking barefoot decreases loading on the lower extremity joints in knee osteoarthritis |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=2923–27 |year=2006 |pmid=16947448 |doi=10.1002/art.22123 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; although more study is required to elucidate the factors that distribute loads in shod and barefoot walking. A 2007 study examined 180 modern humans and compared their feet with 2,000-year-old skeletons. They concluded that, before the invention of shoes, humans overall had healthier feet.&lt;ref name="NYmag"/&gt; A 1991 study found that children who wore shoes were three times more likely to have [[flat feet]] than those who did not, and suggested that wearing shoes in early childhood can be detrimental to the longitudinal arch of the foot.&lt;ref name="2300 children" /&gt; Children who habitually go barefoot were found to have stronger feet, with better flexibility and mobility, fewer deformities like flat feet or toes that curve inwards, and fewer complaints.&lt;ref name="Angier_Natalie"&gt;{{cite news|last=Angier|first=Natalie|title=Which Shoes Are Best For Children?

Since there is no artificial protection of the bare foot, some of the possible issues include cuts, abrasions, bruises, or puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns, as well as poisonous plants, animals, or [[parasite]]s that can enter the body through the cuts on an injured bare foot.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staheli LT |title=Shoes for children: a review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=371–75 |year=1991 |pmid=1861942 |doi= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people who are not habitually barefoot, [[Athlete's foot]] is spread by fungal spores coming into contact with skin that has been weakened and made moist. The fungus is known to only affect around 0.75% of habitually barefoot people in one study and can be prevented by reducing shoe use and keeping the feet dry, particularly after walking through a damp environment where people communally walk barefoot as the fungus only develops under the right conditions, such as when people fail to properly dry their feet after swimming or showering and then put on shoes. Wearing shoes such as flip flops or sandals in these areas can reduce the risk.&lt;ref name="athletes_foot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=Patricia|title=Athlete's Foot|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/health_problems/skin/athletes_foot.html|publisher=kidshealth.org|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the fungus is very unlikely to develop on a person who goes barefoot all the time.

The [[hookworm]] parasite, found only in warm, moist climates where human [[feces]] contaminated with hookworm larvae has been left in places where it might come into contact with human skin, can burrow through a bare human foot (or any part of the body that comes into contact with it).&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm |title=Hookworm Infection |date=September 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000301095412/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm |archivedate=March 1, 2000 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the parasite tends to occur mainly in mud and cesspools, its spread cannot be stopped by most standard shoes{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} since the larvae can penetrate fabric and small holes. The parasite may spread through contaminated material coming into contact with any part of the body, such as through flecks of mud splashing on an ankle or leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trop|first=Am J|title=Penetration by Infective Hookworm Larvae of the Materials Used in the Manufacture of Shoes|url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/s1-9/1/79.citation|accessdate=26 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hookworm]] parasite is relatively mild, has few symptoms, and can pass completely unnoticed when the infestation level is low enough. Since the hookworm infection is very cheap and easy to treat, and since it requires infected feces to come into contact with human skin within a particular time period, eradicating hookworm is mainly a matter of hygiene (including the building of proper toilet and waste-disposal facilities) and mass-treatment. In very cold weather, shoes can provide thermal insulation, protecting against [[frostbite]].

Issues that can develop as a result of someone who has always worn shoes going barefoot include calf pain or [[Achilles tendinitis]] or [[plantar fasciitis]] due to shortening of the Achilles tendon and the foot being underdeveloped, due to regular use of shoes. A careful transition ease or remove symptoms, which quickly vanish as the foot adapts.&lt;ref name="Quinn_Elizabeth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Elizabeth|title=Barefoot Running – The Pros and Cons of Going Shoeless|url=http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/runningworkouts/a/Barefoot-Running.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Howell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Daniel|title=The Barefoot Book|year=2010|publisher=Hunter House|isbn= 978-1630266639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blisters on the feet may occur in the first few weeks of going barefoot, until the skin has become more robust.&lt;ref name="Quinn_Elizabeth"/&gt; Individuals with [[diabetes]] or other conditions that affect sensation in the feet are at greater risk of injury while barefoot.

== Laws ==
In the United States, there have been myths that regulations require the wearing of footwear. In the United States, during the period of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement of the 1960s]], business establishments would deny admittance to barefoot [[hippie]]s arguing that health regulations required that shoes be worn.&lt;ref name="MillerJoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/1088537.html |title=Going barefoot |last=Miller |first=Joe |date=May 29, 2008 |work=[[The News and Observer]] |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602011040/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/1088537.html |archivedate=June 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a belief by many in nonexistent [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] or local health department regulations preventing people from going to stores, restaurants, and other establishments without shoes. However, those regulations that exist apply only to employees and not customers.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barefooters.org/osha.html |title=Bare Feet and OSHA |date=January 7, 2006 |publisher=barefooters.org |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524040917/http://barefooters.org/osha.html |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] requires employers to "ensure that each affected employee uses protective footwear" when there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling or rolling objects, objects piercing the sole of an employee's foot, and where an employee's feet may be exposed to electrical hazards.&lt;ref name="Chow_Andrew"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chow |first=Andrew |title=Is Going Barefoot at Work a Step Too Far? |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/02/tagblogsfindlawcom2012-freeenterprise-idUS286283164820120502 |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=May 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508074700/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/02/tagblogsfindlawcom2012-freeenterprise-idUS286283164820120502 |archivedate=May 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, employee footwear, where required by OSHA, must comply with one of the standards described in OSHA's regulations.&lt;ref name="Chow_Andrew"/&gt; State and local laws may dictate when and where an employee must wear shoes.&lt;ref name="Chow_Andrew"/&gt;

==Sports and recreation==
[[File:Blue leggings.jpg|thumb|right|A woman sitting in a library with her bare feet on a chair.]]
There are several recreational activities one can participate in while barefoot. Those involved in [[water sports]] such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[water polo]] almost always participate barefoot due to the difficulty of swimming with footwear.

Other common activities performed barefoot include yoga, pilates, [[hiking]], running, driving, water skiing, [[touch rugby]], [[soccer]], [[beach volleyball]], [[surfing]], [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]], [[gymnastics]], [[Slacklining]], and [[martial arts]]. [[Wrestling]] can be done barefoot. Although most modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestlers wear shoes, [[sumo wrestling]], [[Yağlı güreş]] (oil or "Turkish" wrestling), and [[mud wrestling]] are commonly done while barefoot. [[Fiji]]an wrestler [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka]] of the WWE has wrestled barefoot as well.&lt;ref name="Traina_Jimmy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Traina |first=Jimmy |title=Favorite Wrestlers of All Time |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/scorecard/jimmys_blog/2006/06/favorite-wrestlers-of-all-time.html |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=June 12, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407185431/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/scorecard/jimmys_blog/2006/06/favorite-wrestlers-of-all-time.html |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American football]] is not traditionally a barefoot sport, though several [[placekicker]]s have preferred to kick barefoot, including [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Rich Karlis]] of the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref name="Gehman_Jim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gehman|first=Jim|title=Where Are They Now: PK Tony Franklin|url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12521|accessdate=June 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Eagles]]|date=May 5, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100619135621/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12521| archivedate= 19 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss_Irv"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Irv|title=Karlis a standout as barefoot kicker|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_11559948?source=bb|accessdate=June 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools of thought involved in barefoot placekicking were that the lack of a shoe provided the kicker with a better "feel" for the ball and greater control over its trajectory.

===Hiking===
People of all ages all over the world can participate in barefoot hiking, gathering for walks through forest and hiking trails sans footwear. Barefoot hikers claim that they feel a sense of communion with the earth and enjoy the sheer pleasure of feeling more of the world with their feet.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Todras-Whitehill|first=Ethan|title=Footloose and Boot Free: Barefoot Hiking.|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/travel/escapes/22hike.html|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several clubs throughout North America practicing regular barefoot hikes, including the Barefoot Hikers of Minnesota, Seattle Barefoot Hikers, East Bay Barefoot Hikers, the Barefoot Hikers and Grass Walkers of Greater Kansas City, and the Barefoot Hikers of Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LADailyNews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauly |first=Brett |title=Sole Survivors: New shoeless joes are hitting dusty trails around San Francisco Bay and beyond. |url=http://barefooters.org/hikers/publicity/la_daily_news.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961029205731/http://www.barefooters.org/hikers/publicity/la_daily_news.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 29, 1996 |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |date=March 21, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barefoot Hiking Groups|url=http://www.barefoothub.com/barefoot-hiking-groups/|website=The Barefoot Hub|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European nations, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, there are barefoot parks or walks.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barefoot_walk 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Wena Alun|title=Challenge senses on barefoot walk. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/7955356.stm|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barfuss_park"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Barefoot Parks in Europe.|url=http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm|publisher=barfusspark.info|accessdate=June 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100605081950/http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm| archivedate= 5 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parks are kept clean and maintained on a regular basis, so that barefoot hiking can be done in an environment suitable for people who are habitually shod. Barefoot parks usually include a lot of adventure stations, allowing visitors to experience the feeling of soil textures underfoot; to wade through rivers, mud, brooks, or ponds; and to exercise [[foot gymnastics]], [[Equilibrioception|balancing]], and climbing. The ''Barfußpfad'' (barefoot trail) at Bad Sobernheim in Germany attracts over 100,000 visitors annually and has seen approximately 1 million visitors since its inception in 1999.&lt;ref name="BadSobernheim"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast eine Million Menschen.|url=http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/region/bad-kreuznach-bad-sobernheim-kirn/vg-bad-sobernheim/sobernheim/7927509.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=Allgemeine Beitung |date=November 25, 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was first developed in the 19th century by [[Sebastian Kneipp]], one of the founders of the [[Naturopathy|Naturopathic medicine]] movement. He believed that applying your feet to a range of natural stimuli would have therapeutic benefits. This is related to the ancient practice of [[reflexology]], practiced in China for thousands of years for relaxation and to promote longevity.&lt;ref name="Wignall_Alice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wignall|first=Alice|title=Get your socks off|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/25/healthandwellbeing.walkingholidays|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Running===

Many leisure and competitive runners have been known to run barefoot, including well-known athletes [[Zola Budd]] of South Africa and [[Abebe Bikila]] of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Warburton_Michael"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warburton|first=Michael |title=Barefoot Running |journal=Sportscience|date=Sep–Dec 2001|volume=5|issue=3 |url=http://sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm|accessdate=June 27, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722064341/http://www.sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm| archivedate= 22 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Ragsdale, of [[Talent, Oregon]], set the world record (pending confirmation by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'') for the longest distance run barefoot on June 5, 2010, as part of the [[Relay for Life]] fundraiser for the [[American Cancer Society]]. He logged {{convert|102|mi|km}}, or 413 laps on the South Medford High School track, barefoot.&lt;ref name="Burke_Anita"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burke |first=Anita |title=Todd Ragsdale endures The agony of the feet |url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100608/NEWS/6080317/-1/NEWSMAP |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |newspaper=[[Mail Tribune]] |date=June 8, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610195008/http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100608%2FNEWS%2F6080317%2F-1%2FNEWSMAP |archivedate=10 June 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fastest person to run 100 meters (325&amp;nbsp;feet) on [[ice]] while barefoot is Nico Surings of [[Eindhoven]], Netherlands, who ran that distance in 17.35 seconds on December 8, 2006.&lt;ref name="fastest_barefoot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fastest run 100 metres barefoot on ice|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/amazing_feats/unusual_skills/Fastest_run_100_metres_barefoot_on_ice.aspx|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory studies suggest that, due to the lack of extra weight on the feet, the energy cost of running barefoot is reduced by 4%, resulting in lower [[oxygen]] consumption.&lt;ref name="Warburton_Michael"/&gt; There is evidence that wearing traditional shoes while running leads to heel strike [[Gait (human)|gait]] that, in turn, leads to higher impact as well as a greater risk of injury.&lt;ref name="Lieberman_DE"/&gt; Barefoot running encourages the runner to switch to forefoot strike and may reduce the risk of knee damage.

Barefoot running can be dangerous, especially to runners who do not adequately prepare or give their feet time to adapt to the new style. Many injuries are possible, such as injuries to the [[Achilles tendon]] or [[plantar fascia]], or [[stress fracture]]s in the [[metatarsal]] bones or lower leg. Barefoot runners who do not prepare their bodies could provide, "a stimulus plan for podiatrists, orthopedists, and physical therapists."&lt;ref name="Carey_Art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey |first=Art |title=Well Being: Running barefoot has not-so-obvious hazards |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100628_Well_Being__Running_barefoot_has_not-so-obvious_hazards.html |accessdate=July 2, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=June 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100702011452/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100628_Well_Being__Running_barefoot_has_not-so-obvious_hazards.html| archivedate= 2 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position on barefoot running by the [[American Podiatric Medical Association]] states that there is not enough research on the immediate- and long-term benefits of the practice and that individuals should consult a podiatrist with a strong background in sports medicine to make an informed decision on all aspects of their running and training programs.&lt;ref name="APMA_statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=APMA Position Statement on Barefoot Running|url=http://www.apma.org/Media/position.cfm?ItemNumber=995|publisher=[[American Podiatric Medical Association]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative to barefoot running is to wear thin-soled shoes with minimal padding, such as [[moccasin]]s, [[plimsolls]], or [[huarache (running shoe)|huaraches]], which result in similar gait to going barefoot but protect the skin and keep dirt and water off.&lt;ref name="Hersher_Rebecca"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Perfect Landing. |url=http://alumni.harvard.edu/stories/perfect-landing |accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[Harvard University]]|date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear to maintain optimum flexibility while providing a minimum amount of protection.

[[File:Jaco pastorius 87.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jaco Pastorius]] (1951–1987) was an influential American [[jazz]] bassist, composer and big band leader. He is best known for his work with [[Weather Report]] from 1976 to 1981, as well as work with artists including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Pat Metheny]], and his own solo projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/jaco-pastorius-is-the-most-important-musician-youve-never-heard-of|title=Jaco Pastorius Is the Most Important Musician You Might Have Never Heard Of|author=|date=6 March 2015|website=vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''bassist''' or '''bass player''', is a musician who plays a [[Bass (instrument)|bass instrument]] such as a [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[keyboard bass]] or a low brass instrument such as a [[tuba]] or [[sousaphone]]. Different [[musical genre]]s tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for [[funk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/20342-on-bass-what-the-funk|title=On Bass: What the Funk?|author=|date=|website=premierguitar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R&amp;B]], soul music, [[rock and roll]], [[reggae]], [[jazz fusion]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Country music|country]] and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for [[European classical music|classical music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[rockabilly]], and most genres of [[jazz]]. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in [[Dixieland]] and New Orleans-style jazz bands.

Despite the associations of different bass instruments with certain genres, there are exceptions. Some 1990s and 2000s rock and pop bands use a double bass, such as both [[Andrew Jackson Jihad]], [[Barenaked Ladies]]; [[Indie rock|Indie]] band [[The Decemberists]] and [[punk rock]], [[psychobilly]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artofslapbass.com/artofslapbass/index.php?...3{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; groups such as [[The Living End]], [[Nekromantix]], [[The Horrorpops]] and [[Tiger Army]]. Some fusion jazz groups use a lightweight, stripped-down [[electric upright bass]] rather than a double bass. Some composers of modern art music use the electric bass in a [[chamber music]] setting. Some jazz big bands use electric bass. Some funk, R&amp;B and jazz, fusion groups use [[synth bass]] or keyboard bass rather than electric bass. Bootsy Collins and Stevie Wonder used synth bass. Some Dixieland bands use double bass or electric bass instead of a tuba. In some jazz groups and [[jam band]]s, the basslines are played by a [[Hammond organ]] player, who uses the bass [[pedal keyboard]] or the lower manual for the low notes.

Electric bassists play the [[bass guitar]]. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the [[bass line]] outlines the [[Chord progression|harmony]] of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types of song (e.g. blues ballad, fast swing, etc.). Bass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of each [[chord (music)|chord]] being used in a given song. In addition, [[pedal point|pedal tones]] (repeated or sustained single notes), [[ostinato]]s, and bass [[riff]]s are also used as bass lines. While most electric bass players rarely play [[Chord (music)|chord]]s (three or more notes all sounded at the same time), chords are used in some styles, especially [[funk]], [[R&amp;B]], soul music, [[jazz]], [[Latin]] and [[heavy metal music]].

A short list of notable bassists includes:

'''Bill Henson''' (born 7 October 1955)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/artist/2363 NGV]. Retrieved 8 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Australian]] contemporary art photographer.

==Art==
Henson has exhibited nationally and internationally in galleries such as the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York, the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne, Australia, the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney, Australia and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris. His current practice involves holding one exhibition in Australia every two years, and up to three overseas exhibitions each year.

The use of [[chiaroscuro]]&lt;ref&gt;"What becomes apparent when you see Henson’s work in person is the importance of the almost pitch-black darkness that, in whatever formal context he has devised over the years, always cloaks his forlorn, defiantly unneedy subjects, giving their run-down urban environments the look of remote desert outposts. It’s a black that seems both to be caked on the surface of the photographs, like tar or centuries of soot, and to recede infinitely into the background. It looks as solid as lead, a physical threat to the teens it blankets, and at the same time it’s as if the blackness were exuded by their bodies, forming a kind of paranormal manifestation of some feeling too intense and guarded to register in any other fashion. In its own peculiar way Henson’s black is as unique an achievement as, say, Robert Ryman’s white." Dennis Cooper (2002) The Photography of Bill Henson: Naked Youth, ''Artforum International'', No. 6, p.94-97&lt;/ref&gt; is common throughout his works, through underexposure and adjustment in printing. His photographs' use of [[bokeh]] is intended to give them a [[painterly]] atmosphere. The work is often presented as [[diptych]]s, [[triptych]]s and in other groupings, and the exhibitions are specifically curated by Henson to reflect a sense of musicality.&lt;ref&gt;"As the new Biss recording of Mozart's K364 ''Sinfonia Concertante'', the ''Andante'' movement only, repeats itself endlessly on my stereo, the sound of Richard Tognetti and the ACO orchestra at their absolute greatest washes over me like a tsunami, while my head is also spinning with the staggering beauty of a single gesture made by a woman riding the escalator at the Westfield Doncaster shopping centre, and with just how Tognetti's violin sounds like she looked. Well, there you have it. I call it millennial slippage. You might call it madness..." Henson in interview with Amanda Smith, Artworks Broadcast:Sunday 15 August 2010 11:05AM, Australian Broadcasting Commission transcript, http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/artworks/artworks-feature-bill-henson/3020240 Downloaded 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capon, E., Malouf, D. &amp; Annear, J., in ''Mnemosyne'', Art Gallery of New South Wales, Scalo, (2205) 8-9, 12, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see discussion of the ''Luminous'' concert (2005) performed by the Australian Chamber Orchestra to a screening of Henson imagery in Stevens, Meghan (2009).''Music and Image in Concert''. Australia: Music and Image in Concert&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smee, S., Touch of Innocence, Weekend Australian [newspaper]. 22–23 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duality is a recurring theme of Henson's work, often in combination with adolescent subjects.&lt;ref&gt;"And this sexiness that is there and emphasised is crucial to the austere pessimism of these works. But to see it as the point of the photographs, arraigning Henson as a purveyor of kiddie porn to the elite, is, putting it charitably, to miss the point. It’s like reading him as a centrefold photographer for whom the background is just backdrop. Or thinking the clothed figure in Titian’s ''Allegory of Vice and Virtue'' represents the good girl. What Henson is actually giving us is a series of shattered paysages moralisés, where the innocent sexiness of the bodies is posed against a landscape they are not part of — the majestic, insensible alps (alps that bring to mind the poignancy, which had never struckeme before of Robbe-Grillet’s statement about how Mt Blanc had not been waiting since the Permian Age to be a symbol for Shelley). Henson’s alps appear like a scroll rolled back, to reveal a ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|deus sive natura]]'' it is sentimental to even describe as pitiless. These alps tower over the figures but the environment they are posed in seems just as alien. There is no back to nature primitivism about these figures. They are bruised and wounded and helpless — the flowers about to be consumed in the furnace." John Forbes (1993) 'Bill Henson'.

His works are often in the form of staged tableaux&lt;ref&gt;DARIA, Ioan (2009) The Photographic Treatment of Emotion in Front of a Stage. Bill Henson: The Opera Project.

Burke, Janine and Henson, Bill. Art for the End of the World. ''Meanjin'', Vol. 40, No. 3, Oct 1981: 375-388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson states that he is not interested in a political or sociological agenda.&lt;ref&gt;"I don’t use soap boxes. I don’t have much to say about whether or not people have lost the plot now. No." Henson, Bill &amp; Mirlesse, Sabine (2015) ''Dreamscapes and Sensory Experience: An Interview with Bill Henson By Sabine Mirlesse, June 15, 2015.''

==Life and influences==
Raised in the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Henson studied Visual Arts and Design 1974–1975 at [[Victoria College, Melbourne|Prahran College of Advanced Education]] where [[Athol Shmith]] was head of the Photography program and [[John Cato]] and [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]] were lecturers. He did not complete the diploma, but the nineteen-year-old Henson's work was promoted by Shmith to [[Jennie Boddington]],&lt;ref&gt;"It is remarkable that, so young, his armoury of technical skill is so narrowly focused and accurately directed to serve his needs. He does his own colour processing in his bedroom[...]. He has referred to a ‘certain morbidity’ in his work. Well, that is an element of life too. The young ballerinas seem to be under a spell, in thrall. At one and the same time he is tender artist and tyrant.  The delicacy and control of colour in these shades will excite wonderment and pleasure, where a hint of coral light imbues the lobe of an ear, or minuscule catchlight alights with barest touch on the tip of eyelashes or edges the profiled iris of her eye. At times he teases with only a suggestion of vaporous form, but the presence breathes within the frame. Do we not grieve for mortality when we perceive (for there is a tactile as well as a visual understanding here) the wisp of hair on the nape of her neck? There is something in the order of mystery. Enter the trance." Jennie Boddington (1975), ''Of Tender Years'' Published Photography Gallery room brochure, National Gallery of Victoria. Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;   inaugural Curator of Photography at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]&lt;ref&gt;Boddington, J., Henson, B., (July 1975) exhibition catalogue. Melbourne:National Gallery of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that Henson's first solo show was exhibited there in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Smee, Sebastian. Bill Henson. Art and Australia Vol.42, No.3, Autumn 2005, p. 396 – 405&lt;/ref&gt;

From his period as a student until its closure in 1980, he worked at The Bookshop of Margareta Webber&lt;ref&gt;Henson, Bill, (1980) ''The bookshop of Margareta Webber'' : 1 map ; 46 x 60 cm. (Not drawn to scale). State Library of Victoria collection. Melbourne: Webbers Booksellers http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/7648003&lt;/ref&gt; 343 Little Collins Street Melbourne, which specialised in luxurious books on ballet, dance and the visual arts. Leaving the bookshop, he traveled and photographed in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;'The first city I wanted to see was Dresden.' Henson quoted by Smee, Sebastian. Bill Henson. ''Art and Australia'' Vol.42, No.3, Autumn 2005, p. 396 – 405&lt;/ref&gt; He taught briefly at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]] in Melbourne. Henson's long-term relationship with Luminist Melbourne painter [[Louise Hearman]], whom he met in 1981 at the Victorian College of Arts, has been noted&lt;ref&gt;Coslovich, Gabriella (2008) Seeing in the dark: Louise Hearman remains enthralled by the richness of oil paint.

Hearman won the 2014 [[Doug Moran National Portrait Prize|Moran portrait prize]], Australia's richest at $A150,000, with her double portrait of Bill Henson.&lt;ref&gt;'The co-judge of the prize, former Art Gallery of NSW director Edmund Capon, said Henson and Hearman had lived together for decades.   But Hearman was coy on the subject. "Well, why don’t we just leave that open?" she said.  Capon is a long-term friend of Henson and Hearman, and curated Henson’s 2005 exhibition at the AGNSW.'

==Controversies==

===Images seized===
On 22 May 2008, the opening night of Bill Henson's 2007–2008 exhibition at the [[Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery]] in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], Sydney, was canceled after eight individual complaints were made to Police voicing concerns about an email invitation from the Gallery to a "Private View" that depicted photographs of a nude 13-year-old girl. [[Hetty Johnston]], a [[child protection]] advocate also lodged a complaint with the New South Wales police.&lt;ref name="Tovey"&gt;{{cite news | last = Tovey | first = Josephine |author2=Kennedy, Les |author3=Welch, Dylan | date = 24 May 2008| title = Art obscenity charges | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/henson-finds-support-over-photos/2008/05/23/1211183097197.html | accessdate = 2008-05-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080713043449/http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/henson-finds-support-over-photos/2008/05/23/1211183097197.html| archivedate= 13 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery: Nude children exhibit shut |work=[[News.com.au]] |url=http://www.news.com.au/gallery/0,22056,5031912-5010140,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525213842/http://www.news.com.au/gallery/0%2C22056%2C5031912-5010140%2C00.html |archivedate=25 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the same day a ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' columnist, [[Miranda Devine]], had also written a scathing article in response to viewing the email invitation,&lt;ref name="Devine"&gt;{{cite news | last = Devine | first = Miranda | date = 22 May 2008 | title = Moral backlash over sexing up of our children | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/21/1211182891875.html?page=3 | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which precipitated heated talk-back and media discussion throughout the day. In the process of removing the images from the Gallery, Police found more photographs of naked children on exhibition among various [[large format]] photographs of nonfigurative subjects, which they later sought to examine for the purposes of determining their legal status under the NSW Crimes Act and child protection legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/resources/legislation/legislation.html |title=Australian child protection legislation- National Child Protection Clearinghouse |accessdate=2009-07-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711023525/http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/resources/legislation/legislation.html |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df=dmy }}. aifs.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Following discussions with the Gallery and a decision by Henson, the Gallery canceled the opening and postponed the show.&lt;ref&gt;Roslyn Oxley Gallery, 'Media Statement', 23/5/08&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 23 May that a number of the images in the exhibition had been seized by police local Area Commander Alan Sicard, with the intention of charging Bill Henson, the Gallery, or both with "publishing an indecent article" under the Crimes Act.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kennedy | first = Les | date = 23 May 2008| title = Henson show charges | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/henson-show-charges/2008/05/23/1211183060208.html | accessdate = 2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seized images were also removed from the Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery website, where the remainder of the series can now be viewed online.&lt;ref name="roslynoxley9"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bill Henson, 2008 | work = Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery | url = http://www.roslynoxley9.com.au/artists/18/Bill_Henson/1098/ | accessdate = 2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation provoked a national debate on censorship. In a televised interview, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that he found the images "absolutely revolting"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/23/1211183044543.html Rudd revolted – Arts – Entertainment]. smh.com.au (2008-05-23).

On 5 June 2008 the former director of the National Gallery of Australia, Betty Churcher, said it was "not surprising" that the New South Wales Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP) would announce its official recommendation that no charges be laid regarding the Sydney Roslyn Oxley9 gallery's collection of photographs by artist Bill Henson. Ms Churcher said it would have been ridiculous to drag the case through the courts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.news.yahoo.com/080606/21/175vw.html 'Not surprising' no charges laid over NGA Henson collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610145101/http://au.news.yahoo.com/080606/21/175vw.html |date=10 June 2008 }} Retrieved on 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.news.yahoo.com/080606/21/1761j.html No case against Henson: prosecutors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609050237/http://au.news.yahoo.com/080606/21/1761j.html |date=9 June 2008 }} Retrieved on 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|''I'm very pleased that the public prosecutor has decided that it's likely to end the debacle because they always do, as soon as you take art into court it never works ...

On 6 June 2008 it was reported in ''[[The Age]]'' that police would not prosecute Bill Henson over his photographs of naked teenagers, after they were declared "mild and justified" and given a PG rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/no-charges-for-henson-20080606-2mnv.html No charges for Henson]. theage.com.au (2008-06-06)&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Australian Classification Board]], suggesting viewing by children under the age of 16 is suitable with parental guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/no-charges-for-henson-20080606-2mnv.html 'No charges for Henson] Retrieved on 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian scholar [[Niall Lucy]] criticized Devine's response to Henson's art in his 2010 book ''Pomo Oz: Fear and Loathing Down Under''.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Lucy, ''Pomo Oz: Fear and Loathing Downunder'' (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]]'s book about the 2008 incident ''The Henson case'' was listed for the 2009 [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]] and the 2009 [[Prime Minister's Literary Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=The Henson case|year=2008|publisher=Text Publishing|location=Melbourne, Victoria|isbn=978-1-921520-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building typology''' refers to the study and documentation of a set of buildings which have similarities in their type of function or form. There are two ways of looking at the term "building typology". The first is a functional typology that categorizes buildings into groups by the similarity of their use.  A functional building typology under this definition may create groups such as hospitals, schools, and shopping centers (see more examples in the [[list of building types]] by use). The second is a typology that groups buildings according to their forms, which is explained is this article. Formal building typology may be based on configuration, format, or relationships of building to streets and each other. Any single functional type can be subdivided into formal types. For example, the residential functional type may be further subdivided into formal categories such as high rise towers, single family homes, duplexes, and townhouses. The townhouse building is one formal type that has a specific configuration: single units are placed side-by-side with others, vertically oriented up to four stories tall, and facing the street. Many more variations of this formal type are found around the world, each with variations that are the result of local materials, cultural habits, age and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Urban Housing Handbook|last=Firley|first=Eric|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chichester, UK|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documenting a type is the process of discovering the elements of similar forms which are the same. Usually building types are distinguished by their basic form, site configuration, and scale, but not their specific architectural style, color, or even precise use.and are related to the era, the culture, and the environment in which they arise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architectural Composition and Building Typology|last=Cannigia|first=Gianfranco|last2=Maffei|first2=Gianluigi|publisher=Alinea|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Urban Form: Typology for planners and architects|last=Scheer|first=Brenda|publisher=APA Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of autonomous building types arose in part from the general Enlightenment notion of categorization, a prelude to scientific discovery. At first types were intended as ideal models, which could be variously copied. In this sense types were commonly used forms (a [[basilica]], for example), that were adapted over time in new buildings with quite different uses:  from [[Roman Forum|Roman fora]] to early church forms ([[St. Peter's Basilica]]), to 19th century train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of the City|last=Rossi|first=Aldo|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that these forms are very similar and are derived from each other is an important way of understanding typology:  types are evolved over time and therefor can convey a sense of history or cultural continuity. The idea of building types as formal configurations was enhanced by [[J.N.L. Durand]], who developed two important works, the ''Parallele (1799)'', a huge, handsome book that reproduced plans, elevations and sections of historic buildings at the same scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recueil et paralle des edifices de tout genre anciens et modern|last=Durand|first=Jean-Nicolas-Louis|publisher=Gille|year=1799|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He categorized them by formal types, so that their basic similarities could be recognized. Following this work, Durand also created a second book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Precise of the lectures on architecture, with graphic portion|last=Durand|first=J.N.L|publisher=|year=1802|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manipulated and reconfigured the classical elements of architecture—columns, walls, etc. in order to adapt them to new, emerging uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=J.N.L. Durand (1760-1834): Art and science of architecture|last=Villari|first=Sergio|publisher=Rizzoli International|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durand's system, a language of architecture, demonstrated one essential characteristic of types: a way of designing that was neither entirely free of constraint nor overly prescribed.

==Documenting a building type==

Most buildings of any city can be recognized as belonging to a building type. In the US, for example, several residential types exist, such as garden apartments, townhouses, and high rise housing. Each of these may have many subtypes: even within one part of a city there may appear two or three predominant residential types such as a small post-WWII house or a strongly horizontal ranch house.  Anyone can begin to identify types simply by observing the common buildings in a place. Architectural and urban designers document types more thoroughly, by measuring them, dating them, noting similar changes to the type that arise over time, and identifying their recurring locations in the city.

==The uses of building typology in history and practice==
[[File:Delft Voldersgracht 1.JPG|thumb|Houses along the canal in Delft are a type common just to this area.]]
Building types are critical to architects because they are a starting point for designing. One need not reinvent the form if a common building type, say an office building, is wanted. Most architects develop a sense of common building types over time, even without acknowledging their importance. Architects know the approximate dimensions, bulk, site placement, and internal circulation that dictates most types. This allows them to work quickly to determine the parts of the design problem which are unique:  material, orientation, structure, specific dimensions, entrance, and so on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One school of thought in Italy, started by Saverio Muratori, recognizes the importance of typology in providing continuity in the city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These architects have been influential in recognizing the role of type for modern architecture, where the newest buildings are encouraged to actively assimilate many typological characteristics, without imitating historical styles. 
[[File:Duxton Road shophouses 2.JPG|thumb|A common type in Asia is the "shophouse" which has an open shop on the ground floor and rooms above for living.]]
Historians, anthropologists, and architectural historians use the documentation of type as a key to other characteristics in a city, for example events, political control, or economic changes. As theory tells us, when a type evolves over a period of time, this is an indication that conditions in the city have changed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Built for change: neighborhood architecture in San Francisco|last=Moudon|first=Anne Vernez|publisher=MIT Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Moudon documents changes in the types of an Alamo Square&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; neighborhood to tell a kind architectural, cultural and economic history. She also identifies the block, lot and street pattern as key to typological continuity. Multiple studies using this method have identified important building types, for example Chinese [[shophouse]]s, Shanghai's [[Shikumen]] housing, [[Terraced house|terrace housing]] in Great Britain, [[Courtyard neighborhood|Courtyard]] buildings in France, and the atrium houses found in many hot climates. Atrium types are also important for mosques, shopping malls, and some [[Atrium (architecture)|hotels]].

==Building type and urban design==

Common types are the building blocks of the city. Usually, a neighborhood streets and lots are laid out so that the common type can be built there. This occurs today in suburban subdivisions, but it has been a pattern in history, as well. This combination of types, streets and lots is called an [[urban tissue]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or a plan unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alnwick, Northumberland: a Study in Town-Plan Analysis|last=Conzen|first=M.R.G.|publisher=Institute of British Geographers|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When studying a city, a designer identifies the common tissue patterns in place and may decide to link to them, imitate them, or otherwise recognize them as an historical artifact. A movement of urban theorists and practitioners in the US, [[New Urbanism]], has identified building typology as a key to defining more user-friendly places. In trying to preserve neighborhoods or building new ones, building types once again become the building blocks of the city, and may be codified in law as [[form-based code]]s.

'''Cerruti''' is a [[fashion house]] founded in 1967 in [[Paris]] by the [[Italian people|Italian]] stylist and [[fashion designer]] [[Nino Cerruti]].

Cerruti designs, manufactures, distributes, and retails [[Luxury good|luxury]] [[ready-to-wear]], [[jeans]], [[fragrance]]s, sportswear, leather goods, watches, and accessories. The brand markets these products under two different labels ''[[Cerruti 1881]]'' and '' 18CRR81 Cerruti.''

In 1967, the Cerruti label was officially launched with the opening of the flagship store and headquarters, at 3 Place de la Madeleine in [[Paris]], [[France]].

The company was the property of the American firm [[MatlinPatterson]] Global Advisors from August 2006 until 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Since December 2010, the company is owned by Trinity Ltd ([[Li &amp; Fung]] Group).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrketplace.com/10909/li-fung-unit-trinity-to-buy-cerruti-for-70-million/ Li &amp; Fung unit Trinity to buy Cerruti for $70 million] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122143029/http://www.mrketplace.com/10909/li-fung-unit-trinity-to-buy-cerruti-for-70-million/ |date=November 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1881, the grandfather of [[Nino Cerruti]] founded the [[textile]] mill ''Lanificio Fratelli Cerruti''. Located in [[Biella]] ([[Piemonte]], [[Italy]]) the water in the region is put to use to wash and treat the [[wool]], which is imported principally from [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]], so as to develop [[flannel]], [[tweeds]], [[cashmere wool|cashmere]], and butter [[muslin]]. Nino Cerruti took over the family business after his father's death in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/26/style/26iht-fash_5.html|title=Cerruti's A-List:Here's Hollywood|last=Menkes|first=Suzy|date=1994-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerruti fabrics are still produced in the same workshops.

The '''Cerruti''' label was launched in 1967 with a [[menswear]] collection. In 1976, the line 'Cerruti Woman' was created. Before creating his own [[brand]] in 1974, [[Giorgio Armani]] had worked in [[Paris]] under Cerruti.

In 1978, the house launched its first [[fragrance]] with ''Nino Cerruti pour Homme'', followed by numerous other fragrances for both men and women such as ''Fair Play'' in 1985, ''Cerruti 1881 pour Homme'' in 1990, ''Cerruti Image'' in 1998 and ''l'Essence de Cerruti'' in 2008.

In the 1980s, Cerruti began producing clothes for films, including ''Bonnie and Clyde'', ''[[Pretty Woman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=TwB02OUHnhgC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=cerruti+designing+clothes+for+pretty+woman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDsO_l69vWAhXHPCYKHdIVBogQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cerruti%20designing%20clothes%20for%20pretty%20woman&amp;f=false|title=Undressing Cinema: Clothing and identity in the movies|last=Bruzzi|first=Stella|date=2012-10-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134770595|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', and ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''. The brand designed clothes for actors such as [[Michael Douglas]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Harrison Ford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/26/style/26iht-fash_5.html|title=Cerruti's A-List:Here's Hollywood|last=Menkes|first=Suzy|date=1994-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Pacino]] and [[Jean Paul Belmondo]].

'''Charles Edenshaw''' (ca. 1839–1920) was a [[Haida people|Haida]] artist&lt;ref name=amnh&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/totems/masters/edenshaw.php "Master Artists: Charles Edenshaw."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124101447/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/totems/masters/edenshaw.php |date=24 November 2009 }} ''American Museum of Natural History.'' (retrieved 3 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Haida Gwaii]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. He is known for his woodcarving, [[Haida argillite carving|argillite carving]], jewellery, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;HAND TO HAND:The Legacy of Charles Edenshaw DVD 2005 Ravens and Eagles Productions, www.urbanrez.ca&lt;/ref&gt;{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2010}}

==Background==
Edensew (the name also spelled Edensaw, or Edenso from the Haida chiefly name ''Idɨnsaw'') was born at the Haida village of [[Skidegate]], on Haida Gwaii, located 27 miles off of the coast of [[British Columbia]] Canada.  His father was K'łajangk'una of the Nikwən Qiwe lineage of the Raven moiety.  His mother, whose lineage identity he followed in the Haida matrilineal system, was Qawkúna (later Mrs. John Robson) of the Eagle moiety's Sdəłdás lineage, of which Charles eventually became chief.  He spent his early years at Kiusta and Yatza in the northwestern Charlottes, i.e. the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii). His Haida name was ''Da.a xiigang''&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt; or Tahaygen, alternatively spelled Tahayren and Tahayghen.&lt;ref name=CMCGoldenAge&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/haaat04e.shtml | title=Artists – Golden Age: Charles Edenshaw | publisher=[[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] | accessdate=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ago.net/agoid24961 | publisher=[[Art Gallery of Ontario]] | title=Charles Edenshaw (Tahayghen). Model Totem Pole | accessdate=13 January 2010 | date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned from his uncle, the Eagle chief Albert Edward Edenshaw.  In 1884 he was baptised with his English name, which derived from Scotland's [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]].

In addition to the chiefly name Idɨnsaw, he also held the titles Skɨl'wxan jas ("Fairies Coming to You as in a Big Wave"), Dahʼégɨn ("Noise in the Housepit"), Nəngkwigetklałs ("They Gave Ten Potlatches for Him").

==Artworks==
He produced many commissioned works, including for the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt; His work is in many museum collections, and he served as consultant to many anthropologists.  His works include [[bentwood]] boxes, rattles, masks, [[totem poles]], and staffs, and he worked in wood, [[argillite]], gold, and silver.  His work was collected by the anthropologists [[Franz Boas]] and [[John R. Swanton]].

He is specifically credited for advancing gold and silver engraving in traditional formline design.&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt;

==Family==
Edenshaw's marriage to [[Isabella Edenshaw]] (Yahgujanaas) was part of a long pattern of intermarriage between these two prominent Haida lineages. Together they parented four daughters (in chronological order): Emily (White), Agnus (Yeltatzie), Florence (Davidson), and Nora (Cogo).

Through his daughter Emily, Edenshaw is great-grandfather to the contemporary artists [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas]], [[Jim Hart (Haida Artist)|Jim Hart]] and [[Lisa Hageman Yahgulanaas]] and great-great grandfather to many Haida artists. Edenshaw's daughter was the matriarch [[Florence Davidson]], and is great grandfather to internationally renowned artists [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]], and [[Reg Davidson]], and through Florence, he is grandfather to her daughter, the weaving artist [[Primrose Adams]],&lt;ref name="STONINGTON"&gt;{{cite web|title=Primrose Adams Bio|url=http://www.stoningtongallery.com/artistselect.php?fn=Primrose&amp;ln=Adams&amp;artist=118&amp;artType=4&amp;topic=bio|website=Stonington Gallery|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; great-grandfather to her daughter the weaving artist Isabel Rorick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16640">[[File:Jean Louis Théodore Géricault 005.jpg|right|300px|thumb|''Mazeppa'' by [[Théodore Géricault]] ca. 1823; based on Byron's poem.]]

*''The spelling "Mazepa" refers to the historical person; the double-p "Mazeppa" is used for the artistic and literary works.''

[[Ivan Stepanovych Mazepa|Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709) was a significant figure in the [[history of Ukraine]]. One story about him says that as a young man, he was caught ''[[in flagrante]]'' with a noblewoman, whose husband punished him by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting them free; eventually he reached the Cossacks and became their military leader. This caught the attention of the English poet [[Lord Byron]] ("[[Lady Caroline Lamb#Lord Byron|mad, bad, and dangerous to know]]"), whose ''[[Mazeppa (poem)|Mazeppa]]'' (1819) brought the events to wider attention. His [[narrative poem]] inspired many paintings, particularly by French Romantics, which in turn stimulated musical compositions, stage plays, more poems, and so on. New life was breathed into the equestrian tale when it was transposed to the American [[Wild West]].

==The historical figure==
{{Main|Ivan Mazepa}}
Mazepa served as [[Hetman of Zaporizhian Host]] in 1687–1708. He played an important role in the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709), where after learning that the Russian Tsar, [[Peter the Great]], intended to replace him with [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]], he deserted his army and sided with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. The political consequences and interpretation of this desertion have resonated in the national histories both of Russia and of Ukraine. The alienation of Mazepa from Ukrainian historiography continued during the Soviet period, but post-1991 in independent Ukraine there have been strong moves to rehabilitate Mazepa's image, although he remains a controversial figure.

==Byron's poem==
{{Main|Mazeppa (poem)}}
[[File:Mazeppa - Byron.png|thumb|right|300px|Currier and Ives illustration to their 1846 printing of the poem]]
[[Lord Byron]] published his [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] in 1819. According to the poem, the young Mazeppa has a love affair with a Polish Countess Theresa while serving as a page at the Court of King [[John II Casimir Vasa]]. Countess Theresa was married to a much older Count. On discovering the affair, the Count punishes Mazeppa by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting the horse loose. The bulk of the poem describes the traumatic journey of the hero strapped to the horse. The poem has been praised for its "vigor of style and its sharp realization of the feelings of suffering and endurance".&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Leslie|date=1968|title=Byron's Poetry: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no historical evidence to support that Mazepa was exiled from Poland because of a love affair, or that he was punished by being strapped to a wild horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumberg|first=Arnold|date=1995|title=Great Leaders, Great Tyrants?|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=184–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this colorful legend was in circulation before Byron published his poem.  [[Voltaire]] repeats it in ''History of Charles XII, King of Sweden'' (1731). This appears to have been Byron's main source for his poem: his 'Advertisement' to the poem includes three long quotations from this work. Several critics have also speculated that Byron was familiar with the ''Mémoires d'Azéma'' (1764) by the French writer [[André Guillaume Contant Dorville]], as there are significant similarities between the plot of that novel and of Byron's poem.&lt;ref name="Babinski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Babinski|first=H.F.|date=1975|title=The Mazeppa legend in European Romanticism|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first wave of reaction==
[[File:Mazeppa Louis Boulanger.jpg|thumb|Louis Boulanger, ''Mazeppa'']]
Byron's poem was both popular and influential in the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]. [[Horses in art]] had long been a popular theme, so when the poem was translated into French the same year by [[Amédée Pichot]], a wave of French painters decided to depict Mazeppa's "wild ride", including [[Théodore Géricault]] (1823, now held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Théodore Gericault {{!}} Mazeppa {{!}} The Met|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/358010|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1824, [[Finnish National Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finnish National Gallery - Art Collections - Mazeppa on the Dying Horse|url=http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?si=A+II+1426&amp;lang=en|website=Finnish National Gallery - Art Collections|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Horace Vernet]] (1826, [[Musée Calvet]] in Avignon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Présentation du musée - ANGLAIS - MUSEUM ROOMS - upstairs 1|url=http://www.musee-calvet-avignon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=815|website=www.musee-calvet-avignon.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=fr-fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Louis Boulanger]] (1827, the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ordeal of Mazeppa|url=http://mbarouen.fr/en/oeuvres/the-ordeal-of-mazeppa|website=Musée des Beaux-Arts|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=fr|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Boulanger's ''The Ordeal of Mazeppa'' and Vernet's ''Mazeppa and the Wolves'' both competed in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon of 1827]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

A theatrical version of the story soon appeared: a show called ''Mazeppa, or the Tartar Horse'' premiered at [[Antonio Franconi]]'s [[Cirque Olympique]] in Paris in 1825. This was copied in both the USA and England.&lt;ref name="Mainardi"/&gt;  [[Aleksandr Pushkin]] wrote a poem-response to Byron entitled ''[[Poltava (poem)|Poltava]]'' (1828–29), which opens with an epigraph from the Englishman's poem, and in which he portrays Mazeppa as a villain who betrayed Russians.

[[Victor Hugo]] was inspired by the French Romantic paintings to compose "Mazeppa", one of the major pieces in ''[[Les Orientales]]'' (1829), which he dedicated to Boulanger. The first part of his poem describes Mazeppa's run across Ukrainian plains. The second part compares Mazeppa to a poet banned from the living world because of his eccentricities, the banned poet is attached to the wild horse of his inspiration. The comparison to the poet ends by saying that this crazy trip through suffering finally gives success and glory to the poet.

==The 1830s-1860s==
[[Image:Astley's Amphitheatre Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|A similar equestrian show at [[Astley's Amphitheatre]] in London]]

The playwright [[Henry M. Milner]] wrote ''Mazeppa; or, The wild horse of Tartary. A romantic drama, in three acts. Dramatised from Lord Byron's poem by H.M. Milner, and adapted to the stage under the direction of Mr. Ducrow.''&lt;ref&gt;OCLC 31254994&lt;/ref&gt; (This was [[Andrew Ducrow]], the "Father of British circus [[equestrianism]]" and proprietor of [[Astley's Amphitheatre]].) It appeared in London in 1831. Over the next several years it toured the US, until "at one point, five different productions of the play were showing in San Francisco".&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Linda A.|last2=Bowers|first2=Carrie|title=Agnes Lake Hickok : queen of the circus, wife of a legend|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=9780806139838|chapter=7: Mazeppa Enters the Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Frederick Herring Sr.]], an Englishman who started out as a stagecoach driver, painted several versions of the story: two are "after Horace Vernet" (circa 1833, [[Tate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Mazeppa Surrounded by Horses (after Horace Vernet)’, John Frederick Herring, c.1833 {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/herring-mazeppa-surrounded-by-horses-after-horace-vernet-t00189|website=Tate|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Mazeppa Pursued by Wolves (after Horace Vernet)’, John Frederick Herring, 1833 {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/herring-mazeppa-pursued-by-wolves-after-horace-vernet-t00188|website=Tate|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1842 "MAZEPPA"{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. In 1846, the American lithographer [[Nathaniel Currier]], of [[Currier and Ives]], prepared four plates, with Byronic quotations; the artworks are now at [[Bridgeman Art Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|date=1993|title=Art in an age of Bonapartism, 1800–1815|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=170–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainardi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mainardi|first=Patricia|date=2003|title= Husbands, Wives and Lovers: Marriage and its Discontents in Nineteenth-Century France|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conningham|first1=Frederic A.|title=Currier and Ives prints : an illustrated check list.|date=1983|publisher=Crown Publ.|location=New York|isbn=9780517551158|page=36|edition= New, updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juliusz Słowacki]], a major figure in the [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romantic period]], wrote a play entitled ''Mazeppa'' (1840). Although he is now considered the father of modern Polish drama, it was the only one of his dramas that was put on stage during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Murray (2004). Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760–1850. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 1059–61. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-423-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Malcolm Rymer]], a British writer of [[penny dreadful]]s, wrote ''Mazeppa; or, The Wild Horse of the Ukraine: A Romance'' (1850).

Musicians were also inspired. [[Carl Loewe]] composed a tone-poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mazeppa - A Tone-Poem after Byron, Op. 27 - Carl Loewe &amp; Linda Nicholson Song - BBC Music|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tracks/n5z298|website=BBC|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generation after Hugo published his poem, it became the literary inspiration for [[Mazeppa (symphonic poem)|a symphonic poem]] (1851) and [[Transcendental Étude No. 4 (Liszt)|a Transcendental Étude]] (1852) by [[Franz Liszt]].  Another French Romantic painter, [[Théodore Chassériau]], re-interpreted Byron's poem, with ''Cossack girl at Mazeppa 's body'' (1851, [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Une jeune fille cosaque trouve Mazeppa évanoui sur le cheval sauvage - Musées de Strasbourg|url=https://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/oeuvre-musee-des-beaux-arts/-/entity/id/220490|website=www.musees.strasbourg.eu|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Irishman [[Michael William Balfe]] composed a [[cantata]] known as ''The Page'' or ''Mazeppa'' in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=William Alexander|title=Balfe:His Life and Work|date=1882|page=244|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner's play was adapted and [[burlesque]]d over the decades. For example, in 1856 it was re-written as an equestrian burlesque in two acts, by [[blackface]] minstrel entertainer [[Charles "Charlie" White]]. The main antagonist is Castiron, and his daughter is Olinska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contested Interpretations of the Past in Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian Film: Screen as Battlefield|page=149|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mazeppa story became "a well-worn melodrama in dire need of revitalization", which it received from the performer [[Adah Isaacs Menken]]. Other women had played Mazeppa, including [[Charlotte Cushman]], but Menken's interpretation  -- "sexing up" the part, scandalously performing the nude scene clad only in a flesh-colored [[bodystocking]]—really caught the public imagination.&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma Press"/&gt; Many other female Mazeppas followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slout|first1=William L.|title=En Route to the Great Eastern Circus and Other Essays on Circus History|date=2016|isbn= 978-1-4344-3547-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did a new wave of burlesques. ''Mazeppa'' was very popular during the [[American Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sentilles|first1=Renée M.|title=Performing Menken : Adah Isaacs Menken and the birth of American celebrity|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521820707|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the most widely performed drama in the [[American west]] from the 1860s until the turn of the century,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and was also popular in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|date=2000|title=W.S. Gilbert's Theatrical Criticism|publisher=The Society for Theatre Research|location=Sheffield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agnes Thatcher Lake]], a [[circus]] performer and equestrian all her life, took a production of ''Mazeppa'' to Europe in 1865, performing before [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828–85)|Prince Karl of Prussia]]. She then took her production across the United States, the only circus to do so, performing under her company's big top tents in towns and cities without a theatre big enough to host a stage show. A 2009 biography of Lake (who later married [[Wild Bill Hickok]]) estimates that two million Americans saw her athletic interpretation of Mazeppa, many more than saw Menken's sexualised one .&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma Press"/&gt;

==The 1870s-1880s==
In 1877, Albert Aiken wrote a [[dime novel]] called ''The Indian Mazeppa or The Madman of the Plains'', in which the myth is transposed to the [[Wild West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Mazeppa|website=University of Manitoba|url=http://umanitoba.ca/centres/ukrainian_canadian/ucco/indianmazeppa.html|accessdate=14 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212231107/http://umanitoba.ca/centres/ukrainian_canadian/ucco/indianmazeppa.html|archivedate=12 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pushkin's poem became the subject of [[Mazeppa (opera)|an opera entitled ''Mazeppa'']], written between 1881 and 1883, with three acts and six scenes. The music is by [[Tchaikovsky]] and the libretto by [[Victor Burenin]]. It is set in Ukraine in the 18th century, and is a story about love, abduction, political persecution and vengeful murder.

In 1910, [[Francis Boggs]] produced a short film based on the stage play of Byron's poem titled ''Mazeppa or the Wild horse of Tartary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title | 0001311 | Mazeppa or the Wild horse of Tartary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1990==

In 1991, [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukraine declared independence]], and Mazeppa rose again in international consciousness. A French [[drama film]] titled ''[[Mazeppa (film)|Mazeppa]]'', based loosely on the lives of the painter Géricault and the equestrian Franconi, won a prize at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2565/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Mazeppa |accessdate=2009-08-22|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gericault decided to stay and live with the circus and painted only horses to try and understand the mystery of this animal; Mazeppa embodies a man carried away by his passion.

A Ukrainian film by [[Yuri Ilyenko]] loosely based on historical facts, called ''[[A Prayer for Hetman Mazepa (film)|A Prayer for Hetman Mazepa]]'' was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323279/ Molitva za getmana Mazepu (2002)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A South African interpretation of the Mazepa-Mazeppa motif describes it as "Romantic Phaethon" ([[Phaethon|a character in Greek mythology]] who drove the sun-chariot too recklessly) and points to its appeal to [[Modernist poetry|Modernist poets]] such as [[Bertol Brecht]] and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;VOSS, Tony.

'''Databending''' (or '''data bending''') is the process of manipulating a [[media file]] of a certain [[File format|format]], using [[software]] designed to edit files of another format. Distortions in the medium typically occur as a result, and the process either falls under a broader category of, or is frequently employed in [[glitch art]].

==Process and techniques==
The term ''databending'' is derived from [[circuit bending]], in which objects such as children's toys, [[effects pedal]]s and electronic keyboards are deliberately [[short circuit]]ed by bending the [[circuit board]] to produce erratic and spontaneous sounds. Like circuit bending,&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; databending involves the (often unpredictable) alteration of its target's behavior. Databending achieves this alteration by manipulating the information within a media file of a certain format, using software designed to edit files of a different format; distortions in the medium typically occur as a result.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt;  

Many techniques exist, including the use of [[hex editor]]s to manipulate certain components of a [[compression algorithm]], to comparatively simple methods.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; [[Michael Betancourt]] has posed a short set of instructions, included in the [[Signal Culture |''Signal Culture Cookbook,'']] that involves the direct manipulation of the digital file using a hexadecimal editing program. One such method involves the addition of audio effects through [[audio editing software]] to distort [[raw data]] interpretations of image files. Some effects produce optical analogues: adding an [[echo]] filter duplicated elements of a photo, and inversion contributed to the flipping over of an image. The similarities result from the waveforms corresponding with the layers of pixels in a [[Linear medium|linear fashion]], ordered from top to bottom.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; Another method, dubbed "the WordPad effect", uses the program [[WordPad]] to manipulate images through converting the raw data to the [[Rich Text Format]].&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

===Categorization===
According to the artist Benjamin Berg, different techniques of the process can be grouped into three categories:&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;
* Incorrect editing: Files of a certain format are manipulated using software designed to edit files of a different format.
* Reinterpretation: Files are simply converted from one medium to another.
* Forced errors: Known [[software bug]]s are exploited to force the program to terminate, usually while writing a file.
The "WordPad effect" would fall under ''incorrect editing'', while ''reinterpretation'' contains a subcategory called ''sonification'', in which data other than audio is introduced simultaneously with musical audio data. The last technique is the hardest of the three to accomplish, often yielding highly unpredictable results.&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

==Usage and reception==
[[File:NicolaiRasterNotonLive.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alva Noto uses sonification in his music.]]
Databending is frequently employed in [[glitch art]],&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; and is considered a sub-category of the genre.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; The ''sonification'' technique is commonly used by [[glitch music]]ians such as [[Alva Noto]].&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Ahuja and Lu summarized the process through a quote by Adam Clark Estes of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' as "the internet's code-heavy version of graffiti."&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2013"/&gt; Various groups on [[Flickr]] explore the effects of databending on imagery; an [[Internet bot]] named "GlitchBot" was created to scrape [[Creative Commons]]-licensed imagery and apply the process and upload the results.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Users on [[Vimeo]] who deal explicitly with databending and glitch art in general exist, and a [[Chicago]]-based digital art project named GLI.TC/H was funded using [[Kickstarter]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Weber2011"/&gt;

[[Image:Derrynaflan paten.jpg|thumb|Derrynaflan Paten]]

The '''Derrynaflan Chalice''' is an 8th- or 9th-century [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]], that was found as part of the ''Derrynaflan Hoard'' of five liturgical vessels.  The discovery was made on 17 February 1980 near [[Killenaule]], [[County Tipperary]] in Ireland. According to art historian Michael Ryan the hoard "represents the most complex and sumptuous expression of the ecclesiastical art-style of early-medieval Ireland as we know it in its eighth- and ninth-century maturity."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan 1997:997.&lt;/ref&gt; The area known as Derrynaflan is an island of pastureland surrounded by bogland, which was the site of an early Irish [[abbey]].  The [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] was found with a composite silver [[paten]], a hoop that may have been a stand for the paten, a liturgical [[strainer]] and a bronze basin inverted over the other objects.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ryan, "The Derrynaflan Hoard and Early Irish Art" ''Speculum'' '''72'''.4 (October 1997:995–1017) p. 997, with wide-ranging notes.&lt;/ref&gt; The group is among the most important surviving examples of [[insular art|Insular]] metalwork.  It was donated to the Irish State and the items are now on display in the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="NMIweb"&gt;{{cite web

The hoard was probably secreted during the turbulent 10th to 12th centuries, when Viking raids and dynastic turmoil created many occasions when valuables were hidden. The early and later 10th century is marked by a particular concentration of hoarding in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan 1997:998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 032.jpg|thumb|Detail]]
Derrynaflan is a small island of dry land situated in a surrounding area of peat bogs, in the [[townland]] of Lurgoe, Co. Tipperary, northeast of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]]. The monastery was an important foundation in the period preceding the Viking raids; the present modest ruins of a small [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] nave-and-chancel [[abbey]] church there, however, date from a later period.

The [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/derrynaflan-hoard/ Derrynaflan Hoard] was discovered on 17 February 1980 by Michael Webb from [[Clonmel]] and his son, also Michael, while they were exploring the ancient monastic site of Derrynaflan with a metal detector.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/derrynaflan-hoard/&lt;/ref&gt; They had the implied permission of the owners of the land on which the ruins stood to visit the site but they had no permission to dig on the lands. A preservation order had been made in respect of the ruin under the National Monuments Act, 1930, so that it was an offence to injure or to interfere with the site.&lt;ref&gt; Webb v Ireland [1988] IR 353 &lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was initially kept secret for three weeks.&lt;ref name=IrInd29July06&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Ardagh Chalice]] was discovered in [[County Limerick]], at Reerasta Rath in Uí Fidgenti, 1868.]]
The behaviour of the Webbs, and nearly seven years of litigation, culminating in the Supreme Court action where they unsuccessfully sought over £5,000,000 for the find, led to the replacement of Irish laws of [[treasure trove]] by the law in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, with a new Section 2 being included in the legislation.

The [[Ardagh Chalice]] dates from around the same period, perhaps a century earlier, of the Derrynaflan Hoard and was found close by in neighbouring [[County Limerick]]. At the time, the ruling dynasty in Tipperary and most of [[Munster]] were the [[Eóganachta]], while their longtime allies and possible cousins the [[Uí Fidgenti]] ruled in the Limerick area. [[Feidlimid mac Cremthanin]], king-bishop of Cashel, who became [[King of Munster]] in 821 and died in 847, was a patron of the monastic foundation at Derrynaflan and has been suggested as a possible patron of the chalice.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, with reservations, 1997:997: "This sort of particularism is dangerous as hypotheses of this nature tend to be elevated into 'facts'".&lt;/ref&gt;

As a masterpiece of Insular art, the Derrynaflan chalice was included in the exhibition "The Work of Angels: Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th Centuries AD" (London, 1989, included in the catalogue).

'''''Fearless Girl''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Kristen Visbal]], commissioned by [[State Street Global Advisors]] (SSgA) via McCann New York. It depicts a girl who, as originally installed, faced the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' (or ''[[Wall Street]] Bull'') statue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/things-fearless-girl/308863/ |title=Eight Things You Don't Know About 'Fearless Girl' |publisher=[[Advertising Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed in November 2018 in preparation for relocation to in front of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. A plaque with footprints was placed on the original site of ''Fearless Girl''.&lt;ref name="Moyer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moyer |first=Liz |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/fearless-girl-on-the-move-but-leaves-footprints-for-visitors.html |title='Fearless Girl' on the move, but leaves footprints for visitors to stand in her place |work=[[CNBC]] |date=2018-11-28 |accessdate=2018-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Fearless Girl'' was commissioned to advertise for an [[index fund]] that comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership. The plaque below the statue states: "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference," with "SHE" being both a descriptive pronoun and the fund's [[NASDAQ]] [[ticker symbol]]. The statue was originally installed on March 7, 2017, at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

The commission by State Street Global Advisors specified that the statue should depict a girl with hands on her hips and chin up, with a height of 36 inches, which Kristen Visbal and her collaborators then increased to 50 inches, to better match the size of ''Charging Bull''.&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt; Still, Visbal commented that "I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent".&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt; She modeled the sculpture on two children, but many of the distinguishing features were removed so that it would be universally appealing. A child who would represent all children "so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl."&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt;

== History ==
The statue was installed on March 7, 2017—the day before [[International Women's Day]]—by [[State Street Global Advisors]], in a campaign developed by advertising agency [[McCann Erickson|McCann New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nycs-fearless-girl-statue-corporate-giants-46026204 |title=Behind NYC's 'Fearless Girl' statue are 2 corporate giants |last=Dobnik |first=Verena |date=March 9, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312022256/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nycs-fearless-girl-statue-corporate-giants-46026204 |archivedate=March 12, 2017 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSgA was celebrating the first anniversary of its "Gender Diversity Index" fund that "invests in U.S. large-capitalization companies that rank among the highest in their sector in achieving gender diversity across senior leadership".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.spdrs.com/post/driving-gender-diversity-with-a-bold-new-statement |title=Driving Gender Diversity with a Bold New Statement |last=Mavro |first=Jill |date=March 7, 2017 |website=SPDR Blog|access-date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the statue was developed by Senior Art Director Lizzie Wilson and Senior Copywriter Tali Gumbiner. Wilson and Gumbiner established both the idea for the statue as well as the overall look of the girl using countless moodboards and imagery, which Visbal referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/the-story-of-the-fearless-girl-from-the-women-at-mccann-who-made-her/ |title=The Story of ‘The Fearless Girl,’ From the Women at McCann Who Made Her |last=Nudd |first=Tim |date=March 10, 2017 |website=Adweek|access-date=May 4, 2017|archive-ur;=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fearless Girl'' was originally given a one-week [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] permit that was later extended to 30 days.&lt;ref name="revesz" /&gt; Later, it was announced that the statue would remain in place through February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Fearless Girl' statue will stay through early next year |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/27/news/fearless-girl-statue-2018/ |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |publisher=CNN Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Daniella |title='Fearless Girl' statue will face off Wall Street bull for another year |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fearless-girl-statue-will-face-wall-street-bull-another-year-n738991 |website=NBC News |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |language=en |date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those advocating for the statue to stay longer was U.S. Representative [[Carolyn Maloney]] of [[New York's 12th congressional district]], who stated, "This statue has touched hearts across the world with its symbolism of the resiliency of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fearless-girl-charging-bull-wall-street-new-york-boradway-2018-bronze-statue-stand-up-a7651471.html |title=The Fearless Girl statue will stay on Wall Street until 2018 |last=O'Connor |first=Roision |date=March 27, 2017 |work=The Independent|access-date=April 11, 2017 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City Public Advocate]] [[Letitia James]] wrote a letter that supported keeping the statue, "Fearless Girl stands as a powerful beacon, showing women—young and old—that no dream is too big and no ceiling is too high".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/exclusive-letitia-james-fearless-girl-permanent-article-1.2996620 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Letitia James wants 'Fearless Girl' to be permanent |work=NY Daily News|access-date=April 12, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Juxtaposition with ''Charging Bull'' ===
[[File:Fearless Girl (cropped).jpg|thumb|The juxtaposition of ''Fearless Girl'' and ''Charging Bull'' upset some observers, including sculptor Arturo Di Modica, who installed ''Charging Bull'' in 1989.]]
[[Arturo Di Modica]], who installed ''Charging Bull'' in 1989, asked that the statue of the girl be removed, arguing that the piece exploited his work for commercial purposes and altered the perception of the bull.&lt;ref name="Mettler"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mettler |first1=Katie |title=Charging Bull sculptor says Fearless Girl distorts his art, so he's fighting back |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-charging-bull-sculptor-fearless-girl-20170412-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called ''Fearless Girl'' "an advertising trick" that he wants relocated, citing its political messaging.&lt;ref name="Stack2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-de-blasio.html?_r=0 |title=‘Fearless Girl’ Statue to Stay in Financial District (for Now) |date=March 27, 2017 |work=The New York Times |last1=Stack |first1=Liam |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobnik"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/03/26/new-york-invite-fearless-girl-statue-stay-wall-street/99677644/ |title=Will New York invite the 'Fearless Girl' statue to stay on Wall Street? |date=March 26, 2017 |work=USA Today |language=en |last1=Dobnik |first1=Verena |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Segal''' is a clothing and accessories  [[retail]] store founded in [[West Hollywood, California]]. Its flagship store is on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in West Hollywood.

==Stores==
There are currently three Fred Segal locations in the United States.  The new global flagship is in West Hollywood, the historic Fred Segal location is on Melrose  and the third location is at [[LAX]]’s Thomas Bradley International Terminal. There are two international flagships in Japan, one in the Daikanyama neighborhood of Tokyo and the other in Kobe.  In September 2018, Fred Segal stores opened in Switzerland (3 stores), Taipei, and Kuala Lumpur.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/fred-segal-ramps-international-store-growth-plans-1202773128/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Over five decades ago, Fred Segal opened a local [[jeans]]-only store. This 300-square-foot store grew over the years, and with the expansion, Segal invited key managers to purchase and run select boutiques within their respective area of merchandising expertise within the Fred Segal center offering them to participate as franchisees under the Fred Segal Brand. These franchisees brought in the style and merchandise that eventually know collectively as "Fred Segal."

In May 2012, the worldwide licensing rights to the brand were acquired by SANDOW, a company with brands spanning the design, fashion and beauty sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/specialty-stores/fred-segals-new-deal-5889483 Fred Segal's new deal] [[Women's Wear Daily]]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, SANDOW announced Fred Segal's  expansion strategy to open new flagship locations, both internationally and domestically, launch Fred Segal’s first [[e-commerce]] site, and create private merchandise lines.

In May 2014, SANDOW and Fred Segal announced the partnership with equity investor Evolution Media Partners (Evolution), a joint venture between Evolution Media Capital (EMC), an entertainment, media and sports merchant bank formed in partnership with [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA); TPG Growth, the middle market and growth equity investment platform of global investment firm TPG; and Participant Media, the global entertainment company founded in 2004 by [[Jeff Skoll]].

In September 2017, Fred Segal opened their domestic flagship store on the corner of Sunset and La Cienega in West Hollywood, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fred-segal-flagship-opening-la-week-1042852 |title=Inside the New Fred Segal Flagship Opening in L.A.

'''''Frozen''''' is a play by [[Bryony Lavery]] that tells the story of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl, Rhona.  The play follows Rhona's mother and killer over the years that follow.  They are linked by a doctor who is studying what causes men to commit such crimes.  The themes of the play include emotional paralysis and forgiveness.

==Productions==
The play was first performed at [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in 1998 and won the Best New Play Award from the Theatrical Management Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Kellaway |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jun/23/features.review27 |title=Interview with Bryony Lavery, author of Frozen &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= June 23, 2002|accessdate=2011-10-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It later made its debut at the Royal National Theatre's Cottesloe Theatre on 3 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/8213/past-events/past-productions-20012003.html |title=Past productions 2001-2003 - Past Events |publisher=National Theatre |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived at The [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] starring [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]], [[Suranne Jones]] and [[Nina Sosanya]] for a strictly limited season from February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/frozen/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Frozen'' opened [[Off-Broadway]] in February 2004 at the Manhattan Class Company Theatre starring [[Swoosie Kurtz]], [[Brian F. O'Byrne]] and [[Laila Robins]]. It transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in May and closed in August 2004.&lt;ref name=talkin&gt;[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sfla/sfla52.html "Talkin' Broadway Regional News &amp; Reviews - "Frozen" in Southern Florida"] talkinbroadway.com, October 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frozen'' was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Play]] in 2004, and earned a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] (Brian F. O'Byrne).

==Plot and characters==
The story is set in present-day [[England]] and involves three main characters: a [[serial killer]] named Ralph, who kidnaps and murders a young girl; the murdered girl's mother, Nancy; a New York [[psychiatrist]], Agnetha, who travels to England to examine Ralph. The three lives slowly intersect &amp;mdash; and the characters gradually change and become "unfrozen" as they come to terms with the idea of forgiveness. 

The script begins in [[monologue]]s, each person showing his or her side of the story; the audience sees each person's story intertwine as they connect with one another.

==Allegations of plagiarism==
In September 2004, papers around the world (including ''[[The Times (London)|The Times]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', and the [[Associated Press]]) reported that Lavery had allegedly [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] significant portions (nearly 675 words) of the play from a 1997 ''[[The New Yorker]]'' article by [[Malcolm Gladwell]] about psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis|Dorothy Lewis]], and from Lewis' own 1998 book ''Guilty by Reason of Insanity.'' 

Lewis claimed that ''Frozen'' was based in large part on her life and that the play lifted both themes and verbatim passages from both sources.  However, after interviewing Lavery, Gladwell wrote a second ''New Yorker'' article in which he characterized Lavery’s appropriation as "permissible borrowing." Lavery, for her part, acknowledged that all three characters were drawn heavily from external sources. For the character of Ralph, she drew on the book ''[[The Murder of Childhood]]'' by Ray Wyre and Tim Tate. For the character of Nancy, she drew on an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by Marian Partington, whose sister Lucy had been murdered by the serial killers [[Fred West|Fred and Rosemary West]]. And, for the character of Agnetha, Lavery drew on the Gladwell article. "I wanted [the play] to be accurate", she told Gladwell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gladwell.com/something-borrowed/ Gladwell - Something Borrowed] Nov 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
*"[A] big, brave, compassionate play about [[grief]], revenge, forgiveness and bearing the unbearable." -- ''[[The Guardian]]''

The ''TalkinBroadway'' reviewer of a Florida production wrote: "[A] powerful drama ... about three people living the human condition... a story that needs to continue to be told."&lt;ref name=talkin/&gt;

The '''Golden Mile''' (or, colloquially, "The Mile") is the popular stretch of [[beach]]front in the city of [[Durban]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]], including the [[promenade]] that runs along with it. It runs roughly from uShaka Beach (where the [[uShaka Marine World]] is located) in [[Point Waterfront]] to [[Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World]] in the north and now includes a route directly to Moses Mabhida Stadium. It abuts the central business district of the city to its west. 

It is one of the main tourist attractions in the Durban area. The wide stretch of golden sands, artificially separated by various [[piers]], provides excellent opportunities for sun-worshippers and swimmers to enjoy the sub-tropical sunshine and warm waters of the [[Indian Ocean]]. Most of the Mile's beaches are protected year-round by [[lifeguards]] and [[shark]] nets. The Mile is also a well-known [[surfing|surfer's]] haven. The South Beach end, in particular, is well known as a safe beach for neophyte surfers. The beachfront properties are a mix of residential [[apartments]] and tourist [[hotels]], development of which boomed in the 1970s, although remnants of Durban's [[art-deco]] architecture are still evident. Interspersed among the beachfront properties are several popular restaurants and nightclubs.

The Golden Mile has long been a popular [[domestic holiday]] destination and during the holiday seasons (June–July and December–January) 
South Africans from across the country, but in particular the [[Gauteng]] region, flock to enjoy its many attractions, which include:

*[[Blue Lagoon (Durban)|Blue Lagoon]], a popular hangout, picnic and fishing spot
*''Mini Town'' with a miniature replica of Durban, complete with a working miniature railway and airport.
*[[Moses Mabhida Stadium]]
*Traditional market vendors and other hawkers with a selection of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] art and crafts.
*An [[oceanway]] pavement along the beaches to encourage more people to enjoy walking and cycling.
*[[Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World]], a casino complex with a semi-private beach, restaurants, shops and public entertainment facilities.
*[[uShaka Marine World]] aquarium, water park, dolphinarium, containing a restaurant with the largest shark tank in the world.
*[[North Beach (Durban)|North Beach]], [[Dairy Beach]], the [[Bay of Plenty (Durban)|Bay of Plenty]], Snake Park, Pirates and Country Club beaches are popular [[surfing]] beaches separated by the piers.
*The Skate Park in front of the Bay of Plenty caters for skateboarders, roller bladers and BMX'ers.
*The Surfing Museum, a historical site cataloguing some of Durban's surfing history.

'''Hillsboro Artists' Regional Theatre''' (HART), originally the '''Hillsboro Actors Repertory Theater''', is a [[community theatre]] group in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], [[Oregon]], United States. Founded in 1994, the non-profit group presents around six plays each year. Their 99-seat [[theater]] is located in downtown Hillsboro next to the [[Hillsboro Civic Center]] along Washington Street.

==History==
The Hillsboro Actors Repertory Theater was founded in 1994 by John and Kim Sandstrom as an extension of their dinner-theater company SandStorm Productions.&lt;ref name="havehart"&gt;{{cite news|title=You gotta have HART|last=Colby|first=Richard N.|date=August 26, 1994|work=The Oregonian|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debut"/&gt; The married couple opened the theater in the former [[J.

By the end of their second season in 1996, the 70-seat theater had produced 11 plays.&lt;ref name="success"&gt;{{cite news|title=Success writes a happy script for Actors Repertory Theater|last=Colby|first=Richard N.|date=February 27, 1996|work=The Oregonian|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Productions in the early years included ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]'', and ''[[Show Boat]]'' among others.&lt;ref name="success"/&gt; In February 1996, the Sandstroms began looking at selling the company to a non-profit group.&lt;ref name="success"/&gt; They sold it that year to the Friends of HART in order to focus on raising their family, though Kim remained involved as artistic director for a year.&lt;ref name="staging"&gt;{{cite news|title=West Zoner: Staging real life|last=Mandel|first=Michelle|date=August 14, 2003|work=The Oregonian|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Sandstrom took a hiatus from performing in 2001 after developing health problems, but returned in 2003 to start in ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'', a one-person play by [[Willy Russell]].&lt;ref name="staging"/&gt; Actor [[Bret Harrison]] got his first acting role at HART in a production of ''[[Our Town]]'' in these early years of HART.&lt;ref name="last"/&gt; By 2004, Michael Hibbard had become the artistic director at HART and in June the company had to move out of its original home that held 83 seats after rent doubled at the space.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite news|title=West Zoner: The last curtain call|last=Smith|first=Jill|date=June 3, 2004|work=The Oregonian|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group had also changed its name to Hillsboro Artists' Regional Theatre.&lt;ref name="last"/&gt; Productions were then held and a variety of venues, including the [[Glenn &amp; Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center]].&lt;ref name="last"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">The '''international trade of fine art''' is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique, non-reproducible works by an artist.  The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good.  It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece.  Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market.

==Decorative art as a trade commodity==

The trade commodities included in the definition of "[[visual art]]" include the following: [[painting]], drawing, [[sculpture]] in various materials, [[printmaking]], [[photography]], maps, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[mail art]], [[assemblage art]], [[textile arts]], [[fashion design]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], and product design.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal.  Therefore, art is considered [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 4-digit [[Standard International Trade Classification]] (SITC) classifies "Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as "fine" art.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The 4-digit [[Harmonized System|harmonized commodity]] description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for "fine" art is 9701, which is classified as "Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand".&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

==History of international art trade==

The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when [[Pope Pius II]] prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets.  Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;  Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets.  Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Throughout much of the [[early modern period]], if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad.  Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] of London, which both still survive today.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties.  For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good.   At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], neutral [[Switzerland]] became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent.  Most "degenerate" works of art that the [[Nazi]] government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered [[black markets]].  Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works.  For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;  Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as [[eBay]] and [http://Lauritz.com/ Lauritz.com].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

==Economic theory of art trade==

Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the "secondary market" – rather than the "primary market" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;  For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture.  It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

[[Comparative advantage]] is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods.   There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property.  Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the [[marginal cost]] of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences.  But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism:&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

===Determination of prices===

Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness.  Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Economists use the [[hedonic regression]] (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art.  This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Protectionism vs. Liberalization==
 
[[Protectionism]] is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;  Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad.  America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Protectionists view this as a modern form of American [[imperialism]], which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity.  Australian economist [[David Throsby]] argues that investment in "cultural capital" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; [[Paul M. Bator]], who helped negotiate and draft the [[UNESCO]] convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones.  He explains in ''The International Trade in Art'' that "art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;


Proponents of [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;   Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, [[economies of scale]], and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] – enhance the case for opening markets.  Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The "[[commodification]] objection" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;  Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market.  This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate.  In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics.&lt;ref name="thirteeen" /&gt; More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;

==Largest countries by total trade in art==

The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960.  The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701 (works done exclusively by hand) because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques, stamps, and sculpture that aren’t captured in the HS definition.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

Jess, along with the other characters in ''Black Christmas'', was praised for having characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/black-christmas-1974|title=Black Christmas|last=Wilkins|first=Budd|date=December 23, 2016|website=Slant Magazine|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been regarded as one of the most influential heroines in film and is considered to be one of the greatest [[final girl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/topten/blackchristmas/|title=The Terror Trap: Black Christmas|last=|first=|date=|website=The Terror Trap|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/2011/02/02/women-in-horror-month/|title=Celebrate Women in Horror Month With Our Favorite Final Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=Movie Fone|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivia Hussey]] was set to reprise her role in a sequel to the original film shortly after the release of the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)|2006 reboot]]. However, the film was scrapped after the death of [[Bob Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aminoapps.com/page/horror/8512175/trivia-time-1-black-christmas-2006|title=Trivia Time #1- Black Christmas (2006)|last=|first=|date=|website=Horror Amino|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances ==
In the original ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', Jess is a member of the sorority house Pi Kappa Sig. Jess, along with her sorority sisters, began to receive disturbing phone calls from a disorientated man. During a Christmas party, Jess receives another obscene phone call and lets Barb, Phyl, Clare, and several other girls to listen to the incoherent ramblings of the disturbed caller, who does several different voices within each call he makes. The next day, Jess meets with her boyfriend, Peter, to tell him that she is pregnant and getting an [[abortion]] which causes him to get upset. Jess later attends a search party to help find a missing girl. After the girl's corpse is found, Jess heads home and receives another phone call. She calls the police, unaware that Peter is in the house until he startles her and argues with her. He leaves as the police come and tap the phone. She manages to keep the caller on the phone long enough for the police to trace the call and they tell her the man is calling from inside the house. 

Jess calls for Phyl and Barb and grabs a [[fireplace poker]] and goes upstairs. She discovers the corpses of her friends and then sees the eyes of the caller who reveals himself as Billy looking at her through the door crack, telling her not to "tell what we did, Agnes..." before she slams the door on him. He then chases her downstairs and grabs her hair as she tries to unlock the front door. Jess manages to escape, fleeing to the basement with a fire poker for protection. 

She locks the door just as Billy starts to bang on the door in rage. As Jess wanders the basement, she sees Peter looking into the window, and Jess kills him, believing him to be the killer. The police then hear her screams. They sedate Jess and unknowingly leave her in the house with the real killer, Billy, who is in the attic. Her fate is left ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic-horror.com/reviews/black_christmas_1974|title=Black Christmas (1974)|last=|first=|date=|website=Classic-Horror.com|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://horrorfreaknews.com/black-christmas-1974-review|title=Black Christmas (1974) Review|last=|first=|date=|website=Horror Freak News|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2009/12/17/black-christmas/|title=Black Christmas (1974)|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinemassacre Productions|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jess appears as the main character in the novelization of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terapeak.com/worth/black-christmas-movie-tie-in-novelization-paperback-with-olivia-hussey-cover/251227628123/|title=Black Christmas Movie Tie-in Novelization|last=|first=|date=|website=terrapeak.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after the release of the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)|2006 reboot]], [[Bob Clark]] began to work on a direct sequel to the original film. [[Olivia Hussey]] was set to reprise her role as Jess. In this film, Jess would have been the new house mother of the sorority house. The film was eventually abandoned after the untimely death of Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/10860|title=BLACK CHRISTMAS 2' After 27 Years' Really'|last=|first=|date=November 26, 2001|website=Ain't It Cool News|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In ''The Mammoth Book of Slasher Movies'', Peter Normanton praised the importance that Jess has on the film saying "Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) has to confront a dilemma in her own life, one that will have a major bearing on the outcome of this film."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mammoth Book of Slasher Movies|last=Normanton|first=Peter|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|year=2012|isbn=1780330413|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Fright Xmas,'' Alan-Bertaneisson Jones stated that the plot of ''Black Christmas'' did not focus on the killer but rather on Jess and the other girls from the film, saying that "This is quite refreshing, because unlike in later movies where the victims (especially the female ones) are just a line of meat to feed to the grinder, in this film Jessica is a much more fully realized character; a character with great courage, intelligence and strength (more akin to Laurie from ''Halloween,'' Ripley from the ''Alien'' movies or Sidney from the ''Scream'' movies than most female victims of slashers, perhaps especially in the 1980s)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fright Xmas|last=Jones|first=Alan-Bertaneisson|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2010|isbn=1452061998|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Son of the 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen'', Richard Crouse praised Olivia's performance saying "Hussey brings a quiet strength to Jess that hints at a fountain of inner resolve." and noted the complexity around her character stating that "In ''Black Christmas'' Jess rebels against her boyfriend, planning to have an abortion. Clearly she is no virgin, and yet she is the sole survivor of Billy's rampage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Son of the 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|last=Crouse|first=Richard|publisher=ECW Press|year=2010|isbn=1554903300|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in a number of genres have performed live painting, including famously [[LeRoy Neiman]] creating a painting during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=CMJ/&gt;  In the 1990s and 2000s, live painting became a hallmark of [[street art]] and [[graffiti artist]]s.
Live painting has evolved beyond painting in situ by the impressionists, to incorporating the general public and arenas' of Modern Times. One of Australias famous exponents of 'Live Painting' performance art, Robert K Gammage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houseoftola.com |title=House of Tola |publisher=House of Tola |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; has introduced the physical participation by  spectators/hosts and or guests of adding imagery and colour in situ in the public domain during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrBwBC6Hql0 |title= Artist on Artist |publisher= YouTube |date= |accessdate= 2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;feature SUNDAY LIFE, Sunshine Coast Daily Sept 9 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Caitlin Beidler, an American artist of Redemption Art uses her live paintings to restore people, relationships, and communities through art. Redemption Art aims to be an effective tool in the restoration process by first creating trusting relationships through art, regardless of race, age, culture, or socioeconomic status. From these relationships, Redemption Art seeks to help bring about restoration and then transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.caitlinbeidler.com/about.htm |title= Redemption Art: Restoring People Through Art - Myrtle Beach, South Carolina |publisher= Caitlin Beidler |date= |accessdate= 2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Live Artist teams from Haven Art Studio are examples of Live Artists who collaborate on works of art during Live Art Performances. These artist teams were started in 2005 by the eight members of the Randolph family, based in Redding, California. They paint thematic works that echo world events with a positive redemption message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redding.com/news/2010/aug/13/finding-beauty-in-tragedy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102090109/http://www.redding.com/news/2010/aug/13/finding-beauty-in-tragedy/ |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4894">'''Merovingian illumination''' is the term for the continental [[Franks|Frankish]] style of [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] in the late seventh and eight centuries, named for the [[Merovingian dynasty]]. Ornamental in form, the style consists of [[initial]]s constructed from lines and circles based on [[Late Antique illumination]], title pages with [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s and crucifixes. Figural images were almost totally absent. From the eight century, [[zoomorphic]] decoration began to appear and become so dominant that in some manuscripts from [[Chelles Abbey|Chelles]] whole pages are made up of letters formed from animals. Unlike the contemporary [[Insular illumination]] with its rampant decoration, the Merovingian style aims for a clean page.

One of the oldest and most productive scriptoria was [[Luxeuil Abbey]], founded by the Irish monk [[Columbanus]] in 590 and destroyed in 732. [[Corbie Abbey]], founded in 662, developed its own version of the style, while Chelles and [[Laon]] were further centres. From the middle of the eighth century, Merovingian illumination was strongly influenced by insular illumination. An [[evangeliary]] from [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach]] (Trier, Dombibliothek, Cod. 61 olim 134.) indicates that it came into the abbey as the collaborative work of Irish and Merovingian scribes. The foundation of [[Willibrord]] strongly influenced continental illumination and led to the brought Irish culture into the Merovingian realm.

The '''Oslo City Art Award''' (''Oslo bys kunstnerpris'') is given annually for contributions to the arts by the city of [[Oslo, Norway]].

The Oslo City Art Award has been awarded every year since 1978 with the exception of 1991 when the prize was not awarded due to a lack of funding. Since inception, the prize has been distributed to 4-5 recipients annually. The prize is "awarded to individuals who in the past or in recent years has made an outstanding achievement in Oslo's art world".  The prize consists of a diploma and a monetary amount. The award is most often made simultaneously with the presentation of the [[Oslo City Culture Award]], which consists of a bronze medal and a monetary amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oslo.kommune.no/kultur-og-utdanningskomiteen/oslo-bys-kulturpris-og-kunstnerpriser-article17620-4233.html ''Oslo bys kulturpris og kunstnerpriser'' (Oslo commune)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A '''Photoshop contest''', or sometimes '''Photoshop battle''', is an [[online]] game, in which a [[website]] or user of an [[Internet forum]] will post a starting [[image]] — usually a [[photograph]] — and ask others to manipulate the image using some kind of [[computer graphics|graphics]] editing [[software]], such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Corel Photo-Paint]], The [[GIMP]], [[PaintShop Pro]], [[Paint.NET]] or [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]].   People can also use [[video editing]] software to create these images, such as [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] or [[VideoPad Video Editor|NCH VideoPad]].

While [[Photoshop (verb)|Photoshop]] is the industry standard image editing program, [[Adobe Systems]], the publisher of Photoshop, [[Adobe Photoshop#Cultural impact|discourages use]] of "Photoshop" to refer to anything other than their photo editing software, to prevent their [[trademark]] from becoming [[Generic trademark|generic]].

==Humor==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Lukket-50s-computer-HOAX.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Photoshopped "early computing" hoax, [http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=1115586&amp;tt=voteresults&amp;ok=1 winner] of a photoshop contest [[Fark.com]], by user "lukket"; this image even fooled news publications as to its authenticity.]] --&gt;
A large part of the humor in many of these contests involves the use of [[internet meme]]s.

Such contests have recently seen increasing participation on many blogs and forums. The popular internet community [[Reddit]] has a community called /r/photoshopbattles devoted to the contests.

A more "underground" variety of these image manipulation jokes involves the blending of celebrity faces with nude or [[pornography|pornographic]] images, often combined with references to movies, music, magazines and other forms of related [[popular culture]].

==Photoshop tennis==
'''Photoshop tennis''' (also known as '''Photoshop Pong''' or '''Photoshop battle''' (similar in its function to a "[[Turntablism#Turntablist contests|DJ battle]]" in [[hip hop music]]) is a game played through sequential alternating photoshopping of an [[image]]. Photoshop tennis originated in graphics-related [[internet forum]]s in the late-1990s/early-2000s, and shares an earlier history with online image games such as [[SITO]]'s "PANIC" (started January, 1994).&lt;ref name="SITOpanic"&gt;[http://www.sito.org/docs/tennis.html SITO Panic and Photoshop Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was made popular by art director Jim Coudal in 2001 as "Photoshop Tennis".&lt;ref name="wiredtennis"/&gt; The matches on coudal.com have since been renamed '''Layer Tennis''',&lt;ref name="layertennis"&gt;[http://www.layertennis.com/ Coudal Partners' Layer Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt; as they are no longer restricted to the use of Adobe Photoshop.

Each match of Photoshop tennis is generally played with two competing players.&lt;ref name="wiredtennis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/09/47132

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players pick a starting image, or one is "served" by a player, then another player makes some sort of alteration to the image in any chosen image editor (matches are not exclusive to Adobe Photoshop). They then send the altered image to the other player or players, usually via [[e-mail]] or by posting the image to a Photoshop tennis forum, who then edits that image and sends it back to the first player. This process goes back and forth until a predetermined number of rounds have elapsed, or the players otherwise wish to end the game. When the final round is over, there may be an independent [[judge]] who determines who has played the best shots, and declares that person the winner, or players may play without a clear winner. Sometimes extra rules can be enforced, such as sticking to one particular [[Computer software|software package]], or keeping to a particular [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]. &lt;!-- // Context of this sentence?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from borrowing aspects from the emo, like the sideswept [[fringe (hair)|bangs]], the Pokemones also shared some aspects typical to the [[Punk (subculture)|punk]] and the local "hardcore" subculture. Pokemones were livelier, more extroverted than the emo and otaku stereotypes. Most Pokemones were teens. During parties they danced to [[reggaeton]] music, while kissing and groping with as many people (male or female) as they could, which they called ''poncear''.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; They made extensive use of the [[Internet]], trading photos of themselves on image-sharing site [[Fotolog]] and communicating through [[MSN Messenger]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;

Pokemones were usually from the Chilean middle and lower class. They were frequently juxtaposed against another group, the so-called ''peloláis'', well-to-do girls with long, straight, fairer hair from private, Catholic schools.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web

In January 2008, Internet messages surfaced urging violence against Pokemones (mainly because of borrowing aspects from other subcultures, such as emo hair, [[hip-hop]] clothes, and for using the [[Crip Walk|c-walk]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} People belonging to the subculture increasingly began to be attacked outside discos and pubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Qur'an Gate''' ({{lang-fa|دروازه قرآن}} ''Darvāzeh Qur'an'') is a historic gate in the north of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]].

It is located at the northeastern entrance of the city, on the way to [[Marvdasht]] and [[Isfahan]], between Baba Kouhi and Chehel Maqam Mountains near Allah-O-Akbar Gorge.&lt;ref name="shirazcity.org"&gt;[http://www.shirazcity.org/Home/sightseeing.html Shiraz Municipality&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232924/http://www.shirazcity.org/Home/sightseeing.html |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Gate was first built during the reign of [['Adud ad-Dawla]]. By the time of the [[Zand dynasty]], it had sustained a lot of damage, so it was restored and a small room on top was added, in which were kept hand-written Qur’āns by [[Sultan Ibrahim Bin Shahrukh Gurekani]]. The two Qur’āns are known as Hifdah-Man.&lt;ref name="shirazcity.org"/&gt; Travelers passing underneath the gates were believed to receive the blessing of the Holy Book as they began their trip or journey from Shiraz.

During the [[Qajar dynasty]], the gate was damaged by multiple earthquakes; it was later restored by Mohammad Zaki Khan Nouri.&lt;ref name="shirazcity.org"/&gt; In 1937 the two Qur’āns were taken from the gate and were taken to the Pars Museum in Shiraz, where they remain today. In 1949 the arch of the gate was restored by Hosein Igar, a merchant also known as E'temad Al-Tejar.&lt;ref name="shirazcity.org"/&gt; 

Today the gates are part of a city park where Shirazis relax and picnic during their leisure hours.

'''Rustin Spencer "Rust" Cohle''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[True Detective (season 1)|first season]] of the [[anthology series|anthology]] [[crime drama]] television series ''[[True Detective]]'' on [[HBO]]. He was created by series creator [[Nic Pizzolatto]] and is portrayed by [[Matthew McConaughey]]. Cohle works as a detective for the Louisiana State Homicide Unit, alongside his partner Martin "Marty" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]). The season follows Cohle and Hart's hunt for a [[serial killer]] in Louisiana, across 17 years.

Both the character of Rust Cohle and Matthew McConaughey's performance have received critical acclaim. McConaughey won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series]], and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alice|last=Vincent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10677470/True-Detective-Matthew-McConaughey-wrote-a-450-page-deconstruction-of-Rust-Cohles-life.html|title=''True Detective'': Matthew McConaughey wrote a 450-page deconstruction of Rust Cohle's life|work= ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Cohle is introduced as a gifted, but deeply troubled, detective from [[Texas]] who is transferred from working on regional drug task force to the [[Louisiana]] State Police near the end of 1994. After three months with the LSP, in January 1995, he and his partner are tasked with investigating a series of brutal, bizarre murders. A haunted, solitary [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], Cohle believes that life is meaningless, human beings are merely "sentient meat", and hope is self-delusion.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Long Bright Dark|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep1|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 12, 2014|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohle spends his free time obsessing over every detail of the crime, hoarding evidence in a storage locker and keeping extensive notes in a ledger, which earns him the derisive nickname "The Taxman" among his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Seeing Things|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep2|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 19, 2014|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually reveals Cohle's backstory. He was born in [[South Texas]] but raised in [[Alaska]] by his father after his parents divorced. He became a police detective in his 20s. Years before the main story arc, his two-year-old daughter, Sophia, was killed in a car accident, a tragedy that destroyed his marriage. Devastated by the loss, Cohle grew ever more unstable and unpredictable in his work, eventually killing a [[crystal meth]] addict who had injected his own child with the drug. His superiors offered him a chance to avoid prison by working as an undercover narcotics detective, which he did for four years; Cohle notes that this was twice as long as most undercover detectives are kept in rotation. During this assignment, Cohle became addicted to drugs, and eventually killed three cartel members in a shootout, while being shot multiple times himself.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"/&gt;

During his recovery, he was committed to a mental hospital in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. Upon his release, he was offered retirement with full pension, but he declined that offer in favor of transferring to a homicide division. His superiors then transferred him to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he lives alone and has no friends, living only for his work. He tries to remain sober, but he occasionally falls off the wagon because of the stress of his job and his grief for his daughter. Cohle also has [[synesthesia]] and suffers from [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] from his drug-using years as an undercover cop.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

The series takes place in two time periods: 1995–2002, in which Cohle and Hart work together to find the killer; and 2012, when Cohle, who has by now quit the police force and become an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], submits to an interview with Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]) and Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]) regarding the murders. Cohle sees through the detectives, and realizes that they think he is the killer.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Locked Room|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep3|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=January 26, 2014|season=1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character arc==
Cohle and Hart are assigned to investigate a murder in which the killer [[rape]]d and [[torture]]d the victim, Dora Lange, and attached a pair of antlers to her head after killing her.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark" /&gt; They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to "[[Carcosa]]" and a "Yellow King". In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

Cohle and Hart work the case for three months, during which they trace the murder to Reggie Ledoux ([[Charles Halford]]), a former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room" /&gt; To find more information, Cohle infiltrates a biker gang with ties to Ledoux, posing as a drug dealer representing a cartel in Mexico. He assists the gang in a home invasion so he can arrest the ringleader, Ginger ([[Joseph Sikora]]), and force him to lead them to Ledoux, who cooks meth for the biker gang. During the home invasion, a shootout ensues in which several people are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Who Goes There|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep4|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=February 9, 2014|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginger takes Cohle to meet Ledoux's cousin and "cook partner", Dewall ([[Ólafur Darri Ólafsson]]). The meeting does not go well, but Hart follows Dewall to Ledoux's [[meth lab]] and calls Cohle to tell him where it is. There, Hart and Cohle discover that Ledoux has kidnapped and tortured two children, and Hart kills Ledoux in a fit of rage as Cohle looks on. Dewall, meanwhile, is killed after he runs off and blows up on one of his own homemade mines. Cohle stages evidence to support Hart's story that Ledoux opened fire on them, forcing Hart to kill him in self-defense. The two are hailed as heroes, and receive commendations and promotions.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Secret Fate of All Life|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep5|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 16, 2014|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cohle interrogates a suspect who reveals that Ledoux and Dewall did not act alone.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life" /&gt; He tells Cohle that he will give them information about the "Yellow King" in return for a plea deal. Cohle wants to investigate this lead further, but the suspect kills himself in his cell that night, after receiving a phone call. Cohle becomes obsessed with reopening the case, and pursues several leads, including a private Christian school run by Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) that had been closed amid rumors of [[child molestation]]. Tuttle complains to Cohle's superiors, who suspend Cohle without pay and order him to leave the case closed. That night, Hart's wife Maggie ([[Michelle Monaghan]]) shows up at Cohle's apartment and seduces him in order to get back at Hart for repeatedly cheating on her. Hart finds out and gets into a fistfight with Cohle in front of the entire department. Cohle quits the force the same day, and becomes a drifter and an alcoholic, supporting himself as a part-time bartender.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Haunted Houses|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep6|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 23, 2014|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rust Cohle 2012.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cohle in 2012]]
In 2012, murders similar to those from 1995 begin again, Cohle is seen in the vicinity of the body, arousing the suspicion of Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania. They believe that Cohle was the killer in 1995, because he led Hart to every lead they had and seemed to know everything about the killer's frame of mind. Gilbough and Papania now believe that Cohle is committing the new murders as well. They interview Cohle and Hart, who both refuse to cooperate once the purpose of the interview becomes clear.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses" /&gt;

Cohle meets with Hart and tells him that he has found evidence leading to the killer. Hart is skeptical, and still resentful of Cohle for having sex with Maggie, but Cohle convinces him to help with the investigation by showing him a videotape he stole from Rev. Tuttle's home. The video is over 20 years old, and shows numerous masked men raping and torturing Marie Fontenot, a missing child whose name had come up in their investigation 17 years earlier. Cohle and Hart track down the original case's chief investigating officer, Steve Geraci ([[Michael Harney]]), and interrogate him at gunpoint. Geraci tells them that his superior, the late Sheriff Ted Childress, ordered him to halt the investigation; Childress was one of Tuttle's relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=After You've Gone|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep7|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=March 2, 2014|season=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon discover that the Tuttle and Childress families — to whom both Reggie and Dewall Ledoux belong — are related, and have long histories of child abuse and murder. They ultimately discover that the killer is a Childress, and go to the late sheriff's home to investigate.&lt;ref name="Form and Void"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Form and Void|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep8|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= March 9, 2014|season=1|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohle and Hart go to the Childress house, where they find that the sheriff's son, Errol ([[Glenn Fleshler]]), is the killer, and discover the remains of his father tied up in a shed. They also encounter Betty Childress ([[Ann Dowd]]), his mentally disabled half-sister, with whom he is having an [[incest]]uous relationship. Cohle pursues Childress into the catacombs behind the house, which Childress identifies as Carcosa. Cohle discovers an idol draped in yellow and covered in skulls — the "Yellow King" — and has a hallucination of a spiraling vortex, the same vortex that had been drawn on many of the victims over the past 17 years. Childress stabs Cohle in the gut and also attacks Hart, but Cohle saves his partner by shooting Childress in the head, killing him. Gilborough and Papania, whom Hart had called, arrive at the scene. With the evidence Hart and Cohle collected, they connect Childress to dozens of murders, including Dora Lange's.&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

Cohle falls into a coma, during which he feels the loving presence of his father and daughter. He later wakes up in hospital and leaves with Hart, and tells him that, "Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
McConaughey received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Cohle, and has won and been nominated for several awards,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/awards Matthew McConaughey - Awards] www.imdb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; including:

[[File:Salón de Mayo 1967. Havana. Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Salón de Mayo Billboard_1967. Havana. Cuba]]
The '''Salón de Mayo''' (May Salon) was an art exhibition held in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], in July 1967. It took its name from the [[Salon de Mai]], an artists collective founded during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]]. It was organized by [[Carlos Franqui]] with the assistance of such artists as [[Wifredo Lam]], [[René Portocarrero]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Pablo Picasso]].

The exhibition presented works by more than a hundred artists and represented rival schools of twentieth-century art: early modernists (Picasso, Miro, Magritte); the next generation (Lam, Calder, [[Jacques Hérold]], [[Stanley Hayter]]); and postwar ([[Asger Jorn]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Jorge Soto (artist)|Jorge Soto]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982 |date=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA154&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lam wrote to Franqui in anticipation of the event of his hopes:
{{quote|...that young painters and sculptors would be able to work in a socialist country such as Cuba and enjoy the spontaneity of creating something so that they would have memories of the pleasure they experienced working in Cuba just for the sake of working.}}
Some artists were invited to create works in Cuba in the weeks preceding the exhibition, with those works donated to the Cuban government to form the nucleus of the collection of a contemporary art museum. The museum was never constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982| page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA161&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative engagement was a principle theme of the event. On 19 July 1967, more than eighty artists and writers contributed to a mural, ''Cuba colectiva'', in front of the Cuba Pavilion in Havana, adding either images or text inside spiral bands that circled outward from a central image of "rhomboid heads" by Lam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982|pages=155–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Paris newspaper described the event:&lt;ref name=sims156&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA156&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...with a speed that is typically Cuban, a giant white canvas was hung in the outdoors, practically in the street, in the humid night air of the tropics ... It had the feel of a somewhat surrealist magic ceremony which was celebrated in the midst of a popular festival. Although not a drop of alcohol was consumed, the event was intoxicating}}
In Franqui's words the enterprise represented:&lt;ref name=sims156/&gt;
{{quote|a collective art, a socialist art, an art of liberty, of revolution, imaginative, convulsive, revolutionary, popular ... For the first time, during the night, revolutionary artists and the people created an imaginative reality.}}
The [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] had dreamed of "a revolutionary imagination that could support social change" and this event, in the estimation of one art historian, "delivered the opportunity for Surrealist adherents to participate satisfactorily–if only briefly–in an act of solidarity with an actual revolutionary regime ... that accommodated both sensuality and revolutionary rectitude."&lt;ref name=sims156/&gt; The radical poet [[Alain Jouffroy]] wrote:&lt;ref name=sims156/&gt;
{{quote|The Collective Mural of Cuba represents a new cultural and historical reality through which the individual unconscious is for the first time in direct dialogue with the collective political conscious. The ideology of Che [Guevara] was present, as well as a sensuality, a festiveness, a delirium, a tenderness, friendship ... and it is enough that the Cuban revolution set the context in which revolutionary artists and intellectuals met, where hope for a reconciliation of the subversive imagination and revolutionary political reason become a reality. The riskiest venture for man today, which would allow him to communicate most directly with pleasure and death, is to participate in and dedicate himself to revolution.}}
The Salón was a unique event under a regime that, in the words of a writer who was later imprisoned, "used every imaginable pretext to keep culture on a short leash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Padilla|first1=Herberto|title=Self-Portrait of the Other: A Memoir|date=1990|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_pGtjnmLy4C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a demonstration of vigorous self-expression, the Salón de Mayo has also been interpreted as a rejection of the Soviet Union's approach to artistic endeavor, an assertion on the part of Communist Cuba of its independence from the Soviet model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Horowitz|first1=Irving Louis|title=Cuban Communism|date=1988|publisher=Transaction Books|page=462 |edition=Sixth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hx2_y7Vu-PUC&amp;pg=PA462&amp;|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Cuba, the Salón de Mayo represented the high point of free artistic expression.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">The '''Sarmish Gorge''' (better known as '''Sarmishsay''') is located on the southern slopes of the [[Karatau]] mountain range, 30–40&amp;nbsp;km to the north-east of the city of [[Navoi]] (Kermine) in [[Uzbekistan]]. The mountain range of the Karatau is considered to be one of the western spurs of the [[Turkestan]] Mountain Ridge of the Western [[Tien Shan]]. To the south of the Karatau lies the [[Zarafshan]] Valley, bordering the [[Kyzyl Kum]] desert. Since ancient times, the Karatau area has been an intersection of seasonal migration routes for people and animals.

Sarmishsay is the largest of many picturesque gorges along the southern slopes of the Karatau range. This place is famous for various ancient monuments of anthropogenic activity concentrated in an area of about 20&amp;nbsp;km². The sights include [[flint]] quarries, mines, old settlements, burial mounds, crypts and petroglyphs, including monuments of the [[Middle Ages]], early [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]].

There are over 4,000 [[petroglyph]]s still intact in Sarmishsay. They are mainly located at the beginning of a narrow stone canyon of 2-2.5&amp;nbsp;km (approx. 1.5 miles) long. The paintings are made on vertical, and sometimes on horizontal outcroppings of reddish [[sandstone]] streaked with [[slate]] and [[limestone]].

Next to the petroglyphs the burial grounds of ancient [[nomads]] and some [[pagan]] altars are located. Since ancient times this territory has been a sacred zone, where locals performed their sacred ceremonies on holy days.

The Petroglyphs of Sarmishsay&lt;ref name="sarmyshsaypetroglyphs"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.people-travels.com/uzbekistan-cities/navoi/sarmyshsay-gorge-and-asrlar-sadosi-2013-as-a-main-national-festival.html| title=Sarmyshsay petroglyphs| accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; give quite a comprehensive picture of local fauna thousands of years ago. Today most of the animals they portray, which once inhabited this area, have disappeared, unable to compete for food with man and domestic livestock. Most of animals included in the stone "book" of the Sarmish Gorge now are extinct.

==Synopsis==
Jin Yu ([[Cecilia Liu]]), an orphan girl of [[Xiongnu]] ethnicity, was raised by wolves in the desert, until a [[Han Chinese]] decided to adopt her. Two years later, following the death of her adoptive father due to political changes, she decides to follow the man's wish and flees to [[Jian'an]], the capital of Western [[Han Dynasty]], changing her name to Xin Yue. Along her journey, she meets Mo Xun ([[Hu Ge]]), a calm and kind disabled man, and later the handsome, cold general Wei Wu Ji ([[Eddie Peng]]). In Jian'an, thanks to her determination, Xin Yue becomes the head of a dance house and helps a quiet girl named Qin Xiang ([[Fala Chen]]) to meet the Emperor. Qin Xiang then turns into the Emperor's most powerful concubine and schemes against Xin Yue. In the meantime, Xin Yue's past with the Xiongnu catches up with her when she meets her childhood friend, Hu Wei Li (Qin Hao), who is now the Ruler of the Damo plains.

While battling against the onslaught of her painful childhood memories and the political intrigue of the royal family, Xin Yue must also choose between Mo Xun and Wei Wu Ji.

==Production==
Filming for the series started on 8 March 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/p/2012-03-02/16593571148.shtml|script-title=zh:图文：《大漠谣》开机-合影|date=March 2, 2012|work=Sina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on 2 July 2012. Subsequent review by [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television|SARFT]] however, claimed the series of falsifying historical accounts. Extensive changes were thus required, resetting the entire premise to take place in a fictional era in a fictional country. Character names from the novel which were based on Chinese historical figures were changed, and dialogues and subtitling were revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2014-09-16/02304209210.shtml|script-title=zh: 《大漠谣》三易名 盘点命途坎坷的剧|date=September 16, 2014|work=Sina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early titles of the series were ''Ballad of the Desert'' (大漠谣, ''Dàmò yáo'', also known as ''A Story of the Wolf Girl''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20120830/1121572659_31.html|script-title=zh:《大漠谣》新一版剧照 绝色佳人刘诗诗貌美倾城|date=August 30, 2012|work=Hunan TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Romance of the Desert'' (大漠奇缘, ''Dàmò qí yuán'') and ''The Legend of Moon and Star'' (星月传奇, ''Xīng yuè chuánqí'').

'''''The City of Beautiful Nonsense''''' was a best-selling novel written by [[Ernest Temple Thurston]]. It became the inspiration for two films (see below for details). It was originally published by [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1909,&lt;ref name="Books and Persons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|title=Books and Persons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aa29jG22CoMC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=September 19, 2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-4510-0667-4|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because the [[copyright]] has expired, the text of the book is now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Thurston1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Temple Thurston|title=The city of beautiful nonsense|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqbPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 17, 2012|year=1915|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a "new and illustrated" edition, with illustrations by Emile Verpilleux, published a year later in 1910. It may fairly be described as a sentimental novel: Temple Thurston himself wrote that "To many, from the first page to the last, it had not the faintest conception of reality, and indeed has earned for me the classification of sentimentalist". This was in the Author's Note to the sequel, entitled ''The World of Wonderful Reality'', published a decade later in 1919. His obituary in ''The Times'' (20 March 1933) stated that "there were those who might suggest that sentimentalism was too evident in Temple Thurston's work".  As well as being a vehicle for Edwardian romanticism, the novel shares the Roman Catholic faith of its author with its main characters.  It is a tale of two cities: mainly Edwardian London – the sidelights on life in London for the shabby genteel are interesting – but also Venice.

==Films==
The first film based on the novel was ''[[The City of Beautiful Nonsense (1919 film)|The City of Beautiful Nonsense]]'', a [[silent movie]] released in 1919,&lt;ref name="Advance: (1920)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advance: (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXM0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA291|accessdate=September 17, 2012|year=1920|publisher=Congregational Publishing Society|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]], [[Chrissie White]] and [[Henry Vibart]]

The second film was a [[Sound film|talkie]], released in 1935 as ''[[City of Beautiful Nonsense (1935 film)|City of Beautiful Nonsense]]''. It starred [[Emlyn Williams]], [[Sophie Stewart]] and [[Eve Lister]]. Both were filmed and produced in the United Kingdom.

"'''The Streets of Cairo'''" or "'''The Poor Little Country Maid'''", also known as "'''the snake charmer song'''", is a well-known melody in the United States. Alternate titles for children's songs using this melody include "The Girls in France" and "The Southern Part of France".&lt;ref name="shira"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Desultor/&gt; This song is often associated with the [[hoochie coochie]] belly dance.

== History ==
[[File:Streets of Cairo.jpg|thumb|1895 sheet music cover for "The Streets of Cairo"]]
Purportedly the original version of the song was written by [[Sol Bloom]], a showman (and later a U.S. Congressman) who was the entertainment director of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893. It included an attraction called "A Street in Cairo" produced by Gaston Akoun, which featured snake charmers, camel rides, and a scandalous dancer known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]]. Songwriter [[James Thornton (songwriter)|James Thornton]] penned the words and music to his own version of this melody, "Streets Of Cairo or The Poor Little Country Maid". Copyrighted in 1895, it was made popular by his wife Lizzie Cox, who used the stage name Bonnie Thornton.&lt;ref name=shira/&gt; The oldest known recording of the song is from 1895, performed by [[Dan W. Quinn|Dan Quinn]] (Berliner Discs 171-Z).&lt;ref name=berliner/&gt;

The first five notes of the song are similar to the beginning of a French song named "Colin Prend Sa Hotte" (1719), which in turn resembles note for note an Algerian or Arabic song titled "Kradoutja".&lt;ref name=straightdope/&gt;

The melody is often heard when something that is connected with [[desert]]s, [[Arabia]], Persia, [[Egypt]], [[belly dancing]], or [[snake charming]] is being displayed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The song was also recorded as "They Don't Wear Pants in the Southern Part of France" by John Bartles, the version sometimes played by radio host [[Dr. Demento]].

==Travadja La Moukère==
In France, there is a popular song that immigrants from [[Algeria]] brought back in the 1960s called "Travadja La Moukère" (from ''trabaja la mujer'', which means "the woman works" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), which uses the same Hoochy Coochy tune.{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} Its original tune, said to have been based on an original Arab song, was created around 1850 and subsequently adopted by the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Partial lyrics :

: Travadja La Moukère
: Travadja Bono
: Trempe ton cul dans la soupière
: Si c'est chaud c'est que ça brûle
: Si ça brûle c'est que c'est chaud !

Translation:
: Travaja La Moukère
: Bono Travaja
: Soak your ass in the tureen
: If it is hot it burns
: If it burns it's that it's hot!

==In popular culture==

===Music===
Since the piece is not copyrighted, it has been used as a basis for several songs, especially in the early 20th century:

*"Hoolah! Hoolah!"
*"Dance of the Midway"
*"Coochi-Coochi Polka"
*"Danse Du Ventre"
*"In My Harem" by [[Irving Berlin]]
*"Kutchy Kutchy"&lt;ref name="shira"/&gt;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;''Strut, Miss Lizzie''&lt;/nowiki&gt; by [[Henry Creamer|Creamer]] and [[Turner Layton|Layton]]
*In Italy, the melody is often sung with the words ''"Te ne vai o no? Te ne vai sì o no?"'' (''"Are you leaving or not? Are you leaving, yes or no?"''). That short tune is used to invite an annoying person to move along, or at least to shut up.

Later popular songs that include all or part of the melody include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whosampled.com/sampled/Sol%20Bloom/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bilibili.com/video/av8860777/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
* In [[Charles Lamont]]'s 1932 short film ''[[War Babies (1932 film)|War Babies]]'', the first film in the [[Baby Burlesks]] series, the song is briefly used while [[Shirley Temple]]'s character Charmaine is dancing around in Buttermilk Pete's Cafe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* In [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s ''[[Sons of the Desert]]'' (1933), it is heard briefly in a belly dancer scene at the beginning of the convention.
* It is heard in the beginning of [[Patrice Leconte]]'s short film "Le laboratoire de l'angoisse" (1971).
* In [[Emir Kusturica]]'s 1993 movie [[Arizona Dream]], the tune is being played several times with accordion by Grace.

===Children's culture===
The tune is used for a 20th-century American children's song with – like many unpublished songs of child folk culture – countless variations as the song is passed from child to child over considerable lengths of time and geography, the one constant being that the versions are almost always [[Obscenity|smutty]]. One variation, for example, is:
: There's a place in France
: Where the ladies wear no pants
: But the men don't care
: 'cause they don't wear underwear.&lt;ref name="shira"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Desultor/&gt;
or a similar version:
: There's a place in France
: Where the naked ladies dance
: There's a hole in the wall
: Where the boys can see it all

Another [[World War II]]-era variation is as follows:
: When your mind goes blank
: And you're dying for a wank
: And Hitler's playing snooker with your balls
: In the German [[prison|nick]]
: They hang you by your dick
: And put dirty pictures on the walls

'''Tina Carter''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', portrayed by [[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]. She first appeared on 18 November 2013, and was introduced as the sister of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]). She was the first of a set of new characters that expanded the [[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carter family]] in 2013, headed by executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] (although Tina was introduced by executive producer [[Lorraine Newman]]). Tina and Bradshaw-White's casting were announced on 19 September 2013. The character was previously mentioned on-screen due to her daughter, [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]) appearing on the show in 2010. Tina's storylines mostly revolve around her relationship with her sister Shirley and same-sex relationships with [[Tosh Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), who physically abuses her, and [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), which ends when Sonia falls out of love with her. Tina also accidentally runs over [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace) and has sex with Janet's father, [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]). In a later storyline, Tina feuded with [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) when it was revealed that he drugged and attacked her when she was a teenager.

== Storylines ==
[[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) tracks his ex-girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) to Tina's rundown flat, after she has been forced out of [[Walford]] by criminal [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]). Shirley agrees to return with Phil, and gives Tina money to escape her abusive girlfriend. She does this, and joins Shirley in Walford. They struggle to find somewhere to live as Tina and Phil do not get on, and end up sleeping on [[Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) floor. Billy develops a crush on Tina, which leads her to reject his advances as she is a [[lesbian]], despite having been married to a man in the past and having a teenage daughter, [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]), who previously lived with Shirley in Walford.

Tina encourages Shirley to get back in touch with Shirley's estranged son (then believed to be their brother)  [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]). They visit his pub in [[Watford]], but his wife [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) is cold towards them so Tina steals money from a bingo competition going on. Shirley returns the money and reconciles with Mick, who then moves his family to Walford by buying the local pub, [[The Queen Victoria]] (the Vic). Tina and Shirley move in with the family and help run the pub, although Tina gets a job at the local café soon after. Tina befriends her colleague [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]). Tina sleeps with Billy when drunk, but tells him that she does not have feelings for him and they agree to be just friends. She is delighted when her father [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]), who the rest of the family are estranged from, makes amends with his children and moves into the Vic with them.

Tina realises she is still in love with her abusive ex-girlfriend, [[Tosh Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), and reconciles with her. She brings her to a family dinner, but Tosh and Shirley argue and after Shirley tries to stop Tina from seeing Tosh. Tina rebels and starts a full relationship with Tosh again, with them eventually moving into a flat nearby with [[Aleks Shirovs]] ([[Kristian Kiehling]]) and [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]). Tina supports Sonia with marital issues, and passes up a night out with Tosh to be with her. They share a passionate kiss, but afterwards decide to just be friends. Tosh demands that Tina and Sonia end their friendship when she finds out, and accidentally causes Tina to hit her head on a door frame in a rage. They reconcile and Tosh tells Tina she wants to have a baby. Tina is reserved at first due to her bad parentage of Zsa Zsa, but eventually agrees and supports Tosh when she is inseminated. This is expensive and Tina begins dealing drugs from the café with the help of her aunt, [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]), but they are forced to stop when Mick and Shirley find out. Tosh is upset when Tina's colleague [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) tells her about the drug dealing, and convinces Tina to raise the money by working extra shifts instead.

Tosh becomes pregnant through the insemination and they announce this at Stan's birthday party, although she loses the baby soon after. Depressed at this, Tosh accepts Tina's nephew [[Dean Wicks]]' ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) offer of being a sperm donor, without Tina's knowledge or consent. Tina is angry when she finds out, but forgives Tosh and supports her when she discovers she is not pregnant again. They fall out when Tosh accuses her of not wanting a baby, and Tosh punches her after taunting her. Tina again forgives her and decides to try and reconcile Tosh with her family by arranging a lunch for them. Her mother [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#Judy Mackintosh|Judy]] ([[Jo Martin]]) comes, but her father makes an excuse, uncomfortable with Tosh's sexuality due to his Christian faith. Judy storms out when Tina tells her about their attempts to have a baby, upsetting Tosh further. Tina is devastated when Stan reveals that he is dying from [[prostate cancer]], and is even more upset when she learns that Stan knew about his illness 3 years prior to him telling the family. She and Tosh urge Stan to see a private doctor, however he reveals that Stan's cancer is too aggressive to be cured, which leaves Tina distraught. Tina supports Sonia when she falls ill, and she confides in her that she spent the money from the charity calendar she organised on a [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric band]] in [[Bulgaria]], to impress her husband [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] (James Bye). Tosh returns home while Sonia is hiding in Tina's room, but she manages to sneak out before Tosh realises. When Martin fails to turn up to the Christmas party for Sonia's group "Fat Blasters", Sonia decides to announce her actions but Tina urges her not to; however, before she can, she collapses. When the paramedics arrive, Tina reveals Sonia has had an operation to fit a gastric band, which shocks Carol and Martin. Babe leads Tosh to believe that Tina is having an affair with Sonia and when Tina denies this, Tosh viciously beats her. The next day, Tina decides that she cannot forgive Tosh for what she has done and thinks it best to move back to the Vic, while Tosh leaves Walford when Tina breaks up with her. Mick stops Tina assisting Stan's requested suicide. Tina is devastated by Stan's death and delivers the eulogy. Tina and Sonia become partners, splitting up briefly when Tina finds out Sonia cheated with her estranged husband Martin. They reconcile when Sonia helps Linda after she goes into premature labour.

Tina and Sonia enjoy their relationship despite Tina's jealously. Sonia realises that she wants another child and tells Tina. Tina is shocked and tells Sonia that she does not want children after messing up with Zsa Zsa. Sonia is angry when Tina drunkenly embarrasses Sonia's daughter [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) when she is singing in public. When Sonia and her co-workers win a Pride of Walford award, Sonia decides she does not want to speak but Tina, drunk again, takes the microphone and humiliates Sonia by revealing she had previously stolen charity money. Tina and Sonia argue, and Tina then confides in [[Sophie Dodd]] ([[Poppy Rush]]) and they kiss and then have sex. She goes to Mick for advice and when she returns home, she starts packing but Sonia then appears and reveals that she has found a lump on her breast so decides not to tell Sonia about Sophie. However, when she goes home, Sophie is with Sonia, asking why Tina has not replied to her messages and has told Sonia everything. Sonia shouts at Tina to leave, but after they talk, they reunite and Tina promises to discuss her feelings and help out more. Sonia tells Tina that she wants a double mastectomy regardless of the result of her tests.

Tina is fired from the café when her bosses [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) decide to sell their restaurant, but eventually they decide not to sell and Tina gets her job back. Sonia starts to have doubts about her relationship with Tina. Sonia returns from a doctor's appointment to discover that Tina has moved her mother, [[Sylvie Carter]] ([[Linda Marlowe]]), who suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]], into the house. Sonia vows to tell Tina their relationship is over but when Tina says she wants to care for Sylvie, Sonia promises to help. However, when Sonia arranges a Carter family dinner for Sylvie's sake, Martin tells her that Tina is not treating her properly. Martin tells Tina to be there for Sonia, mentioning Sonia's elective breast surgery that Tina did not know about. Tina asks Sonia about it, and Sonia says she cannot talk to Tina as she never acts grown up, so Tina insists that she can change. Tina considers asking Social Services for more help caring for Sylvie, but after a good day with her mother, Tina believes the family are the only people who should help, leaving Sonia frustrated. When Tina is forced to leave Sylvie alone, she becomes scared and bites Sonia when she gets home, but Sonia hides this from Tina. Later, Sonia admits to [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) that she no longer loves Tina, and the next day, Sonia ends their relationship saying she has fallen out of love; Tina is devastated and cries to Linda. Sonia then leaves for a new job. Tina struggles to cope with caring for Sylvie and tells Shirley how lonely she feels; Shirley invites Tina and Sylvie to move in with her. Tina is later annoyed when she discovers Shirley is allowing Sylvie to sleep all day to avoid caring for her, and when Shirley goes to prison to help alleviate Mick's debts, Tina accuses her of doing so just to avoid Sylvie. Tina then struggles on her own, and eventually decides to place her in care. The day before she is due to be asseessed, Tina throws Sylvie a party. After Tina puts Sylvie to bed that night, she gets in the bath and ends up being electrocuted. Tina is devastated by her mother's death and is then forced to move out of the flat, so she stays with [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) for a while, before moving into The Vic.

Tina is attacked by a group of men with knives but she escapes in her car. Shaken, Tina accidentally hits someone with her car but she drives off, thinking it was Dot's cat, [[Dave (EastEnders)|Dave]], unaware the person she hit was Billy's daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace). When Tina finds out that she ran over Janet, she becomes plagued with guilt. She confides in Shirley, who orders Tina not to go to the police. When Billy and his fiancée, [[Honey Mitchell]] ([[Emma Barton]]), have an argument, Billy finds solace in Tina and they spend the night together. The next morning, Billy feels guilty and begs Tina not to tell Honey. Tina agrees, not wanting to destroy Billy's relationship after putting his daughter in hospital. Tina confesses to Billy that she hit  Janet. Billy agrees to accompany Tina to the police station, but Shirley stops them, declaring that if Tina confesses to the police, she will tell Honey about their one-night-stand. Shirley later gives Tina a ticket to Spain for two weeks. Although Tina doesn't want to go, Shirley forces her to leave, saying she needs to clear her head. When she returns, Tina tells Shirley she could be pregnant by Billy, but a pregnancy test is negative.

Tina is involved in the break-up of Billy and Honey after a mix-up in the launderette when Honey receives Linda's underwear with her own washing, and sees Billy and Tina hugging, then accuses Billy of having an affair with Tina, forcing Billy to admit to the one-night stand. Shirley sees Honey and Tina talking and assumes that Honey knows Tina hit Janet so reveals this. Tina helps a pregnant girl, [[Georgi (EastEnders)|Georgi]] (Holly Donovan), in the café and finds out she is a friend of Zsa Zsa's. Tina delivers Georgi's baby and then calls Zsa Zsa. Tina tries to reunite Billy and Honey but it backfires when Honey flirts with Jack instead. Tina then visits Zsa Zsa and when she returns, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), an old friend of Mick's, is visiting the Carters. She goes with him to a 1980s night and he is annoyed when she gets a woman's phone number instead of him so he requests the song "[[We Call It Acieed]]" and when it plays, Tina has a terrifying flashback. Tina breaks down at work; she tells Sonia that when she was 19 or 20, she would play a game with Stuart and his friends that involved mild "torture", but once she was locked in a car boot, tied up and gagged, and feared she would die when she smelt burning; Tina realises that the same song was playing in the car that day and believes that Stuart is responsible. She tells Stuart this, but he says it must have been someone else and he will find out who it was, to which Tina agrees. Sonia encourages Tina to tell Mick about what happened to her but when she goes to tell him, Stuart has already spoken to him and Linda. Mick says he will help find out who did it, Stuart mentions that Tina was called a "slag" by the person who did it despite her not telling him, so she accuses him again but he still denies it. Tina gets drunk in the club and gets angry when someone calls her a "slag", she goes missing and Billy tells the Carters what happened in the club. Linda later finds Tina at the police station. Mick then overhears as Tina tells Linda that it was Stuart. Mick finds Tina's old diary and they recall what else happened that day; they remember getting new football kits and Tina recalls her abuser wearing shirt number 9, which Mick says Stuart was wearing that day. Mick confronts Stuart who still denies everything. Stuart keys his own car, claiming that Tina has done it, and accuses her of starting a hate campaign against him. He makes various threats and teases her, saying she is lying about everything and that one day she will wake up in the boot of a car again. He sings "We Call It Acieed" whilst goading her with a wrench, which she takes and whacks him on the head with it, knocking him out. Tina is arrested and tells the police about being locked in the car but they ignore this as she has no witnesses. Tina is released while Stuart tells various people that Tina attacked him. Stuart decides to flip a coin to decide if he should retract his statement, while Mick tries to track down old friends to find witnesses for Tina.  Stuart comes to the Vic and says he was going to withdraw his statement but Shirley attacks Stuart and he proclaims that Tina will go down. However, one of Mick's old friends, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Dylan Box|Dylan Box]] (Ricci Harnett), visits and says Stuart once did the same to him as he did to Tina and has already reported him to the police. Stuart is arrested but continues to deny everything.

== Creation and development ==

===Casting and introduction===
Tina was introduced as the sister of established regular character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who has appeared on the show since 2006. Tina's daughter [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] previously appeared in 2010, played by [[Emer Kenny]], and mentioned her mother as living in Spain with her new husband. Two days before the character's arrival was announced, Treadwell-Collins posted a photo to Twitter of a bomber jacket with the name Tina on the back, sparking speculation that Shirley's sister had been cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a516350/eastenders-boss-reveals-new-character-arrival.html|title='EastEnders' boss reveals new character arrival?|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 September 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting of [[Luisa Bradshaw-White]] was announced on 19 September 2013, around two months before her first on-screen appearance.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy Tina Carter introduced"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a516615/eastenders-luisa-bradshaw-white-to-play-shirleys-sister-tina.html|title='EastEnders': Luisa Bradshaw-White to play Shirley's sister Tina|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=19 September 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina is described as 'loud, brash, cheeky and full of energy', with the potential to lead Shirley astray. Bradshaw-White expressed her excitement over the role, commenting that she was particularly excited as 'the energy between Tina and Shirley is explosive'.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy Tina Carter introduced"/&gt; The role was changed for Bradshaw-White; Tina was initially described as 'an overweight 50-year-old who's past it'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a530784/eastenders-newcomer-tina-carter-role-was-rewritten-for-me.html|title='EastEnders' newcomer: 'Tina Carter role was rewritten for me'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=12 November 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tina first appeared when Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) tracked her sister Shirley to her rundown flat, after she had been forced out of Walford by bad boy Carl White (Daniel Coonan). He convinced Shirley to return with him, and Tina followed soon after, escaping an abusive ex-girlfriend, Tosh; Rebecca Scroggs was introduced in this role in February of the following year.

===Relationships===

====Carter family====
Tina was introduced as the first of a new set of Carters, the family of Shirley, and therefore has a large amount of on-screen interaction with her family. Executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] compared Tina to her sister Shirley, saying that she was 'loud and brash' like her. She also seems to be a liability like Shirley, having parented Zsa Zsa badly and letting her fly of the handle at times.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy Tina Carter introduced"/&gt; Despite this, Tina is more forgiving than her sister; for example, she forgives their father [[Stan Carter]], played by [[Timothy West]], for his bad parenting and alcoholism when they were children, whereas Shirley still holds a grudge against him. She has a good relationship with her nephew [[Mick Carter|Mick]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) and his family, and shares a flat at one time with Shirley's son [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]).

====Sonia Fowler====
Tina became friends with [[Sonia Fowler]], played by [[Natalie Cassidy]], when she returned to the soap. Sonia, who was experiencing troubles in her marriage, received counsel from kindly Sonia and they shared a kiss, as Sonia is [[bisexual]]. However, due to her relationship with Tosh Mackintosh, the kiss went no further. Bradshaw-White revealed that fans wanted her character and Sonia to become a couple, due to their equally kindly nature.&lt;ref name="Tina and Sonia to be together"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flint|first1=Hanna|title=Luisa Bradshaw-White claims fans want Tina and Sonia to be together|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2641932/EastEnders-Luisa-Bradshaw-White-wears-stylish-monochrome-cardigan-claims-fans-want-Tina-Carter-Sonia-Fowler-together.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their friendship ended when Tosh found out about the kiss and ordered them to cut ties.&lt;ref name="Tina faces music over Sonia kiss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Tina faces the music over Sonia kiss|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a574898/eastenders-tina-faces-the-music-over-sonia-kiss-spoiler-pictures.html#~oX8oR26Jzang6p|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tosh Mackintosh and domestic violence====
Tina's past relationship with an abusive ex-girlfriend was hinted at when she was introduced. On 9 February 2014, it was announced Rebecca Scroggs would play [[Tosh Mackintosh]], her firefighter ex who she would reconcile with. Tina tracked down Tosh after realising she still loved her. About their relationship, Scroggs said that 'there's something about Tina that Tosh is really drawn to', but Tina's family 'put pressure' on their relationship.&lt;ref name="Rebecca Scroggs cast as Tina's ex"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rigby|first1=Sam|title=Rebecca Scroggs cast as Tosh Mackintosh|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a549919/eastenders-rebecca-scroggs-cast-as-tinas-ex-girlfriend.html#~oX8poW1o7fYkN2|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirley was Tosh's main advisory and locked Tina in the lounge of the Vic to try and stop her seeing Tosh after a memorable showdown in which Tosh sprayed Shirley to the ground with her fireman's hose. Despite turbulence in their relationship, Scroggs insisted that 'the love between Tina and Tosh is very real'. Bradshaw-White admitted that both her and Scroggs struggled to find the chemistry with Tina and Tosh, due to their drawn out fictional history.&lt;ref name="Tina and Sonia to be together"/&gt;

Several months into their relationship, Tosh was seen pushing to Tina to have a baby. Bradshaw-White said that Tosh pressures Tina into having a baby, telling her 'either they start a family - or she goes'. Tina was a bad mother to her daughter Zsa Zsa due to being addicted to drugs at the time, but Tosh insisted that Tina would be a better mother now as she 'really mothers everyone in the family'.&lt;ref name="Tosh to give Tina baby ultimatum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Tosh to give Tina baby ultimatum|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a575310/eastenders-tosh-to-give-tina-ultimatum-over-baby.html#~oX8r4cU03SopRH|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Tosh would become pregnant,&lt;ref name="Baby news for Tina Carter and Tosh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Baby news for Tina Carter and Tosh|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a593797/eastenders-baby-news-for-tina-carter-and-tosh.html#~oX8rVZ4CSn3iDS|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she was seen to lose the baby soon afterwards. This caused Tosh to become violent towards Tina again, hitting her on two separate occasions.&lt;ref name="Tosh hits Tina"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Tosh' violence to Tina a cause for concern|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a604646/eastenders-toshs-violence-shocks-tina-carters-flatmates.html#~oX8stHp6TJrl61|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the latter, more extreme attack, Jo Harvey Barringer of the [[Broken Rainbow (organisation)|Broken Rainbow UK]] commented that 'the violent punch Tosh (dealt) was calculated to put Tina in her place and to punish Tina for challenging Tosh's dominance in the relationship; a reminder that Tosh was in control and held all the power'.&lt;ref name="Tosh punches Tina consequences"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Love|first1=Ryan|title=LGBT domestic violence plot praised|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a606442/eastenders-lgbt-domestic-abuse-plot-praised-following-tina-tosh-clash.html#~oX8t32qjtoERFJ|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In a poll from Digital Spy soon after Tina's introduction, Tina was voted the fourth favourite new Carter, behind Mick (Dyer), [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny]] ([[Sam Strike]]) and [[Nancy Carter|Nancy]] ([[Maddy Hill]]).&lt;ref name="Favourite Carters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Which of the new Carters is your favourite?|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a541266/eastenders-which-of-the-new-carters-is-your-favourite-poll.html#~oX8uGLDTqiTtWT|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EastEnders'' and Bradshaw-White have been praised for the Tina and Tosh domestic violence story by the charity [[Broken Rainbow (organisation)|Broken Rainbow UK]], who said that the story helped "portray the very real experiences our service users tell us about" in the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref name="Tosh punches Tina consequences"/&gt; The relationship between Tina and Sonia has also been praised by fans, who prefer Sonia to Tosh.&lt;ref name="Tina and Sonia to be together"/&gt; In July 2018, Bradshaw-White was longlisted for the "Best Actress" award at [[Inside Soap Awards|The Inside Soap Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a862268/inside-soap-awards-2018-full-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|title=Full list of nominations for the Inside Soap Awards 2018|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 July 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a868513/coronation-street-inside-soap-awards-shortlist-2018/ |title=Inside Soap Awards 2018: Coronation Street tops the shortlist with 18 nominations |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''visual arts''' are [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]] such as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], [[design]], [[craft]]s, [[photography]], [[video]], [[filmmaking]], and [[architecture]]. Many artistic disciplines ([[performing arts]], [[conceptual art]], [[textile arts]]) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types. Also included within the visual arts&lt;ref&gt;An About.com article by art expert, Shelley Esaak: [http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/visual_arts.htm?p=1 What Is Visual Art?]&lt;/ref&gt; are the [[applied arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/different-forms-of-art.html ''Different Forms of Art – Applied Art'']. Buzzle.com. Retrieved 11 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], [[interior design]] and [[decorative art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgebrown.ca/centres/AD/index.aspx |title=Centre for Arts and Design in Toronto, Canada |publisher=Georgebrown.ca |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028075227/http://www.georgebrown.ca/centres/AD/index.aspx |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current usage of the term "visual arts" includes [[fine art]] as well as the applied, decorative arts and [[craft]]s, but this was not always the case. Before the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' was often restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the [[handicraft]], craft, or applied art media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html Art History: Arts and Crafts Movement: (1861–1900). From World Wide Arts Resources] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013011648/http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html |date=13 October 2009 }}. Retrieved 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art school]]s made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.

The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of [[Western art]] as well as [[Eastern art history|East Asian]] art.  In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour – in [[Chinese painting]] the most highly valued styles were those of "scholar-painting", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western [[hierarchy of genres]] reflected similar attitudes.

==Education and training==
{{main|Visual arts education}}
Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the [[apprentice]] and workshop systems.  In Europe the [[Renaissance]] movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the [[academy]] system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in [[art school]]s at tertiary levels.  Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems.

==Drawing==
{{Main|Drawing}}
[[Drawing]] is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to [[Paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave representations]] of animals such as those at [[Lascaux]] in France and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain. In [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], ink drawings on [[papyrus]], often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on [[pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]], initially geometric, later developed to the human form with [[black-figure pottery]] during the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibujosparapintar.com/english_activities/drawing_course_history.html History of Drawing.

With [[history of paper|paper]] becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |title=Drawing |date=2006 |website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314224108/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |archive-date=14 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=23 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

===Origins and early history===
{{Main|History of painting}}

Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]] caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer.

Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of [[Ramses II]], [[Nefertari]], his queen, is depicted being led by [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1320&amp;HistoryID=ab20&amp;gtrack=pthc History of Painting. From History World]. Retrieved 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks contributed to painting but much of their work has been lost. One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic [[Fayum mummy portraits]]. Another example is mosaic of the [[Battle of Issus]] at [[Pompeii]], which was probably based on a Greek painting. Greek and Roman art contributed to [[Byzantine art]] in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting.

===The Renaissance===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}

Apart from the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced by monks during the [[Middle Ages]], the next significant contribution to European art was from [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italy's renaissance painters]]. From [[Giotto]] in the 13th century to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in [[Art of Italy|Italian art]] as the ''chiaroscuro'' techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.evansville.edu/rl29/art340/f04/renaissancepainting.html History of Renaissance Painting.

[[File:The Nightwatch by Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=Rembrandt painting Night Watch two men striding forward with a crowd|Rembrandt: ''[[Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'']]
Painters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school. [[Jan van Eyck]] from Belgium, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] from the Netherlands and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times. They used the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing technique]] with oils to achieve depth and luminosity.

===Dutch masters===
{{Main|Dutch Golden Age painting}}
The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile [[Rembrandt]] who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and [[Vermeer]] who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life.

===Baroque===
{{Main|Baroque}}
The [[Baroque]] started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century. Main artists of the Baroque included [[Caravaggio]], who made heavy use of [[tenebrism]]. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was a [[flemish]] painter who studied in Italy, worked for local churches in [[Antwerp]] and also painted a series for [[Marie de' Medici]]. [[Annibale Carracci]] took influences from the [[Sistine Chapel]] and created the genre of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]. Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the resulting [[Counter Reformation]]. Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutsaers |first=Inge |url=https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Rethinking_the_Baroque_Intro.pdf |title=Ashgate Joins Routledge - Routledge |publisher=Ashgate.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impressionism===
{{Main|Impressionism}}
[[Impressionism]] began in France in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] who brought a new freely brushed style to painting, often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio. This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality. They achieved intense colour vibration by using pure, unmixed colours and short brush strokes. The movement influenced art as a dynamic, moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art. Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving, whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impressionist art &amp; paintings, What is Impressionist art?

===Post-impressionism===
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Towards the end of the 19th century, several young painters took impressionism a stage further, using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism. Of particular note are [[Paul Gauguin]], who was strongly influenced by Asian, African and Japanese art, [[Vincent van Gogh]], a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south, and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of [[Montmartre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Post-Impressionism. Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism, expressionism and cubism===
{{Main|Modern art}}
[[Edvard Munch]], a Norwegian artist, developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century, inspired by the French impressionist [[Manet]]. ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893), his most famous work, is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Partly as a result of Munch's influence, the German [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Ernst Kirschner]] and [[Erich Heckel]] began to distort reality for an emotional effect.
In parallel, the style known as [[cubism]] developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition. [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] were the leading proponents of the movement. Objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form. By the 1920s, the style had developed into surrealism with [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]] and [[René Magritte|Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/modern-art-movements.htm Modern Art Movements.

==Printmaking==
[[File:Ancientchineseinstrumentalists.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists|Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists]]
{{Main|Printmaking}}
[[Printmaking]] is creating, for artistic purposes, an image on a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] that is then transferred to a two-dimensional (flat) surface by means of ink (or another form of pigmentation). Except in the case of a [[monotype]], the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print.
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Albrecht Dürer engraving Melancholia I from 1541 seated angel contemplating figure|Albrecht Dürer: ''[[Melancholia I]]'' (1541)]]
Historically, the major techniques (also called media) involved are [[woodcut]], [[line engraving]], [[etching]], [[lithography]], and screenprinting (serigraphy, silkscreening) but there are many others, including modern digital techniques. Normally, the print is printed on [[paper]], but other mediums range from cloth and [[vellum]] to more modern materials. Major printmaking traditions include that of Japan (''[[ukiyo-e]]'').

===European history===
{{Main|Old master print}}
Prints in the Western tradition produced before about 1830 are known as [[old master print]]s. In Europe, from around 1400 AD [[woodcut]], was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds. [[Michael Wolgemut]] improved German woodcut from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]], a Dutchman, was the first to use cross-hatching.  At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed, increasing the status of the single-leaf woodcut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prnt/hd_prnt.htm The Printed Image in the West: History and Techniques. The Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese origin and practice===

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
In China, the art of printmaking developed some 1,100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper. Initially images were mainly religious but in the [[Song Dynasty]], artists began to cut landscapes. During the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] (1616–1911) dynasties, the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engraving-review.com/chinese-art-engraving.html Engraving in Chinese Art.

===Development In Japan 1603–1867===

{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}
Woodblock printing in Japan (Japanese: 木版画, moku hanga) is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo-e artistic genre; however, it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period. Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books, long before the advent of movable type, but was only widely adopted in Japan surprisingly late, during the Edo period (1603–1867). Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards, moku hanga differs greatly in that water-based inks are used (as opposed to western woodcut, which uses oil-based inks), allowing for a wide range of vivid color, glazes and color transparency.

==Photography==
{{Main|Photography}}

[[Photography]] is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]. The process is done through mechanical [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] or electronically timed exposure of [[photon]]s into [[chemical]] processing or [[digitizing]] devices known as [[camera]]s.

The word comes from the [[Greek words]] φως ''phos'' ("light"), and γραφις ''graphis'' ("stylus", "paintbrush") or γραφη ''graphê'', together meaning "drawing with light" or "representation by means of lines" or "drawing." Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a [[photograph]]. The term ''photo'' is an abbreviation; many people also call them ''pictures.'' In digital photography, the term ''image'' has begun to replace ''photograph.'' (The term ''image'' is traditional in geometric [[optics]].)

==Filmmaking==
{{Main| Filmmaking}}

Filmmaking is the process of making a motion-picture, from an initial conception and research, through scriptwriting, shooting and recording, animation or other special effects, editing, sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience; it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films, embracing documentary, strains of theatre and literature in film, and poetic or experimental practices, and is often used to refer to video-based processes as well

==Computer art==
{{Main|Computer art}}
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:wiki.Picture by Drawing Machine 2.jpg|thumb|Picture produced by Drawing Machine 2]] --&gt;

Visual artists are no longer limited to [[Media (arts)|traditional art media]]. Computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the 1960s. Uses include the [[Image capture|capturing]] or creating of images and forms, the editing of those images and forms (including exploring multiple [[Composition (visual arts)|compositions]]) and the final [[Artistic rendering|rendering]] or [[printing]] (including [[3D printing]]).

'''Computer art''' is any in which [[computer]]s played a role in production or display. Such art can be an image, sound, [[computer animation|animation]], [[video]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[video game]], [[website]], [[algorithm]], [[performance]] or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating [[Digital data|digital]] technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and [[new media]] works created using computers have been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional [[painting]] with [[algorithmic art]] and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can be difficult. Nevertheless, this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits, though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting.

Computer usage has blurred the distinctions between [[illustrator]]s, [[photographer]]s, [[Image editing|photo editors]], [[3D modeling|3-D modelers]], and handicraft artists. Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers. [[Photographer]]s may become [[digital art]]ists. Illustrators may become [[animator]]s. Handicraft may be [[computer-aided]] or use [[computer-generated imagery]] as a template. Computer [[clip art]] usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and [[page layout]] less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of [[pagination|paginating]] a document, especially to the unskilled observer.

==Plastic arts==
{{main|Plastic arts}}

'''Plastic arts''' is a term for art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics. The term has also been applied to ''all the visual (non-literary, non-musical) arts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.ksu.edu.sa/DOC/Articles19/Article190588.doc Art Terminology at KSU]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete or steel, have also been included in the narrower definition, since, with appropriate tools, such materials are also capable of modulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This use of the term "plastic" in the arts should not be confused with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s use, nor with the movement he termed, in French and English, "[[Neoplasticism]]."

===Sculpture===
{{main|Sculpture}}

Sculpture is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Work of art|artwork]] created by shaping or combining hard or [[plastic]] material, sound, or text and or light, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[clay]], [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by finding or [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built together and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Sculptures are often [[paint]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity 22 September 2007 Through 20 January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html |date=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.

Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

Sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand. With increasing technology in the 20th century and the popularity of [[conceptual art]] over technical mastery, more sculptors turned to [[Art fabrication|art fabricators]] to produce their artworks. With fabrication, the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it. This allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of material like cement, metal and plastic, that they would not be able to create by hand. Sculptures can also be made with [[3-d printing]] technology.

'''''Witches of East End''''' is a 2011 [[novel]] by author [[Melissa de la Cruz]] and the first entry in her ''Beauchamp Family'' series. It was published on June 21, 2011, by [[Hyperion Books]] and follows a family of Long Island witches struggling against dark forces conspiring against them. ''Witches of East End'' is de la Cruz's first adult novel; she said she wrote it with her [[Blue Bloods (novel series)|Blue Bloods]] audience in mind because "many of them will soon be adults" and the book takes place in the same universe as the ''Blue Bloods'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin|first=MaryAnne|title=Melissa de la Cruz on Writing for Adults|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/melissa-de-la-cruz-on-writing-for-adults_b31227|publisher=GalleyCat|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel currently has two sequels: ''Serpent's Kiss'' (2012) and ''Winds of Salem'' (2013).

==Synopsis==
Joanna Beauchamp has lived off the coast of Long Island for many centuries. She and her daughters Freya and Ingrid are immortal witches, cursed to spend the rest of their days without the use of their substantial powers due to the family's involvement in the [[Salem Witch Trials]]. Joanna has the power to heal and bring the dead back to life. Ingrid can tell the future and weave magical [[knotwork]], while Freya can craft potions and charms. They've spent years hiding their true nature from others, something that provides no small amount of frustration due to how much they want to help others. It's only after Freya becomes engaged to the mysterious Bran (Branford) Gardiner (this character was renamed Dash in the TV series), and somehow becomes unwillingly infatuated with his brother Killian, that the Beauchamps seem to start breaking their curse, and slowly begin to cast magic once again. However one small spell turns into several as the Beauchamps begin to fall into the routine of using magic. It's through this everyday usage that they discover that a mysterious presence is at work within the town, making the women barren, unleashing a strange silvery substance into the waters, and ruining the local wildlife.

As Bran is continually away on trips to promote a charitable organisation that his family runs, Freya is often left alone with Killian. This closeness eventually culminates in her once again sleeping with Killian after he assists her with a busy weekend at the pub she works at. While Freya deals with the guilt from her affair and the feelings that her affair with Killian brings up, Ingrid is conflicted by her own romantic feelings towards local police officer Matt Noble. Despite exhibiting an interest in her, Matt has begun dating a coworker, which irritates Ingrid greatly. The townspeople's ailments and the mysterious silver substance in the water eventually prompts Johanna to seek her estranged husband Norman (this character was renamed Viktor in the TV series) in New York, leaving her daughters alone to deal with a growing unrest in the town as a whole. The family is eventually charged with various crimes involving an attack on a local couple as well as the disappearance of a young woman that was interning at the mayor's office.

The Beauchamps eventually discover that the chaos stems from an old rivalry between [[Loki]] and [[Balder]] over Freya. It's also revealed that the entire family are gods from [[Norse mythology]] and that the silvery substance comes from the breaking down of the rifts between worlds. Freya initially believes that Killian is Loki, here to disrupt her relationship with Bran, only to discover that Bran is actually Loki and that his trips were not for charitable purposes but to encourage the destruction of the gates between the worlds. Freya and Ingrid travel into the rift to stop Loki, managing to barely succeed and return home. Once home, they are told that the Council has noticed their magic and that if they can avoid getting convicted of the crimes against them, they will be free to practice magic once more. The Beauchamps are cleared of all charges, the intern's disappearance and death being a result of the mayor's obsession with her and the attack on a local couple being the actions of Bran. Freya and Ingrid have both begun relationships with their partners, with the book ending as Freya's brother approaching her for assistance in capturing Balder/Killian, who he claims tricked him into being imprisoned for the destruction of the [[Bifröst]], which was done by Balder.

The '''''Young Slave''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Schiavo giovane'') is a marble sculpture of [[Michelangelo]], datable to around 1525–1530 which is conserved in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]]. It is part of the "unfinished" series of ''Prigioni'' intended for the [[Tomb of Julius II]].

== History ==
It seems that from the first version of the tomb of Julius II (1505) a series of "Prigioni" was planned for the lowest level of the mausoleum – a series of more-than-life-size statues of chained figures in various poses, leaning on the pilasters which framed a set of niches, each of which would contain a "[[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victory]]". With one on each side of each niche, it must have been initially intended for there to be sixteen or twenty Prigioni. In the course of the reductions of the project which followed, this was reduced to twelve (second project, 1513), eight (third project, 1516) and finally perhaps a mere four (fourth or fifth version, 1526 or 1532), before they were completely eliminated from the project in 1542. According to [[Charles de Tolnay|de Tolnay]] (1951, 1954) the ''Young Slave'' was intended for the space left of the central niche in the project of 1516.

The first examples of the series are the two ''Prigioni'' of Paris, which are mentioned in Michelangelo's letters and were named the "Slaves" (''Schiavi'') in the 19th century: the ''[[Dying Slave]]'' and the ''[[Rebellious Slave]]''. They were sculpted in [[Rome]] around 1513.

The Florentine ''Prigioni'' (The ''Young Slave'', the ''[[Bearded Slave]]'', the ''[[Atlas Slave]]'', and the ''[[Awakening Slave]]'') were probably sculpted in the latter half of the 1520s, when Michelangelo was employed at [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] in Florence (but historians have suggested dates between 1519 and 1534). They are known to have been in the artist's store on the via Mozza until 1544, when Michelangelo's nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti, asked for permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not set foot in Florence after 1534). This permission was denied and it was only in 1564 that they were sold, along with ''[[The Genius of Victory]]'' to the Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], who placed them in the four corners of the [[Grotto of Buontalenti]] before 1591. They were removed from there in 1908 to join the Michelangelo collection which had been formed in the Florentine gallery.

Regarding the date of their creation, Justi (and others) have proposed 1519 on the basis of a letter of 13 February in which [[Jacopo Salviati]] assured the cardinal Aginesis, heir of Pope Julius II that the sculptor would have produced four figures for the tomb before the summer of that year. Wilde proposed 1523, because there is a reference to the cardinal Giulio de' Medici (the future [[Clement VII]]) having seen them before he left for Rome on that date. However de Tolnay dated them to 1530–1534, based on stylistic factors, the frequent mentions of unfinished sculptures for the tomb of Pope Julius in Michelangelo's letters of 1531–1532 and because [[Vasari]] mentions that they were made while Michelangelo prepared the [[modello|cartoon]] of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]''.

A wax [[maquette|bozzetto]] [[Bozzetto for the Young Slave|of the work]] at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]] is generally considered to have been made by Michelangelo himself.

== Description and style ==
The ''Young Slave'' has slightly bent knees as if bearing an enormous force bearing down his back. His left arm is raised to cover his face and his right arm is behind his back, held by a chain which is not visible. The figure is among the most complete of the group and shows clear definition in his legs, torso (especially on the left hand side) and his arms. His hands and head are less worked, while the back is completely unsculpted. The whole surface gives clear traces of the chisels and scrapers used in the sculpting process.

Because of its unfinished state it has an extraordinary energy (already noted by Bocchi in 1591), which connects the figure to some kind of primordial act of liberation from its prison of crude stone – an epic battle with chaos. The meaning of the ''Prigioni'' was probably linked to the motif of the ''Captivi'' in Roman art. In fact, [[Vasari]] identifies them as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For [[Ascanio Condivi|Condivi]], however, they symbolised the Arts, turned into "prisoners" after the Pope's death. Other scholars have made suggested philosophical-symbolic meanings or links to the personal life of the artist and his "torments".
