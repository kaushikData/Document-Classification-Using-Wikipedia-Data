This article deals with [[productivity software]] created for the Amiga line of computers and covers the [[AmigaOS]] operating system and its derivates [[AROS]] and [[MorphOS]] and is a split of main article [[Amiga software]].
See also related articles [[Amiga Internet and communications software]], [[Amiga music software]], [[Amiga programming languages]], and [[Amiga support and maintenance software]] for other information regarding [[software]] that run on Amiga.

==History==
The [[Amiga]] originally supported such prestigious software titles as ''[[WordPerfect]]'', [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'', and ''[[Lattice C]]''. [[Newtek]]'s ''[[Video Toaster]]'', one of the first all-in-one graphics and video editing packages, began on the Amiga.  The ''Video Toaster'' was one of the few accessories for the "big box" Amigas (2000, 3000 and 4000) that used the video slot and enabled users to turn their Amiga into the heart of an entire TV production suite. The later addition of the ''Video Flyer'' by Newtek made possible the first non-linear video editing program for the Amiga. The Amiga made 3D [[Ray tracing (graphics)|raytracing]] graphics available for the masses with ''[[Sculpt 3D]]''.  Before the Amiga, raytracing was only available for dedicated graphic workstations such as the SGI. Other raytracing software also included [[TurboSilver]]. The Amiga was well known for its 3D rendering capability, with many titles being added to the mix as the years went by. Some titles were later ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] and continue to thrive there, such as the rendering software ''[[Cinema 4D]]'' from Maxon, and ''[[LightWave]]'' from Newtek, which was originally part of the ''Video Toaster''. The ''Video Toaster'' itself has even been ported to the Windows platform. ''LightWave'' was used for low-cost computer generated special effects during the early 1990s, with ''[[Babylon 5]]'' being a notable example of a TV-series utilizing ''LightWave''.
Even [[Microsoft]] produced software for use on the Amiga. ''[[AmigaBASIC]]'', an advanced [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] software development environment, complete with an integrated development environment (IDE), was written by Microsoft under contract.

==Graphics software==
Amiga had its beginnings in 1985 with a strong attitude for graphics, more so than other PCs of its age due to its peculiar hardware, and its multimedia chipset. The graphical chip Agnus could access directly [[RAM]] and pilot it with [[Direct memory access|DMA]] (Direct Memory Access) privileges, and featured Bit [[Blitter]] and [[Original Amiga chipset#Copper|Copper]] circuits capable to move ranges of pixels on the screen and deal directly with the electronic beam of the TV set. It could render graphic screens of various number of colors (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 4096 color HAM modes) starting from 320x200 up to 720x576 pixel graphic pages. Amiga released a vast number of graphics software programs, such as [[Graphicraft]], [[Deluxe Paint]], [[TVPaint]], [[Photon Paint]], [[Brilliance (graphics editor)|Brilliance!]], (a program entirely realized upon the suggestions and wishes of well known computer artist [[Jim Sachs]]), [[Aegis Images]], [[ArtEffect]], [[fxPAINT]] by IOSpirit, [[Personal Paint]] from [[Cloanto]], [[Photogenics]], [[Express Paint]], [[Digi Paint]], [[XiPaint]], [[PerfectPaint]], [[SketchBlock]] 24 bit painting program by Andy Broad for AmigaOS 4.x users

=== Graphic applications on AmigaOne systems ===
Unlike [[Commodore International|Commodore]] Amiga systems, AmigaOne systems have no integrated multimedia chipsets. AmigaOne systems, similar to Mac or PC, sport [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]]/[[PCIe]] graphic cards, embedded audio [[AC'97]] sound system, and can use [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]]/[[PCIe]] audio cards, even some professional models. The expanded capability of faster CPU performance, and the availability of standard expansion graphic cards, lead to a new generation of graphic software being born for the AmigaOne machines such as [[Hollywood (programming language)|Hollywood "Visual Programming Suite"]].  This made it also easy to port modern Open Source software like [[Blender3D]].

=== Visual programming ===
[[Hollywood (programming language)|Hollywood]] suite of programs by German software house [https://web.archive.org/web/20090308021058/http://airsoftsoftwair.de/en/prod_hollywood.html Airsoft SoftWair] is a multimedia and presentation program available for all Amigas ([[AmigaOS]], [[MorphOS]], [[AROS]]) and recently, {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, a version of Hollywood became available for [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]] as well. It is able to load [[Scala Multimedia|Scala]] projects and Microsoft [[Powerpoint]] ".[[PPT format|PPT]]" files. Its module [https://web.archive.org/web/20090308011514/http://www.airsoftsoftwair.de/en/prod_designer.html Hollywood Designer] is not only a modern multimedia authoring software but also a true complete cross platform multimedia application layer capable of creating whole Amiga programs through a [[Visual programming|Visual]] design approach.  It also can save executables in various formats: 68k Amiga, [[WarpUP]], AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS executables and [[Intel]] X86 code for [[AROS]]. Recent versions of Hollywood allow for creating executable programs for Intel Windows machines, [[Mac OS X]] for PPC processors and Mac OS X for Intel processors.

=== Modern graphic software ===
There are fairly modern, recent graphic software that is available for AmigaOne machines, and some are still usable on Amiga platforms. [[TVPaint|TV Paint]] was born in 1991, and it was one of the first commercial 32bit graphic software on the market. Latest Amiga version (3.59) was released in 1994 and actually is distributed publicly, but the source code is still proprietary. It is still a valid graphic program, and continues to be used despite its age, due to its ease of use and its vast number of features. Programs like [[Candy Factory]] for AOS 4.0 are designed to create special effects for images, brushes and fonts to create gorgeous internet objects and buttons used in designing web pages. Pixel image editor, formerly [[Pixel32]] is available for MorphOS. [[Blender (software)|Blender]] 3D is one of the best [[Open Source]] cross platform software. Also a first pre-release of [[GIMP]] is available on AmigaOS 4.0 through the [[AmiCygnix]] [[X11]] graphic engine.
Beginning with release 2.1 in 2008, MorphOS has included its own standard Paint utility called [[MorphOS Sketch|Sketch]], simple but powerful, and [[AROS]] has bundled with the last free version of [[Luna Paint]] which become actually a commercial paint program for various operating systems.

===Graphic utilities===
As in any Operating Systems there can't exists only bitmap and vector paint software. All around these main software aimed at creating drawings directly by an author, or aimed at manipulating existing image files it exists a vast market of graphic utilities with peculiar features created in order to support main graphic programs. For example, in Amiga it existed very professional software and it is noteworthy to mention at least some the most important and widely used into Amiga market like Cinematte, CineMorph, Morph Plus, Impact!, Essence, Magic Lantern and Pixel 3D Pro, that were only some of the most notorious ones in the vast range of graphic utilities that could be purchased by skilled and professional users of Amiga platform in its golden age. Cinematte utility allow the user to easily make complex photo-realistic composites of subjects that are photographed against a ''[[Chroma key|bluescreen]]'', or green screen background. It uses the same sophisticated techniques used worldwide in motion picture technology for precise bluescreen compositing. CineMorph it is a program to automatically create morphing effects between two given original images, and create a compound third image, or even all the animation movie associated with the morphing effect. Morph Plus performed same effects as Cinemorph. Impact! created [[physics simulation]] in 3D scenes. Essence was a texture maker to apply textures on 3D surfaces of objects created by 3D tracing programs. Amiga Magic Lantern was a true color animation compressor and player for the Amiga, Pixel 3D Pro utility it was used to create models for 3D objects and save it in various 3D formats, or to transform any model object from a 3D file format to another.

===Vector graphics===
Common widely used format for vector graphics in Amiga are EPS and [[Interchange File Format|IFF]] DR2D. It originated from the fact that Amiga was the first platform on which ran [[Ghostscript]] natively, and also IFF DR2D was the original standard for vector graphics generated by Amiga [[ProVector]] and later adopted by other applications such as [[Art Expression]] and [[Professional Draw]]. Foremost used Amiga drawing and vector graphics utilities are [[Aegis Draw]], ProDraw ([[Professional Draw]]) from [[Gold Disk Inc.]], [[DrawStudio]], [[Art Expression]], [[ProVector]], and for some basic vector graphics, also the tools of [[Professional Page]] and [[PageStream]] are useful. The most modern vector graphics programs on Amiga are actually [[MindSpace]] 1.1, which is aimed mainly at design flowcharts, mindtables, UML and diagrams, and [[Steam Draw]] a 2D simple vector paint program available for MorphOS.

====Flash and SWF====
[[SWFTools]] is a collection of command line programs to convert and save various raster(bitmap) image formats from and to Flash [[SWF]] vector animation format.

====Tracing software====
On AmigaOS are available the widely used free distributable vector to graphics conversion facilities Autotrace, [[Potrace]], [[XTrace]] which can run also in [[AROS]] Amiga Open Source clone OS and [[MorphOS]] Amiga-Like system. The Desktop Publishing software [[PageStream]] has a tracing utility as bundled software.

====DXF, EMF, SVG file formats====
Various programs can read [[DXF]] (almost all Amiga CAD programs), [[Windows Metafile|EMF]], [[SVG]], [[Computer Graphics Metafile|CGM]], [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]], [[Windows Metafile|WMF]], an example of converting tool that reads many formats and output DR2D is the Amiga program [[MetaView]]. It exists also a [[SVG]] Datatype to support directly in the OS, on any program, the feature of loading and saving files in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.

==Computer aided design==
At its beginning Amiga was considered to offer the most powerful graphic platform at a reasonable price.[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue89/The_Amiga_500.php][https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/22/technology/return-desktop-cult-classic-no-not-mac-long-revered-for-its-powerful-graphics.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm] It had various CAD programs available for it, such as X-CAD, [[IntelliCAD Technology Consortium|IntelliCAD]], DynaCaDD, MaxonCAD, IntroCAD, and even programs to design and test electronic circuits, such as ElektroCAD.

==Animation, Comics and Cartoons==
Due to the peculiar capabilities of Amiga in multimedia, and the features of the blit blitter circuit, Amiga was capable of performing advanced animation and video authoring at professional level in the eighties, and thus it was created a vast amount of software which filled also this segment of the professional video editing market. For Amiga there were available animation programs like: Aegis Animator, Lights!Camera!Action!, [[DeLuxe Video]], Disney Animation Studio, versions later than 3 of Deluxe Paint, The Director (a BASIC-like language oriented to animation), [[Scala Multimedia|Scala]], Vision from Commodore itself, VisualFX from ClassX, Adorage Multi Effect program from [[proDAD]], Millennium from Nova Design. ImageFX, and Art Department Pro.

Comic Setter was an interesting tools to create printed comics by arranging brushes representing comic characters, joining it with background images and superimposing it the right frames and "ballons" with their own text speech and captions. It could then print in color the comics that were created.

[[Disney Animation Studio]] was one of the most powerful 2D programs for realizing [[cartoons]]. Born on Amiga, this program, equipped also with a complete cell-frame preview feature was used by many cartoon studios worldwide at its age and still used by some several studios in Europe{{Ref label|Interview_StraneMani|1}} as a useful preview tool.

==Authoring and VideoFX==
in its golden age Amiga can count on a vast range of animation and video authoring software; Aegis Animator, Lights!Camera!Action!, [[DeLuxe Video]], Disney Animation Studio, versions later than 3 of Deluxe Paint, The Director (a BASIC-like language oriented to animation), [[Scala Multimedia|Scala]], Amiga Vision from Commodore itself, VisualFX from ClassX, Adorage Multi Effect program from [[proDAD]], [[Wildfire]] by Andreas Maschke (ported by author to Java later), Millennium from Nova Design, ImageFX from Nova Design, and Art Department Pro.

==3D modeling, rendering and animation==
3D rendering and animation software includes [[Sculpt 3D]], [[TurboSilver]], [[Aladdin4D]], Videoscape 3D, Caligari, Maxon [[Cinema4D]], [[Imagine (3D modeling software)|Imagine]], [[LightWave]] from Newtek, Real3D from Realsoft, Vista Pro, [[World Construction Set]] 3D terrain rendering programs, and [[Tornado3D]] by the Italian company Eyelight.

==Amateur and professional video editing==
Amiga was one of the first commercial computer platform to allow amateur and professional video editing, due to its capability in connecting to TV sets, and deal with Chroma-Key, Genlock signal, at full screen with overscan features, and a good noise-gain ratio.
Amiga and its video peripherals (mainly Genlock boxes and digitizing boxes) in the nineties were available at reasonable prices and then this made the Amiga to become one of the professional video market leader platforms. It was also capable of dealing with broadcast video production (Newtek VideoToaster), and in the age around the 1992-1994, despite of the Commodore demise, Amiga knew its golden age as a professional video platform and there were available for Amiga a vast amount of any kind of video software, graphic facilities and reselling of any of gfx and image gallery data files that could be applied to video productions. Amongst these software it is worth mentioning the main Amiga video-editing programs for [[desktop video]] with both linear and non linear editing with 4.2.2 capabilities as the ones from Newtek available with [[Video Toaster#Video Toaster Flyer|VideoToaster Flyer]] external module for [[Video Toaster]] and just called NLE! (Non Linear Editing), Amiga [[MainActor]], Broadcaster Elite, [[Wildfire (Amiga software)|Wildfire]] by Andreas Maschke for vfx (now in Java), MovieShop for the expansion Amiga cards [[Personal Animation Recorder|PAR]], VLab Motion, and VLab Pro.

==Word processing and page layout==
While desktop video proved to be a major market for the Amiga, a surge of word processing, page layout and graphic software filled out the professional needs starting from the first Amiga text program [[Textcraft]] which was a mix between a real word processor and an advanced text editor, but capable of changing page layouts, fonts, enlarging or reducing their width, changing their colors and adding color images to the text.

Notable word processing programs for Amiga included the then-industry standard [[WordPerfect]] up to version 4.1, [[Shakespeare (word processor)|Shakespeare]], [[Excellence (software)|Excellence]], [[Maxon Word]], [[Final Writer]], [[Amiga Writer]], [[Scribble!]], [[ProWrite]], [[Wordworth]] and the little [[Personal Write]] by [[Cloanto]].

The page layout software included [[Page Setter]] and [[Professional Page]] from [[Gold Disk]], and [[PageStream]] by [[Soft-Logik]], known today as [[Grasshopper LLC]]). Only PageStream was ported to other platforms and continues to be developed and supported by the developers. Graphic software included vector drawing applications like [[Art Expression]] from Soft-Logik, [[ProVector]] by Taliesin, [[Draw Studio]], and [[Professional Draw]] from Gold Disk.

Amiga lacked an [[office suite]] as the term is meant now, but [[integrated software]] was available. [[Pen Pal]] was a word processor integrated with a database and a form editor.  [[Scribble!]], [[Analyze!]] and [[Organize!]] were bundled together as the [[Works!]] suite combining a word processor, spreadsheet and database.  Despite the similarity in name, it had no connection to [[Microsoft Works]].

The page layout language [[LaTeX]] was available in two ports: [[AmigaTeX]], which is no longer available (the first LaTeX can be edited with a front end program), and [[PasTEX]], available on [[Aminet]] repository.

Modern software [[AbiWord]] is available today on [[AmigaOS 4.0]] through the [[AmiCygnix]] [[X11]] graphical engine, [[Scriba (software)|Scriba]] and [[Papyrus Office]] pre-release is available for [[MorphOS]].

===Text editors===
Text editors available on Amiga include [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], [[Emacs]] and [[MicroEMACS]], [[CygnusEd|Cygnus Editor]] also known as CED, and [[Cubic IDE|GoldED]], which then evolved in 2006 into [[Cubic IDE]]. The [[UNIX]] [[ne (text editor)|ne]] editor and the [[vi]]-clone [[Vim (text editor)#Vi IMproved|Vim]] were initially developed on the Amiga.

Development of Text editors never stopped in Amiga. Since 2001, in MorphOS, a limited edition version of GoldEd called MorphEd is available, and since 2008 [http://desler.be/modules/wfchannel/ Cinnamon Writer] and [http://shinkuro.altervista.org/amiga/software/nowined.htm NoWin ED], a universal editor which runs on any Amiga-like platform, are available. Cinnamon Writer is increasing new features to all new releases and aspires to become a full-featured WordProcessor.

==Database and spreadsheets==
In the first age of Amiga (1986–1989) there were cross-platform spreadsheets available, such as [[MaxiPlan]], which was available also for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Macintosh]]. [[Logistix]] (real name LoGisTiX), one of the first spreadsheets for Amiga, [[Microfiche Filer Plus]] was a database which gave the user the experience of exploring data as using [[microfilms]]. [[Superbase database|SuperBase]] was one of the finest programs available for [[Commodore 64|C64]]. It was then ported on [[Atari]], Amiga, and later on [[Personal computer|PC]]. But on Amiga, it would become a standard reference, available in two versions [[Superbase Personal]] and [[SuperBase Professional]] It could handle [[SQL]] databases and had a query internal language such as [[BASIC]]. It was capable of creating forms and masks on records and handling multimedia files into its records years before [[Microsoft Access]]. Superbase also featured [[VCR]] control style buttons to browse records of any database. [[Softwood File II]] was another simple multimedia database which then evolved into [[Final Data]], a good database available for Amiga from [[Softwood Inc.]] From the same firm there was [[Final Calc]], a very powerful spreadsheet, similar to [[TurboCalc]] from the German company [[Schatztruhe]]. [[ProChart]] was a tool to draw flow charts and diagrams.  [[Analyze!]] was a fairly full featured (for the time) spreadsheet developed for the Amiga.  [[Organize!]] was a flat file database package. [[Gnumeric]] spreadsheet has also been ported on Amiga through an [[X11]] engine called [[AmiCygnix]].

In recent times [[MUIbase]] was born and mainly cross-platform [[MySQL]] database language became a reference on Amiga also. [[SQLite]], a self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine, can also be found available on AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS.

In February 2010, Italian programmer Andrea Palmatè ported [[IODBC]] standard to AmigaOS 4.

==Science, entertainment and special use programs==
[[Maple (software)|Maple V]] is one of the best general purpose mathematics software (a.k.a. Mathematic-CAD) ever made. It was available for Amiga also, and appreciated by many scientists using Amiga in its time. [[Distant Suns]], [[Galileo (software)|Galileo]], [[Digital Almanac]] and [[Amiga Digital Universe]] (from [[Bill Eaves]] for the OS4) were stellar sky exploring programs and astronomic calculators. During the age of [[CDTV]] many historic, science, and art CDs like [[Timetable of Science, Innovation]], [[Timetable of Business, Politics]], [[Grolier's Encyclopedia]], [[Guinness Disk of Records]], [[Video Creator]], [[American Heritage Dictionary]], [[Illustrated Holy Bible]], [[Illustrated Works of Shakespeare]], etc. were available.

===Entertainment===
For Amiga there were literally hundreds of entertainment software. Some notable programs for kids and learning were: [[Adventures in Math]] series of floppy disks, from [[Free Spirit Software]], Animal Kingdom series of disks from [[Unicorn Software]], [[Art School]] all the series of [[Barney Bear]] software, the [[Discovery series]], including [[Discovery trivia]], [[Donald's Alphabet Chase]], [[Mickey's 123's]] and [[Mickey's ABC's]] by [[Disney Software]], the [[Electric Crayon]] and [[Ferngully]] series of educational coloring book software (Ferngully was taken from the animation movie), [[Fun School]] series of disks, [[Kid Pix]] set of disks from the well known [[Broderbund Software]] house, which was famous in the nineties, [[Miracle Piano Teaching System]] to teach music to kids, various tales of [[Mother Goose]], and [[World Atlas]] by [[Centaur Software]].

===Fractals, virtual reality, artificial intelligence===
[[ZoneXplorer]] from [[Elena Novaretti]] is considered amongst Amiga users one of the best [[fractal]] experience programs ever made on Amiga, if not on any platform. In 1989 the [[X-Specs 3D Glasses]] from [[Haitex Resources]], one of the first interactive 3D solutions for home computers were created. Also created on Amiga, were the multimedia interactive TV non immersive [[Virtual reality]] exploring software [[Mandala (software)|Mandala]] from [[Vivid Group]] Inc.{{Ref label|Vivid Group|2}}, and the [[Virtuality (gaming)|Virtuality System]] Virtuality 1000 CS 3D VRML all-immersive simulator from W-Industries (then Virtuality Inc.){{Ref label|Virtuality Systems|2}}, for game entertainment in big arcade installations and theme parks, based on A3000.

[[Magellan v.1.1]] (Artificial Intelligence Software), not to be confused with Directory Opus Magellan, was a program to emulate [[Artificial intelligence]] responses on Amiga, by creating heuristic programmed rules based on [[machine learning]] in its form of [[supervised learning]]. The user would choose into [[decision tree]]s and [[decision tables]] system of AI featured by the Magellan program, in which to input objects, and desired outputs and describe all associate conditions and rules which the machine should follow in order to output pseudo-intelligent solutions to given problems.

===Route planning===
[[AmiATLAS]] v.6, was a complete [[Route planner]] tool for Amiga computers. It provided worldwide interactive maps and found optimal routes for traveling from one place to another. It also featured multiple map loading, an integrated CityGuide-System with information to interesting towns, places or regions, some even with pictures, and information about many parks and points of interest.

===Personal organizer, notebook, diary software===
[[Digita Organizer]] v.1.1 from [[Digita International]] was the best Amiga program to let the user to note about dates, meetings, remember expiry dates, etcetera. [http://polymere.free.fr/orga_en.html PolyOrga] for [[MorphOS]] by Frédéric Rignault.

===Personal budget, home banking, accounts===
[[Easy Banker]], [[Home Accounts]], [[Small Business Accounts]], [[Small Business Manager]], [[Account Master]], Accountant, [[AmigaMoney]], [[Banca Base III]], [[HomeBank]], [[CashMaster]], Counting House, etc.

===Software for special purposes===
[[Slow-scan television#AVT|AVT]] (Amiga Video Transceiver), was a software and hardware [[Slow-scan television]] system originally developed by "Black Belt Systems" (USA) around 1990 for the Amiga home computer popular all over the world before the IBM PC family gained sufficient audio quality with the help of special sound cards.

[[Richmond Sound Design]] (RSD) created both [[show control]] (a.k.a. MSC or "[[MIDI Show Control]]") and theatre [[sound design]] software which was used extensively in the theatre, theme park, display, exhibit, [[Stage Manager|stage managing]], show and themed entertainment industries in the 1980s and 1990s and at one point in the mid 90s, there were many high-profile shows at major theme parks around the world being controlled by Amigas through software simply called [[Stage Manager]] which then evolved into its Microsoft Windows version called [[ShowMan]]. There were dozens at [[Walt Disney World]] alone and more at all other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Six Flags]] and [[Madame Tussauds]] properties as well as in many venues in Las Vegas including [[The Mirage]] hotel Volcano and [[Siegfried and Roy]] show, the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] EFX show, [[Broadway theatre]], London's [[West End theatre|West End]], the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s many venues, most of [[Branson, Missouri]]'s theatres, and scores of theatres on cruise ships, amongst hundreds of others. RSD purchased used Amigas on the web and reconditioned them to provide enough systems for all the shows that specified them and only stopped providing new Amiga installations in 2000. There are still an unknown number of shows on cruise ships and in themed venues being run by Amigas.{{source?|date=April 2018}}

The '''Bi-Digital O-Ring Test''' ('''BDORT'''), characterized as a form of [[applied kinesiology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf Medical Practitioner's Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand characterization of BDORT as a form of Applied Kinesiology, paragraphs 305, 306, et alia]&lt;/ref&gt; is a patented [[alternative medicine]] diagnostic procedure in which a patient forms an 'O' with his or her fingers, and the diagnostician subjectively evaluates the patient's health according to the patient's finger strength as the diagnostician tries to pry them apart.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf Medical Practitioner's Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand characterization of BDORT as subjective, paragraphs 61, 318, 331 et alia]&lt;/ref&gt;

BDORT has been cited and characterized at length by the American Institute for Technology and Science Education as a specific and noteworthy example of [[pseudoscientific]] [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aitse.org/assessing-scientific-claims-the-o-ring/ |title=– American Institute for Technology and Science Education |access-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427204953/http://www.aitse.org/assessing-scientific-claims-the-o-ring/ |archive-date=27 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDORT was invented by Yoshiaki Omura, along with several other related alternative medicine techniques. They are featured in Omura's self-published ''Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics Research, The International Journal,'' of which Omura is founder and editor-in-chief, as well as in seminars presented by Omura and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaet.org International College of Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics, Omura's US site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Omura is registered to practice acupuncture in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysed.gov/coms/op001/opsc2a?profcd=60&amp;plicno=122947&amp;namechk=OMU New York State Education Department, Office of the Professions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the only known full, formal independent evaluation of BDORT or of any other BDORT-related treatment and technique by a mainstream scientific or medical body, the [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]] of New Zealand ruled, in two separate cases brought before it in 2003, that [[Richard Gorringe|Richard Warwick Gorringe]], [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB, ChB]] of [[Hamilton, New Zealand]], who used BDORT (which he also called "Peak Muscle Resistance Testing", or "PMRT") to the exclusion of conventional diagnoses on his patients, was guilty of malpractice. In the first case, the Tribunal found it "is not a plausible, reliable, or scientific technique for making medical decisions"  and "there is no plausible evidence that PMRT has any scientific validity".&lt;ref name=nz&gt;[http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand findings in re Richard Gorringe and the PMRT/Bi-Digital O-Ring Test]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qwnzt12&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/gorringe.html|title=Disciplinary Actions against Dr. Richard Gorringe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the second case the Tribunal ruled Gorringe again relied on BDORT to the exclusion of traditional diagnoses, which ultimately led to the death of a patient.&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzt2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions2003/03113cfindings.pdf|title=2004 NZT Report on Richard Gorringe|access-date=27 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002214238/http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions2003/03113cfindings.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these findings and conclusions, Gorringe was fined and stripped of his license to practice medicine.

==Yoshiaki Omura==
{{Nihongo|Yoshiaki Omura|大村恵昭|''Ōmura Yoshiaki''}} is president and founder of the ''International College of Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics,'' president and founder of the ''International Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Medical Association,'' and medical research director of the ''Heart Disease Research Foundation.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/omurast.htm CV/Biography of Dr. Yoshiaki Omura at Omura's Japanese site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The test is a subjective evaluation of a patient's opposing muscle strength in which a diagnostician employs the thumb and forefinger of each hand, formed in the shape of an O, to attempt to force apart an O shape formed by the patient who places the fingertips of their thumb and one of their remaining fingers together. At the same time, the patient holds a slide of [[organ (anatomy)|organ tissue]], a sample of [[medication]], potential [[allergen]], etc., in their free hand, or is otherwise 'probed' at an appropriate [[acupuncture point]] by the use of a metal rod or laser pointer. The diagnostician then uses their perception of the strength required to force apart the patient's 'O-Ring' of thumb and one of the remaining fingers to assess the patient's health.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baobab.or.jp/~oring/e_basis.shtml#compatibility Omura Japanese site description of BDORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpmlegal.com/wfinger.html  |title= Pull my finger! - BI-DIGITAL O-RING TEST FOR IMAGING AND DIAGNOSIS OF INTERNAL ORGANS OF A PATIENT|publisher=Brown &amp; Michaels PC|accessdate=2011-02-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229073951/http://www.bpmlegal.com/wfinger.html |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent==
The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) rejected the initial BDORT patent application as 'too unbelievable to be true'. The application was then resubmitted in 1987, and the USPTO again rejected it. After receiving expert testimony from Omura's "associates in clinical fields and basic sciences, both in Japan and the United States" regarding BDORT, the USPTO issued {{Cite patent|US|5188107}} in 1993.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/1sad2.htm Yoshiaki Omura's description of patent quest at his Japanese site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that a patent was granted to the BDORT has been cited as an example of 'high weirdness' by one firm of patent attorneys.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

==Suggested uses and variants==
The BDORT is capable, according to its proponents, of a wide range of applications in the diagnosis, prescription of treatment, and evaluation of efficacy of treatment of, amongst others: heart conditions, cancers, 'pre-cancers', allergic reactions, viral and bacterial infections, a range of organic and/or environmental stresses, as well as the precise location of acupuncture points and meridians previously unknown or inappropriately identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://users.med.auth.gr/~karanik/english/articles/icmart99/ab26.htm |title=Omura abstract |access-date=30 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927175544/http://users.med.auth.gr/~karanik/english/articles/icmart99/ab26.htm |archive-date=27 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.baobab.or.jp/~oring/e_index.shtml |title=Omura's Japanese web site capsule description of BDORT applications |access-date=30 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824073432/http://www.baobab.or.jp/~oring/e_index.shtml |archive-date=24 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/18thSympo.html BDORT 18th Symposium]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/19thSympo.html BDORT 19th Symposium]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the New Zealand [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]]'s [[BDORT#Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand review of BDORT|reports]], there is no known independent mainstream scientific or medical evaluation or validation of any of the BDORT or BDORT-related claims, including the following BDORT variants:

;The Indirect Method
:In the Indirect Method of application an intermediary is employed, and the patient is not directly examined. The intermediary, for example, directs a laser pointer held in his or her right hand at the appropriate acupuncture point, for example, atop the patient's head, while at the same time the diagnostician performs the test on the left hand of the intermediary.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

;Remote Application
:Omura claims that it is possible, if the procedure is performed by a very experienced practitioner such as himself, to perform the BDORT on a patient over the telephone without having any physical contact with the patient. In this procedure the patient is, for example, instructed to hold in one hand a substance being evaluated, while holding the telephone receiver at the bodily location prescribed by the diagnostician. The practitioner then evaluates the muscle strength necessary to separate the interlocked O–rings of thumb and forefinger of each of his or her own two hands, and uses this data in place of data from standard BDORT on the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bdort.net/pdf/6thSympoEngAbst.pdf |title=Omura seminar article by Dominic Lu, DDS, presenting diagnosis by Omura via BDORT via telephone |access-date=22 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504080357/http://bdort.net/pdf/6thSympoEngAbst.pdf |archive-date=4 May 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method
:The Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method is a central component of BDORT-derived treatments according to Omura. He claims that with this treatment it is possible, via BDORT diagnosis and evaluation coupled with appropriate [[acupuncture point]] stimulation, to 'target' [[alternative medicine|alternative]] or conventional medications to specific cells or tissues, for example, cancer cells. According to Omura, when this occurs the medications will have minimal 'uptake' by non-targeted tissues or cells, thus maximizing the efficacy of the prescribed medications while minimizing side effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmj-pain.com/Omura.pdf Omura Selective Drug Uptake and CV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12934959&amp;query_hl=9&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum Abstract of Omura paper in ''Acupuncture Electrotherapeutics Resonance'']&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no known independent verification of these claims.

;Solar energy stored papers
:Special Solar Energy: Solar Energy Stored Papers (SESP) is a device which Omura claims was developed using BDORT assessment and evaluation, that can capture a special healing power of sunlight. Omura uses index cards or other ordinary paper and he says the sunlight must be 'captured' at the ideal times of sunrise and sunset. Omura says the energy can then be preserved in SESP while maintaining appropriate ''[[qigong]]'' polarity and shielding the papers from electromagnetic fields by carefully wrapping them in aluminum foil. Thus captured and preserved, he claims that Special Solar Energy is effective in the treatment of a number of conditions, including arthritis, cancers, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. He has applied for a patent for this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2005278006|application}}, Special Solar Energy Stored Papers and Their Application&lt;/ref&gt;

;Psychic healing
:Omura, as published in his journal, has investigated the application of psychic healing and [[psychic surgery]] in Brazil, particularly that of [[Rubens Farias Jr.|Rubens Farias, Jr]], who claims to channel the spirit of [[Dr. Fritz|Dr Fritz]]. Applying the BDORT as his tool of evaluation, he concluded that psychic healing's and psychic surgery's healing effects were achieved through the application of ''qigong'' energy and the use of [[acupuncture points]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/aidsline/1997/oct/M97A0099.html Abstract of Omura's observations on psychic healing and psychic surgery in Brazil as published in his journal, ''Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics Research, The International Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand review of BDORT==
The [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal|New Zealand Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]], ruled on two separate malpractice cases against [[Richard Gorringe|Richard Warwick Gorringe]], [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB, ChB]], of [[Hamilton, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;
In the first, held in [[Wellington]] in 2003,&lt;ref name=nz/&gt; where BDORT was also referred to as 'PMRT' ('Peak Muscle Resistance Testing') by Gorringe,&lt;ref&gt;2003 NZ Tribunal Findings, Paragraph 363 (Note that the Tribunal uses the terms PMRT and BDORT interchangeably, characterizing both as a form of [[Applied kinesiology|Applied Kinesiology]], cf Paragraphs 100, 280, 290, 297, 305, 306, et alia)&lt;/ref&gt; the tribunal examined and dismissed any claims of scientific validity of BDORT, offering the following summary statement of findings:&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;{{quotation|We therefore accept that PMRT is not a plausible, reliable, or scientific technique for making medical decisions. We find there is no plausible evidence that PMRT has any scientific validity. It therefore follows that reliance on PMRT to make diagnoses to the exclusion of conventional and/or generally recognized diagnostic/investigatory techniques is unacceptable and irresponsible.}}

As a result of these findings and conclusions, Gorringe was fined and stripped of his license to practice medicine.

In separate hearings the Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal held in December 2003 and ruled upon in May 2004 in [[Auckland]], found Gorringe guilty of malpractice in the death of an earlier patient, and concluded that Gorringe's reliance on BDORT to the exclusion of conventional diagnoses led to the patient's death.&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzt2/&gt;

===BDORT testimony used by Wellington tribunal in its decision===
Several expert witnesses provided testimony about BDORT at the MPDT Wellington hearings, with which the tribunal concurred:{{quotation|In summary, I find the descriptions of the AK [applied kinesiology] methods and in particular the BDORT test to be inconsistent with known physical principles. Even if it were possible to produce a “field” with these methods, AK [applied kinesiology] methods (and BDORTing) [testing] have not been shown to produce an electrical field which is required to alter the electrical activation of nerve and muscle. A limited survey of the literature shows that the AK [applied kinesiology] testing results are unreliable – and this idea is apparently supported by some organisations that support complementary medicine. I find it deeply disturbing that the only people who seem to claim reliable diagnostic results are those who make a living from applying it and some controlled scientific tests reveal no validity to these claims.|Professor Mark Bryden Cannell &amp;ndash; Tribunal Findings, par. 306&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

{{quotation|BDORT is operator dependent, meaning that what actually happens is that the operator diagnoses whatever it is that he believes in. One cannot scientifically evaluate “belief”. In the context of testing, then, it would be impossible to challenge the practitioner’s belief in his apparatus.|John Charles Welch, MD &amp;ndash; Tribunal Findings, par. 314&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

{{quotation|I think the big problem with the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test is the fact that it’s not been properly tested to make sure that the results are reproducible. As Professor Cannell alluded to in his evidence, the key thing about science is a naive observer anywhere in the world should be able to reproduce the results using the same apparatus.|John Charles Welch, MD &amp;ndash; Tribunal Findings, par. 316&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

===Equivalence with PMRT===
In the first New Zealand MPDT report from [[Wellington]] in 2003, the tribunal defines the terms PMRT and BDORT as equivalent:{{quotation|At each consultation Dr Gorringe "muscle tested" Mrs Short by a procedure called "Peak Muscle Resistance Testing" which he used as a diagnostic tool. We refer to this procedure later and throughout this judgment as PMRT. It is also referred to as Bi Digital O Ring Testing (BDORT).|New Zealand MPDT (2003), par. 100&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

Later in the same report, the tribunal again equates PMRT and BDORT, but states that the technique used by Gorringe is different from Dr. Omura's:{{quotation|Dr. Gorringe gave evidence as to the background relating to PMRT (or BDORT) and attributed the origin of it to Dr. Yoshiaki Omura and produced some written material relating to the Omura technique (exhibits 31 and 42). However, it would appear from a perusal of those materials that the technique which Dr. Gorringe practices is different from that practiced by Dr. Omura and therefore the Omura materials do not assist the Tribunal to any real extent.|New Zealand MPDT (2003), par. 290&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

The tribunal uses the terms BDORT and PMRT interchangeably throughout the Wellington report from 2003.

In the second MPDT report from [[Auckland]] in 2004,&lt;ref name=nzt2/&gt; the tribunal does not mention PMRT at all, and refers to Gorringe's technique exclusively as 'BDORT'.

The [[Quackwatch]] article reviewing these two New Zealand MPDT reports also equates PMRT and BDORT, stating:{{quotation|The test Gorringe used is called peak muscle resistance testing (PMRT) -- also referred to as bi digital O ring testing (BDORT) -- in which the practitioner observes whether the subject's opposed thumb and fourth fingers can be pulled apart...|[[Quackwatch]]&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;}}

==BDORT-related courses==
BDORT-related seminars, given by Omura, are conducted monthly in New York. The [[University of the State of New York]] Education Department allows these seminars to count towards course credit for physicians and dentists seeking certification for the application of [[acupuncture]] in the course of their practice.&lt;ref name=nysem&gt;[http://www.op.nysed.gov/acupuncert.htm New York State Education Department Listing of Registered Programs for Certification in Acupuncture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icaetnysem&gt;[http://icaet.org/seminars.html Omura's US site, with reference to seminars and content]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Decision of 15 May 2007 the [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]], in [[Victoria, Australia]], in an [[appeal]] against a [[Case law|decision]] by the [[Acupuncture#Australia|Chinese Medical Registration Board]] of Victoria refusing registration to practice as an [[acupuncturist]], found that attendance and participation in Yoshiaki Omura's ''Annual International Symposium on Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics'' as accredited by the [[University of the State of New York]] [[New York State Education Department|Education Department]], in addition to "clinical experience ... with these subjects in respect of real patients" did not meet the Chinese Medicine Board's requirement of "competencies substantially equivalent to" those taught in a Board certified acupuncture class. Given this, the Tribunal ruled that the Board was not required to certify the applicant as a practitioner of Chinese medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au/board/MalterVCATDecisionMay2007.pdf |title=Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Decision |access-date=29 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810034139/http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au/board/MalterVCATDecisionMay2007.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2007/815.html Australasian Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burzynski Clinic''' is a controversial clinic offering unproven [[cancer treatment]]. It was founded in 1976 and is in [[Texas]], [[United States]]. It is best known for the controversial "antineoplaston therapy", using compounds it calls antineoplastons, devised by the clinic's founder Stanislaw Burzynski in the 1970s. There is no accepted scientific evidence of benefit from antineoplaston combinations for various diseases.

The clinic has been the focus of criticism primarily due to the way its antineoplaston therapy is promoted, the costs for people with cancer participating in "trials" of antineoplastons, problems with the way these trials are run, and legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without state board approval.

== Stanislaw Burzynski ==

Burzynski was born on January 23, 1943 in [[Lublin]], [[Poland]]. He graduated from the [[Medical University of Lublin|Medical Academy in Lublin]].&lt;ref name="Smith1992"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology|title=The Burzynski Controversy in the United States and in Canada: A Comparative Case Study in the Sociology of Alternative Medicine|first=Murray E.

Burzynski moved to the [[United States]] in 1970, working at [[Baylor College of Medicine|Baylor College]] until 1977, when he established the Burzynski Research Laboratory where he administered antineoplaston therapy, initially to 21 patients but then more widely as "experimental" treatment. This opened him up to "charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope", which led to several instances of media controversy.&lt;ref name="Smith1992"/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Burzynski founded the Burzynski Research Institute in 1984.&lt;ref name="BRI"&gt;{{cite web | title = Burzynski Research Institute Home Page | url = http://www.burzynskiresearch.com | accessdate = May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His scientific papers have caused academic controversy, with reviewers disputing the design of the trials and scientific validity of the published results.&lt;ref name="vickers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rocco&gt;{{cite journal | last = Di Rocco | first = C| url = http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/89/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00381-014-2513-5.pdf?auth66=1426352663_c9647b49945395eb0d2ac67f6443ee73&amp;ext=.pdf | date = December 2014|volume=30|issue=12|pages=2063 |publisher = Childs Nerv Syst (Springer) | title = Main editor's comment to the paper: the response and survival of children with recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma based on phase II study of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with brainstem glioma.

In February 2017 following lengthy hearings the Texas Medical Board recommended Burzynski's medical license be revoked, with the revocation suspended, and a fine of $360,000 for billing irregularities and other violations.&lt;ref name="HoustonPressFine"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/unorthodox-doc-stanislaw-burzynski-faces-360-000-fine-and-probation-9206755 |title=Unorthodox Doc Stanislaw Burzynski Faces $360,000 Fine and Probation |last=Malisow |first=Craig |newspaper=[[Houston Press]] |publication-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antineoplaston therapy ==

''Antineoplaston'' is a name coined by Burzynski for a group of [[peptides]], peptide derivatives, and mixtures that he uses as an [[alternative cancer treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Keith I. |title=Antineoplastons and the Challenges of Research in Integrative Care |journal=Integrative Cancer Therapies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15035867 |doi=10.1177/1534735404263274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from ''[[neoplasm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Shannon |last1=Brownlee |first2=Gary |last2=Cohen |title=Trials of a Cancer Doc: Experimental drugs and a 20-year fight with the FDA |journal=US News &amp; World Report |pmid=10186429 |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/981005/archive_004873.htm |year=1998 |volume=125 |issue=13 |pages=28–30, 32, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the U.S. since 1984 but is not approved for general use.  The compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered as part of clinical trials at the Burzynski Clinic and the Burzynski Research Institute.&lt;ref name=NCIfaq/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9091754 |year=1997 |title=Lessons from antineoplaston |volume=349 |issue=9054 |page=741 |journal=Lancet |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)21011-1 |last1=The Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16484713 "&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burzynski | first1 = S.

Burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in the presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group.&lt;ref name=Burzy1986&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burzynski |first1=SR |title=Antineoplastons: history of the research (I) |journal=Drugs under experimental and clinical research |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=1–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3527634}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first identified antineoplastons from human blood. Since similar peptides had been isolated from urine, early batches of Burzynski's treatment were isolated from urine.&lt;ref name=Burzy1986/&gt; Burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically.&lt;ref name="Marshall1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Eliot |title=The Politics of Alternative Medicine |journal=Science |volume=265 |issue=5181 |pages=2000–2002 |year=1994 |pmid=8091220 |doi=10.1126/science.8091220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione).  From A-10, antineoplaston AS2-1 was derived – a 4:1 mixture of [[phenylacetic acid]] and [[phenylacetylglutamine]].&lt;ref&gt;NCI Drug Dictionary, [http://cancer.gov/Templates/drugdictionary.aspx?searchTxt=antineoplaston Definitions of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1]&lt;/ref&gt; The Burzynski Clinic website states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston A10-I is [[phenylacetylglutamine]].&lt;ref name="pmid16484713" /&gt;

Since 2011, the clinic has marketed itself as offering "personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy", which has stirred further controversy, as the treatment bears no relationship to gene-targeted therapy and only superficially incorporates elements of [[personalized medicine]].&lt;ref name=SBM1&gt;[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/stanislaw-burzynskis-personalized-gene-targeted-cancer-therapy/ Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's "personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy": Can he do what he claims for cancer?], David Gorski, Science Based Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;  The clinic's version of personalized medicine bears little resemblance to [[targeted cancer therapy]], as the clinic includes [[chemotherapy]] drugs and antineoplastons are part of this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;David Gorski for Science-Based Medicine. December 12, 2011 [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/stanislaw-burzynski-antineoplastons-and-the-orphan-drug-sodium-phenyl-butyrate/ Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, antineoplastons, and the selling of an orphan drug as a cancer cure] Quote: " it’s not the concept of "personalized gene-targeted therapy" to which I object. It’s how Burzynski does it and how he corrupts the very concept through his "everything but the kitchen sink" approach to throwing "targeted" therapies at cancer patients willy-nilly without a systematic rationale for picking them or, it seems, any concern for potential adverse reactions due to combining drugs that have not been tested adequately in combination."
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Hill for The Skeptical Inquirer. January 10, 2014 [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/burzynski_clinic_a_scientifical_year_of_fail/ Burzynski Clinic: A Scientifical Year Of Fail]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical trials ===
{{For|definitions of clinical trial phases|clinical trial}}

According to the [[National Cancer Institute]], as of April 2013, "no phase III randomized, controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted. Publications have taken the form of case reports, phase I clinical trials, toxicity studies, and phase II clinical trials",&lt;ref&gt;National Cancer Institute. [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/antineoplastons/healthprofessional/Page5#_47 Information for Professionals: Antineoplastons (PDQ®): Human/Clinical Studies] Updated: April 9, 2013. Page accessed March 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and  "for the most part, these publications have been authored by the developer of the therapy, Dr. Burzynski, in conjunction with his associates at the Burzynski Clinic. Although these studies often report remissions, other investigators have not been successful in duplicating these results."&lt;ref name=NCIsummary&gt;National Cancer Institute. [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/antineoplastons/healthprofessional/page7 Information for Professionals: Antineoplastons (PDQ®): Summary of the Evidence] Updated: April 9, 2013. Page accessed March 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1995, the NCI initiated multiple phase II trials of antineoplastons. In 1995, after over $1 million had been spent on these trials, they were stopped before the effectiveness of antineoplastons could be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Mitchell R.|last2=Jonas|first2=Wayne B.|title=Managing Social Conflict in Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research: The Case of Antineoplastons|journal=Integrative Cancer Therapies|date=March 2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.1177/1534735404263448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1990s, Burzynski registered some sixty clinical trials of antineoplastons and, in December 2010, a Phase III trial which did not open for patient recruitment. Burzynski has not published full results for any of these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/stanislaw_burzynski_four_decades_of_an_unproven_cancer_cure/ Four decades of an unproven cancer cure], David Gorski, Skeptical Inquirer vol 38.2, April 2014, Center for Inquiry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterlipson/2013/04/19/a-film-producer-a-cancer-doctor-and-their-critics/ A Film Producer, A Cancer Doctor, And Their Critics], Peter Lipson, Forbes, 2013-19-04&lt;/ref&gt; According to his lawyer, Richard Jaffe:
{{quotation|[...] Burzynski personally put together seventy-two protocols to treat every type of cancer the clinic had treated and everything Burzynski wanted to treat in the future. [...] We heard that the FDA had to put together a fifty-person task force to review all of the protocols Burzynski submitted.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffe|first=Richard|title=Galileo's Lawyer: Courtroom Battles in Alternative Health, Complementary Medicine and Experimental Treatments|year=2008|publisher=Thumbs UP|location=Houston, TX|isbn=978-0980118308|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

All trials were paused (no new patients allowed) following a 2013 FDA inspections which found (for the third consecutive time) significant issues with his Institutional Review Board, and, according to papers published in November 2013, substantial issues with the conduct of both the clinic and Burzynski as principal investigator.&lt;ref name = "USA Today" &gt;{{cite news|last=Szabo|first=Liz|title=Doctor accused of selling false hope to families|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/15/stanislaw-burzynski-cancer-controversy/2994561/|accessdate=November 15, 2013|work=USA Today|date=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficacy ===

Although Burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic's patients say they have been helped,&lt;ref name=ACS1 /&gt; there is no evidence of the clinical [[efficacy]] of these methods. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the [[American Cancer Society]]&lt;ref name=ACS1 /&gt; and [[Cancer Research UK]]&lt;ref name="cancer-uk" /&gt; among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. While the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe [[neurotoxicity]].&lt;ref name="SBM1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Cancer Institute. [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/antineoplastons/healthprofessional/page1 Information for Professionals: Antineoplastons (PDQ®): Overview] Updated: April 9, 2013. Page accessed March 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent scientists have been [[reproducibility|unable to reproduce]] the positive results reported in Burzynski's studies: NCI observed that researchers other than Burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results,&lt;ref name=NCIsummary/&gt; and [[Cancer Research UK]] states that "available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer."&lt;ref name="cancer-uk"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[Cancer Research UK]] | title = What is antineoplaston therapy? | url = http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/what-is-antineoplaston-therapy | accessdate = November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no convincing evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s in the [[scientific literature]] that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease.&lt;ref name=NCIfaq&gt;National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/antineoplastons/Patient/page2 Information for Patients: Antineoplastons (PDQ®): Questions and Answers About Antineoplastons] Updated: April 9, 2013. Page accessed March 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] has stated since 1983 that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences.&lt;ref name=ACS1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/antineoplaston-therapy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721031005/http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/PharmacologicalandBiologicalTreatment/antineoplaston-therapy|archive-date=July 21, 2010|dead-url=yes|title=Antineoplaston Therapy|date=November 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2016|publisher=American Cancer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antineoplastic1983&gt;{{cite journal |title=Antineoplastons |journal=CA |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=57–9 |year=1983 |pmid=6401577 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.33.1.57 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.33.1.57/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 medical review described antineoplaston treatment as a "disproven therapy".&lt;ref name="vickers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vickers |first1=A. |title=Alternative Cancer Cures: 'Unproven' or 'Disproven'? |journal=CA |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=110–8 |year=2004 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110 | url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110/full|pmid=15061600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, three [[oncology|oncologists]] were enlisted by the weekly Washington newsletter ''The Cancer Letter'' to conduct independent reviews of Burzynski's clinical trial research on antineoplastons. They concluded that the studies were poorly designed, not interpretable, and "so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works". One of them characterized the research as "scientific nonsense".&lt;ref name="langford1998"&gt;{{cite news |first=Terri |last=Langford |date=October 1, 1998 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19476338.html|title=Oncologists criticize methods of controversial cancer treatment |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to questioning Burzynski's research methods, the oncologists found significant and possibly life-threatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Antineoplaston Anomaly: How a Drug Was Used for Decades in Thousands of Patients, With No Safety, Efficacy Data|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/burzynski2.html|accessdate=August 26, 2012|newspaper=The Cancer Letter|date=September 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] has stated: "Bottom Line: There is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans."&lt;ref name = MSKCC&gt;[http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/antineoplastons Antineoplastons], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
According to the American Cancer Society, "Treatment can cost from $7,000 to $9,500 per month or more, depending on the type of treatment, number of consultations, and the need for surgery to implant a catheter for drug delivery. Available information suggests that health insurance plans often do not reimburse costs linked to this treatment."&lt;ref name=ACS1/&gt;  As of March 2015, the Burzynski Clinic required patients to provide a deposit before treatment starts and their website informed patients that "Since we are classified as "out of network" we are unable to accept Medicare, Medicaid and any HMO insurance".&lt;ref&gt;Burzynski Clinic [http://www.burzynskiclinic.com/preparing-for-your-appointment.html Preparing for your appointment] Page accessed March 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==

===FDA warnings===

Burzynski's use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the U.S. FDA and the [[Texas Attorney General]],&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;[http://www.3rdcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/HTMLopinion.asp?OpinionID=847 Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, Appellant v. Stanislaw R. Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., Appellee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111650/http://www.3rdcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/HTMLopinion.asp?OpinionID=847 |date=September 28, 2011 }} Court judgement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openjurist1987"&gt;[http://openjurist.org/819/f2d/1301/united-states-v-burzynski-cancer-research-institute-r 819 F.2d 1301] 1987 judgment&lt;/ref&gt; and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result.

In 2009, the [[FDA Warning Letter|FDA issued a warning letter]] to the Burzynski Research Institute, stating that an investigation had determined the Burzynski [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) "did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the [[Human subject research|protection of human subjects]]." It identified a number of specific findings, among them that the IRB had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized, had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation, and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies, among others.  The Institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2009 Burzynski Research Institute Warning Letter | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration| url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2009/ucm192711.htm | accessdate = November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another warning issued in October 2012 notes that the Burzynski Clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being "safe and effective", noting: {{quotation|Promotion of an investigational new drug is prohibited under FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.7(a), which states, "A sponsor or investigator, or any person acting on behalf of a 1 sponsor or investigator, shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug. This provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug, including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The websites, including the posted press releases and embedded videos, contain claims such as the following that promote Antineoplastons as safe and/or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated or otherwise promote the drugs. [...] Since Antineoplastons are investigational new drugs, the products' indication(s), warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and dosage and administration have not been established and are unknown at this time. Promoting Antineoplastons as safe and effective for the purposes for which they are under investigation, by making representations such as those noted above, is in violation of 21 CFR 312.7(a).|FDA enforcement letter|[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM326631.pdf Original]}}

The letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities, including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with Burzynski himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/11/07/stanislaw-burzynski-slapped-down-by-the-fda-once-again/ Respectful Insolence], ScienceBlogs, November 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, antineoplaston trials were paused following the death of a child patient. In January and February 2013, the FDA inspected Burzynski and his IRB in Houston. In December 2013, the FDA issued its findings in warning letters to Burzynski, expressing "concerns about subject safety and data integrity, as well as concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in place at your site to protect patients...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/11/fda-issues-warning-to-controversial-houston-cancer-doctor/3990623/ | title= FDA issues warning to controversial Houston cancer doctor| work=[[USA Today]] | date=December 11, 2013 | accessdate=March 14, 2015 | author=Szabo, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 the FDA released the observational notes from an inspection of Burzynski as a principal investigator that took place between January and March 2013. Among the findings were “[failure] to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome, therapeutic response [...], for 67% of study subjects reviewed during the inspection,” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria, failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons, and failure to report all adverse events. Further, the FDA told Burzynski, "You failed to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under your care. Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102 investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22, 2013 [...] There is no documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects.” The FDA also observed that Burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug. Lastly, the FDA observed: "Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review", meaning that there was no way for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.&lt;ref name = "USA Today" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lipson|first=Peter|title=FDA Documents Paint Disturbing Picture of Burzynski Cancer Clinic|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterlipson/2013/11/11/fda-documents-paint-disturbing-picture-of-burzynski-cancer-clinic/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorski|first=David|title=Revealed by the FDA: The results of the most recent inspection of the Burzynski Clinic|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/revealed-by-the-fda-the-results-of-the-most-recent-inspection-of-the-burzynski-clinic/|publisher=Science Based Medicine|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM373967.pdf FDA Inspection Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Burzynski's written response to the 2013 FDA investigation he states that the investigators '"complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response."'&lt;ref name ="USA Today"/&gt;

In December 2013, the FDA issued two warning letters, one to the Burzynski Institutional Review Board and one to Burzynski, the subjects of the investigations in February. The FDA found that Burzynski and the IRB had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports. The letter to Burzynski noted serious problems with patient medical files with respect to a pediatric patient who died while treated by Burzynski&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/11/fda-issues-warning-to-controversial-houston-cancer-doctor/3990623/ | title=FDA issues warning to controversial Houston cancer doctor | work=[[USA Today]] | date=December 11, 2013 | accessdate=December 12, 2013 | author=Szabo, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose death apparently initiated the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2013/ucm378237.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2014, ''USA Today'' reported that the FDA had decided to permit "a handful" of cancer patients to receive Burzynski's treatment provided that the patients did not receive the treatment directly from him.&lt;ref name="USA Today FDA agrees"&gt;{{cite news|title=FDA agrees to let patients get controversial drug|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/21/burzynski-cancer-patients-fda-drug/6711697/ | work=USA Today | first1=Liz|last1=Szabo|date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Gorski]] wrote in 2014 that over four decades the FDA and state medical boards have been unable to shut down Burzynkski's business selling unproven treatments – "these organizations are supposed to protect the public from practitioners like Burzynski, but all too often they fail at their charges, in this case spectacularly."&lt;ref name=4decs&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stanislaw Burzynski: four decades of an unproven cancer cure |author=Gorski D |authorlink=David Gorski |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |year=2014 |volume=38 |issue=2 |page=36 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/stanislaw_burzynski_four_decades_of_an_unproven_cancer_cure }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burzynski Clinic has also made use of compassionate use exemptions. According to an investigative report by STAT News published in August 2016, the clinic has benefited by political lobbying of Burzynski's supporters, including the families of patients with terminal diagnoses. According to FDA documents obtained by STAT, "From 2011 to 2016, 37 members of Congress wrote to the FDA about Burzynski. [&amp;hellip;] Most of the lawmakers asked the agency to grant constituents 'compassionate use exemptions' so that they could try his unapproved drugs, or to allow his clinical trials to proceed."&lt;ref name="statnews-2016"&gt;{{cite news | title = To help cancer patients, lawmakers pushed access to a controversial doctor | url = https://www.statnews.com/2016/08/29/stanislaw-burzynski-cancer-treatment-congress/ | last = Kaplan | first = Sheila | date = August 29, 2016 | work = STAT News | publisher = [[Boston Globe Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burzynski, "interventions by lawmakers were helpful."&lt;ref name="statnews-2016" /&gt;

However, appeals to the FDA compassionate use exemptions are not always successful. In one case, "Burzynski said he used a Texas state law to circumvent the agency and start treatment."&lt;ref name="statnews-2016" /&gt; Critics state that "the congressional advocacy risks giving the terminally ill and their families a false sense of hope, while also conferring a measure of legitimacy on him that many believe he does not deserve.".&lt;ref name="statnews-2016" /&gt;

=== Texas Medical Board ===
In December 2010, the use of [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic agents]] by the clinic has been characterized as "random" and their use of unapproved combinations "with no known benefits but clear harms" by the [[Texas Medical Board]], which regulates and licenses physicians in the state of Texas, led to a case against Burzynski by that board. Burzynski was acquitted because he had not personally written the prescriptions.&lt;ref name = "USA Today" /&gt;

In July 2014, the board filed a 202-page complaint against Burzynski to the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings.&lt;ref name="tmb-2014"&gt;{{citation | title = Hearing Conducted by the Texas State Office of Administrative hearings |url = https://www.scribd.com/embeds/234000288/content | publisher = Texas Medical Board |date = July 10, 2014}} SOAH Docket No. 503-12-1342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brooks-2014"&gt;{{cite news | title = Texas Medical Board files 202-page complaint against cancer "cure" being used in NH | last = Brooks |first = David | url = http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/granitegeek/1041667-468/texas-medical-board-files-202-page-complain-against.html | date = July 14, 2014 | work = Nashua Telegraph | accessdate = July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint addressed allegations by the Board including misleading patients into paying exorbitant charges,&lt;ref name="tmb-2014" /&gt;{{rp|2}} misrepresenting unlicensed persons to patients as licensed medical doctors,&lt;ref name="tmb-2014" /&gt;{{rp|2,4–6,28–31,50–53}} and misleading patients into accepting care from providers without significant education or training related to cancer treatment.&lt;ref name="tmb-2014" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Citing examples of problems with 29 patients, which were listed in the document, the board said that "unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy" were prescribed "in ways that caused harm to several patients."&lt;ref name="szabo-July2014"&gt;{{cite news | last = Szabo | first = Liz | title = Texas medical board charges controversial cancer doctor | publisher = USA Today | date = July 24, 2014 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/24/new-charges-for-burzynski/13111483/ | accessdate = July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Burzynski's counsel, Richard Jaffe, withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Order no. 26 - Finding mandatory basis for attorney withdrawal | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/288010171/Order-No-26-Finding-Mandatory-Basis-for-Attorney-Withdrawal | date = August 26, 2015 | publisher = [Texas] State Office of Administrative Hearings}} SOAH Docket No. 503-14-1342.MD&lt;/ref&gt; a result of Jaffe pursuing actions against Burzynski in bankruptcy court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Board staff response to respondent's motion for continuance of hearing on the merits and to modify order no. 27 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/288010206/Board-Staff-Response-to-Respondent-s-Motion-for-Continuance-of-Hearing-on-the-Merits-and-to-Modify-Order-No-27| date = October 23, 2015 | publisher = State Office of Administrative Hearings}} SOAH Docket No. 503-14-1342.MD&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of replacement counsel, the hearing was set to begin in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Order no. 27 - Summarizing August 26. 2015 prehearing conference and modifying the dates for the hearing on the merits | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/288010191/Order-No-27-Summarizing-August-26-2015-Prehearing-Conference-and-Modifying-the-Dates-for-the-hearing-on-the-Merits | date = September 2, 2015 | publisher = [Texas] State Office of Administrative Hearings}} SOAH Docket No. 503-14-1342.MD&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the Texas Medical Board took Burzynski to court in Houston, Texas. Burzynski was accused of [[bait-and-switch]] tactics, improperly charging patients, not informing patients that he owns the pharmacy they were required to use to fill their medications, and of [[off-label use|off-label prescribing]] of drugs. Burzynski's former attorney Richard Jaffe has filed suit in Federal Court claiming unpaid legal fees of over $250,000. Burzynski through his current attorney denied all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Szabo|first1=Liz|title=Controversial Texas doctor Stanislaw Burzynski goes before disciplinary board |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/19/controversial-texas-doctor-stanislaw-burzynski-goes-before-disciplinary-board/76006572/ |work=USA Today|date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2017, the Texas Medical Board sanctioned Burzynski, placing him on probation and fining him $40,000.&lt;ref name="Chang2017a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Julie|title=Texas Medical Board sanctions controversial cancer doctor Burzynski|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/texas-medical-board-sanctions-controversial-cancer-doctor-burzynski/L9lDsfNTbBOuaWWqLEDBUI/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being sanctioned for over 130 violations, he was allowed to keep his medical license and to continue to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blaskiewicz |first1=Robert |title=Burzynski Sanctioned by Texas Medical Board |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff recommendations had been more punitive.&lt;ref name="Chang2017a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMBproposedJudgement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Texas Medical Board|title=In the Matter of the Complaint Against Stanislaw Rajmund Burzynski, M.D. SOAH Docket No, 503-14-1342, MD|url=http://images.houstonpress.com/media/pdf/232_final_order.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2017|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probation terms included additional medical training, disclosure of the Board's ruling to patients and medical facilities, and monitoring of his patient records.&lt;ref name="Chang2017b"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Julie|title=Texas Medical Board sanctions controversial cancer doctor Burzynski|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-medical-board-sanctions-controversial-cancer-doctor-burzynski/sxUP7GZ8XbYR4KzPTH5aCJ/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuits ===
In 1983, a federal court issued an injunction against Burzynski, barring him from shipping antineoplastons in [[interstate commerce]] without FDA approval. Burzynski continued to use antineoplastons and was charged with 75 federal counts of mail fraud and violations of federal drug laws. In 1994, a 20-day trial resulted in the dismissal of the 34 counts of mail fraud. On the other 41 counts, the jury deadlocked, failing to come to a verdict.&lt;ref name="MaxwellMayo"&gt;Larry A. "Max" Maxwell &amp; Thomas Win. Mayo, [https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1600&amp;context=smulr Health Care Law], ''SMU Law Review'', Vol. 50, issue 2 (Annual Survey of Texas Law), pp. 1291-92.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate [[Administrative law|administrative proceeding]], the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners charged Burzynski with violations of Texas state law relating to his use of antineoplastons. An [[administrative law judge]] ruled that Burzynski violated a section of the Texas Health and Safety Code dealing with prescriptions for unapproved drugs. The [[Texas Court of Appeals]] ultimately upheld this determination in a 1996 decision.&lt;ref name="MaxwellMayo"/&gt;

In December 2010, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed a multi-count complaint in the [[Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings]] against Burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards.&lt;ref name=TexasMedBoard&gt;http://www.ministryoftruth.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tmbvsburzynski.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, a Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings administrative law judge ruled that Burzynski was not [[Vicarious liability|vicariously liable]] under Texas administrative law for the actions of staff at the clinic.&lt;ref&gt;Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings via [http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/11/26/significance-of-the-tmb-dismissal-case-against-burzynski/ Stanislaw Burzynski gets off on a technicality], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] ScienceBlogs&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Lola Quinlan, an elderly, stage IV cancer patient, sued Burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to "swindle her out of $100,000". She also sued his companies, The Burzynski Clinic, the Burzynski Research Institute and Southern Family Pharmacy, in Harris County Court. She sued for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, deceptive trade and conspiracy.&lt;ref name=Langford&gt;Cameron Langford.

=== Legal threats to online critics ===

In November 2011, a music writer and editor for the British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' sought help raising £200,000 to have his 4-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with [[glioma]], treated at the Burzynski Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Bainbridge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/nov/20/a-family-gripped-by-cancer?INTCMP=SRCH |title="The worst year of my life: cancer has my family in its grip" Luke Bainbridge. 20 November 2011 |publisher=Guardian |date= November 20, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment, and had died, and challenged the validity of Burzynski's treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepticalhumanities.com/2011/11/26/stanislaw-burzynskis-public-record/ Stanislaw Burzynski's public record], Skeptical Humanities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/11/28/burzynski-clinic-the-domain-of-scoundrels-and-quacks/ Burzynski clinic the domain of scoundrels and quacks], ''Pharyngula'' ([[PZ Myers]])&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Stephens, identifying himself as a representative of the Burzynski Clinic, sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of Burzynski be removed from their sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticnorth.com/2011/11/burzynski-clinic-meet-the-streisand-effect/|title=Burzynski Clinic?

Following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by Stephens against the bloggers, the Burzynski Clinic issued a press release on November 29, 2011 confirming that the Clinic had hired Stephens "to provide [[Search engine optimization|web optimization]] services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning Dr. Burzynski and the Clinic",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BzijOpjuex1bMjE4N2JjOGItZGFlOS00NDE0LTk2YzktMThkYjFiOTU2YjNl&amp;hl=en_US|publisher=Burzynski Clinic|accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; apologizing for comments made by Stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information, and announcing that Stephens "no longer has a professional relationship with the Burzynski Clinic."

The story, including the threats against the bloggers, was covered by the ''[[BMJ]]'' (formerly the ''British Medical Journal''). The chief clinician at [[Cancer Research UK]] expressed his concern at the treatment offered, and Andy Lewis of Quackometer and science writer [[Simon Singh]], who had previously been sued by the [[British Chiropractic Association]], said that [[English defamation law|English libel law]] harms public discussion of science and medicine, and thus public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.d7865|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7865|title=Texan clinic threatens UK bloggers with legal action over criticisms of its treatments|year=2011|last1=McCartney|first1=M.|journal=BMJ|volume=343|pages=d7865|pmid=22138837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in [[Skeptical Inquirer]] published in March 2014, skeptic Robert Blaskiewicz chronicled the activities by skeptics to investigate and challenge Burzynski's claim of cancer treatments.  He claimed aggressive actions by Burzynski's supporters toward the critics, including contacting their employers, lodging complaints to state licensing boards and defamation.  Blaskiewicz pointedly indicated that, although Burzynski had dismissed Marc Stephens, his clinic has not retracted the warnings of the possibility of lawsuits against critics, that it is "a threat that hangs over all of these activists every day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Blaskiewicz|first1=Robert|title=Skeptic Activists Fighting for Burzynski’s Cancer Patients|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=38.2|issue=March/April|pages=44–47|year=2014|publisher=CSI|url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/skeptic_activists_fighting_for_burzynskis_cancer_patients/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media and commentary ==

* In 2010, Eric Merola, an [[art director]] of television commercials, released a film titled ''Burzynski: Cancer is Serious Business'', that promotes the Clinic's claims and describes Burzynski's use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/movies/04burzynski.html|title=A Texas Doctor With a Possible Cancer Cure|date=June 4, 2010|publisher=New York Times|first=Jeannette|last=Catsoulis}} {{IMDb title|1632703|Burzynski}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Merola released a follow-up movie to ''Cancer is Serious Business''.&lt;ref name=CPT12&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2908348/?ref_=nm_knf_i2 |title=Burzynski&lt; part II IMDB |date=August 21, 2013 |accessdate=August 29, 2015 |author=IMDB |publisher=IMDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]'' commented that the first movie "violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking" and that by interviewing only Burzynski's supporters, the film's producer "is either unusually credulous, or doesn't understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ella Taylor |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-01/film/quack-quack-goes-burzynski/ |title=QUACK-QUACK Goes Burzynski - Page 1 - Movies - New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as having the qualities of a "paranoid [[conspiracy theory]]" and likened it to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', adding that the film's explanatory diagrams are "simplistic to the point of idiocy". The ''Variety'' review concluded that "despite its infotainment look, ''Burzynski'' ultimately proves convincing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scheib |first=Ronnie |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942914?refcatid=31 |title=Variety Reviews - Burzynski - Film Reviews - New U.S. Release - Review by Ronnie Scheib |publisher=Variety.com |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2013, Burzynski received the [[Pigasus Award]], which is bestowed each [[April Fool's Day]] by the [[James Randi Educational Foundation|James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF)]] to "honor the five worst offenders who are intentionally or unintentionally peddling harmful paranormal and pseudoscientific nonsense."&lt;ref name="pigasus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/2074-jrefs-pigasus-awards-to-honor-dubious-peddlers-of-woo.html | title=JREF's Pigasus Awards "Honors" Dubious Peddlers of "Woo" | publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] | accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation cited as the basis for the award the high cost of antineoplaston treatments, the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy, the lack of FDA approval on the treatments, the lack of published final results of any single clinical trial, and the existence of FDA warning letters concerning research method safety and possible rules violations impacting patient safety.

The '''compressibility factor''' ('''Z'''), also known as the '''compression factor''' or the '''gas deviation factor''', is a correction factor which describes the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior. It is simply defined as the ratio of the molar volume of a gas to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure.  It is a useful thermodynamic property for modifying the [[ideal gas law]] to account for the [[real gas]] behavior.&lt;ref name=Chart&gt;[http://iptibm1.ipt.ntnu.no/~jsg/undervisning/naturgass/parlaktuna/Chap3.pdf Properties of Natural Gases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206055206/http://iptibm1.ipt.ntnu.no/~jsg/undervisning/naturgass/parlaktuna/Chap3.pdf |date=2011-02-06 }}. Includes a chart of compressibility factors versus reduced pressure and reduced temperature (on last page of the PDF document)&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, deviation from ideal behavior becomes more significant the closer a gas is to a phase change, the lower the temperature or the larger the pressure.  Compressibility factor values are usually obtained by calculation from [[Equations of State|equations of state]] (EOS), such as the [[Equation of state#Virial equation of state|virial equation]] which take compound-specific empirical constants as input.  For a gas that is a mixture of two or more pure gases (air or natural gas, for example), the [[gas composition]] must be known before compressibility can be calculated.  &lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively, the compressibility factor for specific gases can be read from generalized compressibility charts&lt;ref name=Chart/&gt; that plot &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; as a function of pressure at constant temperature.

The compressibility factor should not be confused with the [[compressibility]] (also known as [http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_compressibility coefficient of compressibility] or [http://petrowiki.org/Isothermal_compressibility_of_gases isothermal compressibility]) of a material which is the measure of the relative volume change of a fluid or solid in response to a pressure change.

==Definition and physical significance==

[[File:Compressibility factor for Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|A graphical representation of the behavior of gases and how that behavior relates to compressibility factor.]]

The compressibility factor is defined in thermodynamics and engineering frequently as:
:&lt;math&gt;Z=\frac{p}{\rho R_\text{specific} T},&lt;/math&gt;
where p is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the gas and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{specific} = \frac {R} M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant#Specific gas constant|specific gas constant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zucker, Robert D.  |author2=Biblarz, Oscar|title=Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics|edition=2nd|publisher= Wiley Books |year=2002|isbn=0-471-05967-6}} page 327&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; being the [[molar mass]], and the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Temperature#Kinds of temperature scale|absolute temperature]] ([[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale]]).

In [[statistical mechanics]] the description is:
:&lt;math&gt;Z= \frac {pV}{nRT}&lt;/math&gt;
where p is the pressure, n is the number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of gas, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute [[temperature]], and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant]].

For an [[ideal gas]] the compressibility factor is &lt;math&gt;Z=1&lt;/math&gt; per definition. In many real world applications requirements for accuracy demand that deviations from ideal gas behaviour, i.e., [[real gas]] behaviour, is taken into account. The value of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; generally increases with pressure and decreases with temperature. At high pressures molecules are colliding more often. This allows repulsive forces between molecules to have a noticeable effect, making the molar volume of the real gas (&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{m}}&lt;/math&gt;) greater than the molar volume of the corresponding ideal gas (&lt;math&gt;(V_{\mathrm{m}})_{\text{ideal gas}} = RT/p&lt;/math&gt;), which causes &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to exceed one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McQuarrie, Donald A.  |author2=Simon, John D.|title=Molecular Thermodynamics|publisher= University Science Books |year=1999|isbn=1-891389-05-X}} page 55&lt;/ref&gt; When pressures are lower, the molecules are free to move. In this case attractive forces dominate, making &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The closer the gas is to its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] or its boiling point, the more &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; deviates from the ideal case.

=== Fugacity ===
The compressibility factor is linked to the [[fugacity]] coefficient by the relation

:&lt;math&gt; f = P \exp\left(\int \frac{Z-1}{P} dP\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized compressibility factor graphs for pure gases==
[[Image:Diagramma generalizzato fattore di compressibilità.jpg|thumb|400px|Generalized compressibility factor diagram.]]

The unique relationship between the compressibility factor and the [[reduced temperature]], &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[reduced pressure]], &lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt;, was first recognized by [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] in 1873 and is known as the two-parameter [[principle of corresponding states]]. The principle of corresponding states expresses the generalization that the properties of a gas which are dependent on intermolecular forces are related to the critical properties of the gas in a universal way. That provides a most important basis for developing correlations of molecular properties.

As for the compressibility of gases, the principle of corresponding states indicates that any pure gas at the same reduced temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt;, and reduced pressure, &lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt;, should have the same compressibility factor.

The reduced temperature and pressure are defined by
:&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;P_r = \frac{P}{P_c}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; are known as the critical temperature and critical pressure of a gas. They are characteristics of each specific gas with &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; being the temperature above which it is not possible to liquify a given gas and &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum pressure required to liquify a given gas at its critical temperature. Together they define the critical point of a fluid above which distinct liquid and gas phases of a given fluid do not exist.

The pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data for real gases varies from one pure gas to another. However, when the compressibility factors of various single-component gases are graphed versus pressure along with temperature isotherms many of the graphs exhibit similar isotherm shapes.

In order to obtain a generalized graph that can be used for many different gases, the reduced pressure and temperature, &lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt;, are used to normalize the compressibility factor data. Figure 2 is an example of a generalized compressibility factor graph derived from hundreds of experimental PVT data points of 10 pure gases, namely methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, n-butane, i-pentane, n-hexane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and steam.

There are more detailed generalized compressibility factor graphs based on as many as 25 or more different pure gases, such as the Nelson-Obert graphs. Such graphs are said to have an accuracy within 1–2 percent for &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; values greater than 0.6 and within 4–6 percent for &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; values of 0.3–0.6.

The generalized compressibility factor graphs may be considerably in error for strongly polar gases which are gases for which the centers of positive and negative charge do not coincide. In such cases the estimate for &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; may be in error by as much as 15–20 percent.

The quantum gases hydrogen, helium, and neon do not conform to the corresponding-states behavior and the reduced pressure and temperature for those three gases should be redefined in the following manner to improve the accuracy of predicting their compressibility factors when using the generalized graphs:

: &lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c + 8}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_r = \frac{P}{P_c + 8}&lt;/math&gt;

where the temperatures are in kelvins and the pressures are in atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Y.V.C. Rao|title=Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics|publisher=Universities Press (India)|year=1997|isbn=81-7371-048-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to read a generalized compressibility chart==

In order to read a compressibility chart, the reduced pressure and temperature must be known. If either the reduced pressure or temperature is unknown, the reduced specific volume must be found. Unlike the reduced pressure and temperature, the reduced specific volume is not found by using the critical volume. The reduced specific volume is defined by,

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_R = \frac{\nu_\text{actual}}{RT_\text{cr}/P_\text{cr}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{actual}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cengel, Yunus A.  |author2=Boles, Michael A.|title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach, Eighth Edition|publisher= McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-339817-4}} page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Once two of the three reduced properties are found, the compressibility chart can be used. In a compressibility chart, reduced pressure is on the x-axis and Z is on the y-axis. When given the reduced pressure and temperature, find the given pressure on the x-axis. From there, move up on the chart until the given reduced temperature is found. Z is found by looking where those two points intersect. the same process can be followed if reduced specific volume is given with either reduced pressure or temperature.

==Observations made from a generalized compressibility chart==

There are three observations that can be made when looking at a generalized compressibility chart.  These observations are:

# Gases behave as an ideal gas regardless of temperature when the reduced pressure is much less than one (P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt; 1).
# When reduced temperature is greater than two (T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 2), ideal-gas behavior can be assumed regardless of pressure, unless pressure is much greater&lt;br /&gt; than one (P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; 1).
# Gases deviate from ideal-gas behavior the most in the vicinity of the critical point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cengel, Yunus A.  |author2=Boles, Michael A.|title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach, Eighth Edition|publisher= McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-339817-4}} page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical models==

The virial equation is especially useful to describe the causes of non-ideality at a molecular level (very few gases are mono-atomic) as it is derived directly from statistical mechanics:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = 1 + \frac{B}{V_\mathrm{m}} + \frac{C}{V_\mathrm{m}^2} + \frac{D}{V_\mathrm{m}^3} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

Where the coefficients in the numerator are known as virial coefficients and are functions of temperature.

The virial coefficients account for interactions between successively larger groups of molecules. For example, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; accounts for interactions between pairs, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; for interactions between three gas molecules, and so on. Because interactions between large numbers of molecules are rare, the virial equation is usually truncated after the third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, J.M.|title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics|edition=Seventh|publisher=McGraw Hill|year= 2005|isbn=0-07-310445-0|display-authors=etal}} page73&lt;/ref&gt;

The compressibility factor is linked to the intermolecular-force potential φ by:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = 1 + 2\pi \frac{N_\text{A}}{V_\text{m}} \int_0^\infty \left(1 - \exp \left(\frac{\varphi}{kT}\right)\right) r^2 dr&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Real gas]] article features more theoretical methods to compute compressibility factors.

==Physical reason for temperature and pressure dependence==

Deviations of the compressibility factor, ''Z'', from unity are due to attractive and repulsive [[Intermolecular force]]s. At a given temperature and pressure, repulsive forces tend to make the volume larger than for an ideal gas; when these forces dominate ''Z'' is greater than unity. When attractive forces dominate, ''Z'' is less than unity. The relative importance of attractive forces decreases as temperature increases (see [[Intermolecular force#Effect on the behavior of gases|effect on gases]]).

As seen [[Compressibility factor#Generalized compressibility factor graphs for pure gases|above]], the behavior of ''Z'' is qualitatively similar for all gases. Molecular nitrogen, N{{sub|2}}, is used here to further describe and understand that behavior. All data used in this section were obtained from the NIST Chemistry WebBook.&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;[http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/ NIST Chemistry WebBook]&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful to note that for N{{sub|2}} the [[Boiling point|normal boiling point]] of the liquid is 77.4 K and the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is at 126.2 K and 34.0 bar.

[[File:Z_Overview.png|thumbnail|Overview of the temperature and pressure dependence of the compressibility factor for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The figure on the right shows an overview covering a wide temperature range. At low temperature (100 K), the curve has a characteristic check-mark shape, the rising portion of the curve is very nearly directly proportional to pressure. At intermediate temperature (160 K), there is a smooth curve with a broad minimum; although the high pressure portion is again nearly linear, it is no longer directly proportional to pressure. Finally, at high temperature (400 K), ''Z'' is above unity at all pressures. For all curves, ''Z'' approaches the ideal gas value of unity at low pressure and exceeds that value at very high pressure.

[[File:N2 Compressibility Factor Low T.png|thumbnail|The pressure dependence of the compressibility factor for N{{sub|2}} at low temperatures. The dashed line shows the gas-liquid coexistence curve.]]
To better understand these curves, a closer look at the behavior for low temperature and pressure is given in the second figure. All of the curves start out with ''Z'' equal to unity at zero pressure and ''Z'' initially decreases as pressure increases. N{{sub|2}} is a gas under these conditions, so the distance between molecules is large, but becomes smaller as pressure increases. This increases the attractive interactions between molecules, pulling the molecules closer together and causing the volume to be less than for an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. Higher temperature reduces the effect of the attractive interactions and the gas behaves in a more nearly ideal manner.

As the pressure increases, the gas eventually reaches the gas-liquid [[Binodal|coexistence curve]], shown by the dashed line in the figure. When that happens, the attractive interactions have become strong enough to overcome the tendency of thermal motion to cause the molecules to spread out; so the gas condenses to form a liquid. Points on the vertical portions of the curves correspond to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being partly gas and partly liquid. On the coexistence curve, there are then two possible values for ''Z'', a larger one corresponding to the gas and a smaller value corresponding to the liquid. Once all the gas has been converted to liquid, the volume decreases only slightly with further increases in pressure; then ''Z'' is very nearly proportional to pressure.

As temperature and pressure increase along the coexistence curve, the gas becomes more like a liquid and the liquid becomes more like a gas. At the critical point, the two are the same. So for temperatures above the critical temperature (126.2 K), there is no phase transition; as pressure increases the gas gradually transforms into something more like a liquid. Just above the critical point there is a range of pressure for which ''Z'' drops quite rapidly (see the 130 K curve), but at higher temperatures the process is entirely gradual.

[[File:N2 Compressibility Factor High T.png|thumbnail|The pressure dependence of the compressibility factor for N{{sub|2}} at high temperatures, compared with that for an ideal gas.]]The final figures shows the behavior at temperatures well above the critical temperatures. The repulsive interactions are essentially unaffected by temperature, but the attractive interaction have less and less influence. Thus, at sufficiently high temperature, the repulsive interactions dominate at all pressures.

This can be seen in the graph showing the high temperature behavior. As temperature increases, the initial slope becomes less negative, the pressure at which ''Z'' is a minimum gets smaller, and the pressure at which repulsive interactions start to dominate, i.e. where ''Z'' goes from less than unity to greater than unity, gets smaller. At the [[Boyle temperature]] (327 K for N{{sub|2}}), the attractive and repulsive effects cancel each other at low pressure. Then ''Z'' remains at the ideal gas value of unity up to pressures of several tens of bar. Above the Boyle temperature, the compressibility factor is always greater than unity and increases slowly but steadily as pressure increases.

==Experimental values==

It is extremely difficult to generalize at what pressures or temperatures the deviation from the [[ideal gas]] becomes important. As a rule of thumb, the ideal gas law is reasonably accurate up to a pressure of about 2 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], and even higher for small non-associating molecules.  For example, [[methyl chloride]], a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar molecule]] and therefore with significant intermolecular forces, the experimental value for the compressibility factor is &lt;math&gt;Z=0.9152&lt;/math&gt; at a pressure of 10&amp;nbsp;atm and temperature of 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perry's chemical engineers' handbook|edition=6|publisher= MCGraw-Hill |year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}} page 3-268&lt;/ref&gt;  For air (small non-polar molecules) at approximately the same conditions, the compressibility factor is only &lt;math&gt;Z=1.0025&lt;/math&gt; (see table below for 10 [[Bar (unit)|bars]], 400 K).

===Compressibility of air===
Normal [[air]] comprises in crude numbers 80 percent [[nitrogen]] {{chem|N|2}} and 20 percent [[oxygen]] {{chem|O|2}}.  Both molecules are small and [[non-polar]] (and therefore non-associating).  We can therefore expect that the behaviour of air within broad temperature and pressure ranges can be approximated as an ideal gas with reasonable accuracy.  Experimental values for the compressibility factor confirm this.

In [[theoretical physics]], a '''constraint algebra''' is a linear space of all [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s and all of their polynomial functions or functionals whose action on the physical vectors of the [[Hilbert space]] should be equal to zero.

For example, in electromagnetism, the equation for the [[Gauss' law]]
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \vec E = \rho&lt;/math&gt;
is an equation of motion that does not include any time derivatives. This is why it is counted as a constraint, not a dynamical equation of motion. In [[quantum electrodynamics]], one first constructs a Hilbert space in which Gauss' law does not hold automatically. The true Hilbert space of physical states is constructed as a subspace of the original Hilbert space of vectors that satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot \vec E(x) - \rho(x)) |\psi\rangle = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In more general theories, the constraint algebra may be a [[noncommutative algebra]].

'''''Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information''''' is a popular [[science book]] by [[Vlatko Vedral]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2010. Vedral examines [[information theory]] and proposes [[information]] as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and [[physical phenomena]]. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of [[entropy]], the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]], the replication of DNA, development of [[social networks]], [[quantum]] behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of [[indeterminism]] in the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature of [[particles]], time, [[determinism]], and of reality itself.

==Contents==

==="Creation Ex Nihilo: Something from Nothing"===
Vedral believes in the principle that information is physical. ''[[Creation ex nihilo]]'' comes from [[Catholic]] dogma, the idea being that God created the universe out of nothing. Vedral says that invoking a supernatural being as an explanation for creation does not explain reality because the supernatural being would have to come into existence itself too somehow presumably from nothing (or else from an infinite regression of supernatural beings), thus of course the reality can come from nothing without a supernatural being. [[Occam's razor]] principle favours the simplest explanation. Vedral believes information is the fundamental building block of reality as it occurs at the macro level (economics, human behaviour etc.) as well as the subatomic level. Vedral argues that information is the only candidate for such a building block that can explain its own existence as information generates additional information that needs to be compressed thus generating more information. 'Annihilation of everything' is a more fitting term than ''creation ex nihilo'' Vedral states, as compression of possibilities is the process of how new information is created.

==="Information for all Seasons"===
Vedral uses an [[Italo Calvino]] philosophical story about a [[tarot]]-like card game as the kernel for his metaphor of conscious life arriving ''[[in medias res]]'' to a pre-existing contextual reality. In this game the individual observers/players (Vedral suggests: quantum physics, thermodynamics, biology, sociology, economics, philosophy) lay down cards with ambiguous meanings as an attempt to communicate messages to deduce meaning out of the other players' interactions. The results (information) of previous rounds establish contextual rules for observers/players in subsequent rounds. The point of this game is not established until the last card has been played as later cards can change the meaning of previous events, as in the case of the quantum explanation for the [[photoelectric effect]] instantly disproving [[classical physics]]. Vedral points out that in our reality there is no last card.

==="Back to Basics: Bits and Pieces"===
[[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] or information content measured as the surprise value of a particular event, is essentially inversely proportional to the logarithm of the event's probability, i = log(1/p). [[Claude Shannon]]'s information theory arose from research at [[Bell labs]], building upon [[George Boole|George Boole's]] digital logic. As information theory predicts common and easily predicted words tend to become shorter for optimal communication channel efficiency while less common words tend to be longer for redundancy and [[error correction]]. Vedral compares the process of life to [[John von Neumann]]'s self replicating [[automata]]. These are enduring information carriers that will survive wear and tear of the individual by producing copies that can in turn go on to produce more copies.

==="Digital Romance: Life is a Four-Letter Word"===
Genetic code as an efficient digital information store, containing built in [[codon]] redundancy for error correction in transcription.

==="Murphy’s Law: I Knew this Would Happen to Me"===
Examines the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics and the process of information increasing entropy. [[Maxwell's Demon]] was thought to be a way around this inevitability, however such a demon would run out of information storage space and have to delete unwanted data thus having to do work to do so, increasing entropy.

==="Place Your Bets: In It to Win It"===
[[Blackjack]] as controlled risk taking using Shannon's information theory probability formulas. Casino as a ′cool′ financial entropy source and the gambler as a ′hot′ financial source, once again the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics means the flow is almost always from hot to cold in the long run. For managed risk spread bets widely and in high risk high reward investments (assuming a known probability), this is the Log optimal portfolio approach.

==="Social Informatics: Get Connected or Die Tryin’"===
[[Six degrees of separation]] means well connected people tend to be more successful as their social networks expose them to more chances to make choices they want. [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] precommitment as strategy in social and self-control, for example burning your bridges by buying gym membership to help motivated self win over lazy self. [[Mutual information]] resulting in [[phase transitions]] in social and political demography as well as physical systems, like water freezing into ice at a particular critical temperature or magnetic fields spontaneously aligning in certain atoms when cooling from a molten state.

==="Quantum Schmuntum: Lights, Camera, Action!"===
Vedral examines the basis of [[quantum information]], the [[qubit]], and examines [[one-time pad]] quantum cryptography as the most secure form of [[encryption]] because of its uncomputability. [[Quantum entanglement]] demonstrates the importance of mutual information in defining outcomes in a reality.

==="Surfing the Waves: Hyper-Fast Computers"===
[[Quantum computers]] offer a search advantage over classical computers by searching many database elements at once as a result of quantum [[Quantum superposition|superpositions]]. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical [[algorithms]]. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.

==="Children of the Aimless Chance: Randomness versus Determinism"===
[[Randomness]] is key to generating new sources of surprise in a reality. Compression of these new sources to discard unimportant information is the [[deterministic]] element and organising principle.

==="Sand Reckoning: Whose Information is It, Anyway?"===
The information content of the universe as measured in [[bit]]s or [[qubits]]. Vedral uses the initial effort of [[Archimedes]] of Syracuse in calculating the [[The Sand Reckoner|amount of sand]] that could theoretically fit inside the universe and compares it to a modern-day attempt to calculate the bit content of the universe. Vedral however sees this content as ultimately limitless as possibly maximum entropy is never reached as compression of complexity is an open ended process and random events will continue to occur. As Vedral sees information as the ultimate building block of physical reality, he speculates that information originating at any scale can force outcomes in all other scales to abide where mutual information is shared. For example, a human performed macro-level scientific test in search of a behaviour in a quantum particle could set parameters for that type of particle in the future when subjected to a similar test.

==="Destruction ab Toto: Nothing from Something"===
The information basis for ''creation ex nihilo''. According to [[John von Neumann]], starting trivially from an [[empty set]] of numbers an [[Infinity|infinite]] sequence of numbers can [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] their way out. An empty set creates the number 1 by observing an empty set within itself which is enough of a basis for distinguishability. It creates the number 2 by observing an empty set within the second empty set and the number 1, and so on. Vedral sees this not as creation but as [[data compression]], as every event of a reality breaks the [[symmetry]] of the pre-existing formlessness. Science is the process of describing a large amount of observed phenomena in a compressed programmatic way to predict future outcomes, and in this process of data compression science creates new information by eliminating all contrary possibilities to explain those phenomena.

==Synopsis==
The book explains the world as being made up of information. The Universe and its workings are the ebb and flow of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter [[Digital data|digital]] code called [[DNA]]. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He explains the nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]]. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour - effects such as '[[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]', which [[Einstein]] called 'spooky action at a distance' and explores cutting edge work on the harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast [[quantum computers]], and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and his concept of “[[it from bit]]”. The ideas challenge our concept of the nature of particles, of time, of determinism, and of reality itself.

'''Distancing language''' is [[Phrase|phrasing]] used by a person to psychologically "distance" themselves from a statement. It is used in an effort to separate a particular topic, idea, discussion, or group from their own personal identity for the purpose of [[self-deception]], [[Deception|deceiving others]], or disunifying oneself from a team, among others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nonprofitaf.com/2014/01/distancing-language-what-it-is-and-why-you-must-crush-it/|title=Distancing language, what it is, and why you must crush it|date=2014-01-13|work=Nonprofit AF|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yousimplybetter.com/practical-communication-tools-distancing-language/|title=Practical Communication Tools: Distancing Language {{!}} You Simply Better|website=yousimplybetter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of distancing language is primarily [[subconscious]] as a means to disengage oneself from acts or ideas that conflict with their personal values, beliefs, and ideals, and is often used to identify if a person is [[Lie|lying]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/minds-business/to-spot-a-liar-listen-closely.html|title=To Spot a Liar, Listen Closely|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/final-debate-2016-lying-politicians-214370|title=How to Tell When Trump and Clinton Are Lying Tonight|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious uses of distancing language are often [[Euphemism|euphemistic]] in nature in order to downplay or desensitize a [[Loaded language|loaded topic]] in an effort to separate the speaker from the subject at hand. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170126-the-hidden-danger-of-euphemisms|title=The hidden danger of euphemisms|last=Peters|first=Mark|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices of distancing language==

=== Avoiding first-person pronouns ===
The use of first-person pronouns as a singular ("I", "me", "my", "myself"), and as a plural ("we", "us", "our", "ourselves") indicates a psychological closeness between the speaker and the topic of discussion. Omitting first-person pronouns suggests the absence of responsibility and identification of the ideas conveyed in the statement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Socialigence|title=Distancing Language {{!}} Verbal Clues to Deception: 4.2|date=2016-10-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0rNNcwIPRk|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "You" as a third-person pronoun ====
In the English language, the pronoun "you" can be used as an appropriate use of distancing language in a universal context, where the statements are intended to be applied to anyone in the general public (e.g. the statement "You should never drink and drive" pertains to anyone who drives).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2015/07/distancing-language-and-sexual-assault.html|title=Statement Analysis ®: Distancing Language and Sexual Assault|last=Hyatt|first=Peter|date=2015-07-15|website=Statement Analysis ®|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, “you” is a common replacement for a first-person pronoun, often to hint at one’s lack of commitment to or interest in a group or organization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* When suggesting ways to increase traffic to an organization's information booth at a [[fair]], a group member says, "''You''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ll get the attention of more people if ''you'' play upbeat music." The alternative phrasing, "''We''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ll get the attention of more people if ''we'' play upbeat music" suggests the speaker identifies with the organization, accepting the shared task of garnering attention to the organization's booth.

==== Passive voicing ====
The use of a [[passive voice]] allows for the omission of identity or ownership, since the nature of a passive voice is that an action is done to an object, and the action's agent is not necessary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aje.com/en/arc/writing-with-active-or-passive-voice/|title=Active vs. Passive voice: What’s the difference? What should I use? And why does it matter? {{!}} AJE {{!}} American Journal Experts|website=www.aje.com|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A restaurant server tells a customer that "A mistake was made on your order" instead of "I made a mistake on your order" as a way of avoiding ownership.

=== “that” vs. "this" ===
[[Demonstrative|Demonstrative determiners]] such as “that” and “those” illustrate a physical or psychological distance between the object and the speaker. The demonstratives “this” and “these” refer to an object that is close to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/demonstratives/|title=Demonstratives {{!}} English Grammar {{!}} EF|website=EF|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A business owner says, "I did not come up with ''those'' ideas", after her business proposal was rejected by investors.

* 

=== Deflecting, minimizing, omission of detail ===
{{see also|Circumlocution|Minimisation (psychology)|Elegant variation}}
Avoiding straight-forward statements is common in deception, either to another person or in self-deception, in order to avoid details that might signify ownership or personal knowledge of the topic. This is accomplished through statements that deflect the topic or that minimize the importance and impact of the topic; alternatively, the speaker can keep statements vague or use [[Hedge (linguistics)|hedge words]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* When a man is asked about his ex-girlfriend's [[infidelity]], he shrugs and says, "I guess I should've seen it coming. We were fighting all the time at that point anyway, so we were probably going to break up sooner rather than later."

=== Euphemisms ===
{{see also|Metaphor}}[[Euphemism|Euphemisms]] are used as a means of minimizing negative emotions that the statement may elicit (either from the speaker or others), in order to make the speaker appear unaffected and the situation impersonal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clarkandmiller.com/25-english-euphemisms-for-delicate-situations/|title=25 Common English Euphemisms {{!}} Clark and Miller|date=2017-09-01|work=Clark and Miller|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Military personnel]] may use a range of distancing terms for [[combatants]] either killing or getting killed. They may also employ distancing, dehumanizing terms for enemy combatants. "[[Collateral damage]]" for the incidental or accidental killing of [[non-combatants]] during attacks on [[Legitimate military target|legitimate military targets]] is an example. Other examples include "blue-on-blue" or [[Friendly fire|"friendly" fire]].

== Examples of distancing language in media ==
[[File:Response to the Lewinsky Allegations (January 26, 1998) Bill Clinton.ogv|thumb|Clinton responding to the sexual allegations on January 26, 1998.]]
Former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s statement denying a [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky]] is a famous example of distancing language used in deception, referring to Lewinsky as "that woman" despite the fact it was public knowledge that Clinton knew her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-lie-detective-S-F-psychologist-has-made-a-2768998.php|title=The lie detective / S.F psychologist has made a science of reading facial expressions|date=2002-09-16|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Clinton avoided first-person pronouns, alternatively using the "you" pronoun in reference to the [[White House]] (as a whole) being inundated with phone calls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Current U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] has shown similar distancing language when dismissing sexual misconduct allegations and shady business deals, and reverts to using "you" when speaking about plans he does not wish to disclose.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Eye tracking''' is the process of measuring either the point of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]] (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.  An '''eye tracker''' is a device for measuring eye positions and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]].  Eye trackers are used in research on the [[visual system]], in psychology, in [[psycholinguistics]], marketing, as an input device for [[human-computer interaction]], and in product design.  There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement.  The most popular variant uses video images from which the eye position is extracted.  Other methods use [[search coil]]s or are based on the [[electrooculography|electrooculogram]].

[[File:Yarbus eye tracker.jpg|thumb|Yarbus eye tracker from the 1960s.]]

== History ==
In the 1800s, studies of eye movement were made using direct observations.

In 1879 in Paris, [[Louis Émile Javal]] observed that reading does not involve a smooth sweeping of the eyes along the text, as previously assumed, but a series of short stops (called fixations) and quick [[saccade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Huey 1908/1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation raised important questions about reading, questions which were explored during the 1900s: On which words do the eyes stop? For how long? When do they regress to already seen words?

[[File:Reading Fixations Saccades.jpg|thumb|left|320px|An example of fixations and saccades over text. This is the typical pattern of eye movement during reading. The eyes never move smoothly over still text.]]
Edmund Huey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huey|first=Edmund|title=The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (Reprint)|publisher=MIT Press 1968 (originally published 1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the [[pupil]]. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.

The first non-intrusive eye-trackers were built by Guy Thomas Buswell in Chicago, using beams of light that were reflected on the eye and then recording them on film. Buswell made systematic studies into reading&lt;ref&gt;Buswell (1922, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; and picture viewing.&lt;ref&gt;(1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; did important eye tracking research and his 1967 book is often quoted. He showed that the task given to a subject has a very large influence on the subject's eye movement. He also wrote about the relation between fixations and interest:

:"All the records ... show conclusively that the character of the eye movement is either completely independent of or only very slightly dependent on the material of the picture and how it was made, provided that it is flat or nearly flat."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclical pattern in the examination of pictures "is dependent on not only what is shown on the picture, but also the problem facing the observer and the information that he hopes to gain from the picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yarbus The Visitor.jpg|thumb|right|320px|This study by {{Harvtxt|Yarbus|1967}} is often referred to as evidence on how the task given to a person influences his or her eye movement.]]
:"Records of eye movements show that the observer's attention is usually held only by certain elements of the picture.... Eye movement reflects the human thought processes; so the observer's thought may be followed to some extent from records of eye movement (the thought accompanying the examination of the particular object). It is easy to determine from these records which elements attract the observer's eye (and, consequently, his thought), in what order, and how often."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"/&gt;

:"The observer's attention is frequently drawn to elements which do not give important information but which, in his opinion, may do so. Often an observer will focus his attention on elements that are unusual in the particular circumstances, unfamiliar, incomprehensible, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... when changing its points of fixation, the observer's eye repeatedly returns to the same elements of the picture. Additional time spent on perception is not used to examine the secondary elements, but to reexamine the most important elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eye tracking thru glass.JPG|thumb|320px|This study by Hunziker (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Hunziker, H. W. (1970). Visuelle Informationsaufnahme und Intelligenz: Eine Untersuchung über die Augenfixationen beim Problemlösen. Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Psychologie und ihre Anwendungen, 1970, 29, Nr 1/2 (english abstract: http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/forsch1e.htm )&lt;/ref&gt; on ''eye tracking in problem solving'' used simple 8&amp;nbsp;mm film to track eye movement by filming the subject through a glass plate on which the visual problem was displayed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/eye movements problem solving.swf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/forsch1e.htm|title=Visual Perception: Eye Movements in Problem Solving.|website=www.learning-systems.ch|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1970s, eye-tracking research expanded rapidly, particularly reading research. A good overview of the research in this period is given by [[Dr. Keith Rayner|Rayner]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayner (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Just and Carpenter&lt;ref&gt;Just and Carpenter (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the influential ''Strong eye-mind hypothesis'', that "there is no appreciable lag between what is fixated and what is processed". If this hypothesis is correct, then when a subject looks at a word or object, he or she also thinks about it (process cognitively), and for exactly as long as the recorded fixation. The hypothesis is often taken for granted by researchers using eye-tracking. However, [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent techniques]] offer an interesting option in order to disentangle overt and covert attentions, to differentiate what is fixated and what is processed.

During the 1980s, the eye-mind hypothesis was often questioned in light of covert attention,&lt;ref&gt;Posner (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright &amp; Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the attention to something that one is not looking at, which people often do. If covert attention is common during eye-tracking recordings, the resulting scan-path and fixation patterns would often show not where our attention has been, but only where the eye has been looking, failing to indicate cognitive processing.

The 1980s also saw the birth of using eye-tracking to answer questions related to human-computer interaction.  Specifically, researchers investigated how users search for commands in computer menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, computers allowed researchers to use eye-tracking results in real time, primarily to help disabled users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf%5D,|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, there has been growth in using eye tracking to study how users interact with different computer interfaces. Specific questions researchers ask are related to how easy different interfaces are for users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"/&gt;  The results of the eye tracking research can lead to changes in design of the interface. Yet another recent area of research focuses on Web development. This can include how users react to drop-down menus or where they focus their attention on a website so the developer knows where to place an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmi-interaktiv.de/uploads/media/MMI-Interaktiv0303_SchiesslDudaThoelkeFischer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoffman,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998&lt;/ref&gt; current consensus is that visual attention is always slightly (100 to 250 ms) ahead of the eye. But as soon as attention moves to a new position, the eyes will want to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0W-3VXNHBP-10&amp;_user=952938&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049220&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=952938&amp;md5=4f7fbf4f015fde59aa9a39b30154e7f3 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(95)00294-4 | volume=36 | title=Saccade target selection and object recognition: Evidence for a common attentional mechanism | year=1996 | journal=Vision Research | pages=1827–1837 | last1 = Deubel | first1 = Heiner | pmid=8759451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We still cannot infer specific cognitive processes directly from a fixation on a particular object in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;Holsanova 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a fixation on a face in a picture may indicate recognition, liking, dislike, puzzlement etc. Therefore, eye tracking is often coupled with other methodologies, such as [[Protocol analysis|introspective verbal protocols]].

== Tracker types ==
Eye-trackers measure rotations of the eye in one of several ways, but principally they fall into three categories: (i) measurement of the movement of an object (normally, a special contact lens) attached to the eye; (ii) optical tracking without direct contact to the eye; and (iii) measurement of electric potentials using electrodes placed around the eyes.

=== Eye-attached tracking ===
The first type uses an attachment to the eye, such as a special contact lens with an embedded mirror or magnetic field sensor, and the movement of the attachment is measured with the assumption that it does not slip significantly as the eye rotates. Measurements with tight-fitting contact lenses have provided extremely sensitive recordings of eye movement, and magnetic search coils are the method of choice for researchers studying the dynamics and underlying physiology of eye movement. This method allows the measurement of eye movement in horizontal, vertical and torsion directions.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Robinson: A method of measuring eye movement using a scleral search coil in a magnetic field, IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Electronics, October 1963, 137–145 ([http://ebooks.yasse.ir/ebooks/IEEE_Journals/Bio-Medical_Electronics_IRE_T/A_Method_of_Measuring_Eye_Movemnent_Using_a_Scieral_Search_Coil_in_a_Magnetic_Field-274.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical tracking ===
[[File:EYE-SYNC eye-tracking analyzer.JPG|thumb|An eye-tracking [[head-mounted display]]. Each eye has an LED light source (gold-color metal) on the side of the display lens, and a camera under the display lens.]]
The second broad category uses some non-contact, optical method for measuring eye motion. Light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a video camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Video-based eye trackers typically use the corneal reflection (the first [[Purkinje images|Purkinje image]]) and the center of the pupil as features to track over time. A more sensitive type of eye-tracker, the dual-Purkinje eye tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.000527|last=Crane|first=H.D.|author2=Steele, C.M.|title=Generation-V dual-Purkinje-image eyetracker|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=527–537|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses reflections from the front of the cornea (first Purkinje image) and the back of the lens (fourth Purkinje image) as features to track. A still more sensitive method of tracking is to image features from inside the eye, such as the retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates. Optical methods, particularly those based on video recording, are widely used for gaze-tracking and are favored for being non-invasive and inexpensive.
{{See also|Video-oculography}}

=== Electric potential measurement ===
The third category uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are the origin of a steady electric potential field which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called [[EOG|Electrooculogram (EOG)]]. If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the common electrode setup, two separate movement components – a horizontal and a vertical – can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel,&lt;ref&gt;Elbert, T., Lutzenberger, W., Rockstroh, B., Birbaumer, N., 1985. Removal of ocular artifacts from the EEG. A biophysical approach to the EOG. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 60, 455-463.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keren | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Yuval-Greenberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Deouell | first3 = L.Y. | year = 2010 | title = Saccadic spike potentials in gamma-band EEG: Characterization, detection and suppression | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 2248–2263 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.057 | pmid=19874901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to potential drifts and variable relations between the EOG signal amplitudes and the saccade sizes, it is challenging to use EOG for measuring slow eye movement and detecting gaze direction. EOG is, however, a very robust technique for measuring [[saccade|saccadic eye movement]] associated with gaze shifts and detecting [[blink]]s. 
Contrary to video-based eye-trackers, EOG allows recording of eye movements even with eyes closed, and can thus be used in sleep research. It is a very light-weight approach that, in contrast to current video-based eye-trackers, requires only very low computational power; works under different lighting conditions; and can be implemented as an embedded, self-contained wearable system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulling|first=A. |author2=Roggen, D. |author3=Tröster, G.|year=2009|title=Wearable EOG goggles: Seamless sensing and context-awareness in everyday environments|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments (JAISE)|volume=1|pages=157–171|issue=2|doi=10.3233/AIS-2009-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus the method of choice for measuring eye movement in mobile daily-life situations and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] phases during sleep.  The major disadvantage of EOG is its relatively poor gaze-direction accuracy compared to a video tracker.  That is, it is difficult to determine with good accuracy exactly where a subject is looking, though the time of eye movements can be determined.

==Technologies and techniques==

The most widely used current designs are video-based eye-trackers. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at some kind of stimulus. Most modern eye-trackers use the center of the pupil and [[infrared]] / [[near-infrared]] non-collimated light to create [[corneal reflection]]s (CR). The vector between the pupil center and the corneal reflections can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the individual is usually needed before using the eye tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzner Hansen|first=Dan|author2=Qiang Ji|title=In the Eye of the Beholder: A Survey of Models for Eyes and Gaze|journal=IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.|date=March 2010|volume=32|issue=3|pages=478–500|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1729561|doi=10.1109/tpami.2009.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two general types of infrared / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye-tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is [[coaxial]] with the optical path, then the eye acts as a [[retroreflector]] as the light reflects off the [[retina]] creating a bright pupil effect similar to [[Red-eye effect|red eye]]. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the retroreflection from the retina is directed away from the camera.&lt;ref name=gneo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gneo|first1=Massimo|last2=Schmid|first2=Maurizio|last3=Conforto|first3=Silvia|last4=D’Alessio|first4=Tommaso|title=A free geometry model-independent neural eye-gaze tracking system|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date=2012|volume=9|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-9-82}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright-pupil tracking creates greater iris/pupil contrast, allowing more robust eye-tracking with all iris pigmentation, and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye: A Survey of Human Vision; Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright.

Another, less used, method is known as passive light. It uses visible light to illuminate, something which may cause some distractions to users.&lt;ref name=gneo/&gt; Another challenge with this method is that the contrast of the pupil is less than in the active light methods, therefore, the center of [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is used for calculating the vector instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigut|first1=J|last2=Sidha|first2=SA|title=Iris center corneal reflection method for gaze tracking using visible light.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering|date=February 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=411–9|pmid=20952326|doi=10.1109/tbme.2010.2087330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This calculation needs to detect the boundary of the iris and the white [[sclera]] ([[Corneal limbus|limbus]] tracking). It presents another challenge for vertical eye movements due to obstruction of eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=H|last2=Krishnaswamy|first2=P|last3=Rolland|first3=JP|title=Video-based eyetracking methods and algorithms in head-mounted displays.|journal=Optics Express|date=15 May 2006|volume=14|issue=10|pages=4328–50|pmid=19516585|doi=10.1364/oe.14.004328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye-tracking setups vary greatly: some are head-mounted, some require the head to be stable (for example, with a chin rest), and some function remotely and automatically track the head during motion.  Most use a sampling rate of at least 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Although 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz is more common, today many video-based eye trackers run at 240, 350 or even 1000/1250&amp;nbsp;Hz, speeds needed in order to capture fixational eye movements or correctly measure saccade dynamics.

Eye movements are typically divided into [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] and saccades – when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position, and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a [[scanpath]]. Smooth pursuit describes the eye following a moving object. Fixational eye movements include [[microsaccade]]s: small, involuntary saccades that occur during attempted fixation. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation or smooth pursuit, but not during a saccade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purves |first=D |author2=st al. |date=2001 |title=Neuroscience, 2d ed. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11156/ |location=Sunderland (MA)|publisher=Sinauer Assocs. |page=What Eye Movements Accomplish|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience.  Other biological factors (some as simple as gender) may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes, or as a method of input in [[gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent displays]], also known as [[gaze-based interfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Majaranta, P., Aoki, H., Donegan, M., Hansen, D.W., Hansen, J.P., Hyrskykari, A., Räihä, K.J., ''Gaze Interaction and Applications of Eye Tracking: Advances in Assistive Technologies'', IGI Global, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data presentation ==

Interpretation of the data that is recorded by the various types of eye-trackers employs a variety of software that animates or visually represents it, so that the visual behavior of one or more users can be graphically resumed. The video is generally manually coded to identify the AOIs(Area Of Interests) or recently using artificial intelligence. Graphical presentation is rarely the basis of research results, since they are limited in terms of what can be analysed - research relying on eye-tracking, for example, usually requires quantitative measures of the eye movement events and their parameters, The following visualisations are the most commonly used:

'''Animated representations of a point on the interface'''
This method is used when the visual behavior is examined individually indicating where the user focused their gaze in each moment, complemented with a small path that indicates the previous saccade movements, as seen in the image.

'''Static representations of the saccade path'''
This is fairly similar to the one described above, with the difference that this is static method. A higher level of expertise than with the animated ones is required to interpret this.

'''Heat maps'''
An alternative static representation, used mainly for the agglomerated analysis of the visual exploration patterns in a group of users. In these representations, the ‘hot’ zones or zones with higher density designate where the users focused their gaze (not their attention) with a higher frequency. Heat maps are the best known visualization technique for eyetracking studies.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. Pernice, Kara. (2010).

'''Blind zones maps, or focus maps'''
This method is a simplified version of the Heat maps where the visually less attended zones by the users are displayed clearly, thus allowing for an easier understanding of the most relevant information, that is to say, we are informed about which zones were not seen by the users.

== Eye-tracking vs. gaze-tracking ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gaze Tracking Example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of eye gaze trace overlay.]] --&gt;Eye-trackers necessarily measure the rotation of the eye with respect to some frame of reference. This is usually tied to the measuring system. Thus, if the measuring system is head-mounted, as with EOG or a video-based system mounted to a helmet, then eye-in-head angles are measured. To deduce the line of sight in world coordinates, the head must be kept in a constant position or its movements must be tracked as well. In these cases, head direction is added to eye-in-head direction to determine gaze direction.

If the measuring system is table-mounted, as with scleral search coils or table-mounted camera (“remote”) systems, then gaze angles are measured directly in world coordinates. Typically, in these situations head movements are prohibited. For example, the head position is fixed using a bite bar or a forehead support. Then a head-centered reference frame is identical to a world-centered reference frame. Or colloquially, the eye-in-head position directly determines the gaze direction.

Some results are available on human eye movements under natural conditions where head movements are allowed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einhäuser | first1 = W | last2 = Moeller | first2 = GU | last3 = Schumann | first3 = F | last4 = Conradt | first4 = J | last5 = Vockeroth | first5 = J | last6 = Bartl | first6 = K | last7 = Schneider | first7 = E | last8 = König | first8 = P | year = 2009 | title = Eye-head coordination during free exploration in human and cat | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1164 | issue = | pages = 353–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhäuser W, Schumann F, Bardins S, Bartl K, Böning G, Schneider E and König P (2007).

== Eye tracking in practice ==
A great deal of research has gone into studies of the mechanisms and dynamics of eye rotation, but the goal of eye- tracking is most often to estimate gaze direction. Users may be interested in what features of an image draw the eye, for example. It is important to realize that the eye-tracker does not provide absolute gaze direction, but rather can measure only changes in gaze direction. In order to know precisely what a subject is looking at, some calibration procedure is required in which the subject looks at a point or series of points, while the eye tracker records the value that corresponds to each gaze position. (Even those techniques that track features of the retina cannot provide exact gaze direction because there is no specific anatomical feature that marks the exact point where the visual axis meets the retina, if indeed there is such a single, stable point.) An accurate and reliable calibration is essential for obtaining valid and repeatable eye movement data, and this can be a significant challenge for non-verbal subjects or those who have unstable gaze.

Each method of eye-tracking has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of an eye-tracking system depends on considerations of cost and application. There are offline methods and online procedures like [[AttentionTracking]]. There is a trade-off between cost and sensitivity, with the most sensitive systems costing many tens of thousands of dollars and requiring considerable expertise to operate properly. Advances in computer and video technology have led to the development of relatively low-cost systems that are useful for many applications and fairly easy to use. Interpretation of the results still requires some level of expertise, however, because a misaligned or poorly calibrated system can produce wildly erroneous data.

===Eye-tracking while driving a car in a difficult situation===

[[Image:Eye movements of drivers.jpg|300px | frame| right |Frames from narrow road eye tracking described in this section&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}} Based on data from:Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The eye movement of two groups of drivers have been filmed with a special head camera by a team of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: Novice and experienced drivers had their eye-movement recorded while approaching a bend of a narrow road.
The series of images has been condensed from the original film frames&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt; to show 2 eye fixations per image for better comprehension.

Each of these stills corresponds to approximately 0.5 seconds in realtime.

The series of images shows an example of eye fixations #9 to #14 of a typical novice and an experienced driver.

Comparison of the top images shows that the experienced driver checks the curve and even has Fixation No. 9 left to look aside while the novice driver needs to check the road and estimate his distance to the parked car.

In the middle images, the experienced driver is now fully concentrating on the location where an oncoming car could be seen. The novice driver concentrates his view on the parked car.

In the bottom image the novice is busy estimating the distance between the left wall and the parked car, while the experienced driver can use his [[peripheral vision]] for that and still concentrate his view on the dangerous point of the curve: If a car appears there, he has to give way, i. e. stop to the right instead of passing the parked car.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures from: Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-tracking of younger and elderly people while walking===

While walking, elderly subjects depend more on foveal vision than do younger subjects. Their walking speed is decreased by a limited [[visual field]], probably caused by a deteriorated peripheral vision.

Younger subjects make use of both their central and peripheral vision while walking. Their peripheral vision allows faster control over the process of walking.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh N, Fukuda T. (2002) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1283 Comparative study of eye movement in extent of central and peripheral vision and use by young and elderly walkers]. ''Percept Mot Skills.'' 2002 Jun;94(3 Pt 2):1283–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of disciplines use eye-tracking techniques, including [[cognitive science]]; [[psychology]] (notably [[psycholinguistics]]; the visual world paradigm); [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI); [[human factors and ergonomics]]; [[marketing research]] and medical research (neurological diagnosis). Specific applications include the tracking eye movement in [[eye movement in language reading|language reading]], [[eye movement in music reading|music reading]], human [[activity recognition]], the perception of advertising, and the playing of sports.

===Commercial applications===
In recent years, the increased sophistication and accessibility of eye-tracking technologies have generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. Applications include [[web usability]], advertising, sponsorship, package design and automotive engineering. In general, commercial eye-tracking studies function by presenting a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include websites; television programs; sporting events; films and commercials; magazines and newspapers; packages; shelf displays; consumer systems (ATMs, checkout systems, kiosks); and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations, [[saccades]], pupil dilation, blinks and a variety of other behaviors, researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or product. While some companies complete this type of research internally, there are many private companies that offer eye-tracking services and analysis.

One of the most prominent fields of commercial eye-tracking research is web usability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns, eye-tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks and how much time a user spends between clicks, thereby providing valuable insight into which features are the most eye-catching, which features cause confusion and which are ignored altogether. Specifically, eye-tracking can be used to assess search efficiency, branding, online advertisements, navigation usability, overall design and many other site components. Analyses may target a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main client site.

Eye-tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials, print ads, online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with current eye-tracking technology. For instance in newspapers, eye-tracking studies can be used to find out in what way advertisements should be mixed with the news in order to catch the reader’s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktracker.com/blog/eye-tracking-case-study/eye-tracking-study-the-new-york-times-vs-the-wall-street-journal|title=LookTracker - Eye Tracking Services|website=www.looktracker.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses focus on visibility of a target product or logo in the context of a magazine, newspaper, website, or televised event. One example is an analysis of eye movements over advertisements in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. The study focused on what particular features caused people to notice an ad, whether they viewed ads in a particular order and how viewing times varied. The study revealed that ad size, graphics, color, and copy all influence attention to advertisements. Knowing this allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target logo, product or ad. As a result, an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohse |first=Gerald |last2=Wu |first2=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9524">'''Frst-order hold''' ('''FOH''') is a mathematical model of the practical reconstruction of sampled signals that could be done by a conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) and an [[analog circuit]] called an [[integrator]].  For FOH, the signal is reconstructed as a [[Piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]] approximation to the original signal that was sampled.  A mathematical model such as FOH (or, more commonly, the [[zero-order hold]]) is necessary because, in the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling and reconstruction theorem]], a sequence of [[Dirac delta function|Dirac impulses]], ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), representing the discrete samples, ''x''(''nT''), is [[low-pass filter]]ed to recover the original signal that was sampled, ''x''(''t'').  However, outputting a sequence of Dirac impulses is impractical. Devices can be implemented, using a conventional DAC and some linear analog circuitry, to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either predictive or delayed FOH.

Even though this is ''not'' what is physically done, an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of Dirac impulses, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), to a [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant system]], otherwise known as a [[electronic filter|linear filter]] with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the [[impulse response]]) so that each input impulse results in the correct piecewise linear function in the output.

==Basic first-order hold==
[[Image:Sampled.signal.svg|thumb|Ideally sampled signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

First-order hold is the hypothetical [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] or [[LTI system]] that converts the ideally sampled signal

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x_s(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= x(t) \ T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

[[Image:Firstorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Piecewise linear signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

to the piecewise linear signal

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Firstorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Impulse response (non-causal) of first-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] of

: &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,=  \frac{1}{T} \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t}{T} \right)
 = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{|t|}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } |t| &lt; T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tri}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[triangular function]].

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(f)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \frac{e^{i \pi fT} - e^{-i \pi fT}}{i 2 \pi fT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathrm{sinc}^2(fT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the normalized [[sinc function]].

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of FOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \frac{e^{sT/2} - e^{-sT/2}}{sT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

This is an [[acausal system]] in that the linear interpolation function moves toward the value of the next sample before such sample is applied to the hypothetical FOH filter.

==Delayed first-order hold==
[[Image:Delayedfirstorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Delayed piecewise linear signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

'''Delayed first-order hold''', sometimes called '''causal first-order hold''', is identical to FOH above except that its output is delayed by one [[sampling frequency|sample period]] resulting in a delayed piecewise linear output signal

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t - T - nT}{T} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Delayedfirstorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Impulse response of causal first-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] of

: &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,=  \frac{1}{T} \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t-T}{T} \right)
 = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{|t-T|}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } |t-T| &lt; T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tri}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[triangular function]].

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(f)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \frac{1 - e^{-i 2\pi fT}}{i 2 \pi fT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= e^{-i 2 \pi fT} \mathrm{sinc}^2(fT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sinc function]].

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of the delayed FOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  \left( \frac{1 - e^{-sT}}{sT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The delayed output makes this a [[causal system]].  The impulse response of the delayed FOH does not respond before the input impulse.

This kind of delayed piecewise linear reconstruction is physically realizable by implementing a [[digital filter]] of gain ''H''(''z'') = 1 − ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, applying the output of that digital filter (which is simply ''x''[''n'']−''x''[''n''−1]) to an ideal conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (that has an inherent [[zero-order hold]] as its model) and integrating (in continuous-time, ''H''(''s'') = 1/(''sT'')) the DAC output.

==Predictive first-order hold==
[[Image:Predictivefirstorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Predictive FOH output signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

Lastly, the '''predictive first-order hold''' is quite different.  This is a ''causal'' hypothetical LTI system or filter that converts the ideally sampled signal

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x_s(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= x(t) \ T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

into a piecewise linear output such that the current sample and immediately previous sample are used to linearly [[extrapolate]] up to the next sampling instance.  The output of such a filter would be 

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \left( x(nT) + \left( x(nT) - x((n-1)T) \right) \frac{t-nT}{T} \right) \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \left( \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - \frac{3}{2} \right) + \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - 1 \right) \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

[[Image:Predictivefirstorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Impulse response of predictive first-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] of

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=  \frac{1}{T}  \left( \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t}{T} - \frac{3}{2} \right) + \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t}{T} -1 \right) \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 + \frac{t}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \le t &lt; T  \\
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{t}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } T \le t &lt; 2T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rect}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rectangular function]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tri}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[triangular function]].

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(f)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= (1 + i 2\pi fT) \left( \frac{1 - e^{-i 2\pi fT}}{i 2\pi fT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= (1 + i 2\pi fT) e^{-i 2\pi fT} \mathrm{sinc}^2(fT)) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sinc function]].

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of the predictive FOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  (1 + sT) \left( \frac{1 - e^{-sT}}{sT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

This a [[causal system]].  The impulse response of the predictive FOH does not respond before the input impulse.

This kind of piecewise linear reconstruction is physically realizable by implementing a [[digital filter]] of gain ''H''(''z'') = 1 − ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, applying the output of that digital filter (which is simply ''x''[''n'']−''x''[''n''−1]) to an ideal conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (that has an inherent [[zero-order hold]] as its model) and applying that DAC output to an analog filter with transfer function ''H''(''s'') = (1+''sT'')/(''sT'').

A '''flexion teardrop fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|fracture]] of the anteroinferior aspect of a [[cervical vertebra]]l body due to flexion of the spine along with vertical axial compression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/824380-overview eMedicine &gt; Fracture, Cervical Spine] By Moira Davenport. Updated: Apr 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The fracture continues sagittally through the vertebral body, and is associated with deformity of the body and subluxation or dislocation of the [[facet joints]] at the injured level.&lt;ref&gt;https://radiopaedia.org/articles/flexion-tear-drop-fracture; retrieved 05-23-2018&lt;/ref&gt; A flexion teardrop fracture is usually associated with a [[spinal cord injury]], often a result of displacement of the posterior portion of the vertebral body into the [[spinal canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brant W, Helms C | title = Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology | journal = | volume = | issue = Third Edition | pages = 1110 | year = | pmid = | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexion teardrop fracture should not be confused with a similar-looking vertebral fracture called "extension teardrop fracture". Both usually occur in the cervical spine, but as their names suggest, they result from different mechanisms (flexion-compression vs. hyperextension). Both are associated with a small fragment being broken apart from the anteroinferior corner of the affected vertebra. Flexion teardrop fractures usually involve instability in all elements of the spine at the injured level, commonly occur at the C4-C7 vertebra, and have a high association with spinal cord injury (in particular [[anterior cord syndrome]]). In comparison, the extension-type fracture occurs more commonly at C2 or C3, causes less if any disruption to the middle and posterior elements, and does not usually result in spinal cord injury (however it may co-occur with more dangerous spine injuries). &lt;ref&gt;https://radiopaedia.org/articles/flexion-tear-drop-fracture; retrieved 05-23-2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://radiopaedia.org/articles/extension-tear-drop-fracture-1; retrieved 05-23-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goop''' (often stylized as '''goop''') is a company owned by actress [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. It was launched as a "[[lifestyle brand]]" by Paltrow in September 2008, beginning as a weekly e-mail newsletter providing [[new age]] advice, such as "police your thoughts" and "eliminate white foods", and the slogan "Nourish the Inner Aspect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/fashion/22gwyneth.html|title=Martha, Oprah ...

Goop has faced criticism for promoting and selling products and treatments that have no scientific basis, lack [[efficacy]], and are recognized by the medical establishment as harmful or as misleading. In 2017, consumer advocacy group [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|Truth in Advertising]] filed a complaint with the government regulatory agency regarding over 50 health claims made by Goop as  dangerous and false.&lt;ref name="TINA"&gt;{{cite web|title=TINA.org Takes Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop-y Health Claims to Regulators {{!}} Truth In Advertising|url=https://www.truthinadvertising.org/tina-takes-goop-claims-to-regulators/|website=Truth In Advertising|accessdate=24 August 2017|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And I wanted it to be a word that means nothing and could mean anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOOP: It's a portal into Gwyneth Paltrow's life|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2009-01-06-paltrow-goop_N.htm|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seb Bishop]] served as CEO of Goop from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pagesix.com/2014/04/16/gwyneths-goop-ceo-quits-in-corporate-uncoupling/?_ga=1.63963820.2064880802.1392929408|title=Goop CEO quits after Paltrow’s ‘uncoupling’|last1=Smith|first1=Emily|date=17 April 2014|work=[[Page Six]]|accessdate=11 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other celebrities were inspired by Goop to launch their own lifestyle websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stein|first1=Joshua David|title=Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Inspires Famous Imitators|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/fashion/Gwyneth-Paltrows-Goop-inspires-other-celebrity-websites.html|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Goop hired [[Oxygen Media]] founder and former CEO of [[Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia]] Lisa Gersh as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/06/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-ceo-gersh/|title=Gwyneth Paltrow hires ex-Martha Stewart chief as Goop CEO|last=Sellers|first=Patricia|date=October 5, 2014|work=Fortune|access-date=July 7, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2014 onwards, Goop's [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] content became increasingly radical: to the point where doctors would begin to call it pseudoscience and media outlets would describe Goop's content as "no longer ludicrous — no, now it was dangerous".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html|title=How Goop’s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow’s Company Worth $250 Million|last=Brodesser-Akner|first=Taffy|date=25 July 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=26 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Paltrow stated that she wanted goop to "be its own stand-alone brand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gwyneth Paltrow: I Questioned Being Hired as a Face |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-03-06/gwyneth-paltrow-i-questioned-being-hired-as-a-face |website=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2015, around two dozen people worked for Goop.&lt;ref name="Racked" /&gt;

The company had approximately 60 employees in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the same year, Goop's most searched topic was "[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detox]]".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Later in 2016, Paltrow moved the company's operations to Los Angeles from the UK following her separation from Chris Martin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3048346/gwyneth-paltrow-goes-to-market|title=Gwyneth Paltrow Goes To Market|date=3 August 2015|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gersh left the position of CEO. The position remained vacant until early 2017, when the board named Paltrow - who had previously announced in 2016 that she would be stepping away from Goop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/29/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-separation-news|title=Gwyneth Paltrow plans separation from Goop|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|date=July 29, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=July 7, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - to fill the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/03/23/gwyneth-paltrow-ceo-goop/|title=Gwyneth Paltrow Says She’s Now CEO of Her Lifestyle Brand Goop|last=Zillman|first=Claire|date=March 23, 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=July 7, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, Goop had 90 employees, and was attracting criticism, including a lawsuit filed by Truth In Advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.girlboss.com/girlboss/gwyneth-paltrow-interview-girlboss-radio|title=Gwyneth Paltrow Speaks Out About All That Goop Controversy|work=Girlboss Media: Redefining success for ourselves.|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2017 [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] article, Stassa Edwards criticized Goop's marketing and retail strategy, claiming that the company profits "from endless illness."&lt;ref name="JezebelWWtW" /&gt;  [[Jill Avery]], a brand analyst, has noted how Goop's response to criticism seems designed to "strengthen their brand and draw their customers closer",&lt;ref name="Vox" /&gt; noting Goop's use of [[feminism]], [[traditional Asian medicine]]s and [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophies]], and [[anti-establishment]] politics to do so.&lt;ref name="Vox" /&gt;  Paltrow characterizes criticisms as "cultural firestorms" which cause an influx of website traffic, stating that she can "monetize those eyeballs".&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

In 2018, Goop began assembling an internal science and regulatory team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goop.com/the-science-regulatory-wellness-portal/ |title=The Science &amp; Regulatory Wellness Portal |last= |first= |date= |website=Goop |access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goop in partnership with Google also began selling Google Home [[smart speaker]]s and accessories in the Goop Lab stores and holiday pop-up shops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/17/17990894/goop-google-holiday-pop-up-partnership|title=Why Google wants to sell its gadgets in Goop stores|work=Vox|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/products/hardware/new-ways-experience-made-google-products/|title=New ways to experience Made by Google products|date=2018-10-09|work=Google|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened its first permanent East Coast Goop store called Goop Lab located at 25 [[Bond Street]] in New York. This follows the permanent location they opened in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]], California in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-opens-chic-store-new-york-city-1197092|title=Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop opens insanely chic permanent store in New York City|date=2018-11-01|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goop launched an online shop in 2012, and it earned $1.5 million for Goop during its first year of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Gwyneth Paltrow’s GOOP $1.6M In Debt?|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-16m-debt-1718036|work=International Business Times|date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, the Goop newsletter had an estimated 700,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=BOFContextualCommerce&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/gwyneth-paltrows-contextual-commerce-play|title=Gwyneth Paltrow’s Contextual Commerce Play|date=29 May 2015|work=[[The Business of Fashion]]|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Goop entered the vitamin and supplements market. Paltrow first had the idea to market [[Dietary supplement|supplements]] after receiving a [[Myers' cocktail]] from Alejandro Junger in 2007.&lt;ref name="newyorkervitamins"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-expands-into-vitamins|title=Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Expands Into Vitamins|last=Marikar|first=Sheila|date=March 27, 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=July 7, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supplements range sold over $100,000 worth of product on the launch day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In April, Goop announced that they had entered into an agreement with [[Condé Nast]] to launch a new print magazine under the name Goop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/fashion/goop-conde-nast-magazine.html|title=Goop and Condé Nast Team Up on a Magazine|last=Safronova|first=Valeriya|date=April 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 21, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quarterly magazine was launched in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/goop-magazine-gwyneth-paltrow-cover|title=Goop’s First Magazine Cover Star Is . . .

Goop generates revenue from advertising and also sells a Goop-branded clothing line, a perfume, and books.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  As of 2017 Goop readers have an average household income of $100k+ per year.&lt;ref name="adweek.com" /&gt;

Goop launched a [[podcast]] in March 2018 using Cadence13 as its digital platform.

Goop expanded its fashion offerings in 2018, hiring Danielle Pergament of [[Allure (magazine)|Allure]] to be Goop's editor in chief, directly under CCO Elise Loehnen. Ali Pew of [[InStyle]] was hired as Goop's fashion director and Anne Keane, formerly of [[Lucky magazine]] is now Goop's fashion strategy director, and they will be attending New York Fashion Week as representatives of the company.&lt;ref name="The Business of Fashion"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/goop-hires-editor-in-chief-from-allure|title=Goop Hires Editor-in-Chief from Allure|date=21 February 2018|work=The Business of Fashion|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2018, Goop launched a capsule collection with fashion designer [[Lilly Pulitzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-x-lilly-pulitzer-dresses-blouses-bag/gwyneth-stretch-shift-dress/|title=Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop x Lilly Pulitzer Dresses, Blouses, Bag|date=2018-06-29|work=Us Weekly|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
In December 2016 a book parodying Goop called ''Glop: Nontoxic Ideas That Will Make You Look Ridiculous and Feel Pretentious'' was published and included advice like, "Our modern lifestyles are absolutely full of toxins — nearly everything we come into daily contact with, from Egyptian cotton sheets to 8-carat diamonds to yacht paint, is dangerously noxious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jaleesa M. |title=10 commandments from Goop parody book, 'Glop' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/12/27/glop-goop-parody-book/95861040/ |work=USA TODAY |date=December 27, 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reed |first1=Sam |title=This Goop Parody Is Scary Similar to the Real Thing |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/goop-parody-is-scary-similar-real-thing-944762 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 7, 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2017 the ''New York Times'' reported that parodying Goop had "become a national pastime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Alexandra |title=Meet the Goopies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/fashion/gwyneth-paltrow-in-goop-health-wellness.html |work=New York Times |date=June 14, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paltrow appeared on The Late Show in 2018 in a spoof segment announcing a collaboration between Goop and Stephen Colbert's lifestyle brand, Covetton House, featuring a sponge which cost $900.  Later that year, Colbert and Paltrow collaborated on a line of goods to raise money for education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gwyneth Paltrow and Stephen Colbert Are Selling Goop-Like Products to Raise Money for Public Schools |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/gwyneth-paltrow-stephen-colbert-are-selling-goop-like-products-raise-money-public-schools-1104064 |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=19 April 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference to NASA was subsequently removed from the advertisement, with the manufacturer of the stickers issuing a statement to [[Gizmodo]] saying "We apologize to NASA, Goop, our customers and our fans for this communication error.

===Disclaimers===
Despite routinely posting articles which purport to give health and nutrition advice on a wide range of topics, these articles typically end with this disclaimer:
{{Quote|text="The views expressed in this article intend to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation. They are the views of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Goop, and are for informational purposes only, even if and to the extent that this article features the advice of physicians and medical practitioners.

In early 2018 Goop started labeling articles with disclaimers indicating whether their content is "For Your Enjoyment" or "Supported by Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goop Slammed for New Answer to "Deceptive" Advertising Claims |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/goop-slammed-new-answer-deceptive-advertising-claims-1124826 |work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=23 July 2018 |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on June 29, 2018 the watchdog group Truth in Advertising sent a letter to the California Food Drug and Medical Device Task Force, saying that

{{Quote|text=[The disclaimers] make clear that the company is aware that it does not have the appropriate scientific evidence to support many of the health claims that it is making in its marketing materials. Further, as a matter of law, these four disclosures cannot be used as cover for unsubstantiated disease-treatment claims. That is to say, Goop is not permitted to make a deceptive health claim and then post a disclaimer saying, 'sorry, there isn’t reliable and competent scientific evidence to actually support that claim but buy our product to treat your [fill in the ailment] anyway.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amid Goop's Mixed Signals, TINA.org Repeats Call for Regulatory Action |url=https://www.truthinadvertising.org/amid-goops-mixed-signals-tina-org-repeats-call-for-regulatory-action/ |website=Truth in Advertising|accessdate=23 July 2018 |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On September 4, 2018, [[Bloomberg News]] reported that: "Goop Inc., the lifestyle company founded by Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow, agreed to pay $145,000 to settle allegations it made unscientific claims about the benefits of three products."

The '''Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey''', or '''GOODS''', is an [[astronomical survey]] combining deep observations from three of [[NASA]]'s [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]: the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], and the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], along with data from other [[Space observatory|space-based telescopes]], such as [[XMM Newton]], and some of the world's most powerful ground-based telescopes.

GOODS is intended to enable astronomers to study the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]] in the distant, early universe.

[[File:Galaxy history revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope (GOODS-ERS2).jpg|thumb|center|600px|GOODS Field (Hubble component)]]

The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey consists of optical and near-infrared imaging taken with the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Very Large Telescope]] and the 4-m telescope at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]; [[infrared]] data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].  These are added to pre-existing x-ray data from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[ESA]]s [[XMM-Newton]], two fields of 10' by 16'; one centered on the [[Hubble Deep Field]] North (12h 36m 55s, +62° 14m 15s) and the other on the [[Chandra Deep Field South]] (3h 32m 30s, -27° 48m 20s).  

The two GOODS fields are the most data-rich areas of the sky in terms of depth and wavelength coverage.

==Instruments==
[[File:GOODS-South field.jpg|thumb|Composite image of the GOODS-South field, result of a deep survey using two of the four giant 8.2-metre telescopes composing [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]]]]

GOODS consists of data from the following space-based observatories:
*The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (optical imaging with the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]])
*The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] ([[infrared]] imaging)
*The [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] ([[X-ray]])
*[[XMM-Newton]] (an X-ray telescope belonging to the [[European Space Agency]])
*The [[Herschel Space Observatory]] (an infrared telescope belonging to the ESA)

==Hubble Space Telescope images==
GOODs used the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] with four filters, centered at 435, 606, 775 and 850&amp;nbsp;nm. The resulting map covers 30 times the area of the [[Hubble Deep Field]] to a photometric magnitude less sensitivity, and has enough resolution to allow the study of 1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|kpc]]-scale objects at redshifts up to 6. It also provides photometric redshifts for over 60,000 galaxies within the field, providing an excellent sample for studying bright galaxies at high redshifts.&lt;ref name="Beckwith2006"&gt;{{cite journal

==Herschel==
In May 2010, scientists announced that the [[infrared]] data from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] was joining the GOODS dataset, after initial analysis of data using Herschel's [[Herschel Space Observatory#Instrumentation|PACS and SPIRE]] instruments. In October 2009, Herschel observed the GOODS-North field, and in January 2010 the GOODS-South field. In so doing, Herschel identified sources for the [[Cosmic infrared background|Cosmic Infrared Background]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Herschel_Reveals_Galaxies_In_The_Goods_Fields_In_A_Brand_New_Light_999.html Herschel Reveals Galaxies In The GOODS Fields In A Brand New Light], spacedaily.com, 12 May 2009, accessed 13 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

In [[probability theory]] and  [[statistics]], a [[sequence]] or collection of [[random variable]]s is '''independent and identically distributed''' (''i.i.d.'' or ''iid'' or '''IID''') if each random variable has the same [[probability distribution]] as the others and all are mutually [[independence (probability theory)|independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/7000/csci7000-001_2011_L0.pdf | title = A brief primer on probability distributions | author = Aaron Clauset | publisher = [[Santa Fe Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Identically distributed, on its own, is often abbreviated '''ID'''. For uniformity, as both are discussed—and in widespread use—this article uses the visually cleaner IID in preference to the more prevalent convention ''i.i.d.''

The annotation IID is particularly common in [[statistics]], where observations in a [[statistical sample|sample]] are often assumed to be effectively IID for the purposes of [[statistical inference]].  The assumption (or requirement) that observations be IID tends to simplify the underlying mathematics of many statistical methods (see [[mathematical statistics]] and [[statistical theory]]).  However, in practical applications of [[statistical modeling]] the assumption may or may not be realistic. To test how realistic the assumption is on a given data set, the [[autocorrelation]] can be computed, [[lag plot]]s drawn or [[turning point test]] performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Performance Evaluation Of Computer And Communication Systems | first = Jean-Yves | last = Le Boudec | isbn = 978-2-940222-40-7 | year=2010 | publisher =[[EPFL Press]]| url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/146812/files/perfPublisherVersion.pdf |pages=46-47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The generalization of [[exchangeable random variables]] is often sufficient and more easily met.

The assumption is important in the classical form of the [[central limit theorem]], which states that the probability distribution of the sum (or average) of IID variables with finite [[variance]] approaches a [[normal distribution]].

Often the IID assumption arises in the context of sequences of random variables. Then "independent and identically distributed" in part implies that an element in the sequence is independent of the random variables that came before it.  In this way, an IID sequence is different from a [[Markov sequence]], where the probability distribution for the ''n''th random variable is a function of the previous random variable  in the sequence (for a first order Markov sequence).  An IID sequence does not imply the probabilities for all elements of the [[sample space]] or event space must be the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cover|first=Thomas|title=Elements Of Information Theory|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-24195-9|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, repeated throws of loaded dice will produce a sequence that is IID, despite the outcomes being biased.

==Definition==

Let the random variables be defined to assume values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I} \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

We say two random variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are '''identically distributed''' ''[[iff|iff]]'' &lt;math&gt;P[x \geq X]=P[x \geq Y], \, \forall x \in \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

We say two random variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are '''independent''' ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;P[y \geq Y]=P[y \geq Y | x \geq X] \land P[x \geq X]=P[x \geq X | y \geq Y] \, \forall x,y \in \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;. See {{slink|Independence (probability theory)#Two random variables}}.

==Examples==
===Uses in modeling===
The following are examples or applications of IID random variables:
* A sequence of outcomes of spins of a fair or unfair [[roulette]] wheel is IID.  One implication of this is that if the roulette ball lands on "red", for example, 20 times in a row, the next spin is no more or less likely to be "black" than on any other spin (see the [[Gambler's fallacy]]).
* A sequence of fair or loaded dice rolls is IID
* A sequence of fair or unfair coin flips is IID
* In [[signal processing]] and [[image processing]] the notion of transformation to IID implies two specifications, the "ID" (ID&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;identically distributed) part and the "I" (I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;independent) part:
** (ID) the signal level must be balanced on the time axis;
** (I) the signal spectrum must be flattened, i.e. transformed by filtering (such as [[deconvolution]]) to a [[white noise|white]] signal (one where all frequencies are equally present).

===Uses in inference===
* One of the simplest statistical tests, the [[Z-test|''z''-test]], is used to test [[null hypothesis|hypotheses]] about [[mean]]s of random variables.  When using the ''z''-test, one assumes (requires) that all observations are IID in order to satisfy the conditions of the [[central limit theorem]].

==Generalizations==
Many results that were first proven under the assumption that the random variables are IID have been shown to be true even under a weaker distributional assumption.

===Exchangeable random variables===
{{Main|Exchangeable random variables}}
The most general notion which shares the main properties of IID variables are [[exchangeable random variables]], introduced by [[Bruno de Finetti]].{{fact|date=February 2016}} Exchangeability means that while variables may not be independent, future ones behave like past ones&amp;nbsp;– formally, any value of a finite sequence is as likely as any [[permutation]] of those values&amp;nbsp;– the [[joint probability distribution]] is invariant under the [[symmetric group]].

This provides a useful generalization&amp;nbsp;– for example, [[sampling without replacement]] is not independent, but is exchangeable&amp;nbsp;– and is widely used in [[Bayesian statistics]].

===Lévy process===
{{Main|Lévy process}}
In [[stochastic calculus]], IID variables are thought of as a [[discrete time]] [[Lévy process]]: each variable gives how much one changes from one time to another.
For example, a sequence of Bernoulli trials is interpreted as the [[Bernoulli process]].
One may generalize this to include continuous time Lévy processes, and many Lévy processes can be seen as limits of IID variables—for instance, the [[Wiener process]] is the limit of the Bernoulli process.

==White noise==

[[White noise]] is a simple example of IID.

The '''Leo Supercluster''' is a [[supercluster]] in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere that stretches across the constellations [[Ursa Major]] and [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]. It covers an area approximately 130 mega[[parsec]]s long by 60 megaparsecs wide. The [[redshift]]s of member [[galaxy cluster]]s range from 0.032 to 0.043. The brightest cluster in the system is [[Abell 1185]].&lt;ref name="Kopylova"/&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Apodiformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Apodiformes have had their numbers quantified.

Many '''[[copper]] [[Mining|mines]]''' have existed in the [[Copper Country]] of the [[United States|U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. These include both large-scale commercial ventures and small operations. There are hundreds of ancient mining pits in and around the Copper Country area, especially on [[Isle Royale]] (several of these were developed). Numerous small modern diggings exist around the area as well, including some around [[Fort Wilkins State Park|Fort Wilkins]] and the [[Copper Harbor Light]].

This historical flag made of carving a picture of running lion with a small sword in its forepaw is considered to be the Ruhuna flag.

Furthermore, King Dutugamunu left Magam Kingdom with the lion flag ahead for the battle to unite the country.  The flag is of a picture of a yellow lion on a red blood colour background.  Accordingly, it was decided to use for the Southern Provincial flag the picture of the lion running with a small sword (iluk koolaya) in its fore paw of the Ruhuna flag and the red colour and yellow colour of the flag taken in the war front by King Dutugamunu.

It was decided to use the same for the Southern Province flag mixture of colours and the standard to represent all communities in Galle, Matara, and Hambantota and four bo leaves (Metta, Karuna, Muditha, Upeksha) of the national flag.

It was agreed that the forms of the sun and moon of the flag of Southern Province flag should be in the same forms of the sun and moon of the flag of Devinuwara Devalaya and that the same form of that of the flag of Hambantota District.  Accordingly, it was expected to keep the integration of Galle, matara and Hambantota.  Therefore, Southern Province flag can be considered as a combination of several traditional flags.

The small sword (iluk Koolaya) is the symbol of control, but it doesn't reflect terror or suppression.  Small sword represents Justice and fair.  Running lion represents velocity fearlessness and pride.

The sun and moon stands for stability prosperity and augustness.  It expresses the traditional saying "Until the sun and moon exists". The sun and moon of the flag is considered to be symbols of victory. The combination of colours round the flag depict the existence of Southern Sri Lanka, victorious war history, religion and patriotism, mutual co-operation and harmony

|{{ListFlag|Flag of the Uva Province (Sri Lanka) SVG.svg}} || November 14, 1987 - || [[Flag of Uva Province]]||In the days of the Sinhala kings, Sri Lanka had been divided into twelve provinces and ruled and each of these twelve provinces had been allotted a flag. Accordingly, in order to bring about qualities such as pleasantness, innocence, greatness and royalty, a flag with a picture of swan had been allotted to the Uva Province.

The flag that was gifted to Uva Province by the King Sri  Wickrama Rajasinghe who ruled the kingdom of Kandy during the period 1798-1815 can be seen even today at the National Museum ( Courtesy:  Book entitled “Uva Ithihasaya” by Panditha Naulle Dhammananda Thero )

[[File:Trimethyl steroid-nomenclature.svg|thumb|right|225px|[[Steroid]] ring system.]]

This is a list of [[androgen]]s/[[anabolic steroid]]s (AAS) or [[testosterone]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s. [[Ester]]s are mostly not included in this list; for esters, see [[List of androgen esters|here]] instead. The major classes of testosterone derivatives include the following (as well as combinations thereof):

* Testosterone derivatives: immediate derivatives of testosterone not falling into the groups below
* 4,5α-Reduced/dihydrogenated testosterone derivatives: [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) derivatives
* 19-Demethylated testosterone derivatives: [[19-nortestosterone]] (nandrolone) derivatives
* [[17α-Alkylated AAS|17α-Alkylated]] testosterone derivatives: [[methyltestosterone]] and [[ethyltestosterone]] derivatives
* 17α-Ethenylated/ethynylated testosterone derivatives: [[ethynyltestosterone]] (ethisterone) and [[vinyltestosterone]] derivatives

The last group consists of [[progestin]]s with mostly only very weak androgenic/anabolic activity.

AAS that are listed as marketed may be marketed as one or more esters rather than as the listed AAS itself.

This list specifically pertains to ''[[steroid]]al'' androgens; ''[[nonsteroidal]]'' androgens like the [[selective androgen receptor modulator]]s (SARMs) [[andarine]] and [[enobosarm]] (ostarine) are not included here.

[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Berlin specimen).jpg|thumb|right|Possibly the best known of all transitional fossils, the Berlin specimen of ''[[Archaeopteryx lithographica]]'']]

This is a tentative partial list of [[transitional fossils]] (fossil remains of groups that exhibits both "primitive" and derived traits). The fossils are listed in series, showing the transition from one group to another, representing significant steps in the evolution of major features in various lineages. These changes often represent major changes in morphology and anatomy, related to mode of life, like the acquisition of feathered wings for an aerial lifestyle in [[birds]], or limbs in the [[fish]]/[[tetrapod]] transition onto land.

Almost all of the transitional forms in this list do not actually represent ancestors of any living group or other transitional forms. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] noted that transitional forms could be considered [[common ancestor]]s, direct ancestors or collateral ancestors of living or extinct groups, but believed that finding actual common or direct ancestors linking different groups was unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, RC (1975) Charles Darwin's Natural Selection; being the second part of his big species book written from 1856 to 1858. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. 1859. ''On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. London: John Murray. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Collateral ancestors are relatives like cousins in genealogies in which they are not in your direct line of descent but do share a common ancestor (in this case it is a grandparent). This kind of thinking can be extended to groups of life. For instance, the well-known ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is a transitional form between non-avian dinosaurs and birds, but it is not the most recent common ancestor of all birds nor is it a direct ancestor of any species of bird alive today. Rather, it is considered an extinct close evolutionary "cousin" to the direct ancestors. This may not always be the case, though, as some fossil species are proposed to be directly ancestral to others, like how ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'' is most likely to be ancestral to ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delezene | first1 = LK | last2 = Kimbel | first2 = WH | year = 2011 | title = Evolution of the mandibular third premolar crown in early Australopithecus | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.01.006 | pmid = 21481921 | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 711–730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|A woodland hominid adapted to quadruped arboreal locomotion, but also for bipedalism.
|Intermediate between the last common ancestor of chimps and humans, and the [[Australopithecus|australopithecines]].
|'''Primitive traits'''
* Brains smaller than later hominids ranging from about 300-350&amp;nbsp;cc
* Foot thumb is not retracted into the foot as a [[hallux|'big toe']]
* Phalanges are more heavily curved than in ''[[Australopithecus]]''
'''Derived traits'''
* Reduced size in canines, however still retained dimorphic characters
* Hind leg dominant, bipedal locomotion while walking, however were quadrupedal while climbing trees
|[[File:Ardi.jpg|150px]]
|-
|4.4–2.0 Ma
|
'''Genus:'''
* ''[[Australopithecus]]''
|First known genus of fully bipedal apes which are probably ancestral to [[Paranthropus|robust australopiths]] and the genus ''[[Homo]]''.
|Intermediate between extinct quadrupedal and bipedal apes. While the relationship between some species are being revised, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' is considered to be, by most experts, the ancestor to all later hominids.
|'''Primitive traits'''
* Some species retain a [[sagittal crest]]
* Curved phalanges, indicating semi-arboreal lifestyle
* Semisectorial premolar is present
* Prognathic face to varying degrees
'''Derived traits'''
* Fully bipedal as indicated by many features including the knee joint, hips, lumbar curve in the spine, position of the [[foramen magnum]], and feet
* Increase in brain size ranging from about 375-500&amp;nbsp;cc
* Development of a parabolic jaw

|-
|2.3–1.4 Ma
|
'''Species:'''
* ''[[Homo habilis]]''
|An early human which is the morphological link between [[australopithecine]]s and later human species.
|Perfect intermediate between early hominids and later humans, possibly ancestral to modern humans.
|'''Primitive traits'''
* Pronounced brow ridge
* Foramen magnum is not positioned as anteriorly like in modern humans, giving a slightly semi-erect appearance
* Although reduced in size the teeth are still fairly large
'''Derived traits'''
* Increase brain size ranging from 510-800&amp;nbsp;cc
* Face is slightly prognathic, but at a much steeper angle
* Bulge in the Broca area, possibly the first hominid to use rudimentary speech
* Associated with the first use of stone tools
| [[File:Homo habilis.jpg|150px]]
|-
|2.0–1.0 Ma
|
'''Species:'''
* ''[[Homo erectus]]''
|Very successful hominid, which was probably ancestral to both modern [[humans]] and [[neanderthals]]. Probably the first hominid to leave and successfully colonize territories outside of Africa.
|Ancestral to modern humans and neanderthals.
|'''Primitive traits'''
* Still retains a heavy brow ridge and [[nuchal torus]]
* Lacked the complexity of modern human language, but does show increase in the Broca area
* Thicker bones and larger teeth than modern humans
'''Derived traits'''
* Rounder and larger brain (about 900–1,100&amp;nbsp;cc) than ''H. habilis''
* Face is orthognathic compared to ''H. habilis''
* Probably lived in [[band societies|bands]] and was an active group hunter
* Associated with advanced stone tools and possibly the first hominid to use and produce fire
| [[File:Homo erectus tautavelensis.jpg|150px]]
|-
|500 Ka–recent
|
'''Species'''
* ''[[Archaic humans|Homo rhodesiensis]]''
|''Homo rhodesiensis'' was the immediate ancestor of modern humans which evidently displaced the [[neanderthal]]s in Europe and the island [[Homo floresiensis|'hobbits']] of southeast Asia. ''H. rhodesiensis'' evolved from ''[[Homo erectus]]'' about half a million years ago but still retains some primitive characteristics such as relatively thick bones and molars larger than modern humans.
|Ancestral to modern humans.
|'''Primitive traits'''
* Large teeth
* Heavy brow ridge
* Extremely robust build in most groups
'''Derived traits'''
* Rounder, less broad based cranium
* Larger brain size, approaching (and sometimes exceeding) modern values

'''Matteo Botti''' (ca. 1570&amp;ndash;1621) was an Italian scientific instrument maker.

Botti came from a Cremonese family on which [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] (1519&amp;ndash;1574) conferred Florentine citizenship. He was a member of the [[Accademia degli Alterati]] and the [[Accademia Fiorentina]]. He undertook various missions abroad as an ambassador for [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand I]] (1549&amp;ndash;1609) and [[Cosimo II]] (1590&amp;ndash;1621). In 1591, he was made a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Stephen]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo S. Olschki, Vieusseux, Gian Pietro. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gGFIAAAAYAAJ Archivio storico italiano]. Vol. 9.

==History ==

MEST was announced in 2007, when [[Meltwater Group|Meltwater]] announced plans to establish an entrepreneurial training program in Africa. The school opened in February 2008 with the first class of Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconafrica.com/meltwater-incubator-a-year-in-review/|title=A Year in Review at Meltwater Incubator in Accra - Ghana|publisher=Silicon Africa|first=Monica|last=Jamaluddin|date=23 January 2013|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the first class of EITs graduated and the MEST [[Business incubator|Incubator]] was launched with [[seed funding]] for incubator companies started by the first group of EITs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/out-of-africa-a-whole-mest-of-startups-emerges-in-ghana/|title=Out of Africa - A Whole MEST of Startups Emerges in Ghana|publisher=TechCrunch|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=14 June 2012|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, MEST partnered with [[Vodafone Ghana]] to sponsor a 48-hour hackathon to help develop access to information, simplify transactions and shorten business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/01/mest-partners-vodafone-ghana-hackathon/|title=MEST Partners Vodafone Ghana for Hackathon|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=28 January 2015 |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/social/vodafone-mest-hackathon-app-developer-competition-finalised--101941|title=Vodafone, MEST Hackathon App Developer Competition Finalised|publisher=Ghana News Agency|date= 24 March 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the school was recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative companies of Africa by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]].&lt;ref name=fast&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041821/most-innovative-companies-2015/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-of-2015-in-africa|title=The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Africa|publisher=Fast Company|date=9 February 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST announced a partnership with [[Samsung]] in April 2015. As part of the agreement, Samsung provided subsidized devices and internship positions, as well as marketing services and mobile application distribution, in exchange for the opportunity to invest in MEST companies through its Samsung Enterprise Business Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/04/mest-partners-samsung-to-support-west-african-startups/|title=MEST Partners Samsung to Support West African Startups|publisher=Disrupt Africa|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=23 April 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST hosted the first Africa Technology Summit in November 2015 in Accra, Ghana, the event featured panels and keynote presentations from a variety of global and African businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyafrique.com/african-technology-summit-ats-2015-accra-ghana/|title=African Technology Summit (ATS) 2015, Accra Ghana|publisher=Tech Afrique|date=12 August 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varian | publisher = Harvard Business Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-87584-863-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aE_J4Iv_PVEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:shapiro+inauthor:varian#PPA184,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and attributed to [[Robert Metcalfe]] in regard to [[Ethernet]], Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of "compatible communicating devices" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Metcalfe’s Law: more misunderstood than wrong? | date = July 26, 2006 | author = Simeon Simeonov | work = HighContrast: Innovation &amp; venture capital in the post-broadband era | url = http://simeons.wordpress.com/2006/07/26/metcalfes-law-more-misunderstood-than-wrong/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only later with the [[history of the Internet|globalization of the Internet]] did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Metcalfe's Law, Web 2.0, and the Semantic Web| date =  | author = James Hendler and Jennifer Golbeck (2008) | url = http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/downloads/Web20-SW-JWS-webVersion.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is also very much related to economics and business management, especially with competitive companies looking to merge with one another.

==Network effects==
Metcalfe's law characterizes many of the [[network effect]]s of communication technologies and networks such as the [[Internet]], [[social networking]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Former Chairman of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] [[Reed Hundt]] said that this law gives the most understanding to the workings of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong |title= Metcalfe's Law is wrong | author = Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko and Benjamin Tilly | date= July  2006 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metcalfe's Law is related to the fact that the number of unique possible connections in a network of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes can be expressed mathematically as the [[triangular number]] &lt;math&gt;n(n+1)/2&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[Big O notation|asymptotically]] proportional to &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The law has often been illustrated using the example of [[fax]] machines: a single fax machine is useless, but the value of every fax machine increases with the total number of fax machines in the network, because the total number of people with whom each user may send and receive documents increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cstep.in/uploads/default/files/publications/stuff/CSTEP_The_Dark_Side_of_Metcalfe%E2%80%99s_Law_Confpaper_2009.pdf |title=The Dark Side of Metcalfe’s Law: Multiple and Growing Costs of Network Exclusion  | author = R. Tongia | date= |accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in  social networks, the greater number of users with the service, the more valuable the service becomes to the community.

==Limitations==
In addition to the difficulty of quantifying the "value" of a network, the mathematical justification for Metcalfe's law measures only the ''potential'' number of contacts, i.e., the technological side of a network. However the social utility of a network depends upon the number of nodes ''in contact''.{{fact|date=October 2017}} If there are [[language barrier]]s or other reasons why large parts of a network are not in contact with other parts then the effect may be smaller.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Metcalfe’s law assumes that the value of each node n is of equal benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Andrew Odlyzko|author2=Bob Briscoe|authorlink1=Andrew Odlyzko|title=Metcalfe's Law is Wrong|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong|website=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|accessdate=25 November 2016|date=1 Jul 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is not the case, for example because the one fax machines serves 50 workers in a company, the second fax machine serves half of that, the third one third, and so on, then the relative value of an additional connection decreases. Likewise, in social networks, if users that join later use the network less than early adopters, then the benefit of each additional user may lessen, making the overall network less efficient if costs per users are fixed.

==Modified models==
Within the context of social networks, many, including Metcalfe himself, have proposed modified models in which the value of the network grows as ''n'' &amp;times; log ''n'' rather than ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcmike.wordpress.com/2006/08/18/metcalfe-social-networks/ |title=Guest Blogger Bob Metcalfe: Metcalfe’s Law Recurses Down the Long Tail of Social Networks |date=18 August 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Briscoe, A. Odlyzko, and B. Tilly, Metcalfe’s law is wrong, ''IEEE Spectrum'' '''43''':7 (2006), pp. 34–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed and Odlyzko have sought out possible relationships to Metcalfe's Law in terms of describing the relationship of a network and one can read about how those are related. Tongia and Wilson also examine the related question of the costs to those excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/view/873/549 |title=The Flip Side of Metcalfe’s Law: Multiple and Growing Costs of Network Exclusion | author = Rahul Tongia and Ernest Wilson| date= September 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Validation with actual data ==
Despite many arguments about Metcalfe' law, no real data based evidence for or against was available for more than 30 years. Only in July 2013, Dutch researchers managed to analyze European Internet usage patterns over a long enough time and found ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; proportionality for small values of ''n'' and (''n'' &amp;times; log ''n'') proportionality for large values of ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite citation|doi=10.1016/j.infoecopol.2013.07.002|title=Empirical validation of Metcalfe’s law: How Internet usage patterns have changed over time|first1=António|last1=Madureira|first2=Frank|last2=den Hartog|first3=Harry|last3=Bouwman|author-link3=Harry Bouwman| first4=Nico|last4=Baken|journal=Information Economics and Policy|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Metcalfe himself provided further proof, as he used Facebook's data over the past 10 years to show a good fit for Metcalfe's law (the model is ''n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6636305&amp;searchWithin%3Dp_Authors%3A.QT.Metcalfe%2C+B..QT.|title = Metcalfe’s law after 40 years of Ethernet|last = Metcalfe|first = Bob|date = 2013|journal = IEEE Computer|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Zhang, Liu and Xu extend Metcalfe's results utilizing data from [[Tencent]], China's largest social network company, and Facebook. Their work showed that Metcalfe's law held for both, despite the difference in audience between the two sites; Facebook serving a worldwide audience and Tencent serving only Chinese users. The Metcalfe's functions of the two sites given in the paper were &lt;math&gt;V_{Tencent}=7.39\times10^{-9}\times n^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{Facebook}=5.70\times 10^{-9}\times n^{2}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11390-015-1518-1|title = Tencent and Facebook Data Validate Metcalfe's Law|last = Zhang|first = Xing-Zhou|date = 2015|journal = JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY|doi = 10.1007/s11390-015-1518-1|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Liu|first2 = Jing-Jie|last3 = Xu|first3 = Zhi-Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Micro-climate on rock at Sunrise-on- Sea.jpg|thumb|Microclimate on rock located in [[intertidal zone]] in [[Sunrise-on-Sea]], [[South Africa]]]]
A '''microclimate''' is a local set of [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas, often with a slight difference but sometimes with a substantial one. The term may refer to areas as small as a few square meters or square feet (for example a garden bed or a cave) or as large as many square kilometers or square miles. Because [[climate]] is [[statistics|statistical]], which implies spatial and temporal variation of the mean values of the describing [[parameter]]s, within a region there can occur and persist over time sets of statistically distinct conditions, that is, microclimates. Microclimates can be found in most places.

Microclimates exist, for example, near bodies of water which may cool the local atmosphere, or in heavy urban areas where [[brick]], [[concrete]], and [[asphalt]] absorb the sun's energy, heat up, and re-radiate that heat to the ambient air: the resulting [[urban heat island]] is a kind of microclimate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sotoga.com/en/urban-microclimate|title=6 Examples of an Urban Microclimate|publisher=Sotoga}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another contributing factor of microclimate is the slope or [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] of an area. South-facing slopes in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and north-facing slopes in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] are exposed to [[effect of Sun angle on climate|more direct sunlight]] than opposite slopes and are therefore warmer for longer periods of time, giving the slope a warmer microclimate than the areas around the slope. The lowest area of a [[glen]] may sometimes [[frost]] sooner or harder than a nearby spot uphill, because cold air sinks, a drying breeze may not reach the lowest bottom, and [[dew point|humidity lingers and precipitates]], then [[freezing|freezes]].

==Background==
[[File:TheLostGardensOfHeligan-Jungle.jpg|thumb|[[Tree fern]]s thrive in a protected [[dell (landform)|dell]] area in the [[Lost Gardens of Heligan]], in [[Cornwall]], England, latitude 50° 15'N.]]

The terminology "micro-climate" first appeared in the 1950s in publications such as ''Climates in Miniature: A Study of Micro-Climate Environment'' (Thomas Bedford Franklin, 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= |title=CLIMATES IN MINIATURE: A STUDY OF MICRO-CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT|author=Thomas Bedford Franklin|year=2013|publisher=Literary Licensing, LLC|asin=B00T3N7MTW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area in a developed industrial park may vary greatly from a wooded park nearby, as natural [[flora]] in parks absorb light and heat in leaves that a building roof or parking lot just radiates back into the air. Advocates of [[solar energy]] argue that widespread use of solar collection can mitigate overheating of urban environments by absorbing sunlight and putting it to work instead of heating the foreign surface objects.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

A microclimate can offer an opportunity as a small [[growing region]] for crops that cannot thrive in the broader area; this concept is often used in [[permaculture]] practiced in northern temperate climates. Microclimates can be used to the advantage of gardeners who carefully choose and position their plants. Cities often raise the average temperature by [[zoning]], and a sheltered position can reduce the severity of winter. [[Roof garden]]ing, however, exposes plants to more extreme temperatures in both summer and winter.

In an urban area, tall buildings create their own microclimate, both by overshadowing large areas and by channeling strong winds to ground level. [[Wind Engineering|Wind effects]] around tall buildings are assessed as part of a microclimate study. ([[Urban Microclimate]])

Microclimates can also refer to purpose-made environments, such as those in a room or other enclosure. Microclimates are commonly created and carefully maintained in museum display and storage environments. This can be done using passive methods, such as [[silica gel]], or with active microclimate control devices.

Usually, if the inland areas have a [[humid continental climate]], the coastal areas stay much milder during winter months, in contrast to the hotter summers. This is the case further north on the American west coast, such as in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], where [[Vancouver]] has an [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] wet winter with rare frosts, but inland areas that average several degrees warmer in summer have cold and snowy winters.

===Soil types===
The type of soil found in an area can also affect microclimates. For example, soils heavy in clay can act like pavement, moderating the near ground temperature. On the other hand, if soil has many air pockets, then the heat could be trapped underneath the topsoil, resulting in the increased possibility of frost at ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/weather/microcli.html|title=Gardening Resources, Cornell University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and influences on microclimate==
Two main parameters to define a microclimate within a certain area are temperature and [[humidity]]. A source of a drop in temperature and/or humidity can be attributed to different sources or influences.
Often microclimate is shaped by a conglomerate of different influences and is a subject of [[microscale meteorology]].

===Cold air pool===
The well known examples of cold air pool (CAP) effect are
Gstettneralm Sinkhole in Austria (lowest recorded temperature {{convert|-53|C|abbr=on}})
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetter-freizeit.com/mikroklima.html|title=Mikroklima - Definition - Wissenswertes|website=www.wetter-freizeit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Sinks]] in the US.
The main criterion on the wind speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in order to create a warm air flow penetration into a CAP is the following:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Fr} = \frac{v}{Nh} \geq \mathrm{Fr}_c,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Froude number]], &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; --- the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency]], &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; --- depth of the valley, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr}_c&lt;/math&gt; --- Froude number at the threshold wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Racovec et al. Turbulent dissipation of the cold-air pool in a basin: comparison of observed and simulated development. Meteorol. Atmos. Phys. 79, 195-213 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craters===
The presence of [[permafrost]] close to the surface in a [[volcanic crater|crater]] creates a unique microclimate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/reports/annual-reports/2010/uh/permafrost-in-hawaii/|title=Permafrost in Hawaii, NASA Astrobiology Institute, 2010|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217143746/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/reports/annual-reports/2010/uh/permafrost-in-hawaii/|archivedate=2014-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caves and lava tubes===
As similar as [[lava tube]]s can be to [[cave]]s which are not formed due to volcanic activity the microclimate within the former is different due to dominant presence of [[basalt]].
Lava tubes and basaltic caves are important [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] targets on Earth and [[Mars]] (see also [[Martian lava tube]]).

===Plant microclimate===
As pointed out by [[Rudolf Geiger]] in his book &lt;ref&gt;R. Geiger. The climate near the ground. Harvard University Press, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; not only climate influences the living plant but the opposite effect of the interaction of plants on their environment can also take place, and is known as ''plant climate''.

===Dams===
{{main|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
Artificial reservoirs as well as natural ones create microclimates and often influence the macroscopic climate as well.

==Cities and regions known for microclimates==

===Americas===
* [[Northern California]] above the Bay Area is also well known for microclimates with significant differences of temperatures. The coastline typically averages between {{convert|17|and|19|C|F}} during summer months along that coastline, but inland towns not far from the ocean such as [[Lakeport, California|Lakeport]], average as much as {{convert|34|C|F|abbr=on}} in spite of being just around 40 miles inland. Even as far north as the [[Klamath River]] valley around the [[41st parallel north]] between [[Willow Creek, California|Willow Creek]] and [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] averages such temperatures, which is extremely hot for such northerly areas. At this parallel, the temperature at the coast is so cool that Willow Creek beats [[Eureka, California|Eureka]]'s all-time record temperature on average 79 times per year. This is in spite of the areas being less than 50 miles from each other. In oceanic stable terms it is like traveling from the summers in the north of [[England]] to the south of [[Spain]] in a fraction of the distance.
** [[San Francisco]] is a city with microclimates and submicroclimates. Due to the city's varied topography and influence from the prevailing summer marine layer, weather conditions can vary by as much as 9&amp;nbsp;°F (5&amp;nbsp;°C) from block to block. The [[Noe Valley]] district for example, is typically warmer and sunnier than adjacent areas because the surrounding hills block some of the cool fog from the Pacific.
** The region as a whole, known as the [[San Francisco Bay area]] can have a wide range of extremes in temperature. In the basins and valleys adjoining the coast, climate is subject to wide variations within short distances as a result of the influence of topography on the circulation of marine air. The San Francisco Bay Area offers many varieties of climate within a few miles. In the Bay area, for example, the average maximum temperature in July is about {{convert|64|F|C|abbr=on}} at [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]] on the coast, {{convert|87|F|C|abbr=on}} at [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]] only {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, and {{convert|95|F|C|abbr=on}} at [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], just {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/CALIFORNIA.htm |title=Climate Of California |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] areas are also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate. The temperatures can vary as much as {{convert|18|F-change|abbr=on}}) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast inland. Hills and mountains can also block coastal air masses. The [[San Fernando Valley]] is usually much warmer in summer than most of Los Angeles, because the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] usually block the cool ocean breezes and fog. Southern California has also a weather phenomenon called "[[June Gloom]]" or "May Grey", which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.
* [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] is also known for its microclimates. Especially notable are the differences between the downtown and river valley/flood plain regions and the areas to the west and north. This is largely due to an elevation difference within the city's boundaries of over {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but can also be attributed somewhat, to the effects of the seasonal [[Chinook wind|Chinooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarboro.ca/articles/Calgary%20Gardening%20Climate.htm |title=Calgary’s Gardening Climate |publisher=Scarboro.ca |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] also has numerous microclimates. Coastal temperatures and weather conditions can differ considerably from areas located just {{convert|5|–|15|km|abbr=on}} inland. This is true in all seasons. Varying elevations are common throughout the city, and it is even possible to experience several microclimates while traveling on a single highway due to these changing elevations.
* [[Chesapeake Bay]] is also known for its subtropical microclimate. It is most notable for its mild climatic effects on the area east and west of the lowlands of Maryland and Delmarva. Having over 64,000 square miles of water; (most of which is a mix of fresh and salt water) creates higher levels of humidity and heat in the spring and summer months. An example of this effect is the survival of tropical palm trees and plants such as water hyacinths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.umd.edu/learn/august-ornamental-plant-tips|title=Learn - University of Maryland Extension|website=extension.umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/more-than-just-the-bay|title=More than Just the Bay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/iss_pub/46/|title=Estimating Watershed Biodiversity: An Empirical Study of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, USA|first1=Morimoto,|last1=Junko|first2=Voinov,|last2=Helena|first3=Wilson, Matthew|last3=A.|first4=Costanza,|last4=Robert|date=14 July 2017|publisher=|journal=Journal of Geographic Information and Decision Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Santiago|Santiago, Chile]] and [[Villa de Merlo]], [[Argentina]] are also subject to microclimates.

===Europe===
* Mountain summits of [[Scotland]]
* Known for its wines, the [[Ticino]] region in [[Switzerland]] benefits from a microclimate in which palm trees and banana trees grow.
* [[Montreux]] in [[Switzerland]].
* [[Gran Canaria]] is called "Miniature Continent" for its rich variety of microclimates.
* [[Tenerife]] is known for its wide variety of microclimates. 
* [[Biddulph Grange]] is very rich with microclimates as a result of the large dips and variety of very large trees alongside a large amount of water.
* [[Leeds]], located in Yorkshire, England is known to have a number of microclimates because of the number of valleys surrounding the city centre.
* The coastal areas in the [[Andalusia]] region of [[Spain]] typically average around at {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} in summer, but [[Tarifa]] only averages {{convert|24|C|F}}. Further north along the coast [[Cádiz]] has a summer average of {{convert|27|C|F|abbr=on}} with very warm nights, whereas nearby [[Jerez de la Frontera]] has summer highs of {{convert|33|C|F|abbr=on}} with inland areas further north such as [[Seville]] being even hotter.

===Asia and Oceania===
* [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] has extreme examples of microclimate, and almost every neighbourhood exhibits its own weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://arlt-lectures.com/jordan-amman.pdf |title=‘‘Ever-growing Amman’’, Jordan: Urban expansion, social polarisation and contemporary urban planning issues |publisher=www.journals.elsevier.com/habitat-international |journal=Habitat International |date=2008 |accessdate=2014-02-02 |first=Robert B. |last=Potter |author2=Khadija Darmame |author3=Nasim Barham |author4=Stephen Nortcliff |volume=33 |pages=81–92|doi=10.1016/j.habitatint.2008.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern and western suburbs are among the coldest in the city, and can be experiencing frost or snow whilst other warmer districts such as the city centre can be at much warmer temperatures at the same time.
* [[Yazd]] and [[Kashan]] in [[Iran]], the traditional architecture benefits from central courtyards with trees and water pools that function together with wind catchers to create a favorable microclimate in this desert area.
* [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] has a microclimate occurring prominently in the warmer months. Inland, in [[Greater Western Sydney|Sydney's western suburbs]], the climate is drier and significantly hotter with temperatures generally around {{convert|3|-|7|C-change|0|abbr=on}} above [[Sydney CBD]] and [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]] (the coast), as [[sea breeze]]s don't penetrate further inland. In summer, the coast averages at {{convert|25.9|C|F|abbr=on}}, while inland varies between {{convert|28|and|30|C|F}}, depending on the suburb.&lt;ref name="acnsa"&gt;{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_066037_All|site_name=Sydney/Kingsford-Smith International Airport|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_067113_All|site_name=Penrith|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme occasions, the Coast would have a temperature of {{convert|24|C|F}}, while a suburb {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}}) inland bakes in {{convert|36|C|F|abbr=on}} heat. However, winter lows in the West are around {{convert|3|-|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} cooler than the coastal suburbs, and may provide mild to moderate frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingin-australia.com/climate-weather-sydney/|title=Sydney’s Climate|website=www.livingin-australia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies, from around {{Convert|682.5|mm|2|abbr=on}} in the far-west to {{convert|1213.8|mm|2|abbr=on}} at Observatory Hill (the east, or the coast).&lt;ref name="acnbc"&gt;{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_067108_All|site_name=Badgerys Creek AWS|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''O-ring theory of economic development''' is a [[economic model|model]] of [[economic development]] put forward by [[Michael Kremer]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="kremer1993"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kremer | first1 = Michael | authorlink1 = Michael Kremer | year = 1993 | title = The O-Ring Theory of Economic Development | journal = [[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 551-575  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | jstor = 2118400 | doi = 10.2307/2118400 | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes that tasks of production must be executed proficiently together in order for any of them to be of high value. The key feature of this model is positive [[assortative mating|assortative matching]], whereby people with similar skill levels work together.

The name comes from the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger shuttle disaster]], a catastrophe caused by the failure of a single [[O-ring]].

Kremer thinks that the O-ring development theory explains why rich countries produce more complicated products, have larger firms and much higher worker productivity than poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Nafziger | first1 = E. W. | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511805615.006 | title = Economic Development  | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780511805615 | chapter = 5 - Theories of Economic Development| pages = 123-164| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==

There are five major assumptions of this model: firms are risk-neutral, [[Labour economics|labor markets]] are competitive, workers supply labor [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastically]], workers are [[Substitute good|imperfect]] substitutes for one another, and there is a sufficient [[Complementary good|complementarity]] of tasks.

Production is broken down into ''n'' tasks. Laborers can use a multitude of techniques of varying efficiency to carry out these tasks depending on their skill. Skill is denoted by ''q'', where 0≤''q''≤1. The concept of ''q'' differs depending on interpretation.  It could mean: the probability of a laborer successfully completing a task, the quality of task completion expressed as a percentage, or the quality of task completion with the condition of a margin of error that could reduce quality.&lt;ref name="todaro2011"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Michael | last1 = Todaro | authorlink1 = Michael Todaro | first2 = Stephen C. | last2 = Smith | authorlink2 = Stephen C. Smith (economist) | title = Economic Development | edition = Ninth | publisher = Addison Wesley | isbn = 1408284472}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166-7}} Output is determined by multiplying the ''q'' values of each of the ''n'' tasks together and then multiplying this result by another term (lets say, ''B'') denoting the individual characteristics of the firm. ''B'' is positively correlated with the number of tasks. The [[production function]] here is simple:

: {{math|1=F(''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') = ''Bq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}

The important implication of this production function is positive assortative matching. We can observe this through a hypothetical four-person economy with two low skill workers ({{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and two high skill workers ({{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}}). This equation dictates the [[productive efficiency]] of skill matching:

: {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &gt; 2''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''}}

By this equation total product is maximized by pairing those with similar skill levels.

== Conclusions ==

There are several implications one can derive from this model:&lt;ref name="todaro2011" /&gt;{{rp|169-170}}

# Workers performing the same task earn higher wages in a high-skill firm than in a low-skill firm;
# Wages will be more than proportionately higher in developed countries than would be assumed by measurements of skill levels;
# Workers will consider human capital investments in light of similar investments by those around them;
# This model magnifies the effect of local bottlenecks which also reduce the expected returns to skill;
# O-ring effects across firms can create national low-production traps.

This model helps explain [[brain drain]] and [[International inequality|international economic disparity]]. As Kremer puts it, "If strategic complementarity is sufficiently strong, microeconomically identical nations or groups within nations could settle into [[Economic equilibrium|equilibria]] with different levels of human capital".&lt;ref name="kremer1993" /&gt;

== Extensions ==

[[Garett Jones]] (2013) builds upon Kremer's O-ring theory to explain why differences in worker skills are associated with "massive" differences in international productivity levels despite causing only modest differences in wages within a country. For this purpose, he distinguishes between O-ring jobs - jobs featuring high strategic complementarities in terms of skill - and foolproof jobs - jobs characterized by diminishing returns to labor - and assumes both production technologies to be available to all countries. He then goes on to show that small international variations in average worker skill per country result in both large international and small intra-national income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268112002193|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2012.10.014 | volume=85 | title=The O-ring sector and the Foolproof sector: An explanation for skill externalities|year=2013|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|pages=1–10 | last1 = Jones | first1 = Garett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14105">Gravitation can be described via a ''scalar theory of gravitation'', using a ''stratified conformally flat metric'', in which the field equation arises from the notion that the vacuum behaves like an optical polarizable medium.
It was proposed by R. H. Dicke (1957) and then H. E. Puthoff  (1998).
Harold Puthoff (see also [[Bernard Haisch]] and [[Stochastic electrodynamics|SED]])


In [[theoretical physics]], '''polarizable vacuum''' (PV) and its associated theory refers to proposals by [[Harold Puthoff]], [[Robert H. Dicke]], and others to develop an analogue of [[general relativity]] to describe [[gravity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv | eprint=0902.1305v1 | author1=Xing-Hao Ye | title=Polarizable vacuum analysis of electromagnetic fields | class=physics.gen-ph | date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its relationship to [[electromagnetism]].

== Description ==

In essence, Dicke and Puthoff proposed that the presence of mass alters the [[electric permittivity]] and the [[magnetic permeability]] of flat [[spacetime]], ε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; respectively by multiplying them by a scalar function, '''K''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;→ε = Kε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, μ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;→μ = Kμ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
arguing that this will affect the lengths of rulers made of ordinary matter, so that in the presence of a gravitational field the spacetime metric of [[Minkowski spacetime]] is replaced by
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = -\frac{1}{\kappa^2} dt^2 + \kappa^2 \, ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2 = K&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ''"[[Vacuum permittivity|dielectric constant of the vacuum]]"''.  This is a "diagonal" metric given in terms of a Cartesian chart and having the same ''stratified conformally flat'' form in the [[Scalar theories of gravitation#Additional variations|Watt-Misner theory of gravitation]].  However, according to Dicke and Puthoff, κ must satisfy a field equation which differs from the field equation of the Watt-Misner theory.  In the case of a static spherically symmetric vacuum, this yields the asymptotically flat solution
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = \exp(m/r) = 1 + m/r + O\left( \frac{1}{r^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
The resulting Lorentzian spacetime happens to agree with the analogous solution in the Watt-Misner theory, and it has the same weak-field limit, and the same far-field, as the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild vacuum]] solution in general relativity, and it satisfies three of the four [[classical tests of general relativity|classical tests of relativistic gravitation]] (redshift, deflection of light, precession of the perihelion of Mercury) to within the limit of observational accuracy.  However, as shown by Ibison (2003), it yields a different prediction for the inspiral of test particles due to gravitational radiation.

However, requiring stratified-conformally flat metrics rules out the possibility of recovering the weak-field [[Kerr metric]], and is certainly inconsistent with the claim that PV can give a ''general'' "approximation" of the [[general theory of relativity]].  In particular, this theory exhibits no [[frame-dragging]] effects.  Also, the effect of gravitational radiation on test particles differs profoundly between scalar theories and tensor theories of gravitation such as general relativity.  [[LIGO]] is not intended primarily as a test ruling out scalar theories, but is widely expected to do so as a side benefit once it detects unambiguous gravitational wave signals exhibiting the characteristics expected in general relativity.

Ibison has considered a "cosmological solution" of PV, analogous to the Friedmann dust solution with flat orthogonal hyperslices in general relativity, and argues that this model is inconsistent with various observational and theoretical constraints.  He also finds a rate of inspiral disagreeing with observation. The latter result disagrees with that of Watt and Misner, whose Lorentzian manifold differs from PV in the case of cosmology.

It is widely accepted that no scalar theory of gravitation can reproduce all of general relativity's successes, contrary to Puthoff's claims. It might be noted that De Felice uses [[constitutive relation]]s to obtain a ''susceptibility tensor'' which lives in spatial hyperslices; this provides extra degrees of freedom which help make up for the degree of freedom lacking in PV and other scalar theories.

==Modified PV Model==
In 2005 Depp proposed a modification to the original PV work of Dicke that addresses many of the objections above. The revised model is not a replacement for general relativity but is meant to provide insight into the possible underlying physics of general relativity.

Depp presents a PV Lagrangian field from which can be derived the exact Schwarzschild solution and the exact Reissner-Nordstrom solution. In addition it is also shown that electron charge renormalization can be obtained from the model that is in good agreement with QED.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/psistar%40sbcglobal.net/PV.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:04:55 Polarizable Vacuum and the Schwarzschild Solution&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/psistar%40sbcglobal.net/PV_and_RN.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:04:58 Polarizable Vacuum and the Reissner-Nordstrom Solution&lt;/ref&gt;

Desiato argues that Depp's modification was actually a correction that consistently uses the refractive index c/K throughout. Where, the original formulations by Dicke and Puthoff were inconsistent, using c^4/K or c^4/K^2 in the leading term of the Lagrangian, rather than Depp's (c/K)^4.  PV and GR are now on the same experimental footing because they produce identical metric predictions. Illustrating that PV is just an alternative interpretation of the same phenomenon described by GR, and is well suited for engineering purposes.

Desiato recently published an article in JBIS, using the Modified PV Model to derive an alternative to Alcubierre's warp drive equation, and offers a different interpretation of the Negative Energy Density required to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desiato|first1=T. J.|title=The Electromagnetic Quantum Vacuum Warp Drive|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2015|volume= 68|pages=347–353|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2015.68.347|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Generalization===
Puthoff himself has apparently offered various characterizations of his proposal, which has been variously characterized as
*an attempt to ''reformulate'' general relativity in terms of a purely formal analogy with the propagation of light through an optical medium,
*an attempt to ''replace'' general relativity with a scalar theory of gravitation featuring formal analogies with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism,
*an attempt to ''unify'' gravitation and electromagnetism in a theory of ''electrogravity'',
*an attempt to provide a ''physical mechanism'' for how spacetime gets curved in general relativity, which suggests (to Puthoff) the possibility of ''"metric engineering"'' for such purposes as spacecraft propulsion (see [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]]).

PV has origins in more mainstream work by such physicists as Robert Dicke{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, but in current parlance the term does appear to be most closely associated with the speculations of Puthoff. The claims have not been accepted in mainstream physics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Not a unified field theory?===
Mainstream physicists agree that PV is {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
#not viable as a unification of gravitation and electromagnetism
#not a "reformulation" of general relativity,
#not a viable theory of gravitation, since it violates observational and theoretical requirements.

== Related work ==
Antecedents of PV and more recent related proposals include the following:
#A proposal in 1921 by [[Harold A. Wilson (physicist)|H. A. Wilson]] to reduce gravitation to electromagnetism by pursuing the formal analogy between "light bending" in [[classical theories of gravitation|metric theories of gravitation]] and propagation of light through an optical medium having a spatially varying [[refractive index]].  Wilson's approach to a [[unified field theory]] is not considered viable today.
#An attempt (roughly 1960-1970) by [[Robert Dicke]] and [[Fernando de Felice]] to resurrect and improve Wilson's idea of an optical analogue of gravitational effects. If interpreted conservatively as an attempt to provide an alternative approach to gtr, rather than as work toward a theory unifying electromagnetism and gravitation, this is not an unreasonable approach, although most likely of rather limited utility.
#The 1967 proposal of [[Andrei Sakharov]] that gravitation might arise from underlying [[quantum field theory]] effects, in a manner somewhat analogous to the way that the (simple) classical theory of elasticity arises from (complicated) particle physics.  This work is generally regarded as mainstream and not entirely implausible, but highly speculative, and most physicists seem to feel that little progress has been made.
#In a series of papers, [[Bernard Haisch]] and Alfonso Rueda have proposed that the [[inertia]] of massive objects arises as a ''"electromagnetic reaction force"'', due to interaction with the so-called [[zero point field]].  According to mainstream physics, their claims rest upon incorrect computations using quantum field theory.
#Recent work, motivated in large part by the discoveries of the [[Unruh effect]], [[Hawking radiation]], and [[black hole thermodynamics]], to work out a complete theory of physical analogues such as ''optical black holes''.  This is not work toward a unified field theory, but in another sense can be regarded as work towards an even more ambitious unification, in which some of the most famous effects usually ascribed to general relativity (but actually common to many metric theories of gravitation) would be seen as essentially ''thermodynamical effects'', not specifically ''gravitational effects''.  This work has excited great interest because it might enable experimental verification of the basic concept of Hawking radiation, which is widely regarded as one of the most revolutionary proposals in twentieth century physics, but which in its gravitational incarnation seems to be impossible to verify in experiments in earthly laboratories.
#The 1999 proposal by Keith Watt and [[Charles W. Misner]] of a [[scalar theories of gravitation|scalar theory of gravitation]] which postulates a ''stratified conformally flat'' metric of the form &lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -\exp(2 \, \phi) + \exp(-2 \phi) (dx^2+dy^2+dz^2&lt;/math&gt;, given with respect to a [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian chart]], where φ satisfies a certain [[partial differential equation]] which reduces in a vacuum region to the [[flat spacetime]] [[wave equation]] &lt;math&gt;\Box \phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a "toy theory", not a fully fledged theory of gravitation, since as Watt and Misner pointed out, while this theory does have the correct [[Newtonian limit]], it disagrees with the result of certain observations.

'''Poper Scientific Stand Up''' is the first Latin American [[stand-up comedy]] group that is engaged in the popularization of science. It is an independent continuation of an early 2015 initiative by [[Diego Golombek]], which was made in conjunction with the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Argentina)|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]], [[Tecnopolis]] and TECtv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mincyt.gob.ar/convocatoria/curso-de-stand-up-scientific-10826|title=Course Scientific stand up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was to invite university students and graduates of different science fields to participate in a Scientific Stand Up comedy course given by renowned humorist [[Diego Wainstein]], for them to create monologues with scientific content. Using the [[stand-up comedy|Stand Up]] format as a resource, they speak about scientific topics to all age groups, whether they have previous knowledge or not, and they also talk about scientists as people and about the perception of science in society. The name "Poper" is a pun on the initials of ''"Popularización Entre Risas"'' (Popularizing Among Laughter), and a tribute to Epistemologist [[Karl Popper]].

==Origins and formation==
In early 2015, the Argentine [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Argentina)|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]], alongside with [[Tecnopolis]] and TECtv,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mincyt.gob.ar/call/course-de-stand-up-scientific-10826|title=Scientific Stand Up Comedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized the first Argentine course of Scientific Stand Up, in order to provide innovative teaching tools for the popularization of science. About 200 people enrolled in the course, and 30 were selected to take part in it, chosen for their scientific, artistic and general backgrounds. Those selected were undergraduates, graduates and researchers who had developed different activities in several scientific institutions in Argentina. The course content included several stand-up techniques such as character building, creating stand-up routines, jokes building, working with props and microphones, vocal work, body language, and communication with the public. During the course, each participant produced monologues that were later exhibited in [[Tecnopolis]], under the name "Humor Científico,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201507/113958-scientist-in-key-of-humor-despiertan-%20sonrisas-in-tecnopolis.html|title=Scientists wake humorously smiles on Tecnopolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 18 shows. They were well received by a diverse audience, which was composed mainly by people outside scientific fields, reaching around 900 spectators a show. After the completion of this course, some of its graduates formed Poper Scientific Stand Up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conexionbrando.com/1848201-del-laboratorio-al-escenario-la-ciencia-tambien-hace-stand-up|title=From the laboratory to the stage science ago Stand Up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV==

In October 2016 the signal TECtv announced it is working on a TV show with the comedian Poper group and Dalia Gutmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://twitter.com/_TECtv/status/786350739048148992 | title = "We are recording a new program"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed in the Crash Hall of the City of Buenos Aires, the Polo Scientific Technology and [[Avenida Corrientes]].

==Curiosities==
* In the show [[Tecnopolis]] used as opening and closing the soundtrack of the film [[Star Wars]], however during shows at La Casa de la Comedia did with Baby's on Fire [[Die Antwoord]].
* The Tecnopolis debut was against 945 people and after the first weekend had joined more than 3,000 people in four shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.conexionbrando.com/1848201-del-laboratorio-al-escenario-la-ciencia-tambien-hace-stand-up | title = From the laboratory to the stage science Stan makes Up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A confusing situation lived in Tecnopolis when one of the weekly functions in Ship Science was suspended because the stage was being used for a conference of Evangelical Pastors as part of Jesus Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eldestapeweb.com/este-sabado-el-jesus-fest-llega-tecnopolis-n8351|title=This Saturday Jesus Fest reaches Tecnopolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first show for schools did in the Belgrano San Roman College, where he was attending in the 60s known rock musician [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spinettabootlegs.com.ar/biografia | title = Biography of Luis Alberto Spinetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many of the members had had a relationship in the past not only as fellow scientists, if not sharing scenarios, such as student-teacher or outreach projects.
* Were hosts at the Awards Tecnox 2015 (Latin American Students Applying Technologies). Its function was to conduct the ceremony sandwiching comedy acts. However, minutes before the start, a blackout surprised all the Aula Magna of the Faculty of Natural Sciences where prizes were given. True to the style of the group took the situation with humor and conducted the ceremony illuminated by a single lamp, cell and a pair of lanterns lit from the public.
* The thematic variety of the group went beyond the artistic and several members who were not known for his scientific work to be completed different disciplines together in publishing scientific journals.
* They have shared the stage with the group of scientists monologues Uruguayans "[[Scientific Bardo]]" both [[Montevideo]] and [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psico.edu.uy/salud/institucional/novedades/mon%C3%B3logos-cient%C3%ADficos | title = Scientific Monologues in UDELAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acknowledgments==
In December 2015 they received the "I love what you do" that delivers the renowned broadcaster [[Carlos Ulanovsky]] Award of [[LRA Radio Nacional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://labeain.com/premios/|title= Awards LABEIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Redstone Test Stand''' or '''Interim Test Stand''' was used to develop and test fire the 
[[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone missile]], [[Jupiter-C| Jupiter-C sounding rocket]], [[Juno I| Juno I launch vehicle]] and [[Mercury-Redstone launch vehicle]].  It was declared an Alabama Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1979&lt;ref name = "nrhpinv2"/&gt; and a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.&lt;ref name = "nhlsum" /&gt;  It is located at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] on the [[Redstone Arsenal]], designated '''Building 4665'''.  The Redstone missile was the first missile to detonate a [[nuclear weapon]].  Jupiter-C launched to test components for the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missile]].  Juno I put the first American satellite [[Explorer 1]] into orbit. Mercury Redstone carried the first American astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] into space.  The Redstone earned the name "Old Reliable" because of this facility and the improvements it made possible.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt7" /&gt;

The Interim Test Stand was built in 1953 by [[Wernher von Braun|Dr. Wernher von Braun's]] team for a mere $25,000 out of materials salvaged from the Redstone Arsenal.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt1" /&gt;  In 1957 the permanent test facility called the [[Propulsion and Structural Test Facility|Static Test Tower]] was finally finished, but the Army decided to continue operations at the Interim Test Stand rather than move.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt8" /&gt;  From  1953 to 1961, 362 static rocket tests were conducted there, including 200 that led directly to improvements in the Redstone rocket for the Mercury manned flight program.  Adapted over the years, it never experienced the growth in size and cost that typified test stands in general, remaining a testament to the engineering ingenuity of the rocket pioneers.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt1" /&gt;

==Background==
[[Liquid-propellant rocket]] development has always proceeded in three steps: 
# Engine testing
# Static rocket testing
# Test launches.
First, prototype engines are tested in a [[Rocket engine test facility]], where the most promising designs are refined during a period of extensive testing.  After an engine has been proven, the complete rocket is assembled.  In this second step, the rocket is anchored to a static test stand.  With the rocket held down, engineers run the engine at full power and refine the system.  The test launch is third, when the missile is fired into the sky.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt6" /&gt;  Wernher von Braun and his team used this process to develop the [[V-2]] or A4 missile in [[Germany]] during [[World War II|WWII]].

Von Braun and members of his team decided to surrender to the United States military to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot by the Nazis to prevent their capture.  They came to the United States via [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref name="oengfvb"/&gt; The Army first assigned the [[List of German rocket scientists in the United States|Germans]] to teach German missile technology, assist with the launching of captured V-2's, and continue rocket research as part of the [[Hermes project]] at [[Fort Bliss| Fort Bliss, Texas]] and [[White Sands Proving Grounds]]&lt;ref name="historyRM14" /&gt;

On April 15, 1950, the Army consolidated their far-flung guided missile and rocket research and development efforts into the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at [[Redstone Arsenal]].  The Army bought the former WWII munitions facility from the [[Chemical Corps|Army Chemical Corps]].  That summer and fall, members of the German rocket team moved from Fort Bliss to Huntsville.  They conducted a preliminary study for proposed {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} range  missiles and began developing one, called '''Hermes C-1.'''  The study envisioned warhead payloads of {{convert|1500|and |3000|lb|kg}}, with the first test launch in 20 months.&lt;ref name="historyRM23-32" /&gt; [[Cold War]] tensions escalated by the [[Korean War]] drove the payload up to a {{convert|6900|lb|kg|adj=on }} atomic bomb with a reduced range.&lt;ref name="historyRM35" /&gt; The system with its new specifications took the name '''Redstone,''' and had to be highly reliable, accurate, and quickly produced, priority 1A.  The development program for the Redstone began in earnest on May&amp;nbsp;1, 1951.&lt;ref name="historyRM53" /&gt;  Separate from the missile development program, another budget line item was to bear the cost of constructing facilities for research and development at Redstone Arsenal because those facilities could also be used for other projects.&lt;ref name="historyRM41" /&gt;  However, the construction of facilities was not funded.

==Early development, 1952–1955==
[[File:Detail of Instrumentation and Control Tanks c 1959 HAER AL-129-A sheet 6 of 7.png|thumb|left|200px| Drawings of buried railroad tanker vessels used as bunkers for instrumentation and control.  Note periscopes in right tank]]
The first twelve missiles were built at Redstone Arsenal.&lt;ref name="historyRM162" /&gt;  Assembly of the first Redstone began in the fall of 1952.  Engineers needed a propulsion test stand to improve the missile, but they were not allowed to spend research and development funds on constructing facilities even for a cause vital to national security.  Rather than wait for funding to go through the two-year Congressional appropriation process, then wait further for construction, Fritz A. Vandersee designed an interim test stand for $25,000, the maximum amount allowed.  The large concrete foundation cost nearly all of the money.  On this base, welders built a small stand with metal salvaged from around the arsenal.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt35-36" /&gt;  Three railroad tank cars that had been used to transport chemicals at the arsenal during the war were cleaned, modified, and buried {{convert|300|ft|m}} away to serve as control and observation bunkers.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg6" /&gt;  To view the firings, the tanks also contain two periscopes believed to have been from two surplus Army tanks.&lt;ref name="Star31-34" /&gt;[[File:Redstone Test Stand bunker.jpg|thumb|right|bunker entrance in 2017]]

When workers assembled the first Redstone missile at Redstone Arsenal in spring of 1953, the '''Redstone Interim Test Stand''' stood ready.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt35-36" /&gt;  A crane hoisted the missile (without the warhead) onto the stand and placed a frame atop the missile.  Cables were attached to the frame to steady the missile.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg7" /&gt;  After extensive tests, workers fueled the missile and fired the engine for tests lasting no more than 15 seconds.  After several successful test runs, the missile went to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] for the test flight.  Launches provided valuable information on the guidance system, but most improvements on the propulsion system came from lessons learned at the Interim Test Stand, where engineers could evaluate the internal workings of the propulsion system while it was firmly anchored to the ground.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt38" /&gt;  A total of fourteen tests were performed with the first four missiles.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HAERtxtA" /&gt;
[[File:Redstone Test Stand and Missile Test 02 047018pu.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Redstone Test Stand during gmissile test #02]]

Before congressional appropriation and construction of permanent facilities was completed, the engineers used the information gained during static testing at the Interim Stand to steadily improve the Redstone system.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt8" /&gt;  The next eight missiles stood for twenty-two tests.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HAERtxtA" /&gt;  The tower to the left of the missile (shown [[:File:Redstone Test Stand.jpg|above right]]) is the Cold Calibration Unit, built in 1954.  It held only the Redstone's alcohol and liquid oxygen tanks, pumps, valves and flow meters in various configurations.  The liquids flowed into another set of tanks and were used to test and calibrate the valves and flow meters to assure that accurate measurements were made during the static fire testing and to assure a proper alcohol to oxygen mixture ratio.  Oxygen-rich propellant mixtures had caused most engine explosions in the early years of liquid rocket development.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg3" /&gt;

In the original version of the facility, flames were directed in a trench beneath the rocket in two opposite directions.  In December 1955, workers installed a new more durable elbow-shaped flame deflector designed by Rocketdyne engineer Carl Kassner.&lt;ref name="HAERtxt44" /&gt;  Water injected through small holes in the elbow quickly turned to steam, keeping the flame away from the metal elbow.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg5" /&gt;

==Army Ballistic Missile Agency, 1956–1958==
The [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA)]] was established on February&amp;nbsp;1, 1956 to turn  the experimental Redstone rocket into an operational weapon and to develop a new Jupiter Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM).&lt;ref name="McCleskey" /&gt;
The Redstone missile development continued with routine missile qualification tests and several improvements were made to the Interim Test Stand.  A [[load cell]] was added to directly measure the thrust of the missile.  A cutoff system was added to detect rough combustion in the engine and automatically stop tests.  This system prevented engine damage while engineers solved the problem.  The first Redstone built by [[Chrysler]] was tested at the Interim Stand.  Chrysler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; built thirty-eight developmental Redstone missiles and all sixty-three tactical Redstones in [[Detroit]].  In addition, several of the Redstone missiles were modified to aid the Jupiter missile development program.  These longer missiles were called Jupiter-C and test fired on the Interim Stand after it was enlarged and strengthened.  A series of tests using propellants chilled to {{convert|−25|F|C}} established that the Redstone could be deployed in the [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name="HAERtxt43-47" /&gt;

In 1957 the permanent [[Propulsion and Structural Test Facility]] was finally completed using the funds appropriated by Congress for the Redstone, but the ABMA decided to continue using the Interim Test Stand for the Redstone.  After four years of development, the interim facilities had proven adequate for testing the Redstone and Jupiter-C, and the Army felt that a move to the new facilities would be disruptive to its busy schedule.&lt;ref name=" HAERtxt43-47" /&gt;

[[File:Juno I awaiting launch with Explorer I.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Juno I awaiting launch with Explorer I]]
Dr. von Braun had proposed to [[Project Orbiter]]  using a Redstone as the main booster for launching artificial satellites on June&amp;nbsp;25, 1954.&lt;ref name="historyRM140" /&gt;  The day [[Sputnik 1]] launched, October&amp;nbsp;4, 1957, von Braun had been showing incoming Defense Secretary [[Neil McElroy]] around the Redstone Arsenal.  They received the news about Sputnik as they relaxed that afternoon.  Von Braun turned to McElroy.  "We could have been in orbit a year ago," he said. "We knew they &amp;#91;the Soviets&amp;#93; were going to do it!  Vanguard will never make it.  We have the hardware on the shelf… We can put up a satellite in 60 days."  McElroy was not confirmed until the next week and did not have the power to back their proposal.  On November&amp;nbsp;8, McElroy directed the Army to modify two Jupiter-C missiles and to place a satellite in orbit by March 1958.&lt;ref name="historyRM145" /&gt;
The first stage was soon test fired.&lt;ref name="HAERtxtA" /&gt;
Eighty-four days later, on January&amp;nbsp;31, 1958, the ABMA launched the first US satellite, Explorer I, into orbit.  Following this successful launch, five more of these modified Jupiter-C missiles (subsequently re-designated Juno I) were launched in attempts to place additional Explorer satellites in orbit.  During this satellite program, the Department of the Army gathered a great deal of knowledge about space. Explorer I gathered and transmitted data on atmospheric densities and the earth's oblateness. It is primarily remembered, though, as the discoverer of the [[Van Allen radiation belt|Van Allen cosmic radiation belt]].&lt;ref name="historyRM145" /&gt;

Because of its proven reliability and accuracy, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] decided to use the Redstone missile in tests to study the effects of nuclear detonations in the upper atmosphere, [[Operation Hardtack I]].  After being static-fired at the Interim Stand in January 1958, two missiles were shipped to the [[Pacific Test Range]].  In July and August, the missiles became the first missiles ever to detonate [[nuclear weapon|atomic warheads]].&lt;ref name="historyRM149-150" /&gt;

In 1958, Redstone development ended and Chrysler began mass production for deployment.  Only a few of these missiles were tested at the Interim Test Stand because the propulsion system had become so reliable.&lt;ref name="HAERdwg7" /&gt;

==Mercury-Redstone, 1959–1960==
[[File:Mercury Capsule at Redstone Test Stand.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Installation of a Mercury capsule on the Mercury-Redstone Test Booster (TB) for Full (110-116 sec) runs, May 1960]]
As the [[space race]] continued, the civilian space agency, [[NASA]] started on October&amp;nbsp;1, 1958&lt;ref name="NacaNASA"/&gt; but the Army kept von Braun and the ABMA for another year and a half.&lt;ref name="ABMA"/&gt;  NASA's [[Project Mercury]] chose the "Old Reliable" Redstone, with its unmatched launch record, as America's first manned launch vehicle.  Nevertheless, the Army had to make improvements for manned missions.  The crew at the Interim Test Stand ran over 200 static firings to improve the Redstone propulsion system.  In addition, all eight Mercury-Redstone launch vehicles endured a full duration acceptance test at the interim stand.&lt;ref name = "HAERtxt47-48" /&gt;  On July 1, 1960, 4,670 people transferred from the ABMA to NASA forming the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).

The first test flight, [[Mercury-Redstone 1]], occurred on November 21, 1960.  After rising a few inches off the launch pad, electrical cables disconnecting in the wrong order caused the engine to shut down.  The launch vehicle sustained minor damage and was returned to MSFC.  Static fire testing on the Redstone Test Stand in February 1961 verified that repairs were successful.  The second test launch, [[Mercury-Redstone 1A]], was successful on December 19, 1960.  On January 31, 1961, a chimpanzee named [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]] flew into space on [[Mercury-Redstone 2]].  Another test flight, [[Mercury-Redstone BD]], added to evaluate changes, confirmed the system was ready.&lt;ref name = "MRproj" /&gt;

[[Alan Shepard|Alan B. Shepard, Jr.]] became the first American in space on May 5, 1961.  [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] was a suborbital flight to an altitude of 115 miles and a range of 302 miles.  This flight demonstrated that man was capable of controlling a space vehicle during periods of weightlessness and high accelerations.  The last Mercury-Redstone flight, [[Mercury-Redstone 4]],
also a manned suborbital flight, carried [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. Grissom]] to a peak altitude of 118 miles and safely landed him 303 miles downrange.&lt;ref name = "historyRM157" /&gt;  The Redstone Test Stand contributed to the success of the first two Americans to fly in space.

==Epilogue==
[[File:Redstone Test Stand sign.jpg|thumb|right]]
The Redstone Test Stand phased out of use in October, 1961.&lt;ref name="Star17-4" /&gt; 
After becoming rundown and littered, the site was restored for the [[United States Bicentennial|US Bicentennial]].&lt;ref name="NASANews" /&gt;  A Redstone missile, which [[U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Missile Command]] (MICOM) loaned to NASA, was installed on February 27, 1976.&lt;ref name=" Star16-27" /&gt;
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as being nationally significant on May 13, 1976.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;
Alabama Section, [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] declared it an Alabama Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1979.&lt;ref name = "nrhpinv2"/&gt;
It was declared a National Historic Landmark on October 3, 1985.&lt;ref name = "nhlsum" /&gt;

'''Soku-hi''' ({{lang-ja|即非}}) means "is and is not". The term is primarily used by the representatives of the [[Kyoto School]] of [[Eastern philosophy]].

The logic of soku-hi or "is and is not" represents a balanced logic of symbolization reflecting sensitivity to the mutual determination of universality and particularity in nature, and a corresponding emphasis on nonattachment to [[Predicate (grammar)|linguistic predicates]] and subjects as representations of the real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/axtell1.htm G.

'''Sport Pedagogy''' is the academic field of study, which is located at the intersection between [[sport]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Roethig, P. and Prohl, R. (Eds.)(2003) ''Sportwissenschaftliches Lexikon'', Schorndorf.&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline, sport pedagogy is concerned with [[learning]], [[teaching]] and instruction in [[sport]], [[physical education]] and related areas of [[physical activity]].&lt;ref name="Armour"&gt;Armour, K. (Ed.)(2011). ''Sport Pedagogy: An introduction for coaching and teaching''. London: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst sport pedagogy is mostly regarded as a sub-discipline of [[sport science]] (in North America frequently referred to as [[kinesiology]]), its theoretical grounding is also underpinned by the general education sciences. As a scientific subdiscipline sport pedagogy is therefore allied to both fields, sport science and education.&lt;ref name = "Tinning"&gt;Tinning, R. (2008) Pedagogy, Sport Pedagogy, and the Field of Kinesiology, ''Quest'', 60 (3), 405-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and Context ==

In its original meaning the word [[pedagogy]], and therefore also sport pedagogy, relates to the purposeful development of children and young people. The word pedagogy derives from the Greek (pais=’child’; agogein=’to lead’; ‘to instruct’ and implies the purposeful art of leading, educating or teaching young people.&lt;ref name = 'Roethig'&gt;Roethig, P. and Prohl, R. (Eds.)(2003) ''Sportwissenschaftliches Lexikon'', Schorndorf, p.527.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the fact that humans are lifelong learners and also potentially engaged in lifelong physical activity, current definitions of sport pedagogy favour a broader view of the context in which sport pedagogy is located. To reflect this, the term sport pedagogy is used more holistically to include pedagogies that relate to adult learning and participation in sport and physical activity across all age ranges.&lt;ref name = 'Roethig' /&gt;

== Historical Background ==

Historically, the roots of sport pedagogy as an academic subdiscipline of sport science can be traced back to the systematic study of physical education as a subject.&lt;ref name="Haag"&gt;Haag, H. (1989). Research in ‘sport pedagogy’: One field of theoretical study in the science
of sport. ''International Review of Education'', 35(1), 5–16&lt;/ref&gt; As an academic discipline sport pedagogy was first explicitly recognised during the late 1960s in continental Europe, where the discipline was seen to provide a theoretical framework for the planning and teaching of physical education in schools. In Germany for instance, the publication of Ommo Grupe’s&lt;ref&gt;Grupe, O. (1969)''Grundlagen der Sportpädagogik'', München : J. A. Barth.&lt;/ref&gt; influential book ‘Grundlagen der Sportpädagogik’ (Foundations of Sport Pedagogy) provided a key moment in defining the concepts and content of sport pedagogy as an academic subject. It also provided the impetus for further research in this field and by the end of the 1970s, professorships in sport pedagogy were well established in sport and exercise science departments throughout Germany Universities.&lt;ref&gt;Roethig, P. and Prohl, R. (Eds.)(2003) ''Sportwissenschaftliches Lexikon'', Schorndorf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English speaking world, the recognition of sport pedagogy as a discipline is more recent. In 1989, the notable German researcher Herbert Haag observed that the meaning of the term 'sport pedagogy' was not as yet fully established in the English speaking sport science literature.&lt;ref name="Haag" /&gt; Nevertheless, Haag confirmed the ascendence and usefulness of the term 'sport pedagogy' to communicate about research in learning and teaching in physical education and sport to international academic audiences in this field. The relatively late adoption of the term 'sport pedagogy' in the English speaking academic literature is also observed by the distinguished Australian researcher Richard Tinning (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;405) who notes that ‘notwithstanding the fact that our European colleagues had been using the terms pedagogy and sport pedagogy for many years, the English-speaking world of kinesiology has only relatively recently embraced the terms.’ Nonetheless, Tinning observes that sport pedagogy is now ‘firmly established as a credible academic subdiscipline’.&lt;ref name = "Tinning"/&gt;

== Sport pedagogy as a discipline and as a field of study ==
While research in sport pedagogy and research in the field of physical education continue to overlap,&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, D. (2007). Mingling with our friends: The kinesiology student and pedagogy knowledge. ''Quest'', 59(1), 92–99&lt;/ref&gt; sport pedagogy is now seen to be the overarching academic discipline, informing learning, teaching and instruction in a wide range of sport, physical activity and exercise contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, D., Macdonald, D., and O’Sullivan, M. (Eds.)(2006). ''The handbook of physical education''. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the centre of the inquiry is the pedagogical encounter between the teacher/coach/instructor and the learner/participant.&lt;ref name="Armour" /&gt; In this, it is the purpose of sport pedagogy 'to support the needs of learners in sport, and other forms of physical activity, wherever and whenever they seek to learn through the life-course'.&lt;ref name = 'AIESEP'&gt;Association Internationale des Ecoles Superieures d’Education Physique (International Association for Physical Education in Higher Education) (AIESEP) AIESEP-Bham 2012 Position Statement: Sport (and Exercise) Pedagogy, Specialist Research Seminar, ‘Sport (&amp; Exercise) Pedagogy’: (Re)Defining the Field’, p.2., Thursday 29 March – Saturday 31 March 2012, University of Birmingham, UK. http://www.aiesep.ulg.ac.be/Document/aiesep_position_statement_sport_pedagogy_2012.pdf, retrieved 27/06/13.&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this end, sport pedagogy researchers should be encouraged to engage in inter-disciplinary work, in order to transcend the respective academic silos that sometimes exist between the distinct sub-disciplines in sport science.&lt;ref name = "AIESEP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3757">In [[Aristotelian physics]] and [[Greek astronomy]], the '''sublunary sphere''' is the region of the [[geocentric]] [[cosmos]] below the [[Moon]], consisting of the four [[classical elements]]: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1974) p. 357-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Toulmin, ''Night Sky at Rhodes'' (1963) p. 38 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The sublunary sphere was the realm of changing nature. Beginning with the Moon, up to the limits of the universe, everything (to classical astronomy) was permanent, regular and unchanging – the region of [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] where the [[Naked eye planets|planets]] and [[star]]s are located. Only in the sublunary sphere did the powers of physics hold sway.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Gillespie, ''The Edge of Objectivity'' (1960) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of concept==

[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] helped to formulate the original theory of a sublunary sphere in antiquity&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, p. 13-5&lt;/ref&gt; - the idea usually going hand in hand with [[geocentrism]] and the concept of a [[spherical Earth]].

[[Avicenna]] carried forward into the Middle Ages the Aristotelian idea of generation and corruption being limited to the sublunary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. E. Garcia, ''Individuation in Scholasticism'' (1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scholasticism|Medieval scholastics]] like [[Thomas Aquinas]] - who charted the division between celestial and sublunary spheres in his work ''Summa Theologica'' - also drew on [[Cicero]] and [[Lucan]] for an awareness of the great frontier between Nature and Sky, sublunary and aetheric spheres.&lt;ref&gt;W. Hooper, ''C. S. Lewis'' (1996) p. 529-31&lt;/ref&gt; The result for medieval/Renaissance mentalities was a pervasive awareness of the existence, at the Moon, of what [[C.S. Lewis]] called 'this "great divide"...from aether to air, from 'heaven' to 'nature', from the realm of gods (or angels) to that of daemons, from the realm of necessity to that of contingence, from the incorruptible to the corruptible"

However, the theories of [[Copernicus]] began to challenge the sublunary/aether distinction. In their wake [[Tycho Brahe]]'s observations of a new star (nova) and of comets in the supposedly unchanging heavens further undermined the Aristotelian view.&lt;ref&gt;R. Curley, Scientists and Inventors of the Renaissance'' (2012) p. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Kuhn]] saw scientists' new ability to see change in the 'incorruptible' heavens as a classic example of the new possibilities opened up by a paradigm shift.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1970) p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary offshoots==
[[Dante]] envisaged Mt Purgatory as being so high that it reached above the sublunary sphere, so that “These slopes are free from every natural change”.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson]] praised Shakespeare's plays as “exhibiting the real state of sublunary nature, which partakes of good and evil, joy and sorrow, intermingled”.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Selected Writings'' (Penguin) p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

Local 5810 represents over 6,000 postdoctoral researchers at the University of California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Postdocs Form Union|url=http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7311-119c|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Nature Magazine|date=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately one tenth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuna|first=Cari|title=Postdoctoral Researchers in California Ratify Labor Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703723504575425590474045262|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all postdoctoral researchers in the United States.

UC postdocs work in all fields of the academy, but are overwhelmingly concentrated in the fields of science, technology, [[engineering]] and math ([[STEM fields|STEM]]). Postdocs perform highly technical work, often under exacting conditions.&lt;ref name="AsimovJun2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov|first=Nanette|title=UC researchers struggle to obtain better wages|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/UC-researchers-struggle-to-obtain-better-wages-3260657.php|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to ratification of their first contract, the majority of postdocs at UC were paid less than $41,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov|first=Nanette|title=UC, postdoctoral researchers achieve labor pact|url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/UC-postdoctoral-researchers-achieve-labor-pact-3256215.php|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

In 2005, a group of postdoctoral researchers employed by the UC, many of whom were previously members of UAW Local 2865&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieff Benderly|first=Beryl|title=Taken for Granted: The Fat Lady Sings|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2008_08_01/caredit.a0800114|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Science Magazine|date=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other local unions representing academic student employees, approached the UAW and asked for help forming a union. The group began an organizing drive as Postdoctoral Researchers Organize/UAW or PRO/UAW.

On August 19, 2008, the California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) certified that a majority of UC postdocs had chosen PRO/UAW as their union.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Contract negotiations began in February 2009.&lt;ref name="AsimovJun2010"/&gt;

==Contract negotiations==

Negotiations of the first [[contract]], which spanned a year and a half,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieff Benderly|first=Beryl|title=Taken for Granted: The New California Postdoc Contract|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2010_09_03/caredit.a1000085|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Science Magazine|date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were protracted and contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasemyer|first=David|title=UC labor union significant for postdoctoral research|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/jul/06/1n6union234647-uc-labor-union-significant-postdoct/?uniontrib&amp;page=1#article|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, union supporters [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bachman|first=Rebecca|title=UC Budget Numbers Don’t Add Up, Scholars Claim|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2009/dec/18/uc-budget-numbers-dont-add-scholars-claim/|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Santa Barbara Independent|date=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at all ten University of California campuses. On April 30, 2010, the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor]] held a [[field hearing]] at [[UC Berkeley]] to evaluate the unusually lengthy amount of time it was taking to reach agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Problems in First Contract Negotiations: Post-Doctoral Scholar Bargaining at the University of California|url=http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/hearing/understanding-problems-first-contract-negotiations-post-doctoral-scholar-bargaining|publisher=U.S. House Education and Labor Committee|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the hearing, Vice President of Human Resources for the University of California Dwaine Duckett testified that the delay was due to difficulty tracking complex funding formulas used to allocate postdoc salaries. A postdoctoral researcher also testified about her difficult experience as an expectant and new mother within the UC system. 

After the hearing, Committee Chairman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] wrote UC President [[Mark Yudof]] expressing "deep concern"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lief Benderly|first=Beryl|title=House Committee Chair Miller Urges Speedy Resolution of Postdoc Contract in Letter to University of California President|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2010/05/house-committee-1.html|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Science Magazine|date=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about UC's slow-paced approach, saying he "left the hearing thoroughly disappointed"&lt;ref name="AsimovJun2010"/&gt; in UC's efforts to reach agreement.  Congressman Miller was then joined by Congresswoman [[Barbara Lee]] and Congresswoman [[Lynn Woolsey]] in sending a letter to the [[Government Accountability Office]] asking the agency to look into "how universities, including the University of California, track how funds provided for [[Funding of science|laboratory research grants]] are spent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lief Benderly|first=Beryl|title=House Committee Questions University of California's Accounting for Research Funds|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2010/06/house-committee-2.html|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Science Magazine|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First contract===

The contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Agreement|url=http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/collective_bargaining_units/post_docs/agreement.html|publisher=University of California|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was ratified on August 11, 2010 with 96 percent of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UC Postdocs Ratify First Union Contract|url=http://www.kqed.org/a/kqednews/R201008121104|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=KQED|date=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made significant advances in pay, health benefits and safety on the job for postdocs.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; Postdoc negotiators were successful in linking minimum salaries to an experience-based scale set by the [[NIH]] for NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowships.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jump|first=Paul|title=California postdocs win better employment terms|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=412936&amp;c=1|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; UC postdocs are guaranteed minimum salary increases with every year of experience.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation" /&gt;

=== Second contract ===
As of September 2015, the union was in negotiations for a second contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/postdocs-petition-for-uc-wide-improvements/|title=Postdocs Petition For UC-Wide Improvements|last=Sun|first=Cheryl|date=2015-09-17|website=The Daily Nexus|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://californianewswire.com/postdocs-urge-uc-to-comply-with-president-obamas-new-dol-rule-and-pay-them-fairly/|title=Postdocs Urge UC to Comply with President Obama's New DOL Rule and Pay Them Fairly|last=Simmons|first=Christopher|date=2015-09-21|website=California Newswire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick William Herschel''',&lt;ref name="Hoskin"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Hoskin|editor-first1=Michael|title=Caroline Herschel's autobiographies|date=2003|publisher=Science History Publ.|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0905193069|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KH|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɜr|ʃ|əl|,_|ˈ|h|ɛər|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/herschel "Herschel"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel}}; 15 November 1738&amp;nbsp;– 25 August 1822) was a German-British [[astronomer]], [[composer]] and brother of fellow astronomer [[Caroline Herschel]], with whom he worked. Born in the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]], Herschel followed his father into the Military Band of Hanover, before migrating to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1757 at the age of nineteen. His works were praised by [[Mozart]], [[Haydn]] (who met Herschel in London) and [[Beethoven]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Herschel constructed his first large telescope in 1774, after which he spent nine years carrying out sky surveys to investigate double stars. The resolving power of the Herschel telescopes revealed that the nebulae in the [[Messier catalogue]] were clusters of stars. Herschel published catalogues of nebulae in 1802 (2,500 objects) and in 1820 (5,000 objects).  In the course of an observation on 13 March 1781, he realized that one celestial body he had observed was not a star, but a planet, [[Uranus]]. This was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity and Herschel became famous overnight. As a result of this discovery, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] appointed him Court Astronomer. He was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and grants were provided for the construction of new telescopes.

Herschel pioneered the use of [[Astronomical spectroscopy|astronomical spectrophotometry]], using prisms and temperature measuring equipment to measure the wavelength distribution of stellar spectra. In addition, Herschel discovered [[Infrared|infrared radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Herschel discovers infrared lighj |url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |website=Cool Cosmos |accessdate=6 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094516/http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |archive-date=25 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other work included an improved determination of the rotation period of [[Mars]],&lt;ref name="Copus"/&gt; the discovery that the Martian polar caps vary seasonally, the discovery of  [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]] (moons of Uranus) and [[Enceladus]] and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] (moons of [[Saturn]]).  Herschel was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] in 1816. He was the first [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] when it was founded in 1820. He died in August 1822, and his work was continued by his only son, [[John Herschel]].

==Early life and musical activities==
Herschel was born in the [[Electorate of Hanover]] in Germany, then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], one of ten children of Isaac Herschel by his marriage to Anna Ilse Moritzen, of German Lutheran ancestry. It has been proposed by Hershel's biographer [[Edward S. Holden|Holden]] that his father's family traced its roots back to [[Jews]] from [[Moravia]] who converted to [[Christianity]] in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7611-herschel-sir-william|title=HERSCHEL, SIR WILLIAM - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barentine"&gt;{{citebook |first=John C. |last=Barentine |title=The Lost Constellations: A History of Obsolete, Extinct, or Forgotten Star Lore |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |page=410 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u_7NCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA410}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they themselves were [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Christians.&lt;ref name="Lubbock"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubbock |first=Constance Ann |title=The Herschel Chronicle: The Life-story of William Herschel and His Sister, Caroline Herschel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hcc5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |date=1933 |publisher=CUP Archive |pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel's father was an [[oboe|oboist]] in the Hanover Military Band. In 1755 the Hanoverian Guards regiment, in whose band Wilhelm and his brother Jakob were engaged as oboists, was ordered to England. At the time the crowns of [[kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] were [[personal union|united]] under [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. As the threat of war with France loomed, the Hanoverian Guards were recalled from England to defend Hanover. After they were defeated at the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]], Herschel's father Isaak sent his two sons to seek refuge in England in late 1757. Although his older brother Jakob had received his dismissal from the Hanoverian Guards, Wilhelm was accused of desertion&lt;ref name="deserter"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoskin |first=M. |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |title=Was William Herschel a deserter? |bibcode=2004JHA....35..356H |volume=35, Part 3 |issue=120 |pages=356–358 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for which he was pardoned by [[George III]] in 1782).&lt;ref name="Clerke1908"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clerke |first=Agnes M |title=A Popular History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century |place=London (republished eText) |publisher=Adam and Charles Black (republished Project Gutenberg) |date=1908 |edition=4 (republished as eBook number 28247) |page=18 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm, nineteen years old at this time, was a quick student of the English language. In England he went by the English rendition of his name, Frederick William Herschel.
In addition to the oboe, he played the violin and [[harpsichord]] and later the [[organ (music)|organ]].{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=67}} He composed numerous musical works, including 24 [[Symphony|symphonies]] and many concertos, as well as some church music.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Griffiths |first1=Martin |title=Music(ian) of the spheres William Herschel and the astronomical revolution  |date= 18 October 2009 |url=http://www.lablit.com/article/550 |website=LabLit |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of his symphonies were recorded in April 2002 by the [[London Mozart Players]], conducted by [[Matthias Bamert]] (Chandos 10048).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHAN 10048 WILLIAM HERSCHEL (1738-1822) |url=https://www.chandos.net/products/catalogue/CHAN%2010048 |website=Chandos |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel moved to [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in 1761 when [[Charles Avison]] immediately engaged him as first violin and soloist for his Newcastle orchestra, where he played for one season. In "Sunderland in the County of Durh: apprill [sic] 20th 1761" he wrote his ''Symphony No. 8 in C Minor.'' He was head of the Durham Militia band from 1760 to 1761.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seagull city: Sunderland's literary and cultural heritage |url=https://wp.sunderland.ac.uk/seagullcity/sir-william-herschel/ |website=Seagull city |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited the home of [[Milbanke baronets|Sir Ralph Milbanke]] at Halnaby Hall near [[Darlington]] in 1760,&lt;ref name="Lubbock"/&gt;{{rp|14}} where he wrote two symphonies, as well as giving performances himself.
After Newcastle, he moved to Leeds and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] where he was the first organist at St John the Baptist church (now [[Halifax Minster]]).&lt;ref name="Barentine"/&gt;{{rp|411}}

In 1766, Herschel became organist of the [[Octagon Chapel, Bath]], a fashionable chapel in a well-known spa, in which city he was also Director of Public Concerts.&lt;ref name="Cowgill"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Cowgill |editor-first1=Rachel |editor-last2=Holman |editor-first2=Peter |title=Music in the British Provinces, 1690-1914 |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=9781351557313 |pages=100–111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTkrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed as the organist in 1766 and gave his introductory concert on 1 January 1767.

Herschel's reading in [[natural philosophy]] during the 1770s indicates his personal interests but also suggests an intention to be upwardly mobile socially and professionally.  He was well-positioned to engage with eighteenth-century "philosophical Gentleman" or [[philomath]]s, of wide-ranging logical and practical tastes.&lt;ref name="Winterburn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winterburn |first1=E. |title=Philomaths, Herschel, and the myth of the self-taught man |journal=Notes and Records |date=25 June 2014 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=207–225 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2014.0027 |pmid=25254276 |pmc=4123665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herschel's intellectual curiosity and interest in music eventually led him to astronomy. After reading [[Robert Smith (mathematician)|Robert Smith]]{{'}}s ''Harmonics, or the Philosophy of Musical Sounds'' (1749), he took up Smith’s ''A Compleat System of Opticks'' (1738), which described techniques of telescope construction.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir William Herschel British-German astronomer |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Herschel |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also read [[James Ferguson (Scottish astronomer)|James Ferguson]]{{'}}s ''Astronomy explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's principles and made easy to those who have not studied mathematics'' (1756) and [[William Emerson (mathematician)|William Emerson]]{{'}}s ''The elements of trigonometry'' (1749),   ''The elements of optics'' (1768) and ''The principles of mechanics'' (1754).&lt;ref name="Winterburn"/&gt;

Herschel took lessons from a local mirror-builder and having obtained both tools and a level of expertise, started building his own [[reflecting telescope]]s. He would spend up to 16 hours a day grinding and polishing the [[speculum metal]] [[primary mirror]]s.  He relied on the assistance of other family members, particularly his sister Caroline and his brother Alexander, a skilled mechanical craftsperson.&lt;ref name="Winterburn"/&gt;

He "began to look at the planets and the stars"&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=David H.|title=The Quest for Comets An Explosive Trail of Beauty and Danger|date=1994|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1489959980|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F_5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 1773 and on 1 March 1774 began an astronomical journal by noting his observations of Saturn's rings and the [[Great Orion Nebula]] (M 42).&lt;ref name="Winterburn"/&gt;
The English [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Nevil Maskelyne]] visited the Herschels while they were at Walcot (which they left on 29 September 1777).&lt;ref name="construction"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoskin |first1=Michael |title=The construction of the heavens : the cosmology of William Herschel |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1107018389 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4b88e-qKYC&amp;pg=PA77 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1779, Herschel had also made the acquaintance of Sir [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], who invited him to join the Bath Philosophical Society.&lt;ref name="Winterburn"/&gt; Herschel became an active member, and through Watson would greatly enlarge his circle of contacts.&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ring |first1=Francis |title=The Bath Philosophical Society and its influence on William   Herschel's career |journal=Culture and Cosmos |date=2012 |volume=16 |pages=45–42 |url=http://www.cultureandcosmos.org/pdfs/16/Ring_INSAPVII_William_Herschel.pdf |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

===Double stars===
Herschel's early observational work soon focused on the search for pairs of stars that were very close together visually. Astronomers of the era expected that changes over time in the apparent separation and relative location of these stars would provide evidence for both the [[proper motion]] of stars and, by means of [[parallax]] shifts in their separation, for the distance of stars from the Earth. The latter was a method first suggested by [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref name="Aitken"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=Robert Grant|title=The Binary Stars|date=1935|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.|location=New York and London|isbn=978-1117504094 |pages=4–9|url=https://archive.org/stream/binarystars00aitk#page/4/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the back garden of his house in New King Street, Bath, and using a {{convert|6.2|in|mm|adj=mid| aperture}}, {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid| focal length}} (f/13) [[Newtonian telescope]] "with a most capital speculum" of his own manufacture,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mullaney|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 1779, Herschel began a systematic search for such stars among "every star in the Heavens",&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;{{rp|5}} with new discoveries listed through 1792. He soon discovered many more [[binary star|binary]] and [[multiple star]]s than expected, and compiled them with careful measurements of their relative positions in two catalogues presented to the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1782 (269 double or multiple systems)&lt;ref name="Herschel1782"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herschel |first1=Mr. |last2=Watson |first2=Dr. |title=Catalogue of Double Stars.

In 1797, Herschel measured many of the systems again, and discovered changes in their relative positions that could not be attributed to the parallax caused by the Earth's orbit. He waited until 1802 (in ''Catalogue of 500 new Nebulae, nebulous Stars, planetary Nebulae, and Clusters of Stars; with Remarks on the Construction of the Heavens'') to announce the hypothesis that the two stars might be "binary sidereal systems" orbiting under mutual [[gravity|gravitational attraction]], a hypothesis he confirmed in 1803 in his ''Account of the Changes that have happened, during the last Twenty-five Years, in the relative Situation of Double-stars; with an Investigation of the Cause to which they are owing''.&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}} In all, Herschel discovered over 800 confirmed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/Herschel_All.html William Herschel's Double Star Catalog].

===Uranus===

[[File:Uranus2.jpg|thumb|Herschel's discovery in 1781]]
In March 1781, during his search for double stars, Herschel noticed an object appearing as a disk. Herschel originally thought it was a comet or a stellar disc, which he believed he might actually resolve.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=96}} He reported the sighting to [[Nevil Maskelyne]] the [[Astronomer Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raffael |first1=Michael |title=Bath Curiosities |date=2006 |publisher=Birlinn |isbn=978-1841585031 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made many more observations of it, and afterwards Russian Academician [[Anders Johan Lexell|Anders Lexell]] computed the orbit and found it to be probably planetary.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |date=1970 |isbn=978-0226458045|page=115|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaffer1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schaffer |first1=Simon |title=Uranus and the Establishment of Herschel's Astronomy |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |date=1981 |volume=12 |pages=11–25 |bibcode=1981JHA....12...11S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel agreed, determining that it must be a planet beyond the orbit of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/herschel/fwhershs.html Astronomical League National – Herschel Club – Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel]. Astroleague.org. Retrieved on 5 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He called the new planet the "Georgian star" (Georgium sidus) after [[King George III]], which also brought him favour; the name did not stick.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; In France, where reference to the British king was to be avoided if possible, the planet was known as "Herschel" until the name "Uranus" was universally adopted. The same year, Herschel was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] and elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="Schaffer1981"/&gt; In 1782, he was appointed "The King's Astronomer" (not to be confused with the [[Astronomer Royal]]).&lt;ref name="Clerke"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clerke |first1=Agnes Mary |title=The Herschels and modern astronomy |date=2010 |publisher=New York |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1108013925 |pages=30–35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vp85AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 1782 Herschel and his sister Caroline moved to [[Datchet]] (then in [[Buckinghamshire]] but now in [[Berkshire]]). There he continued his work as an astronomer and telescope maker.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{Cite wikisource |ref=harv |last=Holden |first=Edward S. |date=1881 |authorlink=Edward S.

===Deep sky surveys===
[[File:NGC 2683 HST.jpg|thumb|[[NGC 2683]] is an [[unbarred spiral galaxy]] discovered by William Herschel on 5 February 1788.]]
From 1782 to 1802, and most intensively from 1783 to 1790, Herschel conducted systematic surveys in search of "deep sky" or nonstellar objects with two {{convert|20|foot|cm|adj=mid| focal length}}, {{convert|12|inch|cm|adj=mid| aperture}} and {{convert|18.7|inch|cm|adj=mid| aperture}} telescopes (in combination with his favoured 6-inch aperture instrument). Excluding duplicated and "lost" entries, Herschel ultimately discovered over 2400 objects defined by him as [[nebula]]e.&lt;ref name="Barentine"/&gt; (At that time, nebula was the generic term for any visually diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way, until galaxies were confirmed as extragalactic systems by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1924.)&lt;ref name="Alfred"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alfred |first1=Randy |title=Dec. 30, 1924: Hubble Reveals We Are Not Alone |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1230hubble-first-galaxy-outside-milky-way/ |website=Wired |accessdate=5 June 2018|date=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel published his discoveries as three catalogues: ''Catalogue of One Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars'' (1786), ''Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars'' (1789) and the previously cited ''Catalogue of 500 New Nebulae ...'' (1802). He arranged his discoveries under eight "classes": (I) bright nebulae, (II) faint nebulae, (III) very faint nebulae, (IV) planetary nebulae, (V) very large nebulae, (VI) very compressed and rich clusters of stars, (VII) compressed clusters of small and large [faint and bright] stars, and (VIII) coarsely scattered clusters of stars. Herschel's discoveries were supplemented by those of Caroline Herschel (11 objects) and his son John Herschel (1754 objects) and published by him as ''General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters'' in 1864. This catalogue was later edited by John Dreyer, supplemented with discoveries by many other 19th century astronomers, and published in 1888 as the ''[[New General Catalogue]]'' (abbreviated NGC) of 7840 deep sky objects. The NGC numbering is still the most commonly used identifying label for these celestial landmarks.&lt;ref name="Barentine"/&gt;{{rp|418}}

===Works with his sister Caroline===
[[File:Sir William Herschel and Caroline Herschel. Wellcome V0002731 (cropped).jpg|thumb|William and Caroline Herschel polishing a telescope lens (probably a mirror), 1896 Lithograph.]]
Following the death of their father, William suggested that [[Caroline Herschel|Caroline]]  join him in Bath, England.  In 1772, Caroline was first introduced to astronomy by her brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Caroline_and_William_Herschel_Revealing_the_invisible|title=Caroline and William Herschel: Revealing the invisible|last=esa|website=European Space Agency|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Caroline spent many hours polishing the mirrors of high performance telescopes so that the amount of light captured was maximized.  She also copied astronomical catalogues and other publications for William.  After William accepted the office of King's Astronomer to George III, Caroline became his constant assistant.&lt;ref name="Fernie"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Inimitable Caroline|last=Fernie|first=J. Donald|publisher=American Scientist|date=November–December 2007|isbn=|location=|pages=486–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1783, a new 20-foot telescope came into service for William.  During this time, William was attempting to observe and then record all of the observations.  He had to run inside and let his eyes readjust to the artificial light before he could record anything, and then he would have to wait until his eyes were adjusted to the dark before he could observe again.  Caroline became his recorder by sitting at a desk near an open window.  William would shout out his observations and she would write them down along with any information he needed from a reference book.&lt;ref name="Discoverers"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discoverers of the Universe: William and Caroline Herschel|last=Hoskin |first=Michael|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011 |isbn=9780691148335 |location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroline began to make astronomical discoveries in her own right, particularly [[comet]]s.  In 1783, William built her a small Newtonian reflector telescope, with a handle to make a vertical sweep of the sky.  Between 1783 and 1787, she made an independent discovery of [[Messier 110|M110]] (NGC 205), which is the second companion of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].  During the years 1786–1797, she discovered or observed eight comets.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

William was even summoned to Windsor Castle to demonstrate Caroline's comet to the royal family.  William recorded this phenomenon himself, terming it "My Sister's Comet."

Caroline also continued to serve as William Herschel's assistant, often taking notes while he observed at the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sheisanastronomer.org/index.php/history/carolineherschel|title=Caroline Herschel (1750–1848)|last=Baldwin|first=Emily|website=www.sheisanastronomer.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For her work as William's assistant, she was granted an annual salary of £50 by George III.  Her appointment made her the first female in England to be honored with a government position.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Science: Antiquity Through the Nineteenth Century|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn Bailey|publisher=MIT Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-262-65038-0|location=|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made her the first woman to be given a salary as an astronomer.&lt;ref name="Zielinski"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=Caroline Herschel: Assistant or Astronomer?|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/caroline-herschel-assistant-or-astronomer-39807005/|website=smithsonianmag.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1785, owing to damp conditions, William and Caroline moved to Clay Hall in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Old Windsor]]. On 3 April 1786, the Herschels moved to a new residence on Windsor Road in [[Slough]].&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt; Herschel lived the rest of his life in this residence, which came to be known as [[Observatory House]].&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web |title=Astronomical observatory |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomical-observatory#ref147669 |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Observatory House, about 1900 |url=http://www.sloughhistoryonline.org.uk/ixbin/hixclient.exe?a=query&amp;p=slough&amp;f=generic_objectrecord.htm&amp;_IXFIRST_=1&amp;_IXMAXHITS_=1&amp;%3Dcms_con_core_identifier=sl-sl-673_observatoryhouse-i-00-000.tif&amp;t=sl-sl-williamherschel&amp;s=YsMAJVwNCpg |website=Slough House Online |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 1788, William Herschel married the widow Mary Pitt (née Baldwin) at [[St Laurence's Church, Slough|St Laurence's Church]], [[Upton, Slough|Upton in Slough]].{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=186}} The marriage caused a lot of tension in the brother-sister relationship.  Caroline has been referred to as a bitter, jealous woman who worshipped her brother and resented her sister-in-law for invading her domestic life.  With the arrival of Mary, Caroline lost her managerial and social responsibilities in the household, and with them much of her status.  Caroline destroyed her journals between the years 1788 to 1798, so her feelings during this period are not entirely known.  According to her memoir, Caroline then moved to separate lodgings, but continued to work as her brother's assistant.  When her brother and his family were away from their home, she would often return to take care of it for them.  In later life, Caroline and Lady Herschel exchanged affectionate letters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Caroline continued her astronomical work after William's death in 1822.  She worked to verify and confirm his findings as well as putting together catalogues of nebulae.  Towards the end of her life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances.  She did this so that her nephew, John, could re-examine them systematically.  Eventually, this list was enlarged and renamed the ''[[New General Catalogue]]''.&lt;ref name="HerschelJW"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herschel |first1=J. F.

===Herschel's telescopes===
The most common type of telescope at that time was the [[refracting telescope]], which involved the refraction of light through a tube using a convex glass [[Lens (optics)|lens]].  
This design was subject to [[chromatic aberration]], a distortion of an image due to the failure of light of different component wavelengths to converge. Optician [[John Dollond]] (1706-1761) tried to correct for this distortion by combining two separate lenses, but it was still difficult to achieve good resolution for far distant light sources.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

[[Reflector telescope]]s, invented by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1668, used a single [[concave mirror]] rather than a convex lens. The concave mirror gathered more light than a lens, reflecting it onto a flat mirror at the end of the telescope for viewing. A smaller mirror could provide greater magnification and a larger field of view than a convex lens. Newton's first mirror was 1.3 inches in diameter; such mirrors were rarely more than 3 inches in diameter.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Because of the poor reflectivity of mirrors made of [[speculum metal]], Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard [[newtonian reflector]] from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This "front view" design has come to be called the [[Herschelian telescope]].&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maurer |first1=A. |last2=Forbes |first2=E. G. |title=William Herschel's Astronomical Telescopes |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |date=1971 |volume=81 |pages=284–291 |bibcode=1971JBAA...81..284M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bratton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bratton|first1=Mark|title=The complete guide to the Herschel objects : Sir William Herschel's star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521768924|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLuv9bAUbBwC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

The creation of larger, symmetrical mirrors was extremely difficult. Any flaw would result in a blurred image. Because no one else was making mirrors of the size and magnification desired by Herschel, he determined to make his own.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;  This was no small undertaking. He was assisted by his sister Caroline and other family members. Caroline Herschel described the pouring of a 30-ft focal length mirror:

{{quote|"A day was set apart for casting, and the metal was in the furnace, but unfortunately it began to leak at the moment when ready for pouring, and both my brothers and the caster with his men were obliged to run out at opposite doors, for the stone flooring (which ought to have been taken up) flew about in all directions, as high as the ceiling. My poor brother fell, exhausted with heat and exertion, on a heap of brickbats. Before the second casting was attempted, everything which could ensure success had been attended to, and a very perfect metal was found in the mould, which had cracked in the cooling." Caroline Herschel&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;}}

Herschel is reported to have cast, ground, and polished more than four hundred mirrors for telescopes, varying in size from 6 to 48 inches in diameter.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=C. S.|title=History of the telescope|journal=The Sidereal Messenger: A Monthly Review of Astronomy|date=1891|volume=10|page=342 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMBLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA342|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herschel and his assistants built and sold at least sixty complete telescopes of various sizes.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;
Commissions for the making and selling of mirrors and telescopes provided Herschel with an additional source of income. The King of Spain reportedly paid £3150 for a telescope.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

An essential part of constructing and maintaining telescopes was the grinding and polishing of their mirrors. This had to be done repeatedly, whenever the mirrors deformed or tarnished during use.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;
The only way to test the accuracy of a mirror was to use it.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;

&lt;!-- ====The 20ft telescope==== --&gt;

====The 40ft telescope====
{{see also|40-foot telescope}}
[[File:Lossy-page1-3705px-Herschel's Grand Forty feet Reflecting Telescopes RMG F8607 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[40-foot telescope|40-foot (12 m) telescope]]]]

The largest and most famous of Herschel's telescopes was a reflecting telescope with a {{convert|49+1/2|in|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[primary mirror]] and a 40-foot (12&amp;nbsp;m) [[focal length]]. The [[40-foot telescope]] was, at that time, the largest [[scientific instrument]] that had been built. It was hailed as a triumph of "human perseverance and zeal for the sublimest science".&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lubbock"/&gt;{{rp|215}}

In 1785 Herschel approached King George for money to cover the cost of building the 40-foot telescope. He received  £4,000.&lt;ref name="Greenwich"/&gt;  Without royal patronage, the telescope could not have been created. As it was, it took five years, and went over budget.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

The Herschel home in Slough became a scramble of "labourers and workmen, smiths and carpenters".&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;  A 40-foot telescope tube had to be cast of iron. The tube was large enough to walk through. Mirror blanks were poured from [[Speculum metal]], a mix of [[copper]] and [[tin]]. They were almost 4 feet in diameter and weighed 1,000 pounds.  When the first disk deformed due to its weight, a second thicker one was made with a higher content of copper. The mirrors had to be hand polished, a painstaking process. A mirror was repeatedly put into the telescope and removed again to ensure that it was properly formed. When a mirror deformed or tarnished, it had to be removed, repolished and replaced in the apparatus.  A huge rotating platform was built to support the telescope, enabling it to be repositioned by assistants as a sweep progressed.  A platform near the top of the tube enabled the viewer to look down into the tube and view the resulting image.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwich"&gt;{{cite web |title=40-foot Herschelian (reflector) telescope tube remains - National Maritime Museum |url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11109.html |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PIA06256 Mimas full view.jpg|thumb|Saturn orbiter's view of Mimas]]
In 1789, shortly after this instrument was operational, Herschel discovered a new [[Moons of Saturn#Table of known moons|moon]] of [[Saturn]]: [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], only 250 miles in diameter.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=190}} Discovery of a second moon ([[Enceladus]]) followed, within the first month of observation.&lt;ref name="Mimas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enceladus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

The 40-foot telescope proved very cumbersome, and in spite of its size, not very effective at showing clearer images.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Herschel's technological innovations  had taken him to the limits of what was possible with the technology of his day.  The 40-foot would not be improved upon until the Victorians developed techniques for the precision engineering of large, high-quality mirrors.&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=A. |title=William Herschel and the Measurement of Space |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=1989 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=399 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989QJRAS..30..399C |accessdate=6 June 2018|bibcode=1989QJRAS..30..399C }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
William Herschel was disappointed with it.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=A Giant of Astronomy |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=3 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-giant-of-astronomy|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceragioli"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ceragioli |first1=R. |editor-last=Cunningham |editor-first=C. |title=The Scientific Legacy of William Herschel |chapter=William Herschel and the “Front-View” Telescopes |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |location=Cham |pages=97–238 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32826-3_4 |series=Historical &amp; Cultural Astronomy |isbn=978-3-319-32825-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most of Herschel's observations were done with a smaller {{convert|18.5|in|cm|adj=on}}  {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-focal-length}} reflector. Nonetheless, the 40-foot caught the public imagination. It inspired scientists and writers including [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[William Blake]], and impressed foreign tourists and French dignitaries. King George was pleased.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Herschel discovered that unfilled telescope apertures can be used to obtain high angular resolution, something which became the essential basis for [[Interferometry|interferometric imaging]] in astronomy (in particular [[aperture masking interferometry]] and [[hypertelescope]]s).&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldwin |first1=J.

====Reconstruction of the 20ft telescope====
In 2012, the [[BBC]] ''[[Stargazing Live]]'' television programme built a replica of the 20-foot telescope using Herschel's original plans but modern materials. It is to be considered a close modern approximation rather than an  exact replica. A modern glass mirror was used, the frame uses metal scaffolding and the tube is a sewer pipe. The telescope was shown on the programme in January 2013 and stands on the Art, Design and Technology campus of the [[University of Derby]] where it will be used for educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/20970167 BBC builds William Herschel's telescope for Stargazing Live] Ariel at BBC Learning, 10 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life on other celestial bodies ===

Herschel was sure that he had found ample evidence of life on the Moon and compared it to the English countryside.&lt;ref name="Basalla"/&gt; He did not refrain himself from theorising that the other planets were populated,&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; with a special interest in Mars, which was in line with most of his contemporary scientists.&lt;ref name="Basalla"/&gt; At Herschel's time, scientists tended to believe in a plurality of civilised worlds; in contrast, most religious thinkers referred to unique properties of the earth.&lt;ref name="Basalla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basalla|first1=George|title=Civilized life in the universe : scientists on intelligent extraterrestrials |date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195171815|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herschel went so far to speculate that the interior of the sun was populated.&lt;ref name="Basalla"/&gt;

=== Sunspots, climate, and wheat yields ===
Herschel started to examine the correlation of [[solar variation]] and [[solar cycle]] and climate.&lt;ref name="Herschel, W. 1801 265–318"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herschel |first=W. |date=1801 |title=Observations tending to investigate the nature of the Sun, in order to find the causes or symptoms of its variable emission of light and heat; With remarks on the use that may possibly be drawn from solar observations |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/91/265.full.pdf+html?sid=99352cf4-35ce-4d62-8eb2-55dc257b8fa8|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=91 |pages=265–318 |jstor=107097 |bibcode=1801RSPT...91..265H |doi=10.1098/rstl.1801.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of 40 years (1779–1818), Herschel had regularly observed [[sunspot]]s and  their variations in number, form and size. Most of his observations took place in a period of low solar activity, the [[Dalton minimum]], when sunspots were relatively few in number. This was one of the reasons why Herschel was not able to identify the standard 11-year period in solar activity.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Sun set food prices in the Middle Ages|journal=Nature|date=22 December 2003|doi=10.1038/news031215-12|url=https://www.nature.com/news/2003/031222/full/news031215-12.html|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pustil’nik"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pustil’nik|first1=Lev A.|last2=Din|first2=Gregory Yom|title=Influence of solar activity on the state of the wheat market in medieval England|journal=Solar Physics|date=September 2004|volume=223|issue=1–2|pages=335–356|doi=10.1007/s11207-004-5356-5|arxiv=astro-ph/0312244|bibcode=2004SoPh..223..335P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herschel compared his observations with the series of wheat prices published by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.&lt;ref name="Nye"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nye|first1=Mary Jo|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 5, The Modern Physical and Mathematical Sciences |volume=5| date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn= 978-0521571999 |page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, Herschel reported his findings to the Royal Society and indicated five prolonged periods of few sunspots correlated with the price of wheat.&lt;ref name="Herschel, W. 1801 265–318"/&gt; Herschel's study was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries but did initiate further attempts to find a correlation. Later in the 19th century, [[William Stanley Jevons]] proposed the [[solar cycle|11-year cycle]] with Herschel's basic idea of a correlation between the low number of sunspots and lower yields explaining [[Business cycle|recurring booms and slumps in the economy]].&lt;ref name="Pustil’nik"/&gt;

Herschel's speculation on a connection between sunspots and regional climate, using the market price of wheat as a proxy, continues to be cited.
According to one study, the influence of solar activity can actually be seen on the historical wheat market in England over ten solar cycles between 1600 and 1700.&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pustil’nik"/&gt; The evaluation is controversial&lt;ref name=ml12&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solar Influence on Global and Regional Climates | doi=10.1007/s10712-012-9181-3 | volume=33|issue=3–4 |journal=Surveys in Geophysics|pages=503–534 | last1 = Lockwood | first1 = Mike|bibcode = 2012SGeo...33..503L |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the significance of the correlation is  doubted by some scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Love |first=J.

From studying the [[proper motion]] of stars, the nature and extent of the [[stellar kinematics|solar motion]] was first demonstrated by Herschel in 1783, along with first determining the direction for the solar apex to [[Lambda Herculis]], only 10° away from today's accepted position.&lt;ref name=lankford1997&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Lankford | date=1997 | title=History of astronomy: an encyclopedia | page=258 | volume=1 | series=Garland encyclopedias in the history of science | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-8153-0322-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=herschel1783&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=106492|last1=Herschel|first1=William|date=1783|title=On the Proper Motion of the Sun and Solar System; With an Account of Several Changes That Have Happened among the Fixed Stars since the Time of Mr. Flamstead|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=73|pages=247–83|doi=10.1098/rstl.1783.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoskin&gt;{{citation

[[File:Herschel-galaxy.jpg| thumb|right| William Herschel's model of the Milky Way, 1785]]
Herschel also studied the structure of the [[Milky Way]] and was the first to propose a model of the galaxy based on observation and measurement. He concluded that it was in the shape of a [[spiral galaxy|disk]], but incorrectly assumed that the sun was in the centre of the disk.&lt;ref name=Kamp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berendzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berendzen |first1=Richard |title=Geocentric to heliocentric to galactocentric to acentric: the continuing assault to the egocentric |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=1975 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=65–83 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(75)90049-5 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665675900495 |accessdate=6 June 2018|bibcode=1975VA.....17...65B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Shape of the Milky Way from Starcounts |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l8_p3.html |website=Astro 801 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/meet-the-stargazers/in-history.html |title=Stargazers in History |publisher=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt; This  [[Heliocentrism|Heliocentric]] view was eventually replaced by  [[Galactocentrism]] due to the work of [[Harlow Shapley]], [[Heber Doust Curtis]] and [[Edwin Hubble]] in the 1900s.

== Discovery of infrared radiation in sunlight ==
On 11 February 1800, Herschel was testing filters for the sun so he could observe sun spots. When using a red filter he found there was a lot of heat produced. Herschel discovered [[infrared radiation]] in [[sunlight]] by passing it through a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]] and holding a [[thermometer]] just beyond the red end of the [[visible spectrum]]. This thermometer was meant to be a control to measure the ambient air temperature in the room. He was shocked when it showed a higher temperature than the [[visible spectrum]]. Further experimentation led to Herschel's conclusion that there must be an [[visual perception|invisible]] form of light beyond the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref name="Rowan-Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Rowan-Robinson |date=2013 |title=Night Vision: Exploring the Infrared Universe |page=23 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107024762  |oclc=780161457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aughton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aughton|first1=Peter|title=The story of astronomy|date=2011|publisher=Quercus|location=New York|isbn=978-1623653033|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpeJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Herschel used a [[microscope]] to establish that [[coral]] was not a plant – as many at the time believed – because it lacked the cell walls characteristic of plants.&lt;ref name="Azzouni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Azzouni|first1=Jody|title=Ontology Without Borders|date=July 20, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190622558|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0W4sDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and death==
William Herschel and Mary had one child, [[John Herschel|John]], born at Observatory House on 7 March 1792. William's personal background and rise as man of science had a profound impact on the upbringing of his son and grandchildren. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1788.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, William was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and was accorded the honorary title 'Sir' although this was not the equivalent of an official British knighthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanham |first=A. |first2=M. |last2=Hoskin, |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=44 |title=The Herschel Knighthoods: Facts and Fiction |last-author-amp=yes |bibcode=2013JHA....44..149H |issue=120 |pages=149–164 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped to found the Astronomical Society of London in 1820,&lt;ref name="Shortland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shortland |first1=E. |title=The Astronomical Society of London |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |date=1820 |volume=81 |pages=44–47 |url=http://adsbit.harvard.edu/full/seri/JBAA./0081//0000044.000.html |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1831 received a royal charter and became the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A brief history of the RAS |url=https://www.ras.org.uk/about-the-ras/a-brief-history |website=Royal Astronomical Society |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

On 25 August 1822, Herschel died at Observatory House, Windsor Road, Slough, after a long illness.  He was buried at nearby [[Church of St Laurence, Upton-cum-Chalvey|St Laurence's Church, Upton, Slough]]. Herschel's epitaph is
{{cquote|Coelorum perrupit claustra&lt;br&gt;(He broke through the barriers of the heavens) &lt;ref name="Pendergrast"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pendergrast|first1=Mark|title=Mirror mirror : a history of the human love affair with reflection |date=2004|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465054718|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-GErgSbU0C&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Caroline was deeply distressed by his death, and soon after his burial she returned to [[Hanover]], a decision she later regretted.  She had lived in England for fifty years. Her interests were much more in line with her nephew [[John Herschel]], also an astronomer, than with her surviving family in Hanover. She continued to work on the organization and cataloguing of nebulae, creating what would later become the basis of the [[New General Catalogue]]. She died on 9 January 1848.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Roberta J.

==Memorial==
William Herschel lived most of his life in [[Slough]], a town then in Buckinghamshire. He died in the town and was buried under the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upton-cum-Chalvey]], near Slough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.saint-laurence.com/history.html |website=Saint Laurence Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey,  Slough |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel is quite respected in Slough and there are several memorials to him and his discoveries. In 2011 a new bus station, the design of which was inspired by the infrared experiment of William Herschel, was built in the centre of Slough.&lt;ref name="Serck"/&gt;

His house at 19 New King Street in [[Bath, Somerset]], where he made many [[telescope]]s and first observed Uranus, is now home to the [[Herschel Museum of Astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Visiting |url=http://herschelmuseum.org.uk/visiting/ |website=Herschel Museum of Astronomy |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Woman in Science'''''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/womaninsciencew00zahmgoog#page/n0/mode/2up Woman in Science, by H. J. Mozans (MIT Press, 1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a book written by [[H. J. Mozans]] (a pseudonym for John Augustine Zahm) in 1913. It is an account of women who have contributed to the sciences, up to the time when it was published.

==Themes==
The comprehensive theme that is depicted throughout ''Woman in Science'' is that of women's biological capacity. It is asserted that women being less prominent than men in science is due to the lack of educational and career opportunities available rather than, the biological aspects of brain size or structure. In addition, the book encompasses the many developments of science throughout history. The main objective of the author/book was for women to become more involved and gain a respected position in the scientific field, in addition to increasing educational and career opportunities for women interested in science. It was one of the first collaborations of women's contributions to the scientific community, and it "explored the barriers to women's participation in science."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Has_Feminism_Changed_Science.html?id=Fb232LIFk80C ''Has Feminism Changed Science?''], by [[Londa Schiebinger]], Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}, p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

"H. J. Mozans, in his Woman in Science, gives us a most comprehensive survey of the scientific activity and attainments of women. Primarily inspired to his investigation by extensive travels in Greece and Italy, the author begins with the learned women of ancient Greece-Hypatia, Sappho, and Aspasea, and of somewhat less widespread fame, Gorgo, Andromeda, and Corinna-and passes on from them to the women of ancient Rome, the women of the Middle Ages, when education was largely confined to monasteries, the women of the renaissance, and the women of subsequent and modern times. He shows during each of these epochs the advantages and opportunities offered to women in each country, and indicates where their achievements were least, and where greatest. He very conclusively proves that where opportunity was great, achievement was likewise great, and vice versa. "In every department of natural knowledge," he states, "when not inhibited by her environment, woman has been the colleague and the emulatress, if not the peer, of the most illustrious men who have contributed to the increase and diffusion of human learning." He analyzes most carefully the biologic capacity of women for scientific pursuits, coming to the conclusion that the reputed difference in intelligence between men and women is due not to difference in brain size or structure or innate power of intellect, but to education and opportunity. He then goes carefully through the historical development of each science, beginning with mathematics, going on through astronomy, physics, chemistry, the natural sciences, medicine, and surgery, archaeology,and invention, and shows the instances, extent and value of woman's contributions to each science. He concludes with the prediction that increasing education and opportunity for women will bring about ever-increasing participation in the advancement of science."&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Woman in Science.

PREFACE

"Only then did the magnitude and the difficulty of my self-imposed task begin to dawn upon me. I saw that it would be impossible, if I were to do justice to the subject, to compass in a single volume anything like an adequate account of the contributions of women to the advancement of general knowledge. I accordingly resolved to restrict my theme and confine myself to an attempt to show what an important role women have played in the development of those branches of knowledge in which they are usually thought to have had but little part".}}

"The subject of my book thus, by a process of elimination, narrowed its scope to woman’s achievements in science. Many works in various languages had been written on what women had accomplished in art, literature, and state-craft, and there was, therefore, no special call for a new volume on any of these topics. But, with the exception of a few brief monographs in German, French and Italian, and an occasional magazine article here and there, practically nothing had been written about woman in science. The time, then, seemed opportune for entering upon a field that had thus far been almost completely neglected; and, although I soon discovered that the labor involved would be far greater than I had anticipated, I never lost sight of the work which had its virtual inception in the peerless sanctuary of Pallas Athena in the 'City of the Violet Crown.'"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}}}

:''For World Clock which is actually an [[astronomical clock]], see [[Jens Olsen's World Clock]]''
A '''world clock''' is a [[clock]] which displays the [[time]] for various cities around the [[world]]. 
The display can take various forms:
*The [[clock face]] can incorporate multiple round [[analog clock|analogue]] clocks with moving hands or multiple [[Digital data|digital]] clocks with numeric readouts, with each clock being labelled with the name of a major city or time zone in the world.  
*It could also be a picture [[map]] of the world with embedded analog or digital time-displays.
*A moving circular map of the world, rotating inside a stationary 24-hour dial ring. Alternatively, the disc can be stationary and the ring moving.
*Light projection onto a map representing daytime, used in the [[Geochron]], a brand of a particular form of world clock.
There are also worldtime [[watch]]es, both [[wrist watch]]es and [[pocket watch]]es.  Sometime manufacturers of timekeepers erroneously apply the worldtime label to instruments that merely indicate time for two or a few [[time zone]]s, but the term should be used only for timepieces that indicate time for all major [[time zone]]s of the globe.
