'''''Bad Influence!''''' is an early to mid-1990s British factual television programme broadcast on [[CITV]] between 1992 and 1996, and was produced in Leeds by Yorkshire Television (now known as ITV Studios). It looked at [[video games]] and computer technology, and was described as a "kid’s [[Tomorrow's World]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whizzbang.tv/violetberlin.htm Violet Berlin Website 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown on Thursday afternoons and had a run of four series of between 13 and 15 shows, each of 20 minutes duration. For three of the four series, it had the highest ratings of any CITV programme at the time. Its [[working title]] was ''Deep Techies'',&lt;ref&gt;''BUZZ!'', a now-defunct video games magazine on [[ORACLE (teletext)|ORACLE]]&lt;/ref&gt; a colloquial term derived from 'techies' basically meaning technology-obsessed individuals. The show's finished title was a reference to how video games were often viewed by the UK press at the time.

''Bad Influence!'' began during the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16 bit-era]] of computer and video gaming, and featured in-depth news, previews and reviews about the very latest in gaming and computer technology. The series ran long enough to feature the launch of the [[Nintendo 64]] console (then acknowledged by its working title, the Ultra 64) in its fourth and final series. The show was originally presented by then children's TV presenters [[Violet Berlin]] and [[Andy Crane]] (of 1980s CBBC Broom Cupboard fame [The Broom Cupboard being the nickname for the CBBC's [[continuity announcer]]'s booth]), who were studio based, and US teen actor Z Wright, who filed location reports from the US until Series 4. There was also a cheats segment character called Nam Rood (played by [[Andy Wear]]), an anarchic "furtler" who lived in a shed in the first two series, and then in the basement for Series 3. He would give viewers gaming cheats (written on cards he would stick to his forehead) in between mock experiment comedy sketches three times per episode. He would always greet viewers with his trademark catchphrases "slimy furtlers" and "scrotty furtlers", the term "furtler" equating to the term "[[techie]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bad-influence.co.uk/presenters.htm Bad Influence! : Violet Berlin, Andy Crane, et al.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features included three game reviews per episode by teenagers local to the area where Bad Influence! was produced, namely the city of Leeds in West Yorkshire. Although these teenagers stints on the show varied, a small number appeared in all four series of the programme. Each game was given two separate scores, one from the girls and one from the boys. Although the majority of mid-programme reports were filed from the US by Z Wright, they were sometimes filed by Violet Berlin and on rare occasions by Andy Crane, in place of Z Wright. The programme usually focused on PC and Amiga segments early on in an episode, with more console-based segments later on. There was also a weekly competition towards the end of the programme, directly before one of the show's most distinctive features - the 'Datablast' sequence. The Datablast - which viewers were encouraged to record on their video recorders - consisted of a number of pages of gaming articles and information that were flashed rapidly onto the screen during the credits. Viewers could then read the pages by replaying it in slow motion on their video player. The information consisted of a watered down version of most of that episodes features, as well as some exclusive content, such as Top Ten video games charts.

In Series 1, a spin-off Bad Influence! magazine was launched by [[Europress]] and promoted on the show, however only two editions were ever published.

In Series 2, as part of a report, Violet Berlin was included as a character in the [[Mega Drive]] game [[Micro Machines 2]]. She was also included in another video game in Series 4.

In Series 3, the show experienced a revamp. The virtual reality title sequence and credits, which by the end of Series 2 had begun to look somewhat dated, were replaced by a new, industrial-style title sequence, influenced by the mega-flop beat-em-up [[Rise of the Robots]]. There was also a remixed, industrial-style theme tune and a slightly more anarchic feel to the show, suggesting it was now targeting a slightly older teen audience. This demographic refocusing was in tune with gaming trends which were moving more towards older teens and younger adults, yet at odds with CITV viewer trends which showed that CITV audiences were actually getting younger.{{OR|date=June 2014}} Also in Series 3, the Datablast section only appeared once, at the end of the series, which would prove to be its final appearance. Also making their final appearance were Z Wright and Nam Rood.

In Series 4, the final series, Z Wright had been replaced by Violet Berlin presenting global reports (rather than solely US reports) and she was also granted her own slot, called Virtual Violet. Back in the studio, Crane was now joined by new co-presenter [[Sonya Saul]]. Nam Rood and the Datablast had both been discarded. In the final edition, Berlin, Crane and Saul all presented together in the studio, the only time this ever occurred.

Shortly after the 4th series ended, a report on the now defunct television information service [[Teletext]] reported that plans were afoot to remarket Bad Influence! at a younger audience if it were to get a Series 5. However these plans were never implemented, most likely because gamers were getting older whilst CITV's audience was getting younger, and so would have had little appeal to CITV's increasingly younger audience. Subsequently, a fifth series was not commissioned and the show was axed.

==Early life==
Parks was born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to Aaron Jacobson, a [[Jew]]ish merchant who had immigrated to the United States in 1900 from [[Latvia]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]), and his wife Hattie (Spiegel) Jacobson, the daughter of immigrants from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Census 1930, Atlanta, GA, Supervisor's District 4, Sheer 24A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=James E.|authorlink=|authors=|title= Stars in Khaki: Movie Actors in the Army and the Air Services|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|location=|url=|isbn=1-55750-958-1|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one older brother, Allen Jacobson.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Parks' had his first experience in amateur theatre when he was four years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monologue and Dial Log|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6116657/oakland_tribune/|work=Oakland Tribune|date=October 23, 1933|page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Marist School (Georgia)|Marist College, a Catholic preparatory school in Atlanta Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bixler|first1=David|title=The Man at the Mike|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6116828/the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=April 24, 1937|page=9|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 3, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
Parks entered radio broadcasting at age 16, for Atlanta's [[WGST]].&lt;ref name=rs&gt;DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). ''Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2834-2}}. P. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, he moved to [[New York City]] and was hired as a singer and [[straight man]] on ''The [[Eddie Cantor]] Show'', then becoming a [[CBS Radio]] staff announcer. Parks was the host of ''[[Break the Bank (1948 game show)|Break the Bank]]'', which premiered on radio in 1945 and was telecast from 1948 to 1957, as well as ''Stop the Music'' on radio in 1948 and television from 1949 to 1952. The success of  ''Stop the Music'' took a toll on the ratings of the popular radio show hosted by satirist [[Fred Allen]], who began spoofing Parks's program with skits mocking the premise of the show, one called ''Cease The Melody.''

With other celebrities, he hosted NBC radio's ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' during the 1960s.

==Television==
[[File:Bert Parks statue Atlantic City.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of Bert Parks in Atlantic City commemorates his association with the Miss America pageant.]]
Parks' first game show was ''Party Line'' on NBC (broadcast from [[New York City]] NBC flagship station WNBT), which involved viewers calling in to answer questions and win $5 prizes; ''Party Line'' ran from June 8 to August 31, 1947, making its one surviving episode the oldest known game show and one of the oldest surviving television shows to have been recorded. Commercial kinescopes did not come out until fall 1947 (co-sponsored by NBC, DuMont, and Kodak), and the only kinescopes known to predate ''Party Line'' are a few episodes of ''Kraft Television Theater'' from February and June 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress online archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Other games that Parks hosted in early television include ''[[Stop the Music (TV series)|Stop the Music]]'' (1949-52/1954-56), ''Double or Nothing'' (1952–54), ''Balance Your Budget'' (1952–53), ''Two in Love'' (1954), ''Giant Step'' (1956–57), ''Hold That Note'' (1957), ''Bid 'n' Buy'' (1958), ''County Fair'' (1958–59), ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' (1958–60), ''[[The Big Payoff]]'' (1959), ''[[Yours for a Song]]'' (1961–63), and the pilot for ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (April 21, 1965). His last game show hosting job was in 1968, on the pilot for a revival of Heatter-Quigley's ''The Celebrity Game''; the show did not sell.

He also helmed a daytime [[variety show]] in 1950, simply called ''The Bert Parks Show''. In addition, he also starred in a syndicated series called ''Circus!'' (featuring various circus acts from around the world) in the early 1970s. Parks also appeared in a 1976 episode of ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' as the nefarious host of the "Miss United States" beauty pageant, involved in a plot to sell national security technology.

However, Parks is most famous for hosting the [[Miss America]] telecast from 1955–79, after which he was unceremoniously fired by the organization (he heard a newscast while on vacation) in an attempt to attract a more youthful audience. ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' host [[Johnny Carson]] led an on-air campaign to get Parks rehired, but was unsuccessful. In 1990, for the 70th anniversary of the Miss America pageant (during which Miss America 1991 was crowned), Parks was brought on by host [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]] to sing "There She Is" to the new Miss America, [[Marjorie Vincent|Marjorie Judith Vincent]]. It was the last time Parks performed the song live.

Parks' last known television appearance, a [[Pepsi]] commercial, first aired in June 1991.

==Recordings==
A recording of "[[There She Is, Miss America]]" as sung by Parks was used each year in the Miss America scholarship pageant until [[Miss America 2012|2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss America loses ‘there she is. . .’ theme song|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/05/08/miss-america-loses-there-she-is-theme-song/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the new reigning titleholder takes her walk down the runway in her newly earned crown. On September 13, 2015, the recording was reused for the [[Miss America 2016|95th Anniversary of the Miss America pageant]].

Parks did a take-off of his hosting role in ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'' (1990), starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Matthew Broderick]] and [[Bruno Kirby]]. He played the emcee of a Gourmet Club dinner where guests supposedly eat a [[Komodo dragon]], singing a spoof of "There She Is" in a salute to the soon-to-be-deceased dragon. Some of his other film appearances were in ''[[That's the Way of the World]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Great Balloon Race]]'' (1977).

Parks appeared on ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' in the 1980 episode "Herb's Dad", playing Herb Tarlek Sr. (father of series' regular [[Herb Tarlek]] Jr.). In 1988, Parks appeared on an episode of ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'' as himself, and in 1991, Parks appeared on an episode of ''[[Night Court]]'' as himself.

==Death==
Parks died of [[lung cancer]] at [[La Jolla, California]] on February 2, 1992 at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife of 49 years, Annette (Liebman) Parks (June 28, 1921 &amp;ndash; December 19, 2013), and their three children.

'''Cage Rage Championships''', also known as '''Cage Rage''', was a [[United Kingdom]]-based, [[mixed martial arts]] promotion that premiered on 7 September 2002 in London. Cage Rage went into liquidation and is now no longer trading. Cage Rage had been owned and managed by [[Elite XC]] until that company ceased operating, and the British promoters behind Cage Rage formed a new organization and withdrew all the old Cage Rage titles.&lt;ref name="UltimateUKMirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/more-sport/2008/12/08/neil-the-goliath-grove-crowned-ultimate-challenge-uk-champ-115875-20955677/|title=Neil ‘The Goliath’ Grove crowned Ultimate Challenge UK champ|last=Granet|first=Chris|date=12 August 2008|work=Mirror.co.uk|publisher=The Daily Mirror|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matchmaker and on-screen personality [[Dave O'Donnell (MMA promoter)|Dave O'Donnell]] was also a minority shareholder in the company. Fellow on-screen personality and co-promoter Andy Geer also owned a minority stake until he left the promotion in 2008.&lt;ref name="geerdeparts"&gt;{{cite web| author=| year=2008| title=Cage Rage promoter Andy Geer steps down| work=mmaweekly.com| url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=6109&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=311&amp;Itemid=9| accessdate=19 May 2008}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage Rage events were replayed on [[Nuts TV]],&lt;ref name="tvdeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagerage.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=280&amp;Itemid=9 |title=Why Inbound Marketing Works &amp;#124; Learning how to navigate Inbound |publisher=Cagerage.tv |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with their own weekday show on [[The Fight Network (UK &amp; Ireland)]] until these channels closed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cage Rage | year=2006 | title=Cage Rage SLAMS onto TWC Fight! | work=cagerage.tv | url=http://www.cagerage.tv/index.php? | accessdate=6 December 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206211947/http://www.cagerage.tv/index.php | archivedate=6 December 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every Cage Rage event and bout is now archived as part of the UFC FIGHT PASS library.

==History==
Cage Rage started when Alex Jones and Tom Bell set out to raise money by promoting a small [[mixed martial arts]] show, to provide new mats for their martial arts school. The [[2002 in Cage Rage Championships|first Cage Rage event]] in [[Elephant and Castle]], London was a success, which led to fans and fighters asking for a follow up show, leading to further shows and promotion as it exists today.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knucklepit.com/mixed-martial-arts-cage_rage.htm |title=Cage Rage MMA BJJ Royce Gracie Wembley Ian Freeman |publisher=Knucklepit.com |date=1993-11-12 |accessdate=2015-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218115612/http://www.knucklepit.com/mixed-martial-arts-cage_rage.htm |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, after the purchase of [[PRIDE Fighting Championships]] by [[Frank Fertitta III]] and Lorenzo Fertitta from [[Dream Stage Entertainment]], Cage Rage were announced as members of a promotional alliance instigated by [[ProElite]] and [[Fighting and Entertainment Group|FEG]], the parent companies of [[Elite Xtreme Combat|EliteXC]] and [[Hero's]] respectively, along with [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], BodogFight K-1 and Spirit MC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| year=2007| title=K-1 ANNOUNCES SHOWTIME EVENT &amp; NEW ALLIANCES| work=Mmaweekly.com| url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=3679| accessdate=19 May 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this working relationship barely lasted a month. When Cage Rage signed K-1 star Bob Sapp to a main event in London for their show on 21 April 2007, K-1 stopped Sapp from fighting on the card. This left a desperate Geer and O'Donnell scrambling for a new main event on just days notice with aged veteran Tank Abbott eventually stepping in.

Due to the closeness of the two promotions, [[ProElite]] purchased the majority shareholding in Cage Rage in September 2007 from Cage Rage's silent partner John Faraday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| year=2007| title=EliteXC and Cage Rage Championships Join Forces| work=Mmaweekly.com| url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/2805/elitexc-and-cage-rage-championships-join-forces.mma| accessdate=19 May 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619025903/http://mmajunkie.com/news/2805/elitexc-and-cage-rage-championships-join-forces.mma| archivedate=19 June 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Geer Left the group he founded in April 2008, and was replaced by former King of the Cage boss Christopher Cordeiro.

In May 2008, Sky Sports said in a statement they would no longer be airing Cage Rage events on their channels. The official line was that they could not continue with Cage Rage as a fighter (Paul Daley) had sworn on live TV on a previous show. However, this was thought to be an excuse as the incident (where Daley used several sexual cursewords) took place well after the 9pm "[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]". Much more likely Sky was disappointed with the average 19,000 viewers Cage Rage was getting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Since the closure of Cage Rage, Dave O'Donnell created Cage Rage UK, the parent company of another Mixed Martial Arts promotion, [[Ultimate Challenge MMA]] (UCMMA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cagerageuk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159&amp;Itemid=28]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928065423/http://www.cagerageuk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159&amp;Itemid=28 |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Cage Rage's rules&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagerage.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=47 |title=Why Inbound Marketing Works &amp;#124; Learning how to navigate Inbound |publisher=Cagerage.tv |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; were based upon the ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]'' that were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] and modified by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]].&lt;ref name="nsac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html |title=NAC: CHAPTER 467 - UNARMED COMBAT |publisher=Leg.state.nv.us |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules were adopted across the US in other states that regulate mixed martial arts. As a result, they became the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the US and for cage-based MMA worldwide.

At Cage Rage 13, amendments to the ''Unified Rules'' were made, most notably
[[#The "Open Guard" rule|the "Open Guard" rule]] and the banning of [[Elbow (strike)|elbow strikes]] to a downed opponent.

===Rounds===
All Cage Rage fights were contested over three, five-minute rounds, with a one-minute rest period in-between rounds.

===Weight divisions===
Cage Rage had six weight classes:

| colspan=2|Unlimited
|}

===Cage===
Cage Rage used an eight-sided caged arena to stage bouts similar to the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC's]] trademarked Octagon, though it was smaller in size. It had foam padding around the top and between each of the eight sections, with two entry/exit gates on opposite sides. The canvas was marked with a line a metre away from the fence at all points.

===Attire===
As per the ''Unified Rules of MMA'', Cage Rage only allowed competitors to fight in approved shorts, without shoes or any other sort of foot padding. Fighters used approved light gloves (4-6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab.

===Match outcome===
Matches usually end via:
*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter taps on the mat or his opponent three times (or more) or verbally submits.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue.
*'''Technical Knockout''': stoppage of the fight by the referee if it is determined a fighter cannot "intelligently defend" himself or by ringside doctor due to injury.
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for one fighter),
**split decision (two judges score a win for one fighter with the third for the other),
**majority decision (two judges score a win for one fighter with one for a draw),
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw),
**majority draw (two judges score a draw).
**split draw (the total points for each fighter is equal)

A fight can also end in a '''technical decision''', '''technical draw''', '''disqualification''', '''forfeit''' or '''no contest'''.

===Judging criteria===
The [[10-point must system]] was used for all Cage Rage fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or less. If the round is even, both fighters receive ten points. The decision is announced at the end of the match but the judge's scorecards are not announced.

===Fouls===
The following are considered fouls in Cage Rage:

# [[headbutt|Butting]] with the head.
# [[eye-gouging|Eye gouging]] of any kind.
# Biting.
# Hair pulling.
# [[fish-hooking|Fish hooking]].
# [[Groin attack]]s of any kind.
# Putting a finger into any orifice or into any cut or laceration on an opponent. (see [[Fish-hooking]])
# [[Small joint manipulation]].
# Striking to the spine or the back of the head. (see [[Rabbit punch]])
# Striking downward using the point of the elbow. (see [[Elbow (strike)]])
# Throat strikes of any kind, including, without limitation, grabbing the trachea.
# Clawing, pinching or twisting the flesh.

When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.

===Match conduct===
The referee has the right to stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] nor working toward one) after a verbal warning.

===Defunct rules===

====The "Open Guard" rule====
Cage Rage was the home of a unique rule in the world of cage-based MMA; the "open guard" rule. Designed to prevent stalling on the ground, it allowed a standing fighter to use strikes on a downed opponent that would otherwise be [[#Fouls|fouls]].

If a downed fighter was at least a meter away from the cage, on his back and able to avoid or defend against attacks, the referee would raise his arm and call "open guard". Once an open guard was called, the standing fighter could use the following attacks on their opponent:
*stomps,
*kicks or knees to the head, or
*flying attacks.

Unless an open guard has been called, these strikes were fouls.

This rule was introduced at Cage Rage 13 and was designed to prevent a fighter from laying in an open guard where his opponent can only throw leg kicks or drop to initiate grappling.&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt; However, due to their ongoing desire to standardise rules across the UK and work with a potential MMA board of control, this rule was scrapped.

==Events==
{{see also|List of Cage Rage events}}
The [[2002 in Cage Rage Championships|first Cage Rage event]] featured top British fighters, such as Matt Ewin and Robbie Olivier, and international fighters, such as [[Chute Boxe Academy]]-trained Jean Silva. This formula has continued down the years since the first show, with such top domestic fighters like [[Ian Freeman]] and [[Michael Bisping]] appearing, as well as internationally-known fighters like [[Murilo Rua]] and [[Anderson Silva]].

Cage Rage 26 was the first main Cage Rage show to be held outside London.

===Cage Rage Contenders===
In early 2006, Cage Rage Championships launched '''Cage Rage Contenders''', a secondary-level show for up-and-coming fighters to showcase their skills. Trying to conjure up the feel of early Cage Rage shows, these shows take place in a nightclub setting with VIP tables surrounding the cage.

Cage Rage also aimed to franchise the Contenders name to other promoters across the country, the first promoter of which was Jay Gilbey of Intense Fighting in Peterborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagerage.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=306&amp;Itemid=9 |title=Why Inbound Marketing Works &amp;#124; Learning how to navigate Inbound |publisher=Cagerage.tv |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Contenders shows have been expanded to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Wales]] and [[Nottingham]].

'''''Canzonissima''''' was an Italian musical [[variety show]] broadcast by [[Rai 1]] from 1958 to 1974, aired on Saturday evening except for the last two editions in which it was aired on Sunday afternoon. The program was referred to as "the synthesis and the model of comparison of the Italian television variety".&lt;ref name=hhhs&gt;Aldo Grasso – Massimo Scaglioni, ''Enciclopedia della Televisione'', Garzanti, Milano, 1996 – 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalida Dan dan dan.jpg|thumb|265px|[[Dalida]] in finals sing "Dan dan dan", the song that reflects her recent child loss.]]
It was born in radio as a song tournament in 1956, with the title ''Le canzoni della fortuna '' and gained great public success. The following year it was brought on television titled ''Voci e volti della fortuna'' and turned into a competition between amateurs from the various regions of Italy, with the participation of some professional singers, who competed in a separate group.
In 1958 the variety took the name ''Canzonissima'' that remained until the end, with an exception from 1963 to 1967 when the transmission continued with new formats and new titles; ''Gran Premio'', ''Napoli contro tutti'', ''La prova del nove'', ''Scala reale'' e ''Partitissima''.

The show consisted of a musical contest (with singers combined with some state lottery numbers) from the elaborate rules which were generally different from one edition to another; the competition was interspersed with dances and comedy sketches involving  special guests.&lt;ref name=hhhs /&gt;

Edition od 1959 contributed to launch the [[Nino Manfredi]]'s career, and the 1970, which launched the career of [[Raffaella Carrà]].&lt;ref name=hhhs /&gt;
The 1962 edition, hosted by [[Dario Fo]] and [[Franca Rame]], generated large political controversities due to use of censorship to cut some satirical sketches of Fo; the couple Fo-Rame was eventually fired, and the scandal lead to a long interruption of five years.&lt;ref name=hhhs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiara Valentini|title=La storia di Dario Fo|publisher=Feltrinelli Editore, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the entertainer " 'Cool' White" ''see'' [[John Hodges (minstrel)]]
[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Charles White TCS 1.1080.jpg|thumb|right|Charles White]]
'''Charles T. "Charlie" or "Charley" White''' (1821–1891), was an early [[blackface]] [[minstrel]] entertainer.

Born June 4, 1821 in [[Newark, New York]], White moved with his family at the age of two to New York City, where, before he launched his career as an entertainer, he worked in racing stables, for a druggist, in a chair factory and in city government positions. He first came to public attention in 1843 as an [[accordion]] player at the Thalian Hall at 42 Grand Street. That summer, he joined the "Kentucky Minstrels" troupe at the Vauxhall Garden Theatre on Fourth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Ellis, ''An Authentic History of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks'', Chicago, 1910, [http://www.circushistory.org/Cork/BurntCork4.htm BROWN, Col. T. Allson, ''Early History of Negro Minstrelsy]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Thomas D. Rice|Daddy Rice]] popularized blackface with his [[Jim Crow]] character White first incorporated some "negro act" with his accordion playing and then founded [[White's Kitchen Minstrels]] in New York in the early 1840s, opening at the Melodeon on the [[Bowery]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', May 19, 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago':“While we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street.  In those days accordions were the real attraction to the public.  Charley White did a negro act in connection with his accordion playing, but he decided finally to open up with a minstrel troupe, too, so he opened at the Melodeum’’ (sic)’’ on the Bowery with White’s Kitchen Minstrels.

The money was flowing in fast to us "(i.e.Christy’s Minstrels) "so we did not mind opposition."
&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there he seems to have employed the famous dancer [[Master Juba]],&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', July 10, 1887, 'Drop-Curtain Monographs':"Dick Carroll, (originally Master Marks, a jig dancer who succeeded the negro boy Juba at Charlie White's Melodeon, Bowery, this city..."&lt;/ref&gt; who apparently toured with his minstrel troupe.

In addition to the Melodeon on the Bowery,&lt;ref&gt;"Drop Curtain Monographs," New York Times, July 10, 1887&lt;/ref&gt; White managed other theaters. In 1869 he ran the [[Theatre Comique]] at 514 Broadway for a season.&lt;ref&gt;John Charles Franceschina, ''David Braham: The American Offenbach'', Psychology Press: 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, he took over management of Hooley's Opera House, a variety theatre in downtown Brooklyn, renaming it the Brooklyn Globe Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn Eagle, May 1, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was running White's Athenaeum on the Bowery.&lt;ref&gt;Armond Fields, ''Tony Pastor, Father of Vaudeville''McFarland, 2007, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, he was the victim of an attempted mugging. Described as "Charles White, the minstrel" and as living at No. 250 Hudson Street, he was attacked while drunk by two young men who tried to make off with his watch and pocketbook, but the theft was prevented by a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 21, 1877: 'AN ATTEMPT TO ROB "CHARLIE" WHITE'&lt;/ref&gt;

He was largely retired from the stage&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', July 10, 1887, 'Drop-Curtain Monographs':"Charlie White and Bernard long ago shook themselves clear of professional harness..."&lt;/ref&gt; by 1887, although his obituary in the ''New York Times'' says that he had also been engaged to play the role of an elderly black woman in the popular 1890 Broadway musical ''Reilly and the 400'', and that since retirement he had devoted himself to writing reminiscences of his career.

He died of pleuro-pneumonia in New York at his residence, 266 West 36th Street, on January 4, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 5 January 1891: "Death of an old Minstrel"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26717">{{Vocal range}}
A '''countertenor''' (also '''contra tenor''') is a type of [[classical music|classical]] male [[singing]] [[human voice|voice]] whose [[vocal range]] is equivalent to that of the female [[contralto]] or [[mezzo-soprano]] [[voice type]]s, generally extending from around [[scientific pitch notation|G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] to D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although a [[sopranist]] (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the [[soprano]]'s range of around C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;A sopranist is a term used to describe a countertenor whose voice range is so high it is equivalent to that of a soprano; however, this term is widely used falsely. {{cite book
|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults
|last= McKinney
|first= James
|year= 1994
|publisher= Genovex Music Group
|isbn=978-1-56593-940-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countertenors often are [[baritone]]s or [[tenor]]s at core, but on rare occasions use this vocal range in performance.

The nature of the counter-tenor voice has radically changed throughout musical history, from a [[modal voice]], to a modal and [[falsetto]] voice, to the primarily falsetto voice which is denoted by the term today. This is partly because of changes in human physiology and partly because of fluctuations in pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Supernatural Voice|last=Ravens|first=Simon|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2015|isbn=9781843839620|location=Woodbridge|pages=38–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term first came into use in England during the mid-17th century and was in wide use by the late 17th century. However, the use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the soprano range, was known in European all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967385734|title=The supernatural voice : a history of high male singing|last=Simon|first=Ravens,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781843839620|location=|pages=50–57|oclc=967385734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern-day ensembles such as [[The Tallis Scholars]] and [[The Sixteen]] have counter-tenors on alto parts in works of this period. There is no evidence that falsetto singing was known in Britain before the early 17th century, when it was occasionally heard on soprano parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967385734|title=The supernatural voice : a history of high male singing|last=Simon|first=Ravens,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781843839620|location=|pages=71–89|oclc=967385734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]], the popularity of the countertenor voice waned and few compositions were written with that voice type in mind.

In the second half of the 20th century, there was great interest in and renewed popularity of the  countertenor voice, partly due to pioneers such as [[Alfred Deller]], as well as the increased popularity of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[opera]] and the need of male singers to replace the [[castrato|castrati]] roles in such works. Although the voice has been considered largely an [[early music]] phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire.&lt;ref name="Stark2003"&gt;Stark, James (2003), ''Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles1982"&gt;Giles, Peter (1982), ''The Countertenor.''

== History ==
=== Early centuries ===
In [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions of the 14th and early 15th centuries, the ''contratenor'' was a voice part added to the basic two-part contrapuntal texture of discant (''[[superius]]'') and [[tenor]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tenere'' which means to hold, since this part "held" the music's melody, while the ''superius'' [[descant]]ed upon it at a higher pitch). Though having approximately the same range as the tenor, it was generally of a much less melodic nature than either of these other two parts. With the introduction in about 1450 of four-part writing by composers such as [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]] and [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]], the ''contratenor'' split into ''contratenor altus'' and ''contratenor bassus'', which were respectively above and below the tenor.&lt;ref name="Giles1982" /&gt; Later the term became obsolete: in Italy, ''contratenor altus'' became simply ''altus'', in France, ''[[haute-contre]]'', and in England, countertenor. Though originally these words were used to designate a vocal part, they are now used to describe singers of that part, whose vocal techniques may differ (see below).&lt;ref name="Stark2003" /&gt;

In the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, St Paul's admonition ''"mulieres in ecclesiis taceant"'' ("let the women keep silence in the churches")&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|14:34|ASV}}&lt;/ref&gt; still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy [[Boy soprano|treble]]s or [[alto]]s. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). However, countertenors were never used for roles in early opera, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for [[castrato|castrati]]. For example, they took several roles in the first performance of [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607). Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles; the last soprano falsettist singing in Rome, Juan [Johannes de] San[c]tos (a Spaniard), died in 1652.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/~rsherr/frmst1.htm|title=SingerList|website=sophia.smith.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326004513/http://sophia.smith.edu/~rsherr/frmst1.htm|archivedate=26 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Italian opera]], by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated, while in France, the modal high tenor, called the ''haute-contre'',&lt;ref&gt;the nature of the ''haute-contre'' voice has been the subject of much debate, but it is now generally accepted that ''haute-contres'' sang in what voice scientists term "[[Modal voice|modal]]", perhaps using [[falsetto]] or ''[[falsettone]]'' for their highest notes (cf. Lionel Sawkins, "Haute-contre", in Sadie, Stanley (ed.), ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', II, pp.&amp;nbsp;668-69, Grove (Oxford University Press), New York, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-19-522186-2}}, and Mary Cyr, "On performing 18th-century Haute-Contre Roles", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', vol. 118, 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;291–5, later reproduced in Cyr, M., ''Essays on the Performance of Baroque Music. Opera and Chamber Music in France and England'', essay no. IX, Ashgate Variorum, Aldeshot (UK)/Burlington, Vermont (USA), 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5926-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; was established as the voice of choice for leading male roles.

In England [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]] wrote significant music for a higher male voice that he called a "counter-tenor", for example, the roles of Secrecy and Summer in ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692). "These lines have often challenged modern singers, who have been unsure whether they are high tenor parts or are meant for falsettists".&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;[[John Potter (musician)|Potter, J.]] (2009), ''Tenor, History of a voice'', Yale University Press, New Haven/London, p. 19 (included footnote 35). {{ISBN|978-0-300-11873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary vocal treatises, however, make clear that Purcell’s singers would have been trained to blend both methods of vocal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967385734|title=The supernatural voice : a history of high male singing|last=Simon|first=Ravens,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781843839620|location=|pages=130–138|oclc=967385734}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Purcell's choral music the situation is further complicated by the occasional appearance of more than one solo part designated "countertenor", but with a considerable difference in range and [[tessitura]]. Such is the case in ''[[Hail! Bright Cecilia|Hail, bright Cecilia]]'' (''The Ode on St Cecilia's Day 1692'') in which the solo, "'Tis Nature's Voice," has the range F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to B{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (similar to those stage roles cited previously), whereas, in the duet, "Hark each tree," the countertenor soloist sings from E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (in the trio "With that sublime celestial lay". Later in the same work, Purcell's own manuscript designates the same singer, Mr Howel, described as "a High Contra tenor" to perform in the range G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; it is very likely that he took some of the lowest notes in a well-blended "chest voice"&amp;nbsp;– see below).

=== 18th century ===
"The Purcell counter-tenor 'tenor' did not flourish in England much beyond the early years of the [eighteenth] century; within twenty years of Purcell's death [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] had settled in London and ''[[opera seria]]'', which was underpinned entirely by Italian singing, soon became entrenched in British theatres".&lt;ref name="Potter"/&gt; In parallel, by Handel's time, castrati had come to dominate the English operatic stage as much as that of Italy (and indeed most of Europe outside France). They also took part in several of Handel's oratorios, though countertenors, too, occasionally featured as soloists in the latter, the parts written for them being closer in compass to the higher ones of Purcell, with a usual range of A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Giles1982" /&gt; They also sang the alto parts in Handel's choruses. It was as choral singers within the Anglican church tradition (as well as in the secular genre of the [[Glee (music)|glee]]) that countertenors survived as performers throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Otherwise they largely faded from public notice.&lt;ref name="Stark2003" /&gt;

=== 20th century ===
The most visible person of the countertenor revival in the twentieth century was [[Alfred Deller]], an English singer and champion of authentic early music performance. Deller initially identified as an "alto", but his collaborator [[Michael Tippett]] recommended the archaic term "countertenor" to describe his voice.&lt;ref name="Giles1982" /&gt; In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the [[Deller Consort]], was important in increasing audiences' awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. [[Benjamin Britten]] wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten's ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'' (1973) was created by [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. [[Russell Oberlin]] was Deller's American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin's success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him.&lt;ref name="Giles2005"&gt;Giles, Peter (2005), ''A Basic Countertenor Method''&lt;/ref&gt; Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgrPBTRjMk|title=Russell Oberlin explica o que é um contratenor|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316010040/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgrPBTRjMk|archive-date=16 March 2016|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some [[Breeches role|trouser roles]] originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous and includes Orfeo in [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' and ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]'', and Bertarido in ''Rodelinda''.&lt;ref name="Stark2003" /&gt; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] also had castrati roles in his early operas, including Amintas in ''[[Il re pastore]]'' and Cecilio in ''[[Lucio Silla]]''.

Many modern composers other than Britten have written, and continue to write, countertenor parts, both in choral works and opera, as well as songs and song-cycles for the voice. Men's choral groups such as [[Chanticleer (ensemble)|Chanticleer]] and [[The King's Singers]] employ the voice to great effect in a variety of genres, including early music, gospel, and even folk songs. Other recent operatic parts written for the countertenor voice include Edgar in Aribert Reimann's ''[[Lear (opera)|Lear]]'' (1978), the messenger in his ''[[Medea (Reimann)|Medea]]'' (2010), the title role in [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]'' (1983), Claire in [[John Lunn]]'s ''The Maids'' (1998), the Refugee in [[Jonathan Dove]]'s ''[[Flight (opera)|Flight]]'' (1998), Trinculo in [[Thomas Adès]]'s ''[[The Tempest (opera)|The Tempest]]'' (2004), the Boy in [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]]'s ''[[Written on Skin]]'' (2012) and several others (see [[Countertenor#Roles in opera|Roles in opera]] below).

== Voice type ==

The [[vocal range]] of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female [[contralto]] or [[mezzo-soprano]] [[voice type]]s. A trained countertenor will typically have a vocal center similar in placement to that of a contralto or mezzo-soprano.&lt;ref name="Appelman1986"&gt;Appelman, D. Ralph (1986). ''The Science of Vocal Pedagogy: Theory and Application''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Giles (countertenor)|Peter Giles]], a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism.  In modern usage, the term "countertenor" is essentially equivalent to the medieval term ''contratenor altus'' (see above).  In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed.&lt;ref name="Giles2005" /&gt; The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;J.B. Steane, "Countertenor", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', cited, I, p. 999.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used.  In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a [[falsetto]] vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of "chest voice" (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes.  The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed.&lt;ref name="Giles2005" /&gt;

In response to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register "head voice."&lt;ref name="Giles2005" /&gt; Many voice experts{{who|date=November 2017}} would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation "head voice" for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production.  The latter type of head voice is, in terms of the vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to "chest voice" than to falsetto, since it uses the same "speaking voice" production (referred to as "modal" by voice scientists), and this is reflected in the timbre.&lt;ref name="Appelman1986" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
Particularly in the British choral tradition, the terms "male soprano" and "male alto" serve to identify men who rely on falsetto vocal production, rather than the [[modal voice]], to sing in the soprano or alto vocal range. Elsewhere, the terms have less universal currency. Some authorities do accept them as descriptive of male falsettists, although this view is subject to controversy;&lt;ref&gt;Ardran and Wulstan in their article "The Alto or Countertenor Voice" (''[[Music &amp; Letters]]'', vol. 48/1, January 1967) agree with the view of Giles noted below; others disagree strongly&amp;nbsp;– see, for example, [[Neal Zaslaw]]: "The enigma of the Haute-Contre" (''[[The Musical Times]]'', vol. 115, no. 1581 (November 1974), pp. 939-941); Mary Cyr: "On performing 18th-century haute-contre roles" (''The Musical Times'', vol. 118, April 1977); Simon Ravens: "A sweet shrill voice : The countertenor and vocal scoring in Tudor England" (''[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]'' 1998; XXVI: 123-136).&lt;/ref&gt; they would reserve the term "countertenor" for men who, like [[Russell Oberlin]], achieve a soprano range voice with little or no falsetto, equating it with ''haute-contre'' and the Italian ''tenor altino''.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, "liberal" in his use of the word countertenor, proposes this latter term for such voices&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to this view maintain that a countertenor will have unusually short vocal cords&lt;ref name="Stark2003" /&gt; and consequently a higher speaking voice and lower range and tessitura than their falsettist counterparts, perhaps from D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Operatic vocal classification, on the other hand, prefers the terms "countertenor" and "[[sopranist]]" to "male soprano" and "male alto," and some scholars consider the latter two terms inaccurate owing to physiological differences between male and female vocal production.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt; The only known man who can claim to be a true male soprano by that definition is [[Michael Maniaci]], whose modal voice falls in the soprano range, akin to a woman's, because his larynx did not develop fully in puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517072513/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Childerico,&lt;ref&gt;Questioned. According to Anthony Hicks the small [[soprano]] part of Childerico, which has no arias, was probably sung an octave lower by William Savage after his voice had just broken (''Faramondo'', in Sadie, II, 121).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Faramondo]]'', (Handel)

'''European dances''' refers to various dances originating in [[Europe]]. Since Medieval ages, European dances tend to be refined, as they are based on the court dances of aristocrats.

==History==
In [[ancient times]], European dances were performed as either sacred dances in religious ceremonies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = THE EVOLUTION OF SACRED DANCE IN THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TRADITION|last = LUERSSEN|first = JADE|publisher = Illinois Wesleyan University|year = 1967|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for popular entertainment.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] dance included religious worship, education, religious or civil ceremonies and festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brief Description of the Greek Dance|url = http://www.nostos.com/dance/|website = www.nostos.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One famous [[Greek dances|Greek dance]] is the [[dithyramb]], in honor of [[Dionysus]].

Originally [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had exclusively religious dances. As Rome gained dominance, including conquering Greece, more dance traditions were absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roman Dance|url = http://www.carnaval.com/italy/dance/roman_dance.htm|website = www.carnaval.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bacchanalia]] and [[Lupercalia]] festivals highlight the importance of dance in Rome.

Under [[Christianity]], dance fell under the control and condemnation of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The History of Dance in the Church|url = http://www.refinedundignified.com/the-history-of-dance-in-the-church.html|website = RU|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records of [[Medieval dance]] are fragmented and limited, but a noteworthy dance reference from the medieval period is the allegory of the [[Danse Macabre]].

During the [[Renaissance]], [[Renaissance dance|dance]] became more diverse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://danzasdelmundo.wordpress.com/historia/ "Historia", DanzasDelMundo.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Country dances, performed for pleasure, became distinct from court dances, which had ceremonial and political functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Western Social Dance|url = https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/diessay3.html|website = memory.loc.gov|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, from a modified [[ländler]], the [[waltz]] was introduced in all the European courts. Thus, group dance gives way to couples dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ÁNGEL ZAMORA  "Danzas del Mundo" Publisher= CCSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century Queen of France [[Catherine de' Medici]] promoted and popularized dance in France. Catherine helped develop the ''[[Ballets de cour|ballet de cour]].'' The production of the ''Ballet Comique de la Reine'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ballet comique de la reine {{!}} dance by Beaujoyeulx|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Ballet-comique-de-la-reine|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the French [[minuet]], characterized by its bows, courtesies and gallant gestures, permeated the European cultural landscape.

==National traditions==
===Germany===
Germany does not have an official national dance, but recognized dance styles include:&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.germany101.com/page/german-dance German Dance]" www.germany101.com/page/german-dance. Retrieved 2016-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ländler]]: A dance for couples showing fierceness and trampling. Sometimes it is purely instrumental and sometimes is accompanied by vocal arrangements including [[yodeling]]. When ballroom dancing became popular in Europe in the 19th century, [[Ländler]] became faster and more elegant and men took the nails off of the boots they danced with. It is believed to be the forerunner of the [[waltz]].
*[[Polka]]: A popular dance appeared in Bohemia in 1830.

'''''Extreme Ghostbusters''''' is an American animated television series and a follow-up to the animated series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]''. It is a part of the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. The series originally aired in late [[1997 in television|1997]], and features a team of younger college-level Ghostbusters who are led by veteran Ghostbuster [[Egon Spengler]]. In some TV listings, the show was called ''Ghostbusters Dark''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete [[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] Guide to Ghostbusters'' (2014), "Extreme Makeover" (pg 190)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set years after the end of ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', lack of supernatural activity has put the Ghostbusters out of business. Each member has gone their separate way, except for Dr. Egon Spengler, who still lives in the firehouse to monitor the containment unit, take care of [[Ghostbusters (franchise)#Slimer|Slimer]], further his studies and teach a class on the paranormal at a local college. When ghosts start to reappear, Egon is forced to recruit his lone four students as the new Ghostbusters. These are Kylie Griffin, a [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl [[genius]] and expert on the [[occultism|occult]]; Eduardo Rivera, a cynical [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] slacker; Garrett Miller, a young [[European Americans|white]] [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] [[Sportsperson|athlete]] who uses a wheelchair; and Roland Jackson, a studious [[African-American]] machinery whiz. Filling the cast are [[Janine Melnitz]], the Ghostbusters' previous secretary who returns to the job, and Slimer, a hungry ghost.

The series follows the adventures of this "Next Generation" of Ghostbusters tracking down and capturing ghosts all over New York and occasionally beyond the city. The series is styled as a supernatural comedy, following the trend set by its [[The Real Ghostbusters|predecessor]], but given an updated and darker feel. This is reflected by the use of a gritty, [[Rock music|rock]]/[[punk rock|punk]]-inspired variation of [[Ray Parker, Jr.]]'s song "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" as the opening theme written by [[Jim Latham]] and performed by voice actor [[Jim Cummings]]. Recurring themes throughout the series are the new team learning to work together despite their differences, Janine's largely unrequited affection for Egon, the [[love-hate relationship]] between Kylie and Eduardo that is never resolved, and the Ghostbusters' frequent clashes with authority figures who disbelieve their work.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}
[[File:Extreme-Ghostbusters-Cast-1.png|256px|thumb|right|From left to right in front: Garrett Miller, Kylie Griffin, Eduardo Rivera, and Roland Jackson.]]
*[[Egon Spengler]] (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) – The only original Ghostbuster to become a regular in this spin-off series, Egon takes on the role of [[mentor]] for the new team of Ghostbusters. He still lives in the fire house with Slimer, enabling the building to become the Ghostbusters headquarters when paranormal activity starts again. Before the first ghost escaped, Egon was teaching classes on the paranormal at New York City College – four people taking his class was ''double'' the usual. He usually leaves the field work to the new members, opting to provide audio back-up from the fire house and information on their current adversary, but has joined them in action when he feels the crisis requires his presence. Other than ghosts, he also has an interest in [[mold]] and started to grow cultures in Eduardo's bathtub when the two roomed together. He continues to have romantic tension with Janine. The official website gave his age as 41&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/profiles/egon.html|title=ExtremeGhostbusters.com – Egon|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023202111/http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/profiles/egon.html|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in "The Sphinx", he suffered a mid-life crisis and tried to prove he could physically still cut it.
*[[Janine Melnitz]] (voiced by [[Pat Musick]]) – The Ghostbusters' original receptionist returns to the role after she is reunited with Egon by taking his Paranormal 101 class at New York City College. Like Egon, she watches over the new team, and on occasion contributes an active part in ghostbusting. According to Egon, she also functions as the team's accountant and collector. She also shows off obvious signs of attraction to Egon, but he is completely oblivious to this, which only frustrates her. The official website said "she's spent the last decade flitting from job to job... trying not to pine for Prof. Spengler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/profiles/janine.html|title=Extreme Ghostbusters – Janine|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024081150/http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/profiles/janine.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{vanchor|Eduardo Rivera}} (voiced by [[Rino Romano]]) – Seemingly a lazy, sarcastic and somewhat clueless character, Eduardo nevertheless makes himself an integral part of the team by being determined and reliable. Eduardo, along with Garret, resembles original Ghostbuster [[Peter Venkman]] in that, like Venkman, Eduardo is sarcastic, has a penchant for pursuing attractive women, and is generally unscientific and constantly spouts pop culture references. He also reads "J.N. Kline" young-adult horror novels. Eduardo has a long-running subplot dealing with a love/hate relationship between him and Kylie, although it is very much revealed "In Your Dreams" that he has intimate feelings and dreams about her. These feelings are further enforced in that he is usually the one to rescue Kylie from dangerous situations, and vice versa, in several episodes. He once said to Kylie herself that nothing was going to happen to her "while [he's] around". In fact, in the episode "Darkness at Noon" he outright admitted to Kylie, who was possessed by a ghost at the time, that he felt an attraction of sorts when he saw her for the first time and even showed the intention of kissing her when Kylie asked him to. In "The Unseen" he takes the rap for Kylie's mistake, not wanting "the worst day of her life to get any worse". In "Rage", Eduardo reveals to have an older brother, Carlos "Carl" Rivera, an NYPD officer who is angry with Eduardo for not being a police officer like the rest of their family, and thinks the Ghostbuster are a scam, which is why Eduardo kept his job a secret. In the same episode it is also implied that his father is dead (or at least retired) as he and Carlos refer to him in the past tense during a heated argument. In "Fear Itself", it's revealed that Eduardo has a [[fear of death]] (specifically his own). He has a vicious rivalry with Slimer, but has ended up working with the ghost, and volunteered to save him in "Slimer's Sacrifice". He also has an on the surface rivalry with Garrett with the two often mocking each other and attempting to one up the other. In spite of this as the series goes on the two seem to have the closest thing to a friendship even though Garrett's enthusiastic personality completely contrasts Eduardo's cynical attitude. (The official website claimed he slacks off due to fear of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/profiles/eduardo.html|title=Extreme Ghostbusters.com – Eduardo|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024081140/http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/profiles/eduardo.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Despite all his cynicism and slacking he demonstrates a reasonably high level of intelligence as in the episode "Eyes of a Dragon" he states how the proton aspect of light works to Kylie and later on how to defeat the ghost of that episode. Eduardo was also the one to smash a cursed orb, causing the eye-stealing ghost to disintegrate in the episode "The Unseen" and also continued the incantation that destroyed the demon of an alternate dimension in which he, Roland and Kylie were imprisoned in the episode "Casting the Runes". Eduardo has also exhibited bouts of jealousy whenever Kylie seemingly flirts with other men and in "Till Death Do Us Start" he showed signs of sheepish nervousness when asked if he and Kylie were together.
*{{vanchor|Kylie Griffin}} (voiced by [[Tara Strong|Tara Charendoff]]) – The only member of the new team to have any sort of paranormal knowledge (much like Egon) before signing up as a Ghostbuster, after her friend Jack was a victim of the Grundel. Kylie is in awe of Egon when the series began, but this soon shifts to a more equal footing, and becomes somewhat of the unofficial leader in the field, after Egon. Kylie's calm exterior often sets her as a foil against Eduardo's brashness, as part of the ongoing love/hate dynamic between the two. Although she has never admitted it, she often seemed to appreciate Eduardo's feeling towards her, such as giving a thankful smile on the occasions when he saves her life and vice versa. She is also the one who most commonly wields the Ghost Traps. She is depicted as something of a "Goth" girl, judging by the black hair and lipstick. In the episode "Grease", it is revealed that her parents divorced and she currently lives alone with her cat; she was highly close to her grandmother Rose, who died a year before the show started, and both her interest in the paranormal &amp; Gothic styling are implied to be related to her grandmother's death. In "Fear Itself", it's revealed that Kylie is afraid of maggots as she finds them creepy, and in "Heart of Darkness" it is revealed she used to be "Cheerleader of the Year" when she was in the 8th Grade of her junior high school (something she finds mortifying). There is a running gag where she often replies with the sentence, "I'm not a...", followed by what has happened. It is also hinted throughout the series that she's attracted to older, intelligent men. Kylie Griffin also appears in the ''[[Ghostbusters (comics)#IDW Publishing|Ghostbusters]]'' comic books published by [[IDW Publishing]]. In the comics, she originally only appeared in cameo roles as a worker in [[Ray Stantz]]'s occult book shop before being made a Ghostbuster in issues starting in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/11/15/new-ghostbusters-ongoing-extreme/ |title='Ghostbusters' Gets New Recruits This February In IDW's Ongoing Series – ComicsAlliance &amp;#124; Comic book culture, news, humor, commentary, and reviews |publisher=ComicsAlliance |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119044037/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/11/15/new-ghostbusters-ongoing-extreme |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{vanchor|Roland Jackson}} (voiced by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]) – The mechanic of the group. Roland is the most level-headed and mechanically-gifted of the new Ghostbusters, helping Egon repair and improve the Proton Packs and Ecto-1; his reason for joining Egon's class was seeing the Ecto-1 at an auto show. Roland approaches the paranormal from a practical point-of-view, and in the episode "Fear Itself" reveals that his only fear is the dangerous breakdown of his equipment. In "The Infernal Machine", he became disgruntled that his technological efforts were being taken for granted. Roland's strongest wish is to get into the [[Ivy League]] and become a doctor. He's a very staid, square personality, slow to anger, though he came close to striking one of the racists in "The True Face of the Monster"; it's implied he's had to deal with racist attitudes before. Roland has twice come under the mental control of villains, the Siren in "Sonic Youth" and Luko in "The Infernal Machine". "Grease" reveals Roland is the oldest in a lower-middle-class family and volunteers for the Little League and helps the homeless; in "Grundelesque" we meet his very mischievous younger brother whom Roland (at first) refuses to believe is a troublemaker. Like Winston, Roland is the only African American member of the team, yet he has a talent with machines like Ray.
*{{vanchor|Garrett Miller}} (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) – Despite being a lifelong wheelchair user, Garret has a very 'jock'-like attitude and is a huge fan of extreme sports and attempting mad stunts. In the episode "Grease", it's revealed that Garrett was born with the inability to walk and studying to be a physical therapist, and throughout the series he only refers to his condition to mock it (and in "Be Careful What You Wish For", uses it as an excuse to dump some work on Eduardo). He is the most headstrong and enthusiastic of the new Ghostbusters, often claiming that he's in it only for the adrenaline rush; he was left bitterly disappointed in "Ghost Apocalyptic Future" to learn he was the only Ghostbuster ''not'' remembered in the future dystopia. While he studies to be a physical therapist to help other disabled people, his secret dream is to be an NBA star. In "Fear Itself", it's revealed that Garrett is [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] (though he never admits it to anyone), and has a deep disdain towards the [[FBI]] ever since the incident where two agents arrested them under the belief they were causing the sabotages and released a [[gremlin]] they recently captured while they were on a plane. He has a rivalry with Eduardo, the two of them constantly bantering and trying to one-up each other. In "Deadliners", we find out Garrett wrote a (bad) horror story starring himself (the other Ghostbusters died on the first page, to their annoyance). Like Ray, Garrett is the most enthusiastic. Garrett is the only Ghostbuster in the history of the franchise never to be made as a toy (all other Ghostbusters received at least two toys, including Louis and Janine), presumably due to the implausibility of having the wheelchair as a separate assembling piece. Though a prototype figure was made. Bob Higgins has said that during a focus group of young children, the creators found Garrett was the most popular character: "when we asked... which of these characters would you want to be and they all wanted to be Garrett, they all wanted to be the guy that does the crazy things. They all wanted to be the guy that was the leader and they all kind of saw him as the leader of this group [even though he wasn't]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/ghostbusters_story.html |title=ABILITY Magazine |publisher=ABILITY Magazine |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Slimer]] (voiced by [[Billy West]]) – Slimer remains the most unchanged of all the characters in terms of personality. However, he is given a less cartoony look to fit in with the series' overall style. In "Fear Itself", it's revealed that Slimer is afraid of broccoli (which is ironic, as he has been shown to eat anything). Slimer is very well-meaning, but is often pushed around by the Ghostbusters as he gets in their way and eats continually. His actions often affect the story, usually adversely, though he often acts to fix his mistakes and on a number of occasions has been shown to have a heroic nature and that he can wield a proton pack.&lt;ref&gt;Extreme Ghostbusters episode 19 Bird of Prey"&lt;/ref&gt; He's got a strong rivalry with Eduardo, similar to the one he had with Peter Venkman, though several episodes show that Eduardo – and the other Ghostbusters – do care for him as much as he annoys them.&lt;ref&gt;Extreme Ghostbusters episode 23 Slimer's Sacrifice&lt;/ref&gt; He's been living with Egon for over a decade now, and the two are closer than in the original series; when trying to get Egon to discipline the ghost in "Glutton for Punishment", Janine says she knows the two have been through a lot together, and in "Slimer's Sacrifice" Egon immediately suits up to enter the Containment Unit to rescue him, but after he is attacked by the ghost, Eduardo goes in to save Slimer.

==Production==
Showrunner Bob Higgins told ''Ability Magazine'' that the decision to create a new ''Ghostbusters'' was taken by the studio, which hoped to reinvigorate a lucrative franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/ghostbusters_story.html |title=ABILITY Magazine "Extreme Ghostbusters" |publisher=Abilitymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally announced as ''Super Ghostbusters'' in 1996, the initial press release had Janine, teaching history at a local college, bringing together a new team with "a hip new attitude" to face a new plague of ghosts; "short on time and more than a little desperate, Janine turns to four of her teenaged students". (Egon would be "huddled in front of a computer screen, battling program bugs instead of spooks".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theraffon.net/~spookcentral/egb_original.htm|title=Spook Central: "Extreme Ghostbusters – The Original Version"|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's creators decided "what we wanted to do was really put together a team of misfits in a way, people that you would not necessarily associate with being superheroes on television": hence Eduardo as a slacker, Roland as a "square", and Kylie as moody and sarcastic, with Garrett as the balance, "an adrenaline junkie... who could kind of kick start the team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/ghostbusters_story.html |title=ABILITY Magazine "Extreme Ghostbusters" |publisher=Abilitymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fil Barlow]], the designer, was given rough outlines and originally designed all the characters bar Eduardo as girls (Garrett as Lucy and Roland as Julia), with Egon originally designed as bearded and robed. This aspect would be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete [[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] Guide to Ghostbusters'' (2014), "Extreme Makeover" (pg 119)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow's DeviantArt section: [http://filbarlow.deviantart.com/art/XGB-Early-Concept-Female-Characters-367108793 XGB: Early Concept ~ Female Characters], [http://filbarlow.deviantart.com/art/XGB-Early-Concept-Julia-367189053 XGB: Early Concept ~ Julia]&lt;/ref&gt; (Barlow pitched "Egon as an ambassador to the ghost realm trying to stop an impending war on the other side")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filbarlow.deviantart.com/art/Egon-Conceptual-Design-XGB-287969364|title=Egon: Conceptual Design XGB|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During production, Lucy/Garrett was found to be quite bland and annoying until producer [[Jeff Kline]] suggested putting the character in a wheelchair; Higgins stated this made Garrett more interesting to write, as he was now "one of these guys that takes what he is given and makes the best of it and really lives up to any potential that he has". When designed as Lucy, she was given proton-blasting callipers and crutches but producer Richard Raynis requested the wheelchair instead. (Barlow attempted to show a female character could "be fearless and gung ho" but Raynis requested the gender change) The show ended up winning an award from the Los Angeles Commission on Disabilities for its work on Garrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filbarlow.deviantart.com/art/XGB-Early-Concept-Lucy-Part-1-364823229|title=DeviantArt: "XGB: Early Concept ~ Lucy ~ Part 1 by filbarlow"|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filbarlow.deviantart.com/art/XGB-Early-Concept-Lucy-Part-2-364827780|title=Lucy – Part 2|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/ghostbusters_story.html |title=ABILITY Magazine "Extreme Ghostbusters" |publisher=Abilitymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various elements would be changed before airing: Egon would replace Janine as the teacher, Slimer lost a goblin sidekick called Gnat, and Garrett was originally "Lucas". Roland was originally a clumsy "gentle giant", Eduardo had a dream of running in the Olympics, and Lucas had a hair-trigger temper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theraffon.net/~spookcentral/egb_original.htm|title=Spook Central: "Extreme Ghostbusters – The Original Version"|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some of these still made it to the character profiles on the EGB website)

The team that helmed ''Extreme Ghostbusters'' consisted of many producers and writers that had done work on ''The Real Ghostbusters'', including [[Richard Raynis]]. As a result, the show was made as an explicit sequel to ''Real''. This made the show one of the few direct sequels to a 1980s cartoon series — other franchises, such as ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' and  ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', opted for series relaunches — and as such opted for a more realistic passage of time. [[Maurice LaMarche]] was brought back to play Egon Spengler — though [[Frank Welker]] and Laura Summer did not return to play Slimer and Janine, respectively. The series would start to have more explicit tie-ins to ''Real'' as it went on — "Slimer's Sacrifice" referenced Egon entering the Containment Unit in an episode of ''Real Ghostbusters: Xmas Marks the Spot''; "Grundelesque," was a direct sequel to ''Real Ghostbusters'' episode "The Grundel", bringing back the eponymous villain and revealing Kylie lost a friend during its first attack. Finally and notably was the two-part finale "Back in the Saddle", which featured the remaining original Ghostbusters returning and teaming up with their successors — with [[Dave Coulier]] (the second voice of [[Peter Venkman]]), [[Buster Jones]] (the second voice of [[Winston Zeddemore]]), and Frank Welker (the voice of [[Ray Stantz]]) all reprising their roles.

==Merchandise==
The cartoon series generated a line of [[action figure]]s released by [[Trendmasters]]. The line included Roland, Eduardo, Kylie, and several ghosts, as well as an updated version of Egon Spengler, and the Ecto-1; Garrett did not have a figure released, although collectors have found a prototype figure. Also released was a role playing Proton Pack and Ghost Trap.

===Home video===
In 1999, three [[VHS]] volumes of the show were released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Video]], all of which are now out of print. These videotapes were available to purchase separately or as a packaged boxed set containing all three volumes. The episodes included on the VHS volumes were:

* ''Volume 1'': "Darkness at Noon, Part 1", "Darkness at Noon, Part 2"
* ''Volume 2'': "The Infernal Machine", "Grundelesque"
* ''Volume 3'': "Back in the Saddle, Part 1", "Back in the Saddle, Part 2"

A two disc DVD set of the series was released in Australia on June 2, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/801585 |title=Extreme Ghostbusters – Volume 1 (2 Disc Set) |publisher=Ezydvd.com.au |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311083942/http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/801585 |archivedate=2010-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the UK on June 15 the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003YCKLKA |title=Extreme Ghostbusters [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: Maurice LaMarche, Jason Marsden, Pat Musick, Alfonso Ribeiro, Rino Romano, Tara Strong, Susan Tyrrell, Billy West, David Prince, Gary Anthony Sturgis, Alan Caldwell, Chris Berkeley, CategoryCultFilms, CategoryKidsandFamily, CategoryMiniSeries, CategoryUSA, Extreme Ghostbusters – Season 1 (Vol. 1) – 2-DVD Set ( Extreme Ghostbusters – Season One – Volume On, Extreme Ghostbusters – Season 1 (Vol. 1) – 2-DVD Set, Extreme Ghostbusters – Season One – Volume One, Extreme Ghost busters – 13 Episodes: Film &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Germany, Italy and The Netherlands, all containing the first thirteen episodes of the series, with the UK releases being slightly edited.

There is currently no plan to release the series on DVD in the United States.

The first series was re-released in the UK on the 27th of June 2016.

===Video games===
Three [[video game]]s based on the series were also created, ''[[Ghostbusters video games#Extreme Ghostbusters|Extreme Ghostbusters]]'' for the [[Game Boy Color]], ''[[Ghostbusters video games#Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1|Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]] and ''[[Ghostbusters video games#Extreme Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Invasion|Extreme Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Invasion]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. There are also two PC games: [[Extreme Ghostbusters: Zap The Ghosts!]] and [[Extreme Ghostbusters Creativity Centre]].

==Website==

The original website (still available online) contained a Flash tour of the Firehouse, character profiles, descriptions of the ghosts fought, and a Flash game. Some of the character details in the profiles had never made it into an episode.

The "Spengler's Spirit Guide" section contained journal entries by "Egon" himself, about haunted areas and the how-to of ghostbusting. Two of the entries, The Bermuda Triangle and The Jersey Devil, were topics that showed up in episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/journals/index.html|title=Extreme Ghostbusters.com: Spengler's Spirit Guide|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024162602/http://www.extremeghostbusters.org/journals/index.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
In a retrospective of the show, ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' referred to the "consensus that any extension of the ''Ghostbusters'' brand requires a whole new team of newbies to take on the mantle" and that ''Extreme Ghostbusters'' was the first time it was put into practice. The failure of the show, blamed by the showrunners on poor US scheduling and the decline of non-[[E/I|educational]] children's syndication in favor of carriage on networks such as [[Fox Kids]] and [[Kids' WB]] and cable channels ("broadcast mid-morning in a slot only suitable for pre-schools," though some American stations still did carry the show between 3:00pm and 5:00pm in the afterschool period), was seen by ''SFX'' as showing "the appeal of Ghostbusters was only partially the concept... that it's the characters we love above all must be a sobering thought for anyone charged with rebooting ''Ghostbusters'' again." The show was also noted for being aimed at "a slightly more adolescent audience with a tougher edge", "clearly intended to test the boundaries of child-friendly horror" and the Eduardo/Kylie relationship pushed the edges of the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete SFX Guide to Ghostbusters'' (2014), "Extreme Makeover" (pg 118–22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Kylie Griffin appeared in the IDW comics in the 2010s.

It was released in Japan and North America in 2003, and in Europe and Australia in 2004.

The game is a prequel to ''The Binding Blade'', set on the continent of Elibe. It tells the story of Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector, three young lords of the Lycian lineage who journey to find Eliwood's father and later thwart a larger conspiracy threatening the stability of Elibe. The gameplay, which draws from earlier ''Fire Emblem'' entries, features tactical combat between armies on a grid-based map. Characters are assigned different character classes that affect abilities and are subjected to [[permanent death]] if defeated in battle.

Development began in 2002 as a companion title to ''The Binding Blade'', but development was prolonged from its initial seven-month window as new features were added. While the ''Fire Emblem'' series had remained exclusive to Japan due to concerns about its difficulty, the success of ''[[Advance Wars]]'' and popular demand following the inclusion of ''Fire Emblem'' characters in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' prompted the game's localization. The game was released to positive sales and international critical acclaim, establishing the ''Fire Emblem'' series in the West. Its overseas success fueled the development of ''[[Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance]]'' for the [[GameCube]] [[home console]].

==Gameplay==

''Fire Emblem'' is a [[tactical role-playing game]] where players take the role of story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes the role of an unseen tactician directing the player army.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn02.nintendo-europe.com/media/downloads/games_8/emanuals/game_boy_advance_8/Manual_GameBoyAdvance_Fire_Emblem_EN_DE_FR.pdf|title=Fire Emblem European manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2004|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's various Arenas or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpyReview"/&gt;

Battles in the story take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based system]] where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as [[fog of war]] or elements of the environment that can be manipulated to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Units are split between player, enemy and allied [[non-player character]] (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; it can also be regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;

Each unit is governed by a [[character class]] system, with their class affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains [[experience point]]s (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; If a unit is defeated in battle, they are subject to [[permanent death]], being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;

Weapon strengths and weaknesses are governed by the series' Weapons Triangle system; axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Bows are independent of the system, being effective against airborne units. A similar system, dubbed the Magic Trinity in-game, governs how different types of spells react; elemental magic is strong against light, light against dark and dark against elemental.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; The strength of weapon types assigned to a particular unit is raised through usage, with its rank ranging from E to S, with S being the highest possible affinity with a promoted character. Characters also have a Support system, where talking both in battle and outside during rest periods strengthens two characters' relationship, and consequently provides stat boosts. The higher the Support rank, which ranges from "C" to "A", the better the boons.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;

Outside the main campaign, players can battle against the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) in the Link Arena: after building a team, the player fights a battle against their own units controlled by the game AI. ''Fire Emblem'' also features a Link Arena multiplayer option in which up to four players can link up and do battle with teams of characters from the single-player save file. Players choose up to five characters and equip them like in the main story. During battle, each player takes turns to attack with one character. Weapons selected automatically for each battle Victory is determined either by surviving a period of time or aggregating the highest number of points.&lt;ref name="FEmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Fe7char.jpg|thumb|Several characters from the game; left to right, Eliwood, Sain, Dorcas, Lyn, Rebecca, Hector, and Serra]]
The events of ''Fire Emblem'' take place on the fictional continent of Elibe, twenty years before the events of ''[[Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade]]'': in ancient times, humans and dragons coexisted, but humans turned against and banished the dragons in a conflict called "The Scouring". The player adopts the perspective of a tactician who is found by a girl named Lyn. Lyn discovers that she is the granddaughter of the marquess of Caelin, Hausen. She recruits companions in a quest to prevent Lundgren, her great uncle, from ascending the Caelin throne. Lundgren had wanted to gain power by poisoning the current marquess; he also sent soldiers out to destroy Lyn and any knowledge of her as she is higher in the line of succession. Lyn eventually defeats Lundgren and reunites with her grandfather.

The following chapters revolve around the Lycian lords Eliwood, Hector and their party, which the tactician, (and eventually Lyn) joins. The group are hunting down an antagonistic faction known as the Black Fang, a group of assassins based in Bern. The Black Fang, manipulated by a mysterious figure named Nergal, are attempting to provoke a full-scale war in Elibe, providing Nergal with an enormous amount of "quintessence", or life-force from fallen warriors. Nergal creates his morphs, artificial beings with jet-black hair and golden eyes, to remotely control the Black Fang, and to obtain the quintessence for him. The Black Fang engage Eliwood's interest by capturing his father Lord Elbert, and by inciting rebellion in Lycia. The protagonists' ultimate goal is to prevent Nergal from using their companions Ninian's and Nils' quintessence to open the Dragons' Gate, a portal where dragons reside, and thus ignite Elibe in conflict. As Eliwood and the party hunt the Black Fang down, they eliminate crucial figures of the Black Fang, as well as gaining allies and protecting Bern's royal prince Zephiel (a younger version of the main antagonist from ''The Binding Blade''). The game ends when Eliwood and the party slay Nergal and the dragon that had been summoned via Nergal's quintessence. Eliwood becomes marquess of Pherae, and Hector inherits his brother's title as marquess of Ostia. A secret ending shows an older Eliwood and Hector introducing their respective children [[Roy]] and Lilina to each other, while a grown-up Zephiel, now the king of Bern, is being confronted by a robed man who accuses him of awakening the Demon Dragon.

==Development==
''Fire Emblem'', known in Japan as ''Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken'', was created by series developer [[Intelligent Systems]]. Toru Narihiro and Takehiro Izushi from Intelligent Systems acted as producers, and Hitoshi Yamagami from [[Nintendo]] supervised, and Taeko Kaneda and Kentarou Nishimura directed.&lt;ref name="FERekkaInterview1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FERekkaInterview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEgbaCredits"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Fire Emblem|developer=[[Intelligent Systems]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2003-11-03|platform=[[Game Boy Advance]]|scene=Credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was written by Ken Yokoyama and Kouhei Maeda.&lt;ref name="FEgbaCredits"/&gt; Character designs were done by Sachiko Wada, who would reprise her role for ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones]]''.&lt;ref name="GuideInterviews"/&gt; A second artist on the project was Ryo Hirata, who had previously done illustration work for [[Production I.G]] and would go on to work on ''The Sacred Stones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/71_/s08_/001128.html|title=Interview with Ren Ishimori and Ryo Hirata (2)|publisher=[[Production I.G]]|accessdate=2016-06-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401184352/http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/71_/s08_/001128.html|archivedate=2012-04-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiji Kaneda, who worked on ''The Binding Blade'', did uncredited illustration work.

Development of ''Fire Emblem'' began in 2002 after the release of ''The Binding Blade''. Intended as a companion title built upon the foundation of ''The Binding Blade'', development time was initially estimated at seven months.&lt;ref name="FErekkaDream"/&gt; The storyline was built around three main characters and their strengths in battle; the central character Eliwood was made fairly weak to fit the concept of an "easy" mode for new players, while the other two characters provided both a steeper gameplay challenge and altered story segments.&lt;ref name="FERekkaInterview1"/&gt; As with ''The Binding Blade'', the titular "Fire Emblem" is represented as a family crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:任天堂公式ガイドブック　20th Anniversary 『ファイアーエムブレム大全』が発売中です|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|chapter=World Guide|isbn=4-09-106467-1|date=2010-06-30|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay, initially identical to ''The Binding Blade'', underwent multiple changes including expansions on the role of the player in the storyline through the unseen strategist character, and the added tutorial stages that helped introduce the mechanics to new players.&lt;ref name="FERekkaInterview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0305/22/|script-title=ja:『ファイアーエムブレム　烈火の剣』開発者インタビュー|publisher=''Nintendo Online Magazine''|language=Japanese|date=2003|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828082616/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0305/22/|archivedate=2007-08-28|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FERekkaInterview2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1101.com/nintendo/fire_emblem/|script-title=ja:『ファイアーエムブレム』を噛み砕け！|publisher=[[Hobonichi]]|language=Japanese|date=2003-05-09|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105182700/http://www.1101.com/nintendo/fire_emblem/|archivedate=2006-01-05|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FErekkaDream"/&gt; It was also the first entry in the ''Fire Emblem'' series to introduce multiplayer functionality.&lt;ref name="FElist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/3DS/Fire+Emblem%3A+Awakening/feature.asp?c=50134|title=Pocket Primer: A complete history of Fire Emblem|author=Brown, Mark|publisher=Pocket Gamer|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2016-06-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190328/http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/3DS/Fire+Emblem%3A+Awakening/feature.asp?c=50134|archivedate=2016-03-04|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the multiple extra features, development overran substantially, ultimately lasting over a year.&lt;ref name="FErekkaDream"&gt;{{cite journal | date=2003-05-21 | script-title=ja:ファイアーエムブレム 烈火の剣| journal=Nintendo Dream| issue=89| publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]] | language=Japanese}} [http://god-bird.net/research/feinterview.html Info]&lt;/ref&gt; The tutorial was included because the game's steep difficulty was proving off-putting to new players; this inclusion was part of a move to make ''Fire Emblem'' a major series for Nintendo.&lt;ref name="FERekkaInterview2"/&gt;

==Release==
''Fire Emblem'' was first announced in early 2003. It was the second title in the ''Fire Emblem'' series to have been developed for the [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2003/020203b.html|title=Yet Another Fire Emblem Game Coming to GBA|author=Stone, Cortney|publisher=RPGamer|date=2003|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404060341/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2003/020203b.html|archivedate=2015-04-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on April 25, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2003/4/25/a6c732de7936009913954e0a9aaeb596.html|script-title=ja:本日発売『ファイアーエムブレム』で使用できるレアアイテムをゲットしよう！|publisher=''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]''|language=Japanese|date=2003-04-25|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117174611/http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2003/4/25/a6c732de7936009913954e0a9aaeb596.html|archivedate=2016-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also compatible with the newly released [[Game Boy Advance SP]], an upgraded version of the GBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20030205/nintendo.htm|script-title=ja:任天堂がゲームボーイアドバンスSPの体験会を開催2003年度中には全世界で2,000万台の販売を視野に|publisher=Game Watch Impress|language=Japanese|date=2003-02-05|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628163033/http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20030205/nintendo.htm|archivedate=2013-06-28|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2017, the game's Japanese subtitle was translated as ''The Sword of Flame''.&lt;ref name="Shueisha"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:ファイアーエムブレムキャラクターズ　封印の剣＆烈火の剣 |language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=4-08-782076-9|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/fe/fe_museum/rekka/gallery/index.html|script-title=ja:Fire Emblem Museum - Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken - Art Gallery|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817003002/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/fe/fe_museum/rekka/gallery/index.html|archivedate=2016-08-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the subtitle was officially translated by Nintendo as ''The Blazing Blade''.&lt;ref name="NinOfficial"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Emblem Heroes|url=https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2017-01-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118235623/https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/|archivedate=2017-01-18|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was later released on the [[Virtual Console]] for [[Wii U]] on May 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000006806|script-title=ja:バーチャルコンソールWii U - ファイアーエムブレム　烈火の剣|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401010650/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000006806|archivedate=2016-04-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localization===
The concept of localizing a ''Fire Emblem'' game in the West had been around for some time, but the combined elements of extensive use of text and a view that tactical RPGs would meet with low sales overseas had kept the series exclusive to Japan since its inception.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/50069/features/the-making-of-fire-emblem-awakening/|title=The making of Fire Emblem Awakening|author=East, Thomas|publisher=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2016-03-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611034646/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/50069/features/the-making-of-fire-emblem-awakening/|archivedate=2013-06-11|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GIarticle"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Classic GI – Fire Emblem|journal=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|issue=277|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-advance-wars|title=The Making Of: Advance Wars|publisher=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''|page=2|date=2010-04-26|accessdate=2016-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124130706/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-advance-wars|archivedate=2012-01-24|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major factor was the appearance of Roy from ''The Binding Blade'' and [[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]] from the [[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|first ''Fire Emblem'']] in the 2001 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''.&lt;ref name="FEhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/48555/features/fire-emblem-through-the-ages/|title=Fire Emblem through the ages|author=East, Thomas|publisher=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''|page=7|date=2013-04-13|accessdate=2015-07-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416201524/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/48555/features/fire-emblem-through-the-ages/|archivedate=2013-04-16|deadurl=yes}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20141010141757/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/48555/features/fire-emblem-through-the-ages/?page=7 Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The director of ''Melee'', [[Masahiro Sakurai]], had wanted to include Marth since the [[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|original ''Super Smash Bros.'']], and included him as part of a push for more sword-wielding characters. Gameplay-wise, Roy was included to act as a clone of Marth. There were difficulties including both Marth and Roy as the ''Fire Emblem'' series had not seen an overseas release at that point. Sakurai, with support from Nintendo of America, managed to keep both Marth and Roy in the game.&lt;ref name="GuideInterviews"/&gt; The growing base of tactical role-playing games including ''Advance Wars'', in addition to the interest garnered by the appearance of Roy and Marth in ''Melee'', meant that Nintendo were more willing to bring ''Fire Emblem'' overseas.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIarticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeInfo"/&gt; Speaking in a later interview, localization producer Tim O'Leary said that localizing the title was more difficult than its successor ''The Sacred Stones'', but was smaller in scale than ''[[Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/09/28/fire-emblem-interview-and-videos|title=Fire Emblem Interview and Videos|author=Casamassina, Matt|page=2|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2005-09-28|accessdate=2015-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226060721/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/28/fire-emblem-interview-and-videos|archivedate=2012-12-26|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fire Emblem'' met with generally positive reviews from critics. On aggregate site [[Metacritic]], ''Fire Emblem'' garnered a score of 88/100 based on 31 reviews. It was the 6th best-reviewed GBA title of 2003.&lt;ref name="MetaFERekka"/&gt;

Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' praised the characters and felt it was a suitable addition to the ''Fire Emblem'' series,&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; while [[Eurogamer]]'s Tom Bramwell cited the storyline as being similar to better examples within the Japanese role-playing genre and its near-seamless integration with gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' reviewer Star Dingo called the narrative "a complex (but not convoluted) classic fantasy yarn",&lt;ref name="GProReview"/&gt; while [[GameSpot]]'s Bethany Massimilla called the story standard while praising the writing and character development.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Christian Nutt of [[GameSpy]] praised the writing as highly enjoyable for both the Japanese and Western releases,&lt;ref name="GSpyReview"/&gt; and [[IGN]]'s Craig Harris believed that the game was superior to ''Advance Wars'' through its portrayal of characters despite some minor complaints about characters that remained alive for story reasons despite falling in battle.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; [[PALGN]] reviewer Andrew Burns commented that the story gained a serious edge once Lyn's opening story arc was completed.&lt;ref name="PALGNreview"/&gt;

Speaking about the gameplay, ''Famitsu'' was slightly mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased in the series gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]''.&lt;ref name="GProReview"/&gt; Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging as she made her way through the game,&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience.&lt;ref name="GSpyReview"/&gt; Harris again compared it to ''Advance Wars'', but said that ''Fire Emblem'' had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Burns, who had experience of earlier ''Fire Emblem'' titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.&lt;ref name="PALGNreview"/&gt;

[[File:George Robey by H. Walter Barnett.jpg|thumb|Robey in the 1910s]]
'''Sir George Edward Wade''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (20 September 1869&amp;nbsp;– 29 November 1954),&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;[[James Harding (music writer)|Harding, James]]. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35788 "Robey, George"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, accessed 10 May 2014. {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''George Robey''', was an English comedian, singer and actor in musical theatre, who became known as one of the greatest [[music hall]] performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a comedian, he mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas [[pantomime]] performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the [[pantomime dame|dame]] roles. He scored notable successes in musical [[revue]]s during and after the First World War, particularly with the song "[[If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)]]", which he performed with [[Violet Loraine]] in the revue ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]'' (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth.

Born in London, Robey came from a middle-class family. After schooling in England and Germany, and a series of office jobs, he made his debut on the London stage, at the age of 21, as the [[straight man]] to a comic hypnotist. Robey soon developed his own act and appeared at the [[Oxford Music Hall]] in 1890, where he earned favourable notices singing "The Simple Pimple" and "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now". In 1892, he appeared in his first pantomime, ''Whittington Up-to-date'' in [[Brighton]], which brought him to a wider audience.  More provincial engagements followed in [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]], and he became a mainstay of the popular Christmas pantomime scene.

Robey's music hall act matured in the first decade of the 1900s, and he undertook a number of foreign tours. He starred in the [[Royal Command Performance]] in 1912 and regularly entertained before aristocracy.  He was an avid sportsman, playing [[cricket]] and [[Association football|football]] at a semi-professional level. During the First World War, in addition to his performances in revues, he raised money for many war charities and was appointed a CBE in 1919. From 1918, he created sketches based on his Prime Minister of Mirth character and used a costume he had designed in the 1890s as a basis for the character's attire. He made a successful transition from music hall to [[variety show]]s and starred in the revue ''Round in Fifty'' in 1922, which earned him still wider notice.  With the exception of his performances in revue and pantomime, he appeared as his Prime Minister of Mirth character in all the other entertainment media including variety, music hall and radio.&lt;ref name="COTES42" /&gt;

In 1913 Robey made his film debut, but he had only modest success in the medium. He continued to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in ''Helen!'', his first straight theatre role. His appearance brought him to the attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' in 1935, a role that he later repeated in [[Laurence Olivier]]'s 1944 film, ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]''. During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was [[knighthood|knighted]] a few months before his death in 1954.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Kennington Road, London c. 1865.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Kennington Road in 1865]]
Robey was born at 334 Kennington Road, [[Kennington]], London.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;{{refn|Robey would later claim that he was born in the more affluent area of [[Herne Hill]], although this was incorrect. His birthplace in Kennington is a three-storey house above a shop, which was then a hardware outlet owned by William Brown.&lt;ref name="COTES16"&gt;Cotes, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, Kennington Road was a wealthy area mainly inhabited by successful tradesmen and businessmen. By the 1880s, the area had fallen into a decline and was considered by locals to be one of the most impoverished areas in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]], who had a poor and deprived upbringing, was born in the same street 18 years after Robey.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} His father, Charles Wade,&lt;ref name="COTES18"&gt;Cotes, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; was a civil engineer who spent much of his career on [[tram]]line design and construction.  Robey's mother, Elizabeth Mary Wade {{nee}} Keene, was a housewife; he also had two sisters.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;{{refn|Robey's parents each died during the First World War; his father of a heart attack and his mother as a result of an injury she had sustained during an [[Strategic bombing|air raid]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} His paternal ancestors originated from [[Hampshire]]; his uncle, George Wade, married into aristocracy in 1848, a link which provided a proud topic of conversation for future generations of the Wade family.&lt;ref name="COTES16" /&gt; When Robey was five, his father moved the family to [[Birkenhead]], where he helped in the construction of the [[Mersey Railway]]. Robey began his schooling in nearby [[Hoylake]] at a [[dame school]].&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotes 19"&gt;Cotes, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later the family moved back to London, near the border between [[Camberwell]] and [[Peckham]]. At around this time, trams were being introduced to the area, providing Charles Wade with a regular, well-paid job.&lt;ref name="COTES18" /&gt;

To fulfil an offer of work,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Wade moved the family to Germany in 1880, and Robey attended a school in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="Cotes 19"/&gt; He devoted his leisure hours to visiting the city's museums, art galleries and opera houses and gained a reasonable fluency in German by the time he was 12. He enjoyed life in the country and was impressed with the many operatic productions held in the city and with the Germans' high regard for the arts.&lt;ref name="COTES20"&gt;Cotes, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 14, his father allowed him to move in with a clergyman's family in the German countryside, which he used as a base while studying science at [[Leipzig University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; To earn money, he taught English to his landlord's children and minded them while their parents were at work.  Having successfully enrolled at the university, he studied art and music&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed with the family for a further 18 months so he could complete his studies before returning to England in 1885. He later claimed, apparently untruthfully, to have studied at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="COTES20" /&gt;{{refn|Robey's time at Leipzig University was cut short as his father had to return to England to work. There is no evidence that Robey enrolled at Cambridge or any other English university as fees in Victorian England were too expensive for someone like Charles Wade.&lt;ref name="COTES21"&gt;Cotes, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, members of the theatrical community were convinced of his attendance at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="COTES20" /&gt; The theatre critic [[Max Beerbohm]] wrote that Robey was one of the few distinguished men to emerge from the campus, but the English writer [[Neville Cardus]] was more sceptical, wondering how someone from the University of Cambridge could end up in the music hall.&lt;ref name="COTES21"/&gt; Robey's biographer, [[Peter Cotes]], concludes that he likely played along with the assumptions that he was a Cambridge graduate to fit in with the higher circles of society.&lt;ref name="COTES20" /&gt;|group= n}}

At the age of 18 Robey travelled to [[Birmingham]], where he worked in a civil engineer's office. It was here that he became interested in a career on the stage and often dreamed of starring in his own circus.&lt;ref name="COTES22"&gt;Cotes, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He learned to play the [[mandolin]] and became a skilled performer on the instrument. This drew interest from a group of local musicians and, together with a friend from the group who played the guitar, Robey travelled the local area in search of engagements. Soon afterwards, they were hired to play at a charity concert at the local church, [[Church of SS Mary and Ambrose, Edgbaston|St Mary and St Ambrose]] in [[Edgbaston]], a performance that led to more local bookings.  For the next appearance, Robey performed an impromptu version of "[[Killaloe March|Killaloo]]", a comic ditty taken from the [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''[[Miss Esmeralda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The positive response from the audience encouraged him to give up playing the mandolin to concentrate instead on singing comic songs.&lt;ref name="COTES24"&gt;Cotes, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====London debut====
[[File:RoyalAcquarium1876.png|thumb|250px|The [[Royal Aquarium]] in [[Westminster]], where Robey gave his first major performance]]
By 1890 Robey had become homesick, and so he returned to South London, where he took employment in a civil engineering company. He also joined a local branch of [[the Thirteen Club]], whose members, many of whom were amateur musicians, performed in small venues across London.{{refn|Founded by W. H. Blanch, the Thirteen Club charged members a fee of half a crown a year.  The club members, including both amateur and professional performers, were devoted to the idea of flouting superstition while staging concerts in public houses and halls across London.&lt;ref name="COTES24" /&gt;|group= n}} Hearing of his talent, the founder of the club, W. H. Branch, invited Robey to appear at Anderton's Hotel in [[Fleet Street]], where he performed the popular new comic song "Where Did You Get That Hat?".  Robey's performance secured him a number of private engagements for which he was paid a [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] a night.&lt;ref name="COTES24" /&gt; By the early months of 1891, Robey was much in demand, and he decided to change his stage name. He swapped "Wade" for "Robey" after working for a company in Birmingham that bore the latter name.&lt;ref name="COTES24" /&gt; It was at around this time that he met E. W. Rogers, an established [[music hall]] composer who wrote songs for [[Marie Lloyd]] and [[Jenny Hill (music hall performer)|Jenny Hill]]. For Robey, Rogers wrote three songs: "My Hat's a Brown 'Un", "The Simple Pimple" and "It Suddenly Dawned Upon Me".&lt;ref name="COTES25"&gt;Cotes, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 Robey visited the [[Royal Aquarium]] in [[Westminster]] where he watched "Professor Kennedy", a [[burlesque]] [[mesmerist]] from America.&lt;ref name="COTES25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RoyalAquarium.htm ''The Royal Aquarium''] (Arthur Lloyd theatre history), accessed 26 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his dressing room and offered himself as the stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be "mesmerised" into singing a comic song.&lt;ref name="COTES25" /&gt; At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, and as a result he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the [[Oxford Music Hall]],&lt;ref name="Cotes6"&gt;Cotes, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed "The Simple Pimple" and "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now".&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and ''The Stage'' called him a "comedian with a pretty sense of humour [who] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success".&lt;ref&gt;"Mr George Robey", ''The Stage'', 22 October 1891, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in [[Mile End]], where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he "stole the notices from experienced troupers".&lt;ref name="COTES42"&gt;Cotes, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, Robey conducted a music hall tour of the English provinces which began in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] and took him to [[Liverpool]], at a venue owned by the mother of the influential London impresario [[Oswald Stoll]]. Through this engagement Robey met Stoll, and the two became lifelong friends.&lt;ref name="COTES42" /&gt; In early December, Robey appeared in five music halls a night, including [[Charing Cross Music Hall|Gatti's Under the Arches]], the [[Tivoli Music Hall (London)|Tivoli Music Hall]] and the [[London Pavilion]]. In mid-December, he travelled to [[Brighton]], where he appeared in his first Christmas [[pantomime]], ''Whittington Up-to-Date''.&lt;ref name="COTES41"&gt;Cotes, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Pantomime would become a lucrative and regular source of employment for the comedian. Cotes calls Robey's festive performances the "cornerstone of his comic art", and the source of "some of his greatest successes".&lt;ref name="COTES41" /&gt;

====Music hall characterisations====
[[File:George Robey as The Prime Minister of Mirth.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"The Prime Minister of Mirth", whose costume Robey had based on an earlier design]]
During the 1890s Robey created a number of music hall characters centred on everyday life. Among them were "The Chinese Laundryman" and "Clarence, the Last of the Dandies".&lt;ref name="COTES51"&gt;Cotes, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; As Clarence, Robey dressed in a top hat and frock coat and carried a [[malacca cane]], the garb of a stereotypical Victorian gentleman. For his [[travesti (theatre)|drag]] pieces, the comedian established "The Lady Dresser", a female tailor who was desperate to out-dress her high class customers, and "Daisy Dillwater, the District Nurse" who arrived on stage with a bicycle to share light-hearted scandal and gossip with the audience before hurriedly cycling off.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Robey's popularity came an eagerness to differentiate himself from his music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened from the neck down with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled [[Top hat|top-hat]].&lt;ref name="COTES42" /&gt;{{refn|He swapped the top hat for a small [[Bowler hat|bowler]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He applied thick white [[face paint]] and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit.&lt;ref name="COTES42" /&gt; He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including [[Sax Rohmer]] and [[Bennett Scott]]. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Success in pantomime and the provinces====
At the start of 1894, Robey travelled to Manchester to participate in the pantomime ''Jack and Jill'',&lt;ref name="COTES66-67"&gt;Cotes, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article68722837 |title=A Theatre Case |newspaper=[[West Gippsland Gazette]] |issue=242 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=27 January 1903 |accessdate=18 May 2017 |page=4 (morning) |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract.&lt;ref name="COTES66-67" /&gt;{{refn|Robey considered the fee to be generous. [[Cecilia Loftus]], a well-established music hall performer, was paid £80 a week for an engagement that year.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hn1kuc21R8cC&amp;pg=PA106 "The Scottish 'pro's"], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He did not appear in ''Jack and Jill'' until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Cotes, p. 67"&gt;Cotes, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.&lt;ref name="COTES70"&gt;Cotes, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Robey face.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Robey's make-up design, featuring thick black eyebrows and partially bald wig]]
In the final months of 1894, Robey returned to London to honour a contract for [[Augustus Harris]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the details of which are unknown.&lt;ref name="COTES41" /&gt; In September he starred in a series of stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and [[Bournemouth]], were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences.&lt;ref name="Cotes 47"&gt;Cotes, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat|Dick Whittington]]'', for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress [[Ada Reeve]] felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended,&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, Ada. ''Quoted'' in Cotes, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; while the comedian [[Barry Lupino]] was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.&lt;ref name="Cotes, p. 67"/&gt;

On 29 April 1898, Robey married his first wife, the Australian-born musical theatre actress Ethel Hayden,{{refn|Ethel Hayden was born in [[Melbourne]] in 1877. She arrived in London at an early age and was starring in ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] at the time of her marriage to Robey.&lt;ref name="COTES58" /&gt; A star in her own right, Ethel often accompanied her husband on stage in his various pantomimes and music hall sketches.&lt;ref name="COTES59"&gt;Cotes, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} at [[St Clement Danes]] church in the [[Strand, London]]. The congregation was made up of various theatrical colleagues; J.&amp;nbsp;Pitt Hardacre was his best man, and composer [[Leslie Stuart]] was the organist. Robey and Ethel resided briefly in Circus Road, [[St John's Wood]], until the birth of their first child [[Edward Robey|Edward]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="COTES58"&gt;Cotes, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; They then moved to 83 Finchley Road in [[Swiss Cottage]], [[Hampstead]].{{refn|Swiss Cottage now forms part of the [[London Borough of Camden]].|group= n}} Family life suited Robey; his son Edward recalled many happy experiences with his father, including the evenings when he would accompany him to the half-dozen music halls at which he would be appearing each night.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Edward showed some talent for the stage and appeared in a few minor roles as a child. He gave up acting in his teenage years.&lt;ref name="COTES58" /&gt; He studied law at the University of Cambridge and then with the barrister [[Edward Marshall Hall]], who sponsored him when he came to [[Bar examination#England and Wales|the bar]] in 1925. Edward became the Chief Prosecutor in the [[John George Haigh]] case; was a member of the British legal team at the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg war trials]] and was appointed a [[Courts of Metropolitan Magistrate|Metropolitan Magistrate]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="COTES62"&gt;Cotes, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

[[File:George Robey and family, 1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Robey, Ethel, their daughter Eileen and son [[Edward Robey|Edward]] in 1903]]
By the start of the new century, Robey was a big name in pantomime, and he was able to choose his roles. Pantomime enjoyed wide popularity until the 1890s, but by the time Robey had reached his peak, interest in it was on the wane. A type of character he particularly enjoyed taking on was the [[pantomime dame]], which historically was played by comedians from the music hall.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey was inspired by the older comedians [[Herbert Campbell]] and [[Dan Leno]], and, although post-dating them, he rivalled their eccentricity and popularity, earning the festive entertainment a new audience. In his 1972 biography of Robey, [[Neville Cardus]] thought that the comedian was "at his fullest as a pantomime Dame".&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, Neville. ''Quoted'' in Cotes, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 Robey created the character "The Prehistoric Man".  He dressed as a caveman and spoke of modern political issues, often complaining about the government "slapping another pound of rock on his taxes".&lt;ref name="COTES51" /&gt; The character was received favourably by audiences, who found it easy to relate to his topical observations.&lt;ref name="COTES51" /&gt; That year he released "The Prehistoric Man" and "Not That I Wish to Say Anything" on [[Gramophone record|shellac]] discs using the early [[Gramophone record#"Acoustical" recording|acoustic recording]] process.{{refn|The songs were released by the [[Gramophone Company|Gramophone and Typewriter Company]],&lt;ref name="WINDYRIDGE"&gt;[http://www.musichallcds.co.uk/george_robey.htm "George Robey – WINDYCDR17 – The Prime Minister of Mirth"], Windyridge Music Hall CDs, accessed 24 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the early recording companies, which became the parent organisation for the [[HMV Group|His Master's Voice]] (HMV) label.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1930/04/27/archives/columbia-graphophonehmv-merger-in-england-by-morgan-deal-indicated.html "Columbia Graphophone-H.M.V. Merger In England by Morgan Deal Indicated"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 April 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Robey signed a six-year contract in June 1904 to appear annually at, among other venues, the Oxford Music Hall in London, for a fee of £120 a week. The contract also required him to perform during the spring and autumn seasons between 1910 and 1912. Robey disputed this part of the contract and stated that he agreed to this only as a personal favour to the music hall manager George Adney Payne and that it should have become void on Payne's death in 1907.  The management of the Oxford counter-claimed and forbade Robey from appearing in any other music hall during this period. The matter went to court, where the judge found in Robey's favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57377171 |title=Comedian's £200 a Week |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXV |issue=19,774 |location=South Australia |date=29 March 1910 |accessdate=18 May 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robey was engaged to play the title role in the 1905 pantomime ''Queen of Hearts''. The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing "Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, "Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as "the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes". Robey incorporated "The Dresser", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show.&lt;ref name="COTES68"&gt;Cotes, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded two songs, "What Are You Looking at Me For?" and "The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.&lt;ref name="WINDYRIDGE" /&gt;

===Career peak years===

====Sporting interests and violin-making====
[[File:George Robey in flannels.jpg|thumb|upright|Robey in [[Cricket whites|flannels]] at a charity event in 1902]]
Off-stage, Robey led an active lifestyle and was a keen amateur sportsman. He was proud of his healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] football clubs.{{refn|In 1912 Robey wrote a story entitled ''Football in the Year 2000'' for Fulham Football Club's in-house magazine in which he predicted that players would be flown to matches and paid in tobacco and would be influential in stopping wars and resolving national rivalries.&lt;ref&gt;Horrall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U-DrM5eGq04C&amp;pg=PA168 "Football"], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player well into his fifties.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in [[Dulwich]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/329/329144.html "E Swanborough's XI v G Robey's XI"], Cricket Archive, accessed 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1904, while appearing in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], he was asked by the cricketer [[Harry Wrathall]] to take part in a charity cricket match at the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]]. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by an agent for [[Hull City A.F.C.]], who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as an [[inside right]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Robey MCC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Robey as a member of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]]]
By 1903 Robey was playing at a semi-professional level.  He was signed as an inside forward by Millwall Football Club and scored many goals for them.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; He also displayed a good level of ability in [[vigoro]],&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; an Australian sport derived from both cricket and baseball which was short-lived in England. Two years later he became a member of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]&lt;ref name="COTES138"&gt;Cotes, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; and played in minor games for them for many years.  He gained a reputation at the club for his comic antics on the field, such as raising his eyebrows at the approaching bowler in an attempt to distract him.&lt;ref name="COTES139"&gt;Cotes, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The writer Neville Cardus was complimentary about Robey's cricket prowess and called him "an elegant player" whose performances on the cricket field were as entertaining as they were on the stage.&lt;ref name="COTES138" /&gt; Although a versatile player, Robey thought of himself as a "medium-paced, right-handed bowler".&lt;ref&gt;Robey, George. ''Quoted'' in Cotes, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robey was asked to help organise a charity football match in 1907 by friends of the Scottish football trainer [[James Miller (footballer)|James Miller]], who had died the previous year.  Robey compiled a team of amateur footballers from the theatrical profession and met Miller's former team Chelsea Football Club at their home ground. The match raised considerable proceeds for Miller's widow. Robey was proud of the match and joked: "I just wanted to make sure that Chelsea stay in the first division."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In the later months of 1908, while appearing as Dame Trot in ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' in Birmingham, Robey ran the quickest time in both the 100 and 220-yard sprint at a track in [[Small Heath, Birmingham|Small Heath]].&lt;ref name="COTES139"/&gt;|group= n}}

In his spare time, Robey made violins, a hobby that he first took up during his years in Dresden. He became a skilled craftsman of the instrument, although he never intended for them to be played in public.  Speaking in the 1960s, the violinist and composer [[Yehudi Menuhin]], who played one of Robey's violins for a public performance during that decade, called the comedian's finished instrument "very professional". He was intrigued by the idea that a man as famous as Robey could produce such a "beautifully finished" instrument, unbeknown to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey was also an artist, and some of his pen and ink self-caricatures are kept at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London.&lt;ref name="NPG" /&gt;

====Oswald Stoll====
[[File:George Robey in football kit 1904.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Robey during a charity football match in 1904]]
Robey's first high-profile invitation came in the first decade of the 1900s from [[Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale]], who hired him as entertainment for a party he was hosting at [[Carlton House Terrace]] in Westminster.  Soon afterwards, the comedian appeared for the first time before royalty when [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] had Robey hired for several private functions. Robey performed a series of songs and monologues and introduced the "Mayor of Mudcumdyke", all of which was met with much praise and admiration from the royal watchers. He was later hired by Edward's son, [[George V|the Prince of Wales]] (the future King George V), who arranged a performance at Carlton House Terrace for his friend [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]].&lt;ref name="COTES75"&gt;Cotes, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1912, at the invitation of the impresario Oswald Stoll, Robey took part for the first time in the [[Royal Command Performance]],&lt;ref name="COTES48"&gt;Cotes, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; to which Cotes attributes "one of the prime factors in his continuing popularity".&lt;ref name="COTES48"/&gt; King George V and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] were "delighted" with Robey's comic sketch, in which he performed the "Mayor of Mudcumdyke" in public for the first time.&lt;ref name="COTES48" /&gt; Robey found the royal show to be a less daunting experience than the numerous private command performances that he gave during his career.&lt;ref name="COTES75" /&gt;

At the outbreak of the First World War, Robey wished to enlist in the army but, now in his 40s, he was too old for active service. Instead, he volunteered for the [[Special Constabulary]] and raised money for charity through his performances as a comedian. It was not uncommon for him to finish at the theatre at 1:00 am and then to patrol as a special constable until 6:00 am, where he would frequently help out during [[Zeppelin|zeppelin raids]].  He combined his civilian duties with work for a volunteer motor transport unit towards the end of the war, in which he served as a lieutenant. He committed three nights a week to the corps while organising performances during the day to benefit war charities.  Robey was a strong supporter of the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] and thought that they were often overlooked when it came to charitable donations.  He raised £22,000 at a benefit held at the [[London Coliseum]], which he donated in the navy's favour.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Film debut and ''The Bing Boys Are Here''====
[[File:George Robey as the Mayor.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", an early character for Robey in variety theatre]]
Robey's first experience in cinema was in 1913, with two early sound film shorts: "And Very Nice Too" and "Good Queen Bess", made in the [[List of film sound systems|Kinoplasticon]] process, where the film was synchronised with phonograph records.&lt;ref name=OSO&gt;[http://filmografie.osobnosti.cz/george-239 "George Robey"], Osobnosti.cz, accessed 2 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parrill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G-LX_jt0tsEC&amp;pg=PA91 "'Good Queen Bess' (1913)", p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he tried to emulate his music hall colleagues [[Billy Merson]] and Charlie Austin, who had set up Homeland Films and found success with the ''[[Squibs (1921 film)|Squibs]]'' series of films starring [[Betty Balfour]].&lt;ref name="COTES104"&gt;Cotes, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey met filmmakers from the Burns Film Company, who engaged him in a silent short entitled "George Robey Turns Anarchist",&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b71df09e3 ''George Robey Turns Anarchist''], British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he played a character who fails to blow up the Houses of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;St. Pierre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AvxgFdRJ66kC&amp;pg=PA37 p. 37].&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to appear sporadically in film throughout the rest of his career, never achieving more than a modest amount of success.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, for the first time in many years, Robey appeared in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in ''Sinbad the Sailor''; [[Fred Emney Sr]] played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable.&lt;ref name="COTES68"/&gt; During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income.&lt;ref name="COTES82"&gt;Cotes, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.&lt;ref name="COTES68" /&gt;

By the First World War, music hall entertainment had fallen out of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see.  [[Revue]] appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]''&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], London.&lt;ref name="COTES195"&gt;Cotes, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite [[Violet Loraine]], who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song "[[If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)]]", which became an international success.&lt;ref&gt;"The Bing Boys Are Here", ''Exeter and Plymouth Gazette'', 1 May 1916, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fazan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jA7ihqRBMokC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robey, Loraine and Lester.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Robey (left), [[Violet Loraine]] and [[Alfred Lester]] in costume for ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]'' (1916)]]
This London engagement was a new experience for Robey, who had only been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production,&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and he had never had to memorise lines precisely or keep to schedules enforced by strict directors and theatre managers.&lt;ref name="COTES82" /&gt; ''The Bing Boys Are Here'' ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra for more than a year. The theatrical press praised Robey as "the first actor of the halls".&lt;ref name="COTES70" /&gt; He made two films towards the end of the war: ''The Anti-frivolity League'' in 1916&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6ed0fe0f ''The Anti-frivolity League''], British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Doing His Bit]]'' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b70d5d803 ''Doing His Bit''], British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Zig-Zag'' to ''Joy Bells''====
Robey left the cast of ''The Bing Boys'' during its run, in January 1917, to star at the [[Hippodrome, London|London Hippodrome]] in [[Albert de Courville]], [[Dave Stamper]] and [[Gene Buck]]'s lavishly-staged revue ''[[Zig-Zag!]]''.&lt;ref name="STONE27"&gt;Stone, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey included a sketch based on his music hall character "The Prehistoric Man", with [[Daphne Pollard]] playing the role of "She of the Tireless Tongue".&lt;ref name="COTES85"&gt;Cotes, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who accidentally secures a box at the [[Savoy Theatre]] instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man.  The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show.&lt;ref name="STONE27" /&gt; ''Zig-Zag'' ran for 648 performances.&lt;ref name="COTES85" /&gt; Stoll again secured Robey for the Alhambra in 1918 for a sequel, ''The Bing Boys on Broadway''. The show, again co-starring Violet Loraine, matched the popularity of its predecessor and beat the original show's run with a total of 562 performances.&lt;ref name="COTES85" /&gt;

Robey returned to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took a leading role in another hit revue, ''[[Joy Bells]]''. [[Phyllis Bedells]] took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with [[Anita Elson]] and [[Leon Errol]] as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: "No, No, No" centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and "The Rest Cure" told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of [[malpractice]] from his well-meaning friends who visit him.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Italian newspaper ''La Tribuna'', the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We do not want to see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic."&lt;ref&gt;Cecchi, Emilio. ''La Tribuna'', ''quoted'' in Wilson, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Joy Bells'' ran for 723 performances.&lt;ref name="COTES82"&gt;Cotes, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early months of 1919, Robey completed a book of memoirs, ''My Rest Cure'', which was published later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Robey, George. [https://archive.org/details/myrestcure00robegoog ''My Rest Cure''], Frederick A. Stokes, 1919, Archive.org, accessed 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During the run of ''Joy Bells'' he was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] for raising £14,000 for the French [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="COTES82" /&gt; He declined a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences;&lt;ref name="HDM1"&gt;"George Robey", ''Hull Daily Mail'', 18 September 1942, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] by George V at Buckingham Palace instead.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of the penultimate ''Joy Bells'' performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario [[Alfred Butt|Sir Alfred Butt]], who agreed to pay him £100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his £600 a week contract at the Alhambra.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum.  He and Loraine sang "If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)".&lt;ref name="COTES74"&gt;Cotes, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war years===

====Films and revues of the early 1920s====
[[File:Round In Fifty theatre poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A poster for the revue ''Round in Fifty'' at the London Hippodrome in 1922]]
A gap in the Alhambra's schedule allowed Stoll to showcase Robey in a new short film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/539886/ "Stoll Picture Productions"], British Film Institute, accessed 5 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 112"&gt;Wilson, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; "George Robey's Day Off" (1919) showed the comedian acting out his daily domestic routines to comic effect,&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6a248f6e ''George Robey's Day Off''], British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but the picture failed at the box office. The British director [[John Baxter (director)|John Baxter]] concluded that producers did not know how best to apply Robey's stage talents to film.&lt;ref name="COTES104" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WILSON151"/&gt;

By 1920 variety theatre had become popular in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/variety-theatre/ "Variety Theatre"], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], accessed 25 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robey had completed the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through [[Ad libitum|ad lib]], was also beginning to fall out of favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robey's first revue of the 1920s was ''Johnny Jones'', which opened on 1 June 1920 at the Alhambra Theatre.  The show also featured [[Ivy St. Helier]], [[Lupino Lane]] and [[Eric Blore]]&lt;ref name="COTES88"&gt;Cotes, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and carried the advertisement "A Robey salad with musical dressing".&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 112"/&gt; One of the show's more popular gags was a scene in which Robey picked and ate cherries off St. Helier's hat, before tossing the stones into the orchestra pit which were then met by loud bangs from the bass drum.&lt;ref name="COTES88" /&gt;{{refn|The show featured the songs "It Wouldn't Surprise Me a Bit" and "A Little House, A Little Home".&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 112"/&gt;|group= n}} A sign of his popularity came in August 1920 when he was depicted in scouting costume for a series of 12 [[Royal Mail]] stamps in aid of the Printers Pension Corporation War Orphans and the Prince of Wales Boy Scout Funds.&lt;ref&gt;"George Robey and the Printers", ''The Devon and Exeter Gazette'', 27 August 1920, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoutingmilestones.co.uk/events "The Prince of Wales and the 1937 Coronation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207025208/http://www.scoutingmilestones.co.uk/events |date=7 December 2013 }}, Scouting Milestones, accessed 27 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|bgcolor=#D8D8D8|quote="I think [Robey]'s Mother Goose was, as far as I know, the greatest piece of acting of what is called the 'Dame' that I have ever seen.  But then again his Dame Trot in ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' was great comic acting. It was incredible.

The revue ''Robey en Casserole'' (1921) was next for Robey, during which he led a troupe of dancers in a musical piece called the "Policemen Ballet".  Each dancer was dressed in a mock police uniform on top and a [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] below.  The show was the first failure for the comedian under Stoll's management. That December Robey appeared in his only London pantomime, ''Jack and the Beanstalk'', at the Hippodrome.&lt;ref name="COTES88" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer, Peter Cotes, remembered the comedian's interpretation of Dame Trot as "enormously funny: a bucolic caricature of a woman, sturdy and fruity, leathery and forbidding" and thought that Robey's comic timing was "in a class of its own."&lt;ref name="COTES70" /&gt;{{refn|The production also featured [[Clarice Mayne]] as Jack. [[Jay Laurier]] and [[Tom Walls]] warmed the audience before the main performance.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In March 1922 Robey remained at the Hippodrome in the revue ''Round in Fifty'', a modernised version of ''Round the World in Eighty Days'', which proved to be another hit for the London theatre, and a personal favourite of the comedian.&lt;ref name="COTES88" /&gt;{{refn|Written by [[Sax Rohmer]] and Julian and Laurie Wylie, ''Round in Fifty'' told the story of [[Phileas Fogg]], who travelled the world for a bet.

Co-stars included [[Wallace Lupino|Wallace]] and [[Barry Lupino]] and [[Alec Kellaway]]. It ran for 471 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

====Marriage breakdown and foreign tours====
Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences a further four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the intention of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: ''One Arabian Night'' was a reworking of ''[[Aladdin]]'' and co-starred [[Lionelle Howard]] and [[Edward O'Neill (actor)|Edward O'Neill]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b215810 "''One Arabian Night''"], British Film Institute, accessed 2 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Harlequinade'' visited the roots of pantomime.&lt;ref name="COTES104" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6a614fbd "''Harlequinade''"], British Film Institute, accessed 2 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was [[Sancho Panza]] in [[Maurice Elvey]]'s 1923 film ''[[Don Quixote (1923 film)|Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/pdf/chaplin-in-context.pdf "Chaplin-In-Context"], British Film Institute, p. 2, accessed 4 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he received a fee of £700 a week.&lt;ref name="WILSON151"&gt;Wilson, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923.&lt;ref name="COTES59" /&gt; He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies and walked out of the family home.&lt;ref name="COTES58" /&gt;

Robey made a return to the London Hippodrome in 1924 in the revue ''Leap Year'' in which he co-starred with Laddie Cliff, Betty Chester and [[Vera Pearce]]. ''Leap Year'' was set in South Africa, Australia and Canada, and was written to appeal to the tourists who were visiting London from the Commonwealth countries. Robey was much to their tastes, and his rendition of "My Old Dutch" helped the show achieve another long run of 421 performances. ''Sky High'' was next and opened at the [[London Palladium]] in March 1925. The chorus dancer Marie Blanche was his co-star, a partnership that caused the gossip columnists to comment on the performers' alleged romance two years previously. Despite the rumours Blanche continued as his leading lady for the next four years, and ''Sky High'' lasted for 309 performances on the West End stage.&lt;ref name="COTES90"&gt;Cotes, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1926 was lacking in variety entertainment, a fact largely attributed to the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|UK general strike]] that had occurred in May of that year.&lt;ref name="COTES90" /&gt; The strike was unexpected by Robey, who had signed the previous year to star in a series of variety dates for [[Moss Empires]]. The contract was lucrative, made more so by the comedian's willingness to manage his own bookings. He took the show to the provinces under the title of ''Bits and Pieces'' and employed a company of 25 artists as well as engineers and support staff. Despite the economic hardships of Britain in 1926, large numbers of people turned out to see the show.&lt;ref name="COTES91"&gt;Cotes, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Birmingham, a city where he was held in great affection, and where he was sure the audiences would embrace his new show.  However, censors demanded that he omit the provocative song "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" and that he heavily edit the sketch "The Cheat". The restrictions failed to dampen the audiences' enthusiasm, and ''Bits and Pieces'' enjoyed rave reviews.  It ran until Christmas and earned a six-month extension.&lt;ref name="COTES91"/&gt;

In the spring of 1927 Robey embraced the opportunity to tour abroad, when he and his company took ''Bits and Pieces'' to South Africa, where it was received favourably.&lt;ref name="COTES91" /&gt; By the time he had left Cape Town, he had played to over 60,000 people and had travelled in excess of 15,000 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|{{convert|15000|mi}}|group= n}}  Upon his return to England in October, he took ''Bits and Pieces'' to [[Bradford]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1928, Robey and his company travelled to Canada, where they played to packed audiences for three months.&lt;ref name="WILSON123"&gt;Wilson, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that he produced a new revue, ''Between Ourselves'', in [[Vancouver]],&lt;ref name="COTES92"&gt;Cotes, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WILSON121"&gt;Wilson, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; which was staged especially for the country's armed forces.&lt;ref name="WILSON123" /&gt; The Canadians were enthusiastic about Robey; he was awarded the [[freedom of the city]] in [[London, Ontario]], made a chieftain of the [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Sarcee tribe]],{{refn|During the elaborate ceremony, Robey was given an eagle-feathered head-dress and the tribal name of "Dit-ony-Chusaw", which translates to "Chief Eagle Plume".&lt;ref name="WILSON123" /&gt;|group= n}} and was an honorary guest at a cricket match in [[Edmonton]], Alberta.&lt;ref name="WILSON123" /&gt; He described the tour as "one of unbroken happiness."&lt;ref name="WILSON123"/&gt; In the late 1920s Robey also wrote and starred in two [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film productions, ''Safety First'' (1928) and ''Mrs. Mephistopheles'' (1929).&lt;ref name=OSO/&gt;

In early 1929 Robey returned to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with ''Bits and Pieces'', after which he started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was [[Woolwich]], where he performed to packed audiences over the course of a week.&lt;ref name="COTES92" /&gt; Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler,{{refn|Frank Rolison Littler (1879–1940) married Agnes Richeux, the widow of the impresario Jules Richeux, in 1914. The three children from the Richeux marriage all adopted the surname "Littler", and the two sons, [[Prince Littler]] and [[Emile Littler|Emile]], both became well-known impresarios.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Sheridan. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56657 "Littler, Prince Frank"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, accessed 10 May 2014. {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} with the latter briefly becoming his manager.&lt;ref name="COTES92"&gt;Cotes, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WILSON121" /&gt; In 1932 Robey appeared in his first [[sound film]], ''[[The Temperance Fête]]'',&lt;ref name="Cotes, p. 193"&gt;Cotes, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and followed this with ''Marry Me'', which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career.&lt;ref name="WILSON151"/&gt; The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b00e997 ''Marry Me''], British Film Institute, accessed 23 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later months of 1932, Robey had formed a romantic relationship with the Littlers' daughter Blanche (1897–1981), who then took over as his manager. The couple grew close during the filming of [[Don Quixote (1933 film)|''Don Quixote'']], a remake of the comedian's 1923 success as Sancho Panza. Unlike its predecessor, ''Don Quixote'' had an ambitious script, big budget and an authentic foreign setting.{{refn|The 1932 version was filmed in [[Grasse]] in the south of France. The earlier film was shot in [[Cumberland]]; Robey was in the English-language version, one of three versions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Robey, however, resented having to grow a beard for the role and disliked the French climate and gruelling 12-week filming schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to act out his character's death scene in a farcical way and also objected to the lateness of the "dreadfully banal" scripts,{{refn|In the opinion of Wilson, p. 155|group= n}} which were often written the night before filming.&lt;ref name="WILSON155"&gt;Wilson, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venture into legitimate theatre====
[[File:CBCochrane.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The producer [[Charles B. Cochran|C.B. Cochran]] engaged Robey for the Adelphi Theatre's operetta ''Helen!'' in 1932]]
Until 1932 Robey had never played in legitimate theatre, although he read [[Shakespeare]] from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; That year he took the part of King Menelaus in ''Helen!'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/505646/Sir-George-Robey "Sir George Robey"], Britannica, accessed 31 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which was an English-language adaptation by [[A. P. Herbert]] of Offenbach's operetta ''[[La belle Hélène]]''. The show's producer [[Charles B. Cochran|C. B. Cochran]], a longstanding admirer of Robey, engaged a prestigious cast for the production, including [[Evelyn Laye]] and W. H. Berry, with choreography by [[Léonide Massine]] and sets by [[Oliver Messel]]. The operetta opened on 30 January 1932, becoming the [[Adelphi Theatre]]'s most successful show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic Harold Conway wrote that while Robey had reached the pinnacle of his career as a variety star, which only required him to rely on his "breezy, cheeky personality", he had reservations about the comedian's ability to "integrate himself with the other stars&amp;nbsp;... to learn many pages of dialogue, and to remember countless cues."&lt;ref name="COTES95"&gt;Cotes, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the run of ''Helen!'', Robey briefly resumed his commitments to the variety stage before signing a contract to appear at the Savoy Theatre as Bold Ben Blister in the operetta ''Jolly Roger'', which premiered in March 1933. The production had a run of bad luck, including an actors' strike which was caused by Robey's refusal to join the actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]]. The dispute was settled when he was included as a co-producer of the show, thus excluding him as a full-time actor.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey made a substantial donation to the union, and the production went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its troubles, the show was a success and received much praise from the press.  Harold Conway of the ''Daily Mail'' called the piece "one of the outstanding triumphs of personality witnessed in a London theatre".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Robey completed his final autobiography, ''Looking Back on Life''. The literary critic Graham Sutton admired Robey for his honest and frank account, and thought that he was "at his best when most personal".&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Graham. [http://www.unz.org/Pub/BookmanUK-1933nov-00132a03 "The Bookman's Table": ''Looking Back on Life'', by George Robey"], ''The Bookman'', p. 132, No. 506, Vol. 85, November 1933, accessed 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Shakespearean roles=====
According to Wilson, Robey revered Shakespeare and had an "excellent reading knowledge of the Bard" even though the comedian had never seen a Shakespeare play. As a child, he had committed to memory the "ghost" scene in ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1933, Cochran expressed the opinion that Robey had been a victim of a largely conservative and "snobbish" attitude from theatre managers, that the comedian was "cut out for Shakespeare", and that if he had been frequently engaged in playing the Bard's works, then "Shakespeare would probably have been popular."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, the theatre director Sydney Carroll offered Robey the chance to appear as [[Nick Bottom]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at the [[Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park]], but he initially declined the offer, citing a hectic schedule,&lt;ref name="WILSON137"&gt;Wilson, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; including a conflict with his appearance in that year's Royal Variety Performance on 8 May.&lt;ref name="COTES74" /&gt; He was also concerned that he would not be taken seriously by legitimate theatre critics and knew that he would not be able to include a comic sketch or to engage in his customary resourceful gagging.&lt;ref name="WILSON137" /&gt; In the same year, Robey starred in [[Chu Chin Chow (1934 film)|a film version]] of the hit musical ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]''.  ''The New York Times'' called him "a lovable and laughable Ali Baba".&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=980DE6DB103CE23ABC4A51DFBF66838F629EDE&amp;oref=slogin "Chu Chin Chow (1934): A Robust Operetta"].

At the start of 1935 Robey accepted his first Shakespearean role, as [[Falstaff]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', which surprised the press and worried fans who thought that he might retire the Prime Minister of Mirth. The theatrical press were sceptical of a music hall performer taking on such a distinguished role; Carroll, the play's producer, vehemently defended his casting choice.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll later admitted taking a gamble on employing Robey but wrote that the comedian "has unlimited courage in challenging criticism and risking his reputation on a venture of this kind; he takes both his past and his future in both hands and is faced with the alternative of dashing them into the depths or lifting them to a height hitherto undreamt of."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll further opined that "[Robey] has never failed in anything he has undertaken. He is one of the most intelligent and capable of actors."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Henry IV, Part I'' opened on 28 February at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], and Robey proved himself to be a capable Shakespearean actor,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; though his Shakespearean debut was marred initially by an inability to remember his lines. A journalist from ''[[Daily Express|The Daily Express]]'' thought that Robey seemed uncomfortable, displayed a halting delivery and was "far from word perfect".&lt;ref&gt;"George Robey Would Be a Great Falstaff—If Only He Could Gag!", ''The Daily Express'', 1 March 1935, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', the critic [[Ivor Brown]] said of Robey's portrayal: "In no performance within my memory has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation".&lt;ref&gt;"Henry IV, Part I", ''The Observer'', 3 March 1935, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Another journalist, writing in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', thought that Robey "gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself".&lt;ref&gt;"It Takes Three Years to Equal This Robey", ''Daily Mirror'', 1 March 1935, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, such was Robey's popularity in the role that the German theatre and film producer [[Max Reinhardt]] declared that, should the opportunity arise for a film version, the comedian would be his perfect choice as Falstaff. Cotes described Robey as having "a great vitality and immense command of the [role]. He never faltered, he had to take his audience by the throat and make them attentive at once because he couldn't play himself in."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was eager to be taken seriously as a legitimate actor, Robey provided a subtle nod in the direction of his comic career by using the wooden cane intended for the Prime Minister of Mirth for the majority of his scenes as Falstaff.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[John Betjeman]] responded to the critics' early scepticism: "Variety artistes are a separate world from the legitimate stage. They are separate too, from ballet, opera, and musical comedy. It is possible for variety artists to appear in all of these. Indeed, no one who saw will ever forget the superb pathos and humour of George Robey's Falstaff".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Cotes, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1935, Blanche Littler persuaded Robey to accept Carroll's earlier offer to play Bottom, and the comedian cancelled three weeks' worth of dates. The press were complimentary of his performance, and he later attributed his success to Littler and her encouragement.&lt;ref name="WILSON137" /&gt;

===Later career: 1936–50===

====Radio and television debut====
Robey made his radio debut in 1936 when he was interviewed for ''The Spice of Life'' programme for the [[BBC]].  He spoke about his private life and his time spent on the music hall circuit, which he described as the "most enjoyable experience" of his life. The usually reserved Robey admitted that privately he was not a sociable person and that he often grew tired of his audiences while performing on stage, but that he got his biggest thrill from making others laugh. He also declared a love for the outdoors&lt;ref name="COTES158"&gt;Wilson, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned that, to relax, he would draw "comic scribbles" of himself as the Prime Minister of Mirth,&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp03820/sir-george-robey-george-edward-wade "George Robey (1869–1954), Comedian"], [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], accessed 8 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which he would occasionally give to fans. As a result of the interview he received more than a thousand fan letters from listeners. Wilson thought that Robey's "perfect diction and intimate manner made him an ideal broadcast speaker".&lt;ref name ="COTES158" /&gt; The press commented favourably on his performance, with one reporter from ''Variety Life'' writing: "I doubt whether any speaker other than a stage idol could have used, as Robey did, the first person singular almost incessantly for half an hour without causing something akin to resentment.&amp;nbsp;... The comedian's talk was brilliantly conceived and written."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous reporter from ''Variety Life'', ''quoted'' in Wilson, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later months of 1936, Robey repeated his radio success with a thirty-minute programme entitled "Music-Hall", recorded for American audiences, to honour the tenth birthday of the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Corporation]]. In it, he presented a montage of his characterisations as well as impressions of other famous acts of the day.  A second programme, which he recorded the following year, featured the comedian speaking fondly of cricket and of the many well-known players whom he had met on his frequent visits to the Oval and Lord's cricket grounds over his fifty-year association.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1938 Robey appeared in the film ''[[A Girl Must Live]]'', directed by [[Carol Reed]], in which he played the role of Horace Blount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6ab23eea ''A Girl Must Live''], British Film Institute, accessed 11 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A report in the ''Kinematograph Weekly'' commented that the 69-year-old comedian was still able to "stand up to the screen by day and variety by night."&lt;ref&gt;Quote taken from ''Kinematograph Weekly''; Wilson, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist for ''The Times'' opined that Robey's performance as an elderly furrier, the love interest of both [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[Lilli Palmer]], was "a perfect study in bewildered embarrassment".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robey made his television debut in August 1938&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances.  The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his "comic quality" was conveyed on the small screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited to his voice and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty words. She felt that he should "be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career.&lt;ref name=QCotes114&gt;''Quoted'' in Cotes, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were "really too slow for television".&lt;ref name=QCotes114/&gt;

That November, and with his divorce from Ethel finalised,&lt;ref name="WILSON197"&gt;Wilson, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey married Blanche Littler, who was more than two decades his junior,&lt;ref&gt;"George Robey Married", ''Derby Daily Telegraph'', 28 November 1938, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; at Marylebone Town Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19381201&amp;id=1SIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2482,48913 "Noted Comedian Weds"], ''Montreal Gazette'', 1 December 1938, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At Christmas, he fractured three ribs and bruised his spine when he accidentally fell into the orchestra pit while appearing in the 1938–39 pantomime ''Robinson Crusoe'' in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;"George Robey: More Restful Night But Still In Pain", ''Derby Daily Telegraph'', 4 January 1939, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed the fall to his face mask which gave him a limited view of the stage. The critic Harold Conway was less forgiving, blaming the accident on the comedian's "lost self-confidence" and opining that the accident was the start of Robey's professional decline.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second World War====
Aware of demand for his act in Australia, Robey conducted a second tour of the country at the start of 1939. While he was appearing at the [[New Tivoli Theatre, Sydney|Tivoli Theatre]] in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining to raise money for the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed up with the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.&lt;ref name="COTES63"&gt;Cotes, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, Robey appeared predominantly in troop concerts as himself&lt;ref name="Cotes, p. 193"/&gt; but caused controversy by jokingly supporting the Nazis and belittling black people during his act. His intentions were to gently poke fun at the "[[Little Englander]]s", but audiences thought that he was sympathising with [[Nazism]]. His jocular view that a defeat for Hitler would mean a victory for [[bolshevism]] was highlighted in a series of controversial interviews, which caused him much embarrassment when challenged and which he regretted afterwards. His views became known in the press as "Robeyisms", which drew increasing criticism, but his Prime Minister of Mirth remained popular, and he used the character to divert the negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes wrote that Robey was not a politician, merely a jingoist, who "lived long enough to feel [that] his little-Englander outlook [was causing him] acute embarrassment, and his army of admirers deep dismay."&lt;ref name="COTES63" /&gt;

Robey starred in the film ''[[Salute John Citizen]]'' in 1942, directed by Maurice Elvey and co-starring [[Edward Rigby]] and [[Stanley Holloway]], about the effects that the war had on a normal British family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b4ed4ad ''Salute John Citizen''], British Film Institute, accessed 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1944 review of the film, Robey was described as being "convincing in [an] important role" but the film itself had "dull moments in the simple tale".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46938176 "Salute John Citizen"], ''The Australian Women's Weekly'', 29 January 1944, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; That Christmas, Robey travelled to [[Bristol]], where he starred in the pantomime ''Robinson Crusoe''.&lt;ref name="Cotes, p. 193"/&gt; A further four films followed in 1943, one of which promoted war propaganda while the other two displayed the popular medium of [[cine-variety]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b9f3b6658 "George Robey"], British Film Institute, accessed 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Cine-variety achieved popularity in the 1920s and incorporated the talking motion picture with variety theatre. Many variety theatres were converted into cinemas and showcased the talents of variety comedians, which bought them to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/399030/music-hall-and-variety "Music Hall and Variety"], Britannica, accessed 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Cine-variety introduced Robey to the [[Rainbow Theatre|Astoria]] in Finsbury Park, London, a venue which was used to huge audiences and big-name acts and was described as "a super-cinema".&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early months of 1944, Robey returned to the role of Falstaff when he appeared in the film version of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'', produced by [[Eagle-Lion Films]].  The American film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] had mixed opinions of the film. Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1946, he thought that it showcased "a fine group of British film craftsmen and actors", who contributed to "a stunningly brilliant and intriguing screen spectacle". Despite that, he considered the film's additional screenplay poor and called Falstaff's deathbed scene "non-essential and just a bit grotesque."&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Bosley. [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9901E7D81538E133A2575BC1A9609C946793D6CF "The Screen: Henry V (1944)"], ''The New York Times'', 18 June 1946, accessed 24 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1944, he appeared in [[Burnley]] in a show entitled ''Vive Paree'' alongside Janice Hart and Frank O'Brian.&lt;ref&gt;"Vive Paree", ''Burnley Express'', 18 November 1944, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Robey starred in two minor film roles, as "Old Sam" in ''The Trojan Brothers'', a short comedy film in which two actors experience various problems as a pantomime horse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b905d0e ''The Trojan Brothers''], British Film Institute, accessed 24 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Vogel" in the musical romance ''[[Waltz Time (1945 film)|Waltz Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b69a0c487 ''Waltz Time''], British Film Institute, accessed 24 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 1947 touring England,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; while the following spring he undertook a provincial tour of Frederick Bowyer's fairy play ''The Windmill Man'', which he also co-produced with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Fazan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K_ga0hyylrAC&amp;pg=PT22 p. 22].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===

====Decline in health====
In June 1951, now aged 81, Robey starred in a midnight gala performance at the London Palladium in aid of the family of [[Sid Field]] who had died that year. For the finale, Robey performed "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" and "If You Were the Only Girl in the World"; the rest of the three-hour performance featured celebrities from the radio, television and film mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The American comedian [[Danny Kaye]], who was also engaged for the performance, called Robey a "great, great artist".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Other participants included [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Tommy Trinder]] and [[the Crazy Gang]].&lt;ref name="WILSON222"&gt;Wilson, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The same month, Robey returned to Birmingham, where he opened a garden party at St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church, a venue in which he had appeared at the beginning of his career.  On 25 September he appeared for the BBC on an edition of the radio series ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' for which he chose among others "Mondo ladro", Falstaff's rueful complaint about the wicked world in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/615e0930 "Desert Island Discs: George Robey"], BBC, accessed 17 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| Robey's other choices for the programme were: 1. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] – ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'': "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy". 2. [[Noël Coward]] – "I'll See You Again". 3. [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] – "Piano Concerto in A Minor". 4. [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] – ''The Gondoliers''. 5. [[Fritz Kreisler]] – "Liebesfreud". 6. [[Ivor Novello]] – ''Glamorous Night''. 7. [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] – "Land of Hope and Glory".&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;|group= n}}  For the rest of the year Robey made a number of personal appearances opening fetes and attending charity events.&lt;ref name="WILSON222" /&gt;

Robey took part in the Festival of Variety for the BBC in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf73AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117].&lt;/ref&gt; which paid tribute to the British music hall. For his performance, he adopted an ad-lib style rather than use a script.&lt;ref name="WILSON222" /&gt; His wife sat at the side of the stage, ready to provide support should he need it. According to Wilson, Robey's turn earned the loudest applause of the evening.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month Robey undertook a long provincial tour in the variety show ''Do You Remember?'' under the management of [[Bernard Delfont]]. After an evening's performance in [[Sheffield]], he was asked by a local newspaper reporter if he considered retiring. The comedian quipped: "Me retire? Good gracious, I'm too old for that.  I could not think of starting a new career at my age!"&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, he opened the Lansbury Lodge home for retired cricketers in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], East London; he considered the ceremony to be one of the "happiest memories of his life."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1952, Robey was becoming noticeably frail, and he lost interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In May he filmed ''[[The Pickwick Papers (1952 film)|The Pickwick Papers]]'', in which he played the role of old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Knighthood and death====
In the early months of 1954, a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] was conferred on Robey by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref name="ADVOCATE"&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69886839 "George Robey Knighted"], ''The Advocate'', 18 February 1954, p. 1, accessed 6 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During the following weeks, his health declined; he became confined to a wheelchair and spent the majority of his time at home under the care of his wife. In May he opened a British Red Cross fete in [[Seaford, East Sussex]], and, a month later, made his last public appearance, on television as a panellist in the English version of ''[[The Name's the Same]]''. Wilson called Robey's performance "pathetic" and thought that he appeared with only "a hint of his old self".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; By June he had become housebound and quietly celebrated his 85th birthday surrounded by family; visiting friends were organised into appointments by his wife Blanche, but theatrical colleagues were barred in case they caused the comedian too much excitement.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robey suffered a stroke on 20 November and remained in a semi-coma for just over a week. He died on 29 November 1954 at his home in Saltdean, East Sussex,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19541130&amp;id=MzpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4143,3166710 "Prime Minister of Mirth: A Comic Genius – Death of Sir George Robey"], ''The Glasgow Herald'', 30 November 1954, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium in Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Burials.htm#R "Music Hall and Variety Artistes Burial Places"] (Arthur Lloyd theatre history), accessed 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Blanche continued to live on the Sussex coast until her death at the age of 83 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.buses.co.uk/history/fleethist/712gr.htm "Names on the buses – 712 George Robey"], Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company, accessed 10 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes and legacy==
[[File:Robey stamps 1921.jpg|thumb|Robey depicted in a collection of Royal Mail stamps issued in 1921 in aid of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]]]]
News of Robey's death prompted tributes from the press, who printed illustrations, anecdotes and reminders of his stage performances and charitable activities. "Knighthood notwithstanding, George Robey long ago made himself a place as an entertainer and artist of the people", declared a reporter from the ''Daily Worker'',&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; while a critic for the ''Daily Mail'' wrote: "Personality has become a wildly misused word since his heyday, but George Robey breathed it in every pore."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Cecil. ''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In Robey's obituary in ''The Spectator'', Compton Mackenzie called the comedian "one of the last great figures of the late Victorian and Edwardian music-hall."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/10th-december-1954/18/compton-mackenzie "Sidelight: Compton Mackenzie"], ''The Spectator'' (archive), 10 December 1954, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1954, a memorial service for Robey was held at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The diverse congregation consisted of royalty, actors, hospital workers, stage personnel, students and taxi drivers, among others. The [[Bishop of Stepney]], [[Joost de Blank]], said: "We have lost a great English music hall artist, one of the greatest this country has known in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers gave readings at the service, including the comedian [[Leslie Henson]], who called Robey "that great obstinate bullock of variety".&lt;ref name="Cotes6" /&gt; In his lifetime, Robey helped to earn more than £2,000,000 for charitable causes, with £500,000 of that figure being raised during the First World War.&lt;ref name="HDM1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/robey.html "Sir George Robey: The Prime Minister of Mirth"], it's-behind-you.com, accessed 8 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his efforts, the Merchant Seaman's Convalescent Home in [[Limpsfield]], Surrey, named a ward after him, and managerial staff at the [[Royal Sussex County Hospital|Royal Sussex Hospital]] later bought a new [[Dialysis|dialysis machine]] in his memory.&lt;ref name="COTES7"&gt;Cotes, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robey's comic delivery influenced other comedians, but opinions of his effectiveness as a comic vary. The radio personality [[Robb Wilton]] acknowledged learning a lot from him, and although he felt that Robey "was not very funny", he could time a comic situation perfectly.&lt;ref name="Cotes 47"/&gt; Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey "still didn't make me laugh," although he described him as "a legend" whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's "droll like humour" and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and [[Grock]]'s clowning.&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes wrote: "His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest."&lt;ref&gt;Cotes, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violet Loraine called her former co-star "one of the greatest comedians the world has ever known",&lt;ref name="QUOTE242"&gt;''Quoted'' in Wilson, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; while the theatrical producer Basil Dean opined that "George was a great artist, one of the last and {{sic}} the really big figures of his era. They don't breed them like that now."&lt;ref name="QUOTE242" /&gt;  The actor [[John Gielgud]], who remembered meeting Robey at the Alhambra Theatre in 1953, called the comedian "charming, gracious [and] one of the few really great ones" of the music hall era.&lt;ref name="QUOTE242" /&gt; Upon his death, Robey's costume for the Prime Minister of Mirth was donated to the [[London Museum]], where it is on permanent display.&lt;ref name="COTES7" /&gt;

The '''Georgia Music [[Hall of Fame]]''' was located in downtown [[Macon, Georgia]], [[United States]], from 1996 until it closed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2705 |title=Georgia Music Hall of Fame &amp;#124; New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall of Fame preserved and interpreted the state's musical heritage through programs of collection, exhibition, education and performance; it attempted to foster an appreciation for Georgia music and tried to stimulate [[economic growth]] through a variety of dynamic partnerships and initiatives statewide.  The Hall of Fame closed due to low attendance and reduced state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpb.org/news/2011/05/24/georgia-music-hall-of-fame-closing |title=Georgia Music Hall Of Fame Closing |publisher=Gpb.org |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2012/02/23/closed-georgia-music-hall-site.html | first=Dave | last=Williams | title=Closed Georgia Music Hall site 'surplus property' | date=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercer University]] purchased the former Hall of Fame building in June 2012; the university will use the building for expanded programs within its [[Mercer University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramati |first=Phillip |url=http://www.macon.com/2012/06/21/2069567/state-approves-sale-of-music-hall.html#storylink=rss#wgt=rss |title=State approves sale of music hall to Mercer &amp;#124; Morning Update |publisher=Macon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The Georgia Music Hall of Fame's permanent exhibit space was designed to resemble a Georgia town where venues such as the Jazz and Swing Club, Vintage Vinyl and Rhythm &amp; Blues Revue house artifacts, interpretive text and audio visual elements.  Temporary exhibits included "Keeps Calling Me Home: A Gram Parsons Retrospective", "Let Freedom Sing: Music and the Civil Rights Movement" and '"Otis Redding: I've Got Dreams to Remember", named "Museum Exhibition of the Year" in 2008 by the Georgia Association of Museums and Galleries.

==Education==
Education was at the core of the Georgia Music Hall of Fame's mission.  The Billy Watson Music Factory served children grades pre-K through elementary by encouraging the exploration of musical concepts like rhythm, melody and composition in a hands-on learning environment.  MIKE (Music in Kid's Education) provided a series of programs offering live music performances and music instruction opportunities throughout the year.

==''Georgia Music Magazine''==
The Georgia Music Hall of Fame Foundation published ''Georgia Music Magazine'' quarterly as both the official museum magazine and an in-depth look at Georgia music.  The state's legends, landmarks and unsung heroes were explored through insightful features, historical articles, news and reviews.

==History==
The Georgia Music Hall of Fame's institutional history began in 1978 when the Georgia General Assembly created the Senate Music Recording Industry Committee to study the economic impact of the state's music industry and to explore ways to promote Georgia music and attract music businesses to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2705 |title=Georgia Music Hall of Fame &amp;#124; New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, the Committee developed a Georgia Music Hall of Fame program honoring Georgia musicians who have made significant contributions to the music industry, with [[Ray Charles]] and music publisher [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] named the first inductees on Sept. 26, 1979. Owing much to the vision of then Lt. Governor [[Zell Miller]], the Committee also endeavored to create a public museum and archive to document the state's music heritage and serve as a cultural heritage destination. In 1990, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame Authority was created as an instrumentality of the State of Georgia and a public corporation with the stated corporate purpose and general nature: 1) to construct and maintain a facility to house the Georgia Music Hall of Fame; 2) to operate, advertise and promote the Georgia Music Hall of Fame; and 3) to promote music events at the facility and throughout the state.  On Sept. 22, 1996, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame opened as a {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility housing a main exhibit hall, a retail store, the Zell Miller Center for Georgia Music Studies, an administrative wing, a classroom and a reception room. In 1999, the second phase of the museum, The Billy Watson Music Factory, an interactive and interpretive exhibit space for pre-K through elementary students, opened.  The hall was closed on June 12, 2011 due to lack of attendance.  The exhibits are now being housed at the [[University of Georgia]], [[Georgia State University]], the [[University of West Georgia]] and in private collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2705 |title=Georgia Music Hall of Fame &amp;#124; New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Music]]''' is found in every known culture, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, music may have been in existence for at least 50,000 years and the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0262731430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&amp;printsec=frontcover |author2=Steven Brown |author3=[[Björn Merker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krause, Bernie (2012). ''The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places''. New York: Little Brown/Hachette {{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. "[[Music history]]" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.

==Eras of music==
{{Music eras}}

===Prehistoric music===
{{Main|Prehistoric music}}
Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve entertainment (game)&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm|title=Inuit Throat-Singing|first=Bruno |last=Deschênes |date=January 3, 2002|website=www.mustrad.org.uk|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or practical (luring animals in hunt)&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; functions.

It is probable that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, [[Hum (sound)|humming]] and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|clicking]], [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing. As for other musical instruments, in 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave near [[Ulm]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 =   Conard  | first1 =   NJ  | authorlink =   | title =   A female figurine from the basal Aurignacian of Hohle Fels Cave in southwestern Germany| journal =   Nature| volume =   459| issue =   7244| pages =  248–52  | year =   2009  | doi = 10.1038/nature07995  | id = | pmid=19444215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wilford  | first = John N. | date = June 24, 2009 | title = Flutes Offer Clues to Stone-Age Music  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/science/25flute.html  |accessdate=June 29, 2009  | work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epoc.de/artikel/999323&amp;_z=798890|title=Schwäbische Alb: Älteste Flöte vom Hohle Fels|author=|date=|website=epoc.de|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be about 35,000 years old, the five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone.  The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near [[Greystones]], [[Ireland]], in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-10/wooden-pipe-find-excites-irish-archaeologists/1973640|title=Wooden pipe find excites Irish archaeologists|author=|date=10 May 2004|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the "Divje Babe Flute", a cave bear femur dated to be approximately 43,500 years old, is the world's oldest musical instrument and was produced by Neanderthals. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Claims that the femur is indeed a musical instrument are, however, contested by alternative theories including the suggestion that the femur may have been gnawed by carnivores to produce holes. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Ancient music===
{{Main|Ancient music}}

The prehistoric age is considered to have ended with the development of writing, and with it, by definition, prehistoric music.  "Ancient music" is the name given to the music that followed. The "oldest known song" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]]. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the [[Seikilos epitaph]].

Double pipes, such as those used by the [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, ''Problems,'' Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate polyphony. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or "keynote," while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the [[Indus valley civilization]] archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments|title=The Music of India|first1=Reginald|last1=Massey|first2=Jamila|last2=Massey|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-8170173328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') can be found from the scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.

The history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.

The [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].

'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}
Greek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.

===Biblical period===
{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"David with his harp" [[Paris Psalter]],&lt;br&gt; c. 960, [[Constantinople]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
According to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).&lt;ref&gt;''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', "Music", 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text", writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

===Early music===
{{Main|Early music}}
Early music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.

===Medieval music===
{{Main|Medieval music}}
While musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].

During the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnesänger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].

===Renaissance music===&lt;!-- This section is linked from History of music --&gt;
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

The invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.

Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesurée]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].

The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--&gt; German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[François Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

===Classical music era===&lt;!-- This section is linked from History of music --&gt;
{{Main|Classical period (music)}}
The music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]
Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&amp;nbsp;– and often much longer&amp;nbsp;– musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]]. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[César Franck|Franck]].

India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or [[raga]] rhythmically organized through [[Tala (music)|talas]]. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas describes music at length.

'''Ho Chi Minh City Television (HTV)''' is a local television station owned by the People's Committee of [[Ho Chi Minh City]].

== History ==
The old name of HCMC Television was '''Liberation Television''' that began broadcasting on May 1, 1975. Until April 30, 1975, the name was '''Saigon Television''' ([[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]), founded in 1965, broadcast from February 2, 1966 to April 29, 1975. At the time, in Saigon, there were two different TV stations immediately adjacent in downtown: the TV station of the [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] and Saigon TV. While in [[South Vietnam]] there were five TV stations (Saigon, [[Cần Thơ]], [[Huế]], [[Nha Trang]] and [[Qui Nhơn|Quy Nhơn]]), television in the [[North Vietnam]] was still in the testing period.

After the opening of the center building in early 2006 with modern equipment and technology, HTV gradually switched to digital operations along with its good staff. HTV aims to become one of the most powerful media companies in [[Southeast Asia]].

The following are examples of [[retroactive continuities]] (or retcons).

==Film==
*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), features [[Obi Wan Kenobi]] telling [[Luke Skywalker]] that [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father)]], was betrayed and killed by [[Darth Vader]]. The sequel film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), plot has Vader reveal himself as Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father). [[George Lucas]] decided to merge both characters while writing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The following film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) has Obi-Wan, justifying his original description of Vader having 'murdered' Anakin, as being truth from "a certain point of view" because from his point of view when Anakin became Vader he destroyed everything that was good about his former friend and apprentice. Similarly [[Princess Leia]] had been previously set as an upper-class romantic interest for the farm boy Luke; but in ''Empire Strikes Back'' Leia falls in love with [[Han Solo]], so in order to avoid a possible love triangle, ''Return of the Jedi'' reveals Leia as Luke Skywalker's twin sister (and therefore, daughter of Darth Vader), Lucas had originally planned Luke's sister to be a separate character, before deciding to accommodate it into the already established Leia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secrethistoryofstarwars.com/ |title=東京の婚活パーティーってどんなの？ |publisher=Secrethistoryofstarwars.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016) explains the improbable vulnerability of the [[Death Star]] in ''A New Hope'' to small rebel ships as a consequence of deliberate sabotage on the part of the key Death Star architect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/rogue-one-star-wars-retcon-death-star.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) the seventh entry of the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' film series which serves as a sequel and spin-off to 2006's ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (the sixth film), contains a major change into the continuity of the previous films. ''Creed'' establishes that during the events of ''[[Rocky IV]]'', Rocky's friend and rival [[Apollo Creed]] had an affair that resulted in a woman's pregnancy shortly before his boxing match against [[Ivan Drago]] during which Apollo dies on the ring. Months after the fight, the woman gives birth to [[Adonis Creed]], the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Adonis never meets his father and is the protagonist of the film ''Creed''; furthermore the film reveals Apollo won the fight at the end of ''[[Rocky III]]'' implying that that is the reason why Apollo agreed to fight Ivan Drago.&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/rocky-40th-anniversary-retcon/&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Heisei series (1984–1995)|Heisei]] and [[Godzilla (franchise)#Millennium series (1999–2004)|Millennium]] eras of the ''[[Godzilla]]'' film series, the events of the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Shōwa series (1954–1975)|Showa]] era after the [[Godzilla (1954 film)|original film]] never happened.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In particular, each film in the Millennium series – except for ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', which serves as the direct sequel to ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' – serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/articles/art_mill_conti.htm |title=Godzilla Millennium Series Continuity |publisher=Tohokingdom.com |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', [[Jon Favreau]]'s son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. This was [[retcon|retroactively]] made the introduction of a young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]] and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' director [[Jon Watts]].&lt;ref name="PeterParker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|title=Tom Holland Confirms Popular Fan Theory: Spider-Man Was In ‘Iron Man 2’|last=Bradley|first=Bill|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=June 26, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rVzoB543?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|archivedate=June 26, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PeterParker2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|title=‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ Director Jon Watts Explains Real Story Behind Peter Parker’s ‘Iron Man 2’ Cameo|last=Ryan|first=Mark|work=[[Uproxx]]|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=June 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rXDt2Exj?url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|archivedate=June 27, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
*When [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] killed off his character [[Sherlock Holmes]] by plunging him to his death over the [[Reichenbach Falls]] with his nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]], the public's demand for Holmes was so great that Doyle was compelled to bring him back to life in a subsequent story, where he details that Holmes had merely faked his death.
*Though the term "retcon" did not yet exist when [[George Orwell]] wrote ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that "Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change "all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. "Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable." See [[historical revisionism (negationism)]].
*When [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the character of ''[[Sauron|The Necromancer]]'' was not originally intended to be more than an abstract "bad guy" concept because ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had not yet been conceived.  However, as Tolkien developed ''The Lord of the Rings'', the abstract ''Necromancer'' came to be "discovered" to be [[Sauron]].

==Television==

*In 2004, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' retconned the Baldwin family after [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s nephew [[Danny Baldwin|Danny]] and wife [[Frankie Baldwin|Frankie]] moved to the area from [[Essex]], with their two sons [[Jamie Baldwin|Jamie]] and [[Warren Baldwin|Warren]]. Mike had been portrayed as an only child prior to this moment, with [[Frank "Frankie" Baldwin|his father]] appearing in the program between 1980 and 1982 to confirm the notion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*''[[First of the Summer Wine]]'', the prequel to the long-running British sitcom ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', retconned the character Seymour Utterthwaite as a pre-World War II friend of the other central characters. Seymour had been introduced into later series of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' and was previously unknown to the stalwart characters, Compo and Clegg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First of the Summer Wine, Uncovered |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082703/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The revived series of British science fiction television program ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its television [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s use retroactive continuity as a plot device. 
**Show runner [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|fifth series finale]] depicted the Doctor [[reset button technique|rebooting the universe]]. In answer to a fan's question, Moffat tweeted: "The whole universe came exactly as it was. Except for any continuity errors I need to explain away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724045625/http://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |title=Steven Moffat: ...The whole universe... |work=Steven Moffat on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]], Moffat introduces new aliens the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]], who erase your memory of them the moment you look away. Commenting on this device, writer [[MaryAnn Johanson]] writes, "That could be happening throughout this story... indeed, through the entire history of ''Doctor Who''. Moffat has just created a pretty much unassailable narratively sound reason for inserting retcons ''anywhere'' throughout the half-century history of the show."{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
**In the [[The Name of the Doctor|seventh series finale]], Moffat creates a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the [[War Doctor]] in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]".&lt;ref name="HurtDoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10065201/Doctor-Who-The-Name-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html|title=Doctor Who: The Name of the Doctor, BBC One, review|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=Hogan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown in the mini-episode "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" [[retroactive continuity|retroactively inserted]] into the show's fictional chronology between the [[Eighth Doctor|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.&lt;ref name="HurtDoctorNumber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533505/doctor-who-steven-moffat-on-regeneration-limit.html?rss|title='Doctor Who': Steven Moffat on regeneration limit|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Rigby, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", Moffat revealed, that at the last instant of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the Doctor hid his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
** In the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'', created by [[Russell T Davies]], a drug used to erase the memory of characters is called "retcon"; the use of the drug is often referred to by characters as "retconning".{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==''Star Trek'' in various media==

*When ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' was released in 1979, [[Gene Roddenberry]] claimed that the radically different appearance of the [[Klingon]]s in the film was how they were always supposed to have looked, but they did not have the budget for it in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the 1990s, an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' featured three Klingon characters from the original series, made to fit the new look. However, the later episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]", used footage from the original series with old-look Klingons; Commander [[Worf]] acknowledged their different appearance, saying it was "a long story" and, after receiving incredulous looks, added with a scowl "we do not discuss it with outsiders."
*A 2005, two-episode arc of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'', "[[Affliction (Enterprise episode)|Affliction]]"/"[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]", revealed that the Klingons that appeared in the 1960s episodes were the product of genetic engineering using augmented human [[genes]]. This explanation was used in [[Shane Johnson (author)|Shane Johnson]]'s 1989 ''The Worlds of the Federation'': "The 'Klingons' encountered along the Federation border with the Empire were a Klingon-human fusion, genetically created to infiltrate the Federation. The interception of the Amar transmission during the V'Ger incident revealed the true nature of the Imperial Klingon race and stunned Federation science. Before that time, no one had suspected the Klingons were capable of such advanced genetic engineering, and a great deal of rethinking was done concerning the level of Klingon technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Shane|last2=Punchatz|first2=Don Ivan|title=The Worlds of the Federation|date=1989|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=9780671708139|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; John M. Ford, in ''The Final Reflection'', suggests that human-Klingon fusions are similar to the human-Vulcan fusion that resulted in Spock's birth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Video games==

*The chronology of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series was subject to much debate among fans until an official timeline was printed in the collector's book ''[[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|Hyrule Historia]]'', released in Japan on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |title=Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070944/http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |title=Nintendo of Europe &amp;#124; Nintendo |publisher=Officialnintendomagazine.co.uk |date=2015-08-15 |accessdate=2015-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyrule Historia contains a timeline that explains how each game fits within the storyline. This includes introducing a three-way split after ''Ocarina of Time''. ''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' helps explain the appearance of multiple Zelda, Link and Ganondorf characters across hundreds of years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*The original ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'' trilogy for the NES was followed years later by a new series of sequels produced by [[Team Ninja]] beginning with ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' for the Xbox in 2004. However, the second generation of ''Ninja Gaiden'' video games, being prequels to original series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522141623/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-22 |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Preview for 360 from |publisher=1UP.com |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2015-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/ninja_gaiden_2/preview-948.html |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Interview for Xbox 360 |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205161412/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ninjagaidenii/news.html?sid=6191514&amp;part=rss&amp;subj=6191514 ]&lt;/ref&gt; has many differences from the NES trilogy. The character design of [[Ryu Hayabusa]] in the new games is now based on the ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'' incarnation of the character with long hair and green eyes, the character design of Ryu's father, Ken Hayabusa, has been updated as well, the character now being addressed in the English versions by his original name in the Japanese versions (Jo Hayabusa), and producer Tomonobu Itagaki hints at the possibility that Sonia, a character from the new games, might be Irene Lew from the original series.&lt;ref name="gamespot1"/&gt; With the release of ''[[Dead or Alive: Dimensions]]'' in 2011, it has been revealed that Sonia is indeed Irene Lew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video game | title = Dead or Alive: Dimensions | developer = Team Ninja| publisher = Tecmo| date = 2011-05-24| platform = Nintendo 3DS| version = 1.0| level = Chapter 2| quote = '''Ryu Hayabusa''': Hayate, meet Irene /...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a-mn2EVpFI&amp;t=10m7s |title=Dead or Alive Dimensions Nintendo 3DS Chronicle Mode Chapter 2 Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', the character [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] serves as [[Solid Snake]]'s commanding officer and is apparently revealed near the end of the game to also be the main antagonist. However, ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' establishes the antagonist character to actually be a body double of the real Big Boss, called Venom Snake, who is killed by Solid Snake during this encounter. The original Big Boss later becomes the antagonist in the series' second entry, ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title= Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain |developer= Kojima Productions |publisher= Konami |date= 2015-09-01 |platform= PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC |version= |scene= |level= Truth: The Man Who Sold The World |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the ending of 2006's ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', Sonic and Elise blow out the flame of Solaris, undoing all changes made by Iblis and causing the entire story to never happen; thus undoing all the inconsistencies the game's plot caused. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Ignored sequels in various media==

*The film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' loosely continues the storylines of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', and disregards the events of ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=superman-returns |title=Movies |publisher=Superman Homepage |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], nor does it include story elements from either ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) or ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as [[Story within a story#Film within a film|fictional films]], as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. The film ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' is a direct sequel to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', dismissing the events that take place in the sequels ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'', ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]''. The subsequent film ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' follows the new continuity of ''Halloween H20'', however, it retcons that film's ending in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karina Wilson |url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1970s |title=Horror Film History — Horror Films in the 1970s |publisher=Horrorfilmhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 film, [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'']], will be a direct sequel to the [[Halloween (1978 film)|original film]] while disregarding the previous sequels from [[canon (fiction)|canon]], and [[retcon]]ing the ending of the first film.&lt;ref name="DontPeople"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/danny-mcbride-halloween-just-hope-dont-fk-piss-people-off-183213419.html |title=Danny McBride on 'Halloween': 'I just hope that we don't f*** it up and piss people off' |last=Bierly |first=Mandi |date=2017-11-13 |website=[[Yahoo!]] |access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The film ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' is a sequel to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ignores the events of ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64113/the-exorcist-iii.html |title=The Exorcist III (2015), directed by William Peter Blatty &amp;#124; Film review |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Highlander II: The Quickening]]'' is a sequel to the first film, but its events are ignored by later films in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qwipster.net/highlander3.htm |title=Highlander: The Final Dimension review (1994) Highlander 3 - Qwipster's Movie Reviews |publisher=Qwipster.net |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Highlander: Endgame]]'' ignores the events of both ''Highlander II'' and ''[[Highlander III: The Sorcerer]]'' and only follows the events of the [[Highlander: The Series|TV series]] and the first film.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' and its prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' follow the continuity of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ignoring the events of the other sequels.
*The fifth film in the [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator series]], ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015), completely disregards the events of the third and fourth Terminator films, ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009). In the upcoming [[Terminator 6|sixth Terminator film]] in 2019, ''Terminator Genisys'' itself will be ignored, in addition to ignoring the 2003 and 2009 sequels. Only the [[The Terminator|original 1984 film]] and the first sequel ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) will be considered canon to the 2019 film.

'''London Underground anagram map''' is a [[parody]] map of the [[London Underground]] with the station and line names replaced with [[anagram]]s.  The anagram map was circulated on the web in February 2006.

== Controversy ==
The map was featured on thousands of [[blogs]] before a [[Transport for London]] lawyer requested that the map be removed. It inspired some people to create anagram versions of their hometown's [[rapid transit|metro]] system with similar legal repercussions. The fact that it was appreciated internationally, despite some not knowing the stations behind the anagrams, is a recognition of [[Harry Beck (graphic designer)|Harry Beck's]] iconic [[Tube map]] design.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Origin of the anagram map==

The map was created by 'Barry Heck' using a [[photoshopped]] [[Tube map]] and an online anagram generator, on 7 February 2006. It was originally shown in a thread on the Thingbox chat forum and, after being submitted by one of the site owners, appeared on [[BoingBoing]] a couple of days later receiving 31,000 hits within the next six days. (The name Barry Heck is a [[pseudonym]] chosen because it is an anagram and [[spoonerism]] of [[Harry Beck (graphic designer)|Harry Beck]].)

The idea came from [[The Great Bear (lithograph)|The Great Bear]], a 1992 artwork by UK artist [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]] on display at [[Tate Modern]] in London, but it was not until Dorian Lynskey's music genre tube map appeared in a newspaper in 2006 that Barry Heck decided to make it. 

In 2000, Scottish artist Mark Campbell created the Glasgow Anagram Tour&lt;ref&gt;The Glasgow Anagram Tour was created as Part of Scotland Year of the Artist 2000 part of the celebrations to mark the millennium. Created by Mark Campbell, it consisted of a website, a large illuminated Map, a series of animations that were shown on the large screen on Buchanan St in Glasgow) and a pop-out Anagram Map of Glasgow designed by Mark Campbell and published by the Map Group.&lt;/ref&gt; which involved a large light box anagram map of glasgow and Pop-out Maps with anagrams of Glasgow's cultural establishments which were for sale to commemorate Scotland's Year of the Artist 2000.

Transport for London claimed the image was a copyright infringement and had one of their lawyers ask for the map to be removed from the web. The site hosting it complied and it was removed on 22 February 2006 with the action being reported on BoingBoing again.

Transport for London also censored other websites that hosted the image such as the www.geofftech.co.uk site. But an online backlash against TFL's lawyers meant that many other websites made mirrors of Geoff's page, thus resulting in more copies of tube map "mash-ups" on the internet.

The owner of the site – [[Geoff Marshall]], was interviewed on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] by Chris Vallance about "map-mashing" (making parody maps) in which the London Underground anagram map was discussed. This was broadcast on 14 March 2006.

==Blogging==

BoingBoing has reported that [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Toronto]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Chicago]], [[Oslo]], [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Atlanta]], [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], and [[Vienna]] had anagram maps created for their metro systems, inspired by the London map.

The anagram map was featured in thousands of blogs and its progress can be tracked at [[Technorati.com]]. Because of similarities with [[Neverwhere]] it was mentioned in the letters page of author [[Neil Gaiman]]'s blog, with his fanbase ensuring over 1,700 others linked to it. But nearly 21,000 other blogs linked to BoingBoing's article alone.

==Stations not anagrammatized==

[[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and [[Hornchurch]] stations could not be properly anagrammatized and instead were split into their component words and reversed to produce "Wall Black" and "Church Horn" respectively. Burch Chow/Chow Burch (from the gynaecological Burch procedure) was rejected as an anagram for [[Bow Church]], because of a dislike for uncommon proper nouns, leaving it reversed as "Church Bow". [[Bank–Monument station|Bank]] was anagrammatized into 'nabk', the edible berry of the [[Ziziphus lotus]] tree.

Not all derivatives for other cities followed this pattern. For Toronto, the impossible stations were named after streets, so the namesake's designation as "Avenue" or "Street" was appended before anagramming (Queen became Queen Street became Queerest Ten).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmartz.com/extras/ttc/ John Martz Illustration and Comics].

'''Marc Fumaroli''' (born 10 June 1932 in [[Marseille]]), is a French historian and essayist. Fumaroli was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 2 March 1995 and became its director. He is also a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]], the sister academy devoted to high erudition. Following his appointment to a chair in Seventeenth Century Studies at the University of Paris-IV, La Sorbonne (1980), he was elected to a Chair in Rhetoric and Society in Europe (16th and 17th century) at the [[Collège de France]]. He held it from 1986 to 2002, until mandatory retirement, and is now an emeritus professor. He is acknowledged for the revival of [[Rhetoric]] as field of study of European culture, in a sharp move away from both structuralism and post-modernism. His pioneering work remains ''L'Age De l'Eloquence'' (1980).  This massive work redrew the map of rhetorical scholarship across Europe. Fumaroli was also a member of the [[University of Chicago]]'s Committee on Social Thought.  He is a recipient of the prestigious [[Balzan Prize]], the "Nobel" of the humanities (in 2001). He is a foreign member of the [[British Academy]] and of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

{{About|the film}}
'''''Matula''''' ({{IPA-id|maˈtula|}}) is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (present-day Indonesia) which was directed by [[Tan Tjoei Hock]] and produced by [[The Teng Chun]] of Java Industrial Film. The [[black-and-white]] film, now likely lost, follows a young man who tries to give a woman's soul to a [[dukun|shaman]] as payment for being made handsome.

==Plot==
A rich yet hideously deformed youth named Matula (Ferry Kock) visits a ''[[dukun]]'' (shaman) named Tello, asking to be made handsome. Tello agrees, then does the deed. When Matula asks him to name his price, Tello asks to be paid with a soul. Using his magic, Tello arranges for Emma (Dewi Mada), the daughter of a rich businessman, to meet Matula in a plantation, where Matula can convince her to come with him. Upon realising what is happening, Emma's father Johan and her fiancé Paul chase down Matula. They are too late, as Tello has taken Emma's soul. The four men fight, and though Paul's soul is almost taken, Johan is able to defeat Tello with a bamboo shaft. Defeated, Tello returns Emma's soul. Matula returns to his original form, reeking of death; Tello then demands his soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Matula}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Matula'' was produced by [[The Teng Chun]] for Action Film, a subsidiary of his company New Java Industrial Film. It was directed by [[Tan Tjoei Hock]], a former theatre assistant, who had worked who had made his directorial debut the preceding year with ''[[Dasima]]''; Tan also handled cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Matula}}; {{harvnb|JCG, Tan Tjoei Hock}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Music was handled by [[Sardi (musician)|Mas Sardi]].{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=322}}

It was written by Ferry Kock (who also starred), a former stage actor with the touring troupe [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]] who had made his film debut in 1940 with ''[[Rentjong Atjeh]]''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=169}} The [[black-and-white]] film also starred Dewi Mada, [[Mohamad Mochtar]], and Bissu.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Matula}}

==Release and reception==
''Matula'' was released in 1941, reaching [[Surabaya]] by late January. Open to audiences aged 17 and older, it was advertised as "a film of black magic (''guna-guna''), action, and romance".{{efn|Original: "... ''een film over zwarte Magie (goena-goena) - romantiek en actie.''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} A review in the Surabaya-based ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'' stated that the film was "in every way successful",{{efn|Original: "''... in alle opzichten goed geslaagd.''"}} particularly praising Kock's performance.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}

The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]. The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

'''Monte Bank''', '''Mountebank''', '''Spanish Monte''' and '''Mexican Monte''', sometimes just '''Monte''', is a Spanish gambling [[card game]] and was known in the 19th century as the national card game of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dick|first1=William Brisbane|title=The Modern Pocket Hoyle: Containing All the Games of Skill and Chance as Played in this Country at the Present Time, Being an Authority on All Disputed Points|date=1868|publisher=Dick &amp; Fitzgerald|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lmIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=national+card+game+of+the+mexicans#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20card%20game%20of%20the%20mexicans&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately derives from [[Basset (card game)|basset]], where the banker (dealer) pays on matching cards. The term "monte" has also been used for a variety of other gambling games, especially varieties of three-card [[poker]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, pg. 162, David Parlett – Oxford University Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the swindle [[three-card monte]].

==History==
The two-card version Mexican monte, and the four-card version Spanish monte, are card games played in Spain before coming to Mexico and then the American Southwest. They were originally played with [[Spanish playing cards]] and later with cards made expressly for the game, known as Monte cards, as well as modified standard decks. These games became popular in the United States, specially in Texas, after they were brought back by returning troops from the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Bridget and Rhodes, Sue (2002) [https://web.archive.org/web/20100811061339/http://www.shasta.com/suesgoodco/respite/ "The Soldier's Respite Civil War Gambling, How to Play Faro, Monte &amp;amp; Dice"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Gomes Cassidy &amp; Joan Houston Hall.

Also (1857) San Francisco Call (CA) 6 Jan. 2/2 (OED2), {{ISBN|0-674-00884-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained popular through the end of the century particularly in the [[American Old West|American West]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontiergamblers.com/page15.php "Monte"] Frontier Gamblers&lt;/ref&gt; and even among the American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Wayland, Virginia (1973) "Princeton's Apache Playing Cards" [http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/pulc/pulc_v_34_n_3.pdf ''The Princeton University Library Chronicle'' 34(3):] pp. 147–157, pages 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;Nelson, Walter (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120227063009/http://www.st-max.org/files/MerryGamester.pdf ''The Merry Gamester or Games Through the Ages'' (4th edition)] Merchant Adventures Press, Reseda, California, page 52, {{OCLC|51859146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Monte uses a deck of 40 [[playing cards]] (removing the 10s, 9s, and 8s from a standard 52-card deck). One or more people may play against the house, known as the "bank" or "banker", who is the dealer.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;Arnold, Peter (1989) "Monte Bank" ''The Complete Book of Card Games'' Gallery Books, New York, page 214-215, {{ISBN|0-8317-1530-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Monte===
In some versions, the monte banker, or dealer, must have the whole of his bank, or money which he risks at the game, in sight upon the table.&lt;ref name=Dick/&gt; The play begins with the dealer drawing one card from the bottom of the deck and placing it face up on the table, this card becomes the “bottom layout”.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Similarly, another card is drawn from the top of the deck, known as the “top layout”,&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; and placed face up on the table, usually closer to the dealer. The remaining stack of cards, called the “monte”, is placed face-down in front of the dealer. Sometimes a monte box was used to hold the monte.

The players, sometimes known as punters, place bets on the layout of their choice, or on both. Starting with the player to banker's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, each player has one chance to place his stake on the layouts.  After the last player has placed his stake, the banker turns the monte face-up.  The card now showing is known as the “gate”.  The banker pays, one for one, any bet on a matching [[Suit (cards)|suit]].  The banker takes all the bets from a layout if the “gate” did not match the suit in the layout.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt;

===Spanish Monte===
The play in four-card monte is similar. Instead of one card in the bottom and top layouts, the dealer takes two cards from the top and two more from the bottom of the deck and place them all slightly apart upon the table to form the "bottom layout" and the "top layout", respectively.&lt;ref name="DiagramGroup"&gt;"The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Card Games", [https://books.google.com/books?id=TcG-U30Is-YC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=Monte+Bank+card+game&amp;lr=&amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;q=Monte%20Bank%20card%20game&amp;f=false/ pg. 278] Diagram Group 1995 {{ISBN|0-8069-1330-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal is valid whatever suit appears, even if all four cards are of the same suit. Except for the banker, each player may bet on either pair or both, by placing the bet between that pair. If the “gate” card's suit matches one or both of the cards in a layout, or even cards in both layouts, the players win any bets, but if no card is matched all bets are lost.&lt;ref name="DiagramGroup"/&gt; This decreases the house odds somewhat, as there are frequently two suits in a layout, increasing the possibility of a match.

===Coup===
After the hand, known as "coup", the banker collects all losing bets and pays the winners one to one,&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; all players whose bets matched the “gate” card in the layout. He then takes both layouts off the table, placing them aside to form a discard pile. Turning the "monte" face down, he takes the used “gate” card from the bottom of the deck and also puts it on the discard pile. He then deals for the next layout without shuffling or cutting the cards.

===Change of banker===
The bank and deal remain with one player up to a maximum of five "coups",&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; six, or any previously agreed number of hands,&lt;ref name="DiagramGroup"/&gt; when all of the cards are reshuffled together and in friendly play the bank (dealer) passes to the left. At least ten cards should remain unplayed to prevent players from calculating which suits still remain in the deck. If at any time the bank is emptied, bank and deal pass to the left. In casino play, the house retains the bank.

The '''National Association of Family Entertainment Centers''' ('''NAFEC''') is a division of the International Laser Tag Association, Inc. (ILTA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fecoperator.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=162 NAFEC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasertag.org/ ILTA]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[trade group]] for the [[laser tag]] industry that started in 1996. NAFEC is the non-profit developer and operator association for the family entertainment industry. They help members become better informed through research, services, and communications with all levels of the industry. NAFEC has three levels of memberships: Developer, Operator and Supplier.

NAFEC as of 2011 has over 200 members nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fecoperator.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=162 Over 200 members in NAFEC]&lt;/ref&gt; They provide members with up to date data on safety, operations, [[marketing]], [[seminar]]s, [[trade show]]s and much more.

NAFEC works closely with the law makers of the [[United States|US]] to ensure that new and existing laws do not infringe on the rights of its members.

==History==
The birth of NAFEC came after the 2009 dissolution of the premier [[Family Entertainment Center|FEC]] [[trade association]] the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) and subsequent merger with IAAPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final]&lt;/ref&gt;  This new organization was started with many industry recognized and award winning businesses and vendors.  Some of those people include board members Jay Tritely from [http://www.alleycatsbowl.com Alley Cats, Arlington TX], Jarett Waite from [http://www.laser-mania.com Laser Mania Family Fun Center, St. George, UT],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasertagconvention.com/golden-phaser-award/2010-winners.html  Jarett Waite - 2010 Operator of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt; Davor Franicevich from [http://www.ltofbr.com Laser Tag of Baton Rouge, Laser Tag of New Orleans] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasertagconvention.com/golden-phaser-award/2009-winners.html Davor Franicevich - 2009 Operator of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILTA is the internationally recognized expert on laser tag and all things related to laser tag.  A majority of the ILTA members are FECs and their reach into the international FEC market has been extensive since their first [[trade show]] exhibit in 2010.  The ILTA has also created the first ever Laser Tag Museum where you can view items from the infancy of laser tag up to today's modern equipment.

The National Day of Reason was created by the [[American Humanist Association]] and the [[Washington Area Secular Humanists]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nationaldayofreason.org/about-the-national-day-of-reason/|title = About Us|date = |accessdate = 7 May 2015|website = National Day of Reason|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to serving as a holiday for [[constitutionalists]] and [[secularists]], the National Day of Reason was created in response to the perceived [[unconstitutionality]] of the [[National Day of Prayer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the organizers of the National Day of Reason, the National Day of Prayer, "violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] because it asks [[federal government of the united states|federal]], [[state government in the United States|state]], and [[Local government in the United States|local government]] entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2005, the New York city-based Center for Atheism began to strongly advocate for observers of the National Day of Reason to celebrate in a positive manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = How to Separate Church and State: A Manual from the Trenches|last = McGowan|first = Barry|publisher = Hufton Mueller, LLC|year = 2012|isbn = 9780615638027|location = Alburtis, Pennsylvania|pages = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to donate blood as a group in order to make a "public statement about the life-affirming ideas of nonbelievers."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The National Day of Reason has taken some time to gain popularity, however, over time, more local and state governments have been giving the Day of Reason official recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0501/On-National-Day-of-Prayer-growing-ranks-say-reason-should-have-its-day-too|title = On National Day of Prayer, Growing Ranks Say "Reason" Should Have Its Day, Too|last = Bruinius|first = Harry|date = 1 May 2014|work = The Christian Science Monitor|access-date = 7 May 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012, Representative [[Pete Stark]] supported a proclamation in support of the National Day of Reason in the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the first time, a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] to honor the National Day of Reason was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/05/07/national-day-of-prayer.html|title = Faithful Remember Military, Others on National Day of Prayer|last = Viviano|first = JoAnne|date = 7 May 2015|work = The Columbus Dispatch|access-date = 7 May 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution, U.S. House Resolution 228, was proposed by Representative [[Mike Honda]] on April 29, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2015-04-national-day-of-reason-resolution-introduced-for-the|title = National Day of Reason Resolution Introduced for the First Time in U.S. House of Representatives|date = 29 April 2015|accessdate = 7 May 2015|website = American Humanist Association|publisher = |last = Miller|first = Merrill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another resolution to designate the National Day of Reason was sponsored by Representative [[Jared Huffman]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20180502/NEWS/180509954|title=Huffman counters Trump with proposed National Day of Reason|last=Halstead|first=Richard|date=2 May 2018|work=Marin Independent Journal|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Theatre of Brent''' is a [[British comedy]] [[double act]], in the form of a mock two-man theatre troupe.  [[Patrick Barlow]] plays Desmond Olivier Dingle, the troupe's founder, Artistic Director and Chief Executive.  The role of his assistant (or as Desmond likes to call him, "my entire company") was first performed by Julian Hough. It has subsequently been taken by various actors, including [[Jim Broadbent]] (as Wallace), Robert Austin (as Bernard), and [[John Ramm]] (as Raymond Box).

Their 1998 production ''Love Upon the Throne'' (featuring Barlow as [[Prince Charles]] and Ramm as [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]) was nominated for a [[Laurence Olivier Theatre Award]] for Best Comedy. Barlow has written a number of books under the banner of The National Theatre of Brent, two of which, ''Shakespeare: The Truth!'' and ''All the World's a Globe: From Lemur to Cosmonaut'', have been adapted for radio.  Their radio production in 2007 was ''The Arts and How They Was Done'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071pjt/episodes/guide|work=[[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]|title=The Arts and How They Was Done|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[BBC Radio 4]], starring Barlow and Ramm, with [[Harriet Walter]] as guest star.

In September 2011 the National Theatre of Brent produced ''Giant Ladies That Changed The World'', the story of the [[Suffragette]]s, as five 15-minute episodes broadcast as the ''15 Minute Drama'' following ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' on Radio 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014l01n|work=BBC Radio 4|title=15 Minute Drama - Giant Ladies That Changed the World|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''No Longer Human'''''|人間失格|Ningen Shikkaku}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[novel]] by [[Osamu Dazai]]. Published after ''[[Run Melos]]'' and ''[[The Setting Sun]]'', ''No Longer Human'' is considered Dazai's masterpiece  and ranks as the second-best selling novel in Japan, behind [[Natsume Sōseki]]'s ''[[Kokoro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comipress.com/news/2007/08/22/2529 | title=Takeshi Obata Illustrates Cover for Best-Selling Japanese Novel | date=August 22, 2007 | publisher=[[ComiPress]] | accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literal translation of the title, discussed by Donald Keene in his preface to the English translation, is "Disqualified from Being Human". (The Italian translation was titled ''Lo squalificato'', ''The Disqualified''.)

This novel, despite being serialized as a work of fiction in 1948, is narrated in the first person and contains several elements which betray an [[autobiographical]] basis, such as suicide—a recurring theme in the author's life. Many also believe the book to have been his [[will (law)|will]], as he took his own life shortly after the last part of the book was published, on June 13, 1948.

One modern analyst has proposed Dazai was suffering from [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] when he wrote the book.&lt;ref&gt;Betrayed as Boys: Psychodynamic Treatment of Sexually Abused Men, Japanese edit pp. 448–451 by Naoko Miyaji (2005, mainly [[Richard Gartner]]) {{ISBN|4-86182-013-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot outline ==
''No Longer Human'' is told in the form of notebooks left by one {{nihongo|Ōba Yōzō|大庭葉蔵}}, a troubled man incapable of revealing his true [[self]] to others, and who is instead forced to uphold a facade of hollow jocularity.

The novel is composed of three chapters, or "memoranda", which chronicle the life of Ōba from early childhood to late twenties.

* '''First Memorandum''': Overcome by an intense feeling of [[social alienation|alienation]] and otherness and finding it nearly impossible to understand those who surround him who live in [[egoism (ethical)|egoism]] and [[bad faith]], Ōba can't help but resort to buffoonery in order to establish [[interpersonal relationship]]s. He is abused by a female servant during his childhood, but decides reporting it would be useless.
* '''Second Memorandum''': Ōba becomes increasingly concerned over the potential penetrability of his cheerful facade by his schoolmate Takeichi, who sees through his false buffoonery. Ōba befriends him to prevent Takeichi from revealing his secret. As he shows Takeichi the ghost-like paintings of [[Amedeo Modigliani]], he realizes that certain artists express the inner truth of human cruelty through their own trauma. Ōba paints a self-portrait inspired by these artists, which is so dreadful that he dares not show it to anyone except Takeichi, who esteems the picture. He neglects his [[university]] studies, out of fear of collective life. Under the influence of a fellow artist he meets at a painting class, Horiki, he descends into a vicious cycle of drinking, smoking and [[harlot]]ry, culminating in a [[one-night stand]] with a married woman with whom he attempts to commit double suicide via drowning. Though he survives, she dies, leaving him with nothing but an excruciating feeling of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].
* '''Third Memorandum, Part One''': Ōba is expelled from university, and comes under the care of a friend of the family. He tries to have a normal relationship with a single mother, serving as a surrogate father to her little girl, but abandons them in favor of living with the madam of a bar he patronizes. Since then he tries to believe the meaning of society for an individual is to escape out of fear of humanity. He  drinks heavily, inspired by [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]. Later, he falls into a relationship with a young and naive woman who wants him to stop drinking.
* '''Third Memorandum, Part Two''': Thanks to this woman's grounding influence on his life, Ōba stops drinking and finds gainful work as a cartoonist. Then Horiki shows up, turning Ōba to self-destructive behavior again. Worse, at the moment of recalling ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' by Dostoevsky while he discusses the [[opposite (semantics)|antonym]] of crime with Horiki, Ōba becomes estranged from his wife following an incident where she is sexually assaulted by a casual acquaintance. Over time Ōba becomes an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a [[morphine]] addict. He is eventually confined to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] and, upon release, moves to an isolated place, concluding the story with numb [[self-reflection]] after profound despair.

The story is bookended with two other, shorter, chapters from the point of view of a neutral observer, who sees three photos of Ōba and eventually tracks down one of the characters mentioned in the notebooks who knew him personally.

Ōba refers to himself throughout the book using the [[Japanese grammar#Reflexive pronouns|reflexive pronoun]] {{nihongo|"Jibun"|自分}}, whereas the [[Japanese grammar#Pronouns|personal pronoun]] {{nihongo|"Watashi"|私}} is used both in the [[foreword]] and [[afterword]] to the book by the writer, whose name is unclear. The name "Ōba" is actually taken from one of Dazai's early works, {{nihongo|"Petals of Buffoonery"|道化の華}}.

==Adaptations==

===Movie===
''Ningen Shikkaku'' was adapted to film in 2009, the 100th anniversary of Dazai's birth. The film was directed by [[Genjiro Arato]], the producer responsible for the award-winning ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. Filming started in July, and it was released on February 20, 2010.
The film stars [[Toma Ikuta]] (24) as Ōba Yōzō, a young man who finds it hard to relate to the world around him, but masks this sense of alienation with a jovial demeanor. Still, his life spirals toward self-destruction. Actress [[Satomi Ishihara]] (22) plays one of the several women in his life, and the only one he marries.
The film was marketed outside Japan under the title ''Fallen Angel''.&lt;br/&gt;

A new version of ''Ningen Shikkaku'' is to be released in 2019, starring [[Shun Oguri]] in the role of writer Osamu Dazai. Movie is directed by photographer and film director [[Mika Ninagawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0105313?fbclid=IwAR1JLY0wbgN8smFW32sHuk9AAWmHrVw0P5MZPNgv5MjNk35iGgsBfMZy6sM|title=小栗旬、太宰治役で減量　蜷川実花監督と「人間失格」誕生秘話映画化|last=|first=|date=December 3, 2018|website=cinematoday.jp|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203001402/https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0105313?fbclid=IwAR1JLY0wbgN8smFW32sHuk9AAWmHrVw0P5MZPNgv5MjNk35iGgsBfMZy6sM|archive-date=December 2, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ningenshikkaku-movie.com/|title=Ningen shikkaku Official site|last=|first=|date=December 3, 2018|website=ningenshikkaku-movie.com|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203010706/http://ningenshikkaku-movie.com/|archive-date=December 2, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsmovie2019.tumblr.com/post/180727338659/%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%E4%BA%BA%E9%96%93%E5%A4%B1%E6%A0%BC%E8%A3%BD%E4%BD%9C%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B|title=映画『人間失格』製作開始!!|last=|first=|date=December 3, 2018|website=nsmovie2019.tumblr.com|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203010634/https://nsmovie2019.tumblr.com/post/180727338659/%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%E4%BA%BA%E9%96%93%E5%A4%B1%E6%A0%BC%E8%A3%BD%E4%BD%9C%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B|archive-date=December 2, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yasunori Ninose created another manga version of ''No Longer Human'', titled ''Ningen Shikkaku Kai'' (壊,"kai" = "destruction"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:マンガ界の奇才が太宰に挑む　『人間失格 壊』|url=http://www.menscyzo.com/2010/02/post_875.html|website=Men's Cyzo|accessdate=21 February 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; serialized in ''[[Champion Red]]'' from April to July in 2010. Unlike Furuya's version, this manga depicts human beings' negative emotion and sexual intercourse as tentacles, which have enthralled Ninose since he was five years old.

A third version ({{ISBN|978-4872578102}}), a straight retelling of the story in its original pre-WWII setting, was commissioned for the ''[[Manga de Dokuha]]'' series (comic adaptations of classic literature), published by [[Gakken]]. An English edition was published in online format by [[JManga]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Longer Human|url=http://www.jmanga.com/no-longer-human|publisher=JManga|accessdate=10 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514070022/http://www.jmanga.com/no-longer-human|archivedate=14 May 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
William Bradbury of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' called it a timeless novel, saying that "The struggle of the individual to fit into a normalizing society remains just as relevant today as it was at the time of writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradbury|first1=William|title=No Longer Human|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2014/10/25/books/book-reviews/longer-human|website=The Japan Times|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serdar Yegulalp of Genji Press noted the strength of Dazai in portraying the situation of the protagonist, describing the novel as "bleak in a way that is both extreme and yet also strangely unforced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yegulalp|first1=Serdar|title=Book Reviews: No Longer Human (Osamu Dazai)|url=http://www.genjipress.com/2007/04/no-longer-human-osamu-dazai.html|website=Genji Press|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both critics have noted the autobiographical qualities of the novel, but claim that Dazai's style causes readers to connect to Ōba rather than focus on the author.

Perceptor ('''Percepto''' in [[France]], '''Supervista''' ("Superviser") in [[Italy]]) transforms into a [[microscope]] that also functions as a [[telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;Vibe magazine - August 2002 - Page 172&lt;/ref&gt; He is a renowned Cybertronian Autobot scientist and craves knowledge. His discoveries have helped his allies on many occasions. His specialties lie in [[metallurgy]], [[electrical engineering]], and other sciences closely related to Transformer [[physiology]] though his intelligence has made him reliable in many fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he is an awful bore, but all the Autobots estimate and like him because of his good nature. He is always ready to help and to save everybody (even [[Megatron]] himself) whose life is in danger. Engaging in a physical melee is not his preference, but when he fights Decepticons he uses a concussion rifle.

According to the voice actor [[Paul Eiding]], Perceptor was voiced with inspiration from [[C-3PO]] and [[The Absent-Minded Professor]] with a British accent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/interviews-27/tfw2005-interviews-generation-1-perceptor-paul-eiding-168579/&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceptor was named the oddest thing that G1 Transformers transform into by [[Topless Robot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_9_oddest_things_g1_transformers_transformed_in.php |title=The 9 Oddest Things G1 Transformers Transformed Into |author= Ethan Kaye | date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Comics===
[[File:Circuitbreaker-autobots.jpg|left|thumb|Circuit Breaker leads a giant Autobot she created from parts of other Autobots against the Decepticon Battlechargers in Marvel's Transformers comics.]]

Perceptor was originally part of an Autobot group in the "Dead End" region of [[Cybertron]]. Serving as the group's scientist, Perceptor would nonetheless lead a mission to save the captured [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] from being executed by the local Decepticon commander [[Straxus|Lord Straxus]]. Later, he was opposed to the plan to save the captive scientist Spanner, but was outvoted. Accompanying the others to blow up the Decepticon base, they were horrified to discover that the Decepticons had built Spanner into the Space Bridge itself. Destroying the Bridge as a mercy-killing, Perceptor and his comrades ([[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], Blaster, [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]] and [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]]), with no chance of escaping to Cybertron, crossed the bridge to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;"Transformers" #17-18 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Official Overstreet Comic Book Companion, 11th Edition, Page 257 by Robert M. Overstreet, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After an attack by [[Megatron]], they were then captured by [[Circuit Breaker (Transformers)|Circuit Breaker]] and her [[Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team]], taken to her lab and then dissected. After capturing the [[Aerialbots]] she encountered a new problem - the Decepticon [[Battlechargers]] [[Runabout (Transformers)|Runabout]] and [[Runamuck (Transformers)|Runamuck]] were causing mayhem across America. Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she created a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then used them to battle the two Decepticons, who were attacking the [[Statue of Liberty]]. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released.

After a side-adventure in the U.K. comics in which they encountered (and were almost killed by) the future Decepticon [[Galvatron]], Perceptor's group linked up with the main Autobots - only to learn of the death of [[Optimus Prime]].

In issue #27, "King of the Hill!", Perceptor summoned his fellow Autobots [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Hot Spot (Transformers)|Hot Spot]], [[Jetfire]], [[Omega Supreme]], [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and [[Silverbolt]] in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon [[Trypticon]] the leader was chosen - [[Grimlock]].

He soon regretted this, as Grimlock became more and more tyrannical. After Blaster returned (having gone rogue over Grimlock's leadership) Perceptor was one of those who welcomed him back.

After Prime's return as a [[Powermaster]], Perceptor continued to serve loyally, battling the Decepticons in the [[Arctic]] and getting jumped by the [[Seacons]] in the process. Perceptor was deactivated when [[Starscream]] blew up the Decepticon island ship with Perceptor aboard in Transformers #50.

Perceptor's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, "Back from the Dead".

The future movie continuity also appeared in the "Space Pirates" arc of the UK comic, where he was defeated in the [[Quintesson]] attack on [[Autobot City]].

Perceptor would appear in the [[Transformers: Generation 2]] comics as one of the Autobot scientists studying the victims of the [[Swarm (Transformers)|Swarm]], indicating he was revived by [[Nucleon (Transformers)|Nucleon]] at some point.

===Animated series===
Perceptor made his first appearance in "[[Dinobots|Dinobot]] Island Part 2" when he assisted Chip Chase at understanding some unusual phenomena occurring in that episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119132401/http://anime.com/Transformers/ |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }} Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

His first major role is in "Microbots" when Megatron acquired ''the Heart of Cybertron'', which was decimating the Autobots. He used his shrinking device to shrink himself, [[Bumblebee (Transformer)|Bumblebee]] and [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]], so they could infiltrate Megatron's body and disable the Heart of Cybertron, which he later destroyed.

In "The Golden Lagoon" episode, Perceptor with some Autobots were out until they were attacked by the Decepticon's then he and Seaspray got captured as they were brought to Megatron's underwater headquarters. Later, Perceptor with Seaspray were brought in by Starscream to entertain him and the rest of the Decepticon's where they tried to escape but were caught by Megatron when he came back with a captured Beachcomber. Thanks to Beachcomber, Perceptor with Seaspray and Beachcomber were able to escape then headed over to the golden lagoon, filled with electrum. After meeting up with the rest of the Autobots, Perceptor joined the battle against the Decepticon's while covered in electrum as they were able to send them retreating, after their electrum wore off and when they destroy the golden lagoon.     

In the episode "The God Gambit" [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] collected data in space on a potential new power source, but was attacked by [[Astrotrain]], [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]] and Starscream. Crashing on the moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the local priests worshiped the Decepticons as "''Sky Gods''", but rebels were able to reactivate Cosmos and call for aid from the Autobots. [[Optimus Prime]] sent [[Omega Supreme]] with Perceptor and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]. Astrotrain set himself up as the chief god of the moon and forced the natives to gather energy crystals. The trip to Titan drained Omega of most of his energy, but Perceptor and Jazz were able to gather enough crystals to reactivate Omega and defeat the three Decepticons. Vowing to not let the Autobots gain the crystals, Astrotrain set up a chain reaction destroying them. The Autobots aided the natives to escape the explosion and helped them settle in another area of the moon.

Perceptor appeared in "Cosmic Rust", where he invented Corrostop and using special rust-proof formula on the [[Statue of Liberty]]. In the episode, Megatron had been infected with some disease that made him rust. Perceptor was kidnapped by the [[Stunticons]] and [[Blitzwing]] to treat Megatron's hideous rusting. He diagnoses it as "cosmic rust", and uses some of the formula on Megatron. He himself was also infected, as well as all the Autobots. He and fellow Autobot scientist [[Wheeljack]] got the Matter Duplicator to duplicate the rust-proof formula, as the key ingredient was extinct. With this, the cosmic rust was gone, and the Autobots were saved.

Perceptor would continue to appear throughout season 3, acting as [[Rodimus Prime]]'s scientific advisor. Perceptor was one of the known pre-1986 Autobots to survive ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', along with [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], Cosmos, [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]], [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]], [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], Omega Supreme, the [[Aerialbots]], the [[Protectobots]], and the [[Dinobot]]s. His role as chief Autobot scientist meant he could be used instead of either [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and Wheeljack, whose toys had been discontinued; both being killed off in ''The Transformers: The Movie''.

In episode 78, "Madman's Paradise", [[Spike Witwicky]] and his wife Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. [[Grimlock]] followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where [[Quintessons]] banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the [[Red Wizard (Transformers)|Red Wizard]]'s side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the [[Golden One]]. [[Ultra Magnus]], Blaster, [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], Rewind, [[Ramhorn]], and [[Steeljaw]] followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel all returned to Cybertron.

Perceptor last appeared in episode 93, "The Face of Ninjika". Battling over a Quadrant Lock Disc, Autobot, Decepticon, and Quintesson forces cross a rip in space and become trapped there, landing on the planet Zimojin. An inhabitant named Katsu Don, a Zamojin, removes Perceptor's Autobot sigil which had his universal emulator on it and uses it as the head and face for an ancient robot named Ninjika. Due to having his universal emulator inside his Autobot sigil, Perceptor's consciousness transferred inside the robot body, due to his real robot body suffering from transformation lock. Perceptor befriended Katsu Don as he tells him about the history of his world then they headed over to his town to warn his people about the Quintesson, who sealed the Zamojin world away with the quadrant lock. However, Perceptor ended up getting captured and was forced to give the Quintesson his universal emulator in exchange for Katsu Don safety, who was captured with him. Perceptor hacked into the Quintesson quadrant lock to help free the Zamojin world then was rescued by his Autobots friends. After the Quintesson and Cyclonus retreated off the planet, Perceptor was put back in his robot body and his transformation lock was fixed also he was very pleased to see that his new friend world was put back into right but was more pleased to hear that Katsu Don is gonna continue the work his ancestor did.        

Perceptor made an appearance in 1989, in Transformers: Victory in Japan. [[Wheeljack]], along with Perceptor and [[Minerva (Transformers)|Minerva]] were called upon to save God [[Ginrai]], who they converted into Victory Leo.

===Fun Publications===

Perceptor appeared in the Classicverse Lithograph sold at BotCon 2007.

In the story "Games of Decepticon" [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]] uses a jamming device given to him by Perceptor to disrupt the Cerebro Shells used by [[Bug Bite (Transformers)|Bugbite]] to control the Decepticons.

In ''Transformers Invasion'' Perceptor is among the Autobots in Canada who help get people to safety from an Earthquake caused by ''Shattered Glass'' [[Ultra Magnus]] using the [[Terminus Blade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Benson Yee &amp; Pete Sinclair | penciller = Dan Khanna  | inker = Jake Isenberg | story =Transformers Invasion| title =Transformers Timelines | volume = 2| issue = 7| date =2012 | publisher = [[Fun Publications]]| location = |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dreamwave Productions===
Perceptor would make his first chronological appearance in the third volume of ''The War Within'', as an Autobot scientist supporting the peace between the Autobots, Decepticons and [[Ultracons]]. [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]'s return with a massive army of Seeker clones forced Perceptor to seek a desperate solution - locating the missing Optimus Prime. Recruiting the [[Turbomaster]]s, Perceptor hoped to use his equipment to find where Optimus had been transported to - but Flash interfered with it and was transported instead. Dreamwave's closure would prevent this story from being finished.

Later, he appeared in the second volume of the Generation One series as part of an Autobot resistance movement opposed to [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. He appears pleading with the Cybertronian Council to investigate Shockwave's modifications to other Transformers, but would later join Prime's attack on Iacon.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
[[File:Gijoe-transformers.jpg|right|thumb|Transformers Perceptor, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Grimlock]] and [[Arcee]] meet [[G.I. Joe]] in the pages of Devil's Due comics crossover between the two popular series]]

Perceptor featured in the second G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers tale from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], as one of the resistance group under Ultra Magnus.

Perceptor returned in the third series of G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertonian technology on the planet. Several of the Joes, such as [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] and [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], end up piloting large, human-like robots themselves. When Cobra attacks the Joe base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. An investigation reveals a secret facility literally beneath the Joe's own HQ. Megatron's head is found, inactive and on the floor. Perceptor is enraged, believing Hawk had violated their agreement by messing around with Cybertronian technology. He is soon convinced that Hawk did not know this was happening. The existence of the facility's project, Serpentor, is discovered. A robot himself, smaller than the ones the Joe's pilot, he has the ability to take over mechanical systems with coils. Though the Transformer technology gives him trouble, all of the Joe's mechas are corrupted. Perceptor ends up personally battling [[Scarlett (G.I. Joe)|Scarlett's]] mecha, though she is not in it. Serpentor soon literally buries the entire team in rubble, leaving to conquer Cybertron.

Pursuing Serpentor to Cybertron (and unable to convince Hawk to stay behind) the group were quickly captured by Serpentor's new army, but were freed by [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] and Scarlett. Wounded by the [[Cobra Commander]] possessed Serpentor, Perceptor later recovers, laughing at Roadblock tales.

===3H Enterprises===
Perceptor appeared in a flashback scene in issue #2 of the Transformers: Universe - Wreckers comic, where Rodimus Prime consulted Quickmix, Skids, Perceptor and Rad on his plans to send out ships to gather information on threats from space after the defeat of Unicron.

===IDW Publishing===
Perceptor made his first [[IDW Publishing]] appearance in ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' issue on [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]], as the head of a team aboard the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark-17]] trying to rescue the veteran Autobot. However, the radiation filled surroundings and Kup's madness led to the failure of all rescue attempts. Perceptor then attempted to reason with Springer, agreeing with [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] that it was a waste of lives and resources - until [[Trailbreaker]] arrived.

Perceptor was on the Autobot Orbital Command Hub in ''Spotlight: Blaster''. He was present when Blaster was recovered and returned to the Autobots.

===Fun Publications===
Perceptor is mentioned in the final [[BotCon]] storyline, "Dawn of the Predacus," in which he detected the [[Tripredacus Council]]'s experiments with transwarp technology. He subsequently perished under unknown circumstances, forcing the Primal Council to replace him with the shellshocked Autobot Unit-3 in their formation of Magnaboss.

===Other media===
Perceptor appears in the [[Tfcon]] 2008 voice play prelude comic called "Ground Effects" where he detects a repeat repeat wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meesum Abidi|author-link=Meesum Abidi|title=Ground Effects|publisher=[[TFcon]]|others= Illustrator [[Dylan G.]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Perceptor reappeared in the ''Transformers: Armada'' line, this time as the name of a [[Mini-Con]] combiner formed from the members of the Street Action Team.

Perceptor's bio told how the three beings that make up Perceptor - Grindor, High Wire and Sureshock - are, despite the war raging over them, unflaggingly, unfailingly positive. They try to help all those they meet, and it is this common unity that explains why they work so well together as Perceptor. It stands as a symbol of Mini-Con unity, battling the Decepticons on their own terms, with their unbelievable coordination giving them an edge. However, this comes at a price - [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] desires their abilities, and will stop at nothing to possess them.

===Dreamwave Productions===
In the Energon comic series by Dreamwave comics Perceptor appeared in issues 27-29 of the series. He originally appeared as part of the Autobot reinforcements under [[Jetfire]] who headed to Earth to fend off the [[Terrorcon]] invasion. Perceptor was part of the team who travelled to [[Los Angeles]] to battle the [[Insecticons|Insecticon]] clones, alongside [[Landquake]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Bulkhead (Transformers)|Bulkhead]] and [[Tow-Line]]. They were in danger of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of clones until they were rescued by a surprising source - [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]], resurrected in a new body by [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]]. Megatron decimated the Insecticon clones, leaving the Autobots to help with the devastation.

===IDW Publishing===
Perceptor appeared in IDW's Transformers Collectors Club exclusive comic story, set during the events of [[Transformers: Cybertron]]. He appeared as one of the Mini-Cons loyal to the Mini-Con council, battling the rebel forces of [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]] and [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]]. However, when [[Unicron]] attacked Cybertron once again, Perceptor was one of those who battled [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], forcing him to flee. However, in ''Revelations part 6'', [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] returned to Cybertron, bearing word of [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]]'s death in battle. Perceptor was amongst those that mourned his loss.

* '''''Armada'' Perceptor'''
* '''''Universe'' Perceptor''' (2004)
:Armada Perceptor would be re-released in the Universe line in darker colors packaged alongside Universe [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]] and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. His only appearance in the Transformers: Universe storyline was as one of the Decepticons under the command of [[Reptilion]] in the Botcon 2004 voice actor play. He battled [[Silverbolt (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Silverbolt]], [[Rattrap (Transformers)|Rattrap]] and [[Waspinator]] in order to secure two groups of dimensionally displaced Autobots from the [[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|RiD]] universe. However, the three groups of Autobots, together with a time-lost Autobot shuttle from the Great War, were able to defeat the Decepticons.
* '''''Energon'' Perceptor''' (2004)
:''Armada'' Perceptor (now called Cliffjumper in Japan) returned with a completely new mold for ''Energon''.
:His bio now indicated that while he had gained the admiration and respect of his comrades as a warrior, his greatest desire was to spend time with his human friends ([[Rad (Transformers)|Rad]], Alexis, Carlos and especially [[Kicker (Transformers)|Kicker]]) to learn as much as he could about Earth, its people and its culture. However, he will still battle against the odds to defend it from the Decepticons.
:In late 2005 Energon Perceptor was repackaged for the ''Transformers: Universe'' line. The toy was identical to the Energon version. This character has not appeared in any Universe story yet.
* '''''Cybertron'' Perceptor''' (2006)
:Perceptor is a recolor of the ''Energon'' toy and does not appear in the TV cartoon series. The three members of the Street Action Team are now part of the Mini-Con 'versus' packs and were sold individually along with a member of the Decepticon Mini-Con [[Deep Space Team]]. Although each Mini-Con has a bio on their package; Perceptor, being a combined form, does not. He is described as the most powerful warrior among the Mini-Cons and the only one to defeat their Decepticon rivals.

This Perceptor is an evil mirror-image of the ''Generation 1'' character. In contrast to the original's peaceful nature, this Perceptor is portrayed as being very violent.

===Fun Publications===
Perceptor was seen standing guard in Autobot headquarters in [[Fun Publications]] ''Transformers: Timelines'' story "Shattered Glass".

Perceptor appears in the story arc ''[[Reunification (Transformers)|Reunification]]'' by [[Fun Publications]]. This character is one of [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)|Optimus Prime]]'s evil Autobots, but secretly loyal to [[Alpha Trion#Transformers: Timelines|Alpha Trion]]. He takes [[Breakaway (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines|Breakaway]] captive at the order of Alpha Trion.

===Toys===
The Decepticon Magnificus redeco of the original Perceptor toy has been repurposed as Shattered Glass Perceptor.

Perceptor was recently confirmed for the third season by show artist Derrick J Wyatt. His appearance is very G1-based although he now has a large cranium, what appear to be glasses, and has very scrawny limbs. A leaked model sheet revealed that his vehicle mode is that of a pick-up truck, the rear of which can transform into a mini-laboratory.

Unlike all of the other characters in the series, Perceptor is voiced by a computer through [[speech synthesis]], using the "Fred" voice in [[Mac OS X]]'s [[PlainTalk]] software.

===Animated series===
In the episode "Transwarped" it was revealed that he was the one who built [[Omega Supreme]]. He next appeared in "Decepticon Air", unsuccessfully trying to convince [[Sentinel Prime]] not to take command of the Autobots following [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave's]] attack on [[Ultra Magnus]]. He also appeared in "This is Why I Hate Machines", protesting against Sentinel's extreme suggestion to fire on a Decepticon-controlled Omega Supreme.

In the "Aligned Universe", Perceptor is the Autobot's chief scientist, and is one of Optimus' most trusted advisors.

===Animated Series===
In the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' episode "T.M.I.", [[Bulkhead (Transformers)|Bulkhead]], whilst transcribing a procedure to form synthetic [[Energon cube|energon]], mentions Perceptor's name as he negates "Perceptor's paradox", the nature of which is never specified.

===Books===
Perceptor appears in ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'' and in the sequel novel ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]''. His role is relatively minor-he serves as Optimus Prime's scientific adviser. In homage to his G1 counterpart, he often talks in highly complicated technical terms that infuriate his peers and his commanding officer.

===Games===
Perceptor appears in ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''.

Perceptor appears in ''[[Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark]]''.

[[File:Vaslav Nijinsky tombstone.jpg|thumb|220px|Tombstone of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in Paris. The statue, donated by Serge Lifar, shows Nijinsky as the puppet '''Petrushka'''.]]

'''Petrushka''' ({{lang-rus|Петру́шка|p=pʲɪtˈruʂkə|a=Ru-петрушка.ogg}}) is a [[stock character]] of [[Russia]]n folk [[puppetry]] (''[[rayok]]'') attested to since the 17th century. Petrushkas are traditionally [[marionette]]s, as well as [[hand puppet]]s. The character is a kind of a [[jester]] distinguished by his red dress, a red ''[[Pointed hat|kolpak]]'', and often a long nose.

==Word origin==

Although the Russian word "petrushka" has a [[homonym]] meaning "[[parsley]]", in this context the word is actually a [[hypocoristic]] ([[diminutive]]) for "Pyotr" (Пётр), which is [[Peter (first name)|Peter]] in Russian. Despite this, the character has little or nothing in common with the Commedia del l'Arte stock characters of [[Petruccio]] or [[Pierrot]], but is instead a Russian version of [[Punch (puppet)|Punch]] or [[Pulcinella]].

==History==

Pietro-Mira Pedrillo of Italy, the court jester of the Empress [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ioannovna]], allegedly served as a prototype for Petrushka.

Like Punch, Petrushka's voice was created with the help of a special whistle, and the dialogue was based on a momentary change of the pishchik and the "live" voice of other characters. There were a number of basic plots: the medical treatment of Petrushka, his learning of soldier’s service, the scene with his bride, and the buying of a horse and testing it.

Initially, Petrushka was characteristic of typical [[slapstick comedy]], targeting an adult audience. As puppet theatre gradually became a predominantly children's entertainment, Petrushka became less vulgar and aggressive.  In the [[Soviet Union]], Petrushka appeared widely in [[agitprop]] theater, defending poor peasants and attacking [[kulak]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p305, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Children's Welfare Society]] (RCWS) hosts an annual "Petroushka Ball", which is named after a version of the Petrushka character who fell in love with a graceful [[ballerina]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080608002803/http://www.rcws.org/events_petroushka.htm RCWS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame (PWHF) and Museum''' is an American [[professional wrestling]] [[hall of fame]] and [[museum]] located in [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]].

Its purpose is to "preserve and promote the dignified history of [[professional wrestling]] and to enshrine and pay tribute to professional wrestlers who have advanced this national pastime in terms of athletics and entertainment." The hall of fame is thus not affiliated with any [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].

'''Queenie Leighton''' (18 July 1874 &amp;ndash; 19 November 1943) was a [[British people|British]]  [[music hall]] star of the [[Edwardian era]].

Leighton was born in [[Islington]] in London as '''Lilian Caroline Augusta Rickard''', the youngest of three children of William Henry Rickard, a parliamentary agent, and Fanny Harriett Rickard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/1558/31280_196092-00020/2312250?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.co.uk%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3dlmabirths%26h%3d2312250%26ti%3d5538%26indiv%3dtry%26gss%3dpt%26ssrc%3dpt_t10318011_p487080891_kpidz0q3d487080891z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&amp;ssrc=pt_t10318011_p487080891_kpidz0q3d487080891z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&amp;backlabel=ReturnRecord London, England, Births and Baptisms, 1813-1906 for Lilian Caroline Augusta Rickard (1874) - ''[[Ancestry.com]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 her mother and sister were recorded as actresses living in London's theatre district off [[Strand, London|The Strand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/7572/LNDRG11_327_332-0378/14645398?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.co.uk%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3duki1881%26h%3d14645398%26ti%3d5538%26indiv%3dtry%26gss%3dpt%26ssrc%3dpt_t10318011_p487080891_kpidz0q3d487080891z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&amp;ssrc=pt_t10318011_p487080891_kpidz0q3d487080891z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&amp;backlabel=ReturnRecord  1881 England Census for Lillian Rickard - ''[[Ancestry.com]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; and Leighton started to become known as a child star. Her tall stately appearance, hourglass figure and auburn hair gained her starring roles. In 1898 Leighton married a surgeon, William Hotten George; he was ten years older than her and was dead by 1908. By this time Leighton had a successful stage career in London.

She was a much loved [[principal boy]] in a number of [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] theatre [[pantomime]]s. Women dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] were becoming fashionable in the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] theatre and Leighton was a popular artist in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Michael F. ''Drag!: Male and Female Impersonators on Stage, Screen and Television: An Illustrated World History'' McFarland &amp; Company Incorporated (1994) pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared as [[Prince Charming]], [[Dick Whittington]], [[Sinbad]], [[Aladdin]] and in other musical plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com Leighton on the 'It's Behind You' website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 she appeared as Doña Teresa in ''[[The Toreador]]''.

Leighton went on tour but whilst appearing as Sinbad in [[Bradford]] she had an accident, falling off a stage whale during the performance. She recovered but did not continue to play the leads at Drury Lane afterwards.

In 1911 Leighton  met young music hall manager Frederick Charles Cockerill (1882–1953); at the start of the 1914-18 War Cockerill received a commission in the Artists' Rifles and in 1915 he and Leighton married.&lt;ref&gt;Northampton Independent 1915,1917&lt;/ref&gt;

Leighton was one of the many stage artists who came under pressure to recruit soldiers through their performances with much emphasis on the patriotic aspect of their songs such as ''I'll Make a Man Out of You''. Leighton was reported to have followed up her act at the Royal Hippodrome, [[Dover]], with a tour of the town depositing 'half a dozen young recruits at Dover town hall'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Gordon ''British Theatre in The Great War'' Continuum (2003) pg 130&lt;/ref&gt; Cockerill was injured and returned to his home town of [[Northampton]] where Leighton  continued her recruiting work from The New Theatre, Northampton in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Warwick and Meg Toyer ''Death of A Theatre: A History of the New Theatre, Northampton'' Warwick (1978) pg 44&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]] Leighton appeared in the silent film ''Screen Struck'' (1916), but she was not a success and her career began to fail from this time. Her second and final film was ''[[Under the Greenwood Tree (1929 film)|Under the Greenwood Tree]]'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk www.bfi.org.uk Leighton on the [[British Film Institute]] website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leighton died in [[Farnworth]] in [[Lancashire]] in 1943. She did not have any children from either of her marriages.

A '''robotic pet''' is an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] machine  made in the image of an animal commonly kept as a [[pet]]. There are a variety of robotic pets such as dogs, cats, and birds. Robotic pets may also include things not normally considered pets, like [[Pleo]], a simulation robotic dinosaur. Some people even treat these [[robot]]s as actual pets. [[Domestic robot]]s such as the [[Roomba]] are used for work that an elderly person would probably struggle with. Robot pets also keep elderly people from being depressed and also keep them active. A very popular robotic pet is [[Tekno the Robotic Puppy]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35830">The '''slave narrative''' is a type of literary work that is made up of the written accounts of enslaved [[Africans]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and [[British Empire|its colonies]], including the later [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Caribbean]] nations. Some six thousand former [[slaves]] from [[North America]] and the Caribbean gave accounts of their lives during the 18th and 19th centuries, with about 150 narratives published as separate books or pamphlets. In the U.S. during the [[Great Depression]] (1930s), more than 2,300 additional oral histories on life during slavery were collected by writers sponsored and published by the [[Works Progress Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/17/opinion/greene-slave-narrative/index.html?hpt=hp_c1|title=America's 'Slave Narratives' should shock us|first= Bob|last=Greene|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (WPA) of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration. Most of the 26 audio-recorded interviews are held by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="fountain"/&gt;

Some of the earliest [[memoir]]s of captivity known in England and the British Isles were written by white [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and later [[United States|Americans]] captured and sometimes enslaved in [[North Africa]], usually by [[Barbary pirates]]. These were part of a broad category of "[[captivity narrative]]s" by English-speaking Europeans. Beginning in the 18th century, these included accounts by [[colonists]] and American settlers in North America and the United States who were captured and held by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Several well-known captivity narratives were published before the [[American Revolution]], and they often followed forms established with the narratives of captivity in North Africa. Later North American accounts were by Americans captured by western tribes during 19th-century migrations.

For the Europeans and Americans, the division between captivity as slaves and as [[prisoners of war]] was not always clear. Given the problem of international contemporary slavery in the 20th and 21st centuries, additional slave narratives are being written and published. It is an ubiquitous issue that still persists and remains largely undocumented.

== Slave narratives as a literary genre ==
The development of slave narratives from autobiographical accounts to modern fictional works led to the establishment of slave narratives as a literary [[genre]]. This large rubric of this so-called "captivity literature" includes more generally "any account of the life, or a major portion of the life, of a fugitive or former slave, either written or orally related by the slave himself or herself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/freedom/1609-1865/essays/slavenarrative.htm|title=How to Read a Slave Narrative|last=Andrews|first=William|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the first narratives told the stories of fugitive or freed slaves in a time of racial prejudice, they further developed into retrospective fictional novels and extended their influence until common days. Not only maintaining the memory and capturing the historical truth transmitted in these accounts, but slave narratives were primarily the tool for fugitive or former slaves to state their independence in the 19th century, and carry on and conserve authentic and true historical facts from a first-person perspective. They go further than just autobiographies, and are moreover "a source for reconstructing historical experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/literature-and-language-arts/essays/slave-narratives-genre-and-source|title=The Slave Narratives: A Genre and a Source {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=August 6, 2012|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freed slaves that wrote the narratives are considered as historians, since "memory and history come together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/881290138|title=The Oxford Handbook of the African American Slave Narrative|last=John,|first=Ernest,|date=January 1, 2014|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=9780199731480|oclc=881290138}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accounts link elements of the slave's personal life and destiny with key historical events, such as the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Underground Railroad]].

In simple, yet powerful storylines, slave narratives follow in general a plot common to all of them: starting from the initial situation, the slave in his master's home, the protagonist escapes in the wilderness and narrates the struggle for survival and recognition throughout his uncertain journey to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/800963917|title=Witnessing slavery : the development of ante-bellum slave narratives|last=Frances.|first=Smith Foster,|date=January 1, 1994|publisher=University of Wisconsin law school|isbn=9780299142148|oclc=800963917}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all, these narratives were written retrospectively by freed slaves and/or their abolitionist advocate, hence the focus on the transformation from the dehumanized slave to the self-emancipated free man. This change often entailed literacy as a means to overcome captivity, as the case of [[Frederick Douglass]] highlights. The narratives are very graphic to the extent as extensive accounts of e.g. whipping, abuse and rape of enslaved women are exposed in detail (see [[Treatment of slaves in the United States]]). The denunciation of the slave owners, in particular their cruelty and hypocrisy, is a recurring theme in slave narratives, and in some examples took a comic stance denouncing the double standards (e.g. in Douglass' narrative, his slave owner Hopkins is a very religious, but also brutal man).

According to James Olney, a typical outline looks the following way:

{{quote|
A. An engraved portrait, signed by the narrator.

B. A title page that includes the claim, as an integral part of the title, "Written by Himself" (or some close variant: "Written from a statement of Facts Made by Himself"; or "Written by a Friend, as Related to Him by Brother Jones"; etc.)

C. A handful of testimonials and/or one or more prefaces or introductions written either by a white abolitionist friend of the narrator (William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips) or by a white amanuensis/editor/author actually responsible for the text (John Greenleaf Whittier, David Wilson, Louis Alexis Chamerovzow), in the course of which preface the reader is told that the narrative is a "plain, unvarnished tale" and that naught "has been set down in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination"-indeed, the tale, it is claimed, understates the horrors of slavery.

D. A poetic epigraph, by preference from William Cowper.

E. The actual narrative:

1. a first sentence beginning, "I was born ... ," then specifying a place but not a date of birth;

2. a sketchy account of parentage, often involving a white father;

3. description of a cruel master, mistress, or overseer, details of first observed whipping and numerous subsequent whippings, with women very frequently the victims;

4. an account of one extraordinarily strong, hardworking slave often "pure African"-who, because there is no reason for it, refuses to be whipped;

5. record of the barriers raised against slave literacy and the overwhelming difficulties encountered in learning to read and write;

6. description of a "Christian" slaveholder (often of one such dying in terror) and the accompanying claim that "Christian" slaveholders are invariably worse than those professing no religion;

7. description of the amounts and kinds of food and clothing given to slaves, the work required of them, the pattern of a day, a week, a year;

8. account of a slave auction, of families being separated and destroyed, of distraught mothers clinging to their children as they are torn from them, of slave coffles being driven South;

9. description of patrols, of failed attempt(s) to escape, of pursuit by men and dogs;

10. description of successful attempt(s) to escape, lying by during the day, travelling by night guided by the North Star, reception in a free state by Quakers who offer a lavish breakfast and much genial thee/thou conversation;

11. taking of a new last name (frequently one suggested by a white abolitionist) to accord with new social identity as a free man, but retention of first name as a mark of continuity of individual identity;

12. reflections on slavery.

F. An appendix or appendices composed of documentary material bills of sale, details of purchase from slavery, newspaper items-, further reflections on slavery, sermons, anti-slavery speeches, poems, appeals to the reader for funds and moral support in the battle against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://deceivingmemories.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2011/08/olney_iwasborn.pdf|title="I Was Born": Slave Narratives, Their Status as Autobiography and as Literature|last=Olney|first=James|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ))

There is no consensus about what exact type of literature slave narratives are, whether they can be considered as a proper genre, comprised in the large category [[Captivity narrative]], or are [[Autobiography|Autobiographies]], [[Memoir]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Testimonial]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, or [[Novel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; nonetheless, they play a big part in keeping up the memory of slavery and in approaching a topic that was considered as a taboo for a long time - especially since many denied and still deny the existence of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slavenorth.com/denial.htm|title=Slavery Denial|website=slavenorth.com|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the participation of abolitionist editors, influential historians, such as [[Ulrich B. Phillips]] in 1929, suggested that, as a class, "their authenticity was doubtful." With increased emphasis on using the slaves' own accounts and the research of broader classes of information, since the late 20th century historians have more often validated the accounts of slaves about their own experiences.&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=|first2=|year=1971|title=Slave Narratives: Dismissed Evidence in the Writing of Southern History|url=|format=|journal=Phylon|publisher=|volume=32|issue=4|pages=403–409|jstor=274066|last1=Nichols|first1=William W.|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American slave narratives==
Slave narratives by African slaves from North America were first published in [[England]] in the 18th century. They soon became the main form of [[African-American literature]] in the 19th century. Slave narratives were publicized by [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], who sometimes participated as editors, or writers if slaves were not literate. During the first half of the 19th century, the controversy over slavery in the United States led to impassioned literature on both sides of the issue.

To present the reality of slavery, a number of former slaves, such as [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Harriet Jacobs]], and [[Frederick Douglass]], published accounts of their enslavement and their escapes to freedom. [[Lucy Delaney]] wrote an account that included the [[freedom suit]] waged by her mother in [[Missouri]] for their freedom. Eventually some 6,000 former slaves from North America and the Caribbean wrote accounts of their lives, with about 150 of these published as separate books or pamphlets. In total, it is believed that there exist 294 slave narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/|title=Documenting the American South: North American Slave Narratives Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[American Civil War]], some authors wrote fictional accounts of slavery to create support for abolitionism. The prime example is ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. The success of her novel and the social tensions of the time brought a response by white [[Southern literature|southern writers]], such as [[William Gilmore Simms]] and [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Mary Eastman]], who published what were called [[anti-Tom novels]]. Both kinds of novels were bestsellers in the 1850s.

The North American slave narratives can be broadly categorized into three distinct forms: tales of religious redemption, tales to inspire the abolitionist struggle, and tales of progress. The tales written to inspire the abolitionist struggle are the most famous because they tend to have a strong autobiographical motif, such as in [[Frederick Douglass]]'s [[autobiographies]] and ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' by [[Harriet Jacobs]] (1861).

===Tales of religious redemption===
From the 1770s to the 1820s, the slave narratives generally gave an account of a spiritual journey leading to [[Christian]] redemption. The authors usually characterized themselves as Africans rather than slaves, as most were born in Africa.

Examples include:
*[[Ukawsaw Gronniosaw]], ''A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert "Ukawsaw Gronniosaw", an African Prince'', [[Bath, England]], 1772
*[[Olaudah Equiano]], ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano|The Interesting Narrative and the life of "Olaudah Equiano" or Gustavus Vassa, the African]]'', [[London]], 1789

*[[John Jea]], ''The Life, History, and Unparalleled Sufferings of John Jea, the African Preacher'', 1811

===Tales to inspire the abolitionist movement===
From the mid-1820s, writers consciously chose the autobiographical form to generate enthusiasms for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. Some writers adopted literary techniques, including the use of fictionalized dialogue. Between 1835 and 1865 more than 80 such narratives were published. Recurrent features include: slave auctions, the break-up of families, and frequently two accounts of escapes, one of which is successful. As this was the period of the forced migration of an estimated one million slaves from the [[Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]] through the internal [[slave trade]], the experiences of auctions and separation of families were common to many.

Examples include:
*[[William Grimes (ex-slave)|William Grimes]], ''Life of William Grimes, the Runaway Slave'', [[New York City|New York]], 1825
*[[Solomon Bayley]], ''A Narrative of Some Remarkable Incidents in the Life of Solomon Bayley, Formerly a Slave in the State of Delaware, North America'', 1825

===Tales of progress===
[[Image:SlaveNarrativeTheExperienceOfThomasHJones1871.jpg|thumb|right|Slave narrative of [[Thomas H. Jones]] published in 1871]]
Following the defeat of the slave states of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]], the authors had less need to convey the evils of slavery. Some gave a sentimental account of plantation life and ended with the narrator adjusting to the new life of freedom. The emphasis of writers shifted conceptually toward a recounting of individual and racial progress rather than securing [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

Examples include:
*''The Life of James Mars, A Slave Born and Sold in Connecticut'', [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], 1864
*[[Paul Jennings (slave)|Paul Jennings]], ''A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison'', 1865

===WPA slave narratives===
{{main|Slave Narrative Collection}}
During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the [[New Deal]] [[Works Projects Administration]] (WPA) employed writers and researchers from the [[Federal Writers' Project]] to interview and document the stories of African Americans who were former slaves. Most had been children when the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was passed. Produced between 1936 and 1938, the narratives recount the experiences of more than 2,300 former slaves. Some interviews were recorded; 23 of 26 known audio recordings are held by the [[American Folklife Center]] of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="fountain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Project: WPA.

Retrieved May 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a grandson of a slave owned by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] at [[Monticello]].

==North African slave narratives==
In comparison to North American and Caribbean slave narratives, the [[North African]] slave narratives in English were written by [[British people|British]] and [[North America|American]] [[white slaves]] captured (often at sea or through the [[Turkish Abductions]]) and enslaved in North Africa in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These narratives have a distinct form in that they highlight the "otherness" of the [[Arab slave trade|Muslim slave traders]], whereas the African-American slave narratives often call slave traders to account as fellow [[Christian]]s.

Some captives used their experiences as North African slaves to criticize slavery in the United States, such as William Ray in his book ''Horrors of Slavery''. Slaves in North Africa suffered from many of the same conditions as their African counterparts in the United States, including hard labor, poor diet, and demeaning treatment. But, unlike those in America, slaves in North Africa  and could sometimes escape their condition by [[forced conversion]] to [[Conversion to Islam|Islam]] and adopting North Africa as their home through [[Dhimmitude]], be subject to [[eunuch|eunuch servitude]], or in some cases could be [[ransom]]ed by European powers. The [[Barbary pirates]] made a business out of capturing Europeans at sea and for ransom.

Narratives focused on the central themes of freedom and liberty which drew inspiration from the American Revolution. Since the narratives include the recurrence of themes and events, quoting, and relying heavily upon each other it is believed by scholars that the main source of information was other narratives more so than real captivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papadopoulou|first=Nikoletta|date=2017|title=The narrative's 'general truth': Authenticity and the mediation of violence in Barbary captivity narratives.|url=|journal=European Journal of American Cuture|volume=36|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female captives were depicted as [[Gothic fiction]] characters clinging to the hope of freedom thus more relatable to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Slaves, African Masters|last=Baepler|first=Paul|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women slave narratives ==
Some well-known slave narratives by women slaves include the memoirs of Harriet A. Jacobs, Mary Prince, Mattie J. Jackson, and "old Elizabeth," among others. Some of these accounts were edited and published in the late 1800s by white authors seeking to raise white opposition to slavery.

In her narrative, Mary Prince, a Bermuda-born woman and slave discusses her deep connection with her master's wife and the pity she felt for the wife as she witnessed the "ill-treatment" the wife suffered at the hands of her husband.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Prince, Mary. ''The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave: Related by Herself'', University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince also recounts her experience of becoming literate after being taught English by one of her mistresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Literacy, however, was not a common theme for all slave women. The life story of "old Elizabeth" was transcribed from her oral account at the age of 97.&lt;ref&gt;Old Elizabeth (2006). ''Memoir of Old Elizabeth, A Coloured Woman''. Extract in [[Margaret Busby]], ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', Jonathan Cape, 1992, pp. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women slave narratives, such as those of "old Elizabeth" and Mattie J. Jackson, reveal the importance of spirituality and relationships in the lives of women slaves. These narratives, many published and edited by white women, may represent early efforts of racial and feminist solidarity in the United States.

==Other historical slave narratives==
As slavery has been practised all over the world for millennia, some narratives cover places and times other than these main two. One example is the account given by [[John R. Jewitt]], an English [[armourer]] enslaved for years by [[Maquinna]] of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' calls his memoir a "classic of captivity literature"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;ArticleId=A0004133|title=Jewitt, John Rodgers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409132245/http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;ArticleId=A0004133|archivedate=April 9, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a rich source of information about the [[indigenous people]] of [[Vancouver Island]].

Maria ter Meetelen (1704 in Amsterdam – fl. 1751), was a Dutch writer of an autobiography. Her biography is considered to be a valuable witness statement of the life of a former slave (1748).

==Contemporary slave narratives==
A contemporary slave narrative is a recent memoir written by a former slave, or [[ghost writer|ghost-written]] on their behalf. Modern areas of the world in which slavery occurs include the Sudan, and two narratives, ''Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity – and My Journey to Freedom in America'' (2003) by [[Francis Bok]] and Edward Tivnan, and ''Slave'' by [[Mende Nazer]] and Damien Lewis, derive from slavery experiences in the Sudan.

In his fictional novel [[The Underground Railroad (novel)]], National Book Award winner Colson Whitehead traces the escape of Cora, female slave on a cotton farm in Georgia through the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/964759268|title=The underground railroad : a novel|last=1969-|first=Whitehead, Colson,|isbn=9780385542364|oclc=964759268}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was well-received and said to possess "the chilling, matter-of-fact power of the slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers' Project in the 1930s, with echoes of Toni Morrison's [[Beloved (novel)]]" and can hence be considered as a modern-tale fictional slave narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/books/review-the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead.html|title=Review: 'Underground Railroad' Lays Bare Horrors of Slavery and Its Toxic Legacy|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=August 2, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 7, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2016, filmmaker Michelle Williams launched a film series called "Another Slave Narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anotherslavenarrative.com/|title=Another Slave Narrative|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by an interview with a former slave, she decided to tell the stories of previously enslaved people in a series of short movies. A cast of 22 actors of mixed gender, race, and age, reads out individual slaves' interviews from the [[Slave Narrative Collection]] that includes more than 2,300 interviews conducted from 1936-38. Williams' aim is to document every single fate and hence approach the taboo of slavery, as well as to keep the memory of the slaves alive through these videos.

==Neo-slave narratives==
A neo-slave narrative — a term coined by [[Ishmael Reed]] while working on his 1976 novel ''Flight to Canada'' and used by him in a 1984 interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-ishmael-reed-by-reginald-martin/ "A Conversation with Ishmael Reed By Reginald Martin"] (interview conducted July 1–7, 1983, in Emeryville, California), ''The Review of Contemporary Fiction'', Summer 1984, Vol. 4.2. At Dalkey Archive Press.&lt;/ref&gt; — is a modern fictional work set in the slavery era by contemporary authors or substantially concerned with depicting the experience or the effects of enslavement in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Ashraf H. A. Rushdy, "Neo-slave narrative", in William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster &amp; Trudier Harris (eds), ''Oxford Companion to African American Literature'', New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 533–535.&lt;/ref&gt; The works are largely classified as [[novel]]s, but may pertain to poetical works as well. The renaissance of the postmodern slave narratives in the 20th century was a means to deal retrospectively with slavery, and to give a fictional account of historical facts from the first-person perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushdy|first1=Ashraf H.A.|title=Neo-slave narratives: studies in the social logic of a literary form|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195125337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Styx: Master of Shadows''''' is a [[stealth video game]] developed by [[Cyanide (company)|Cyanide Studios]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. The game is a prequel, and the second video game to take place in the world established by 2012's ''[[Of Orcs and Men]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Styx: Master of Shadows'' is a stealth game where the player must keep to the shadows to survive. Styx has arcane abilities that assist him in his escapades, including the ability to make himself invisible (also featured in ''[[Of Orcs and Men]]''), and the ability to use amber-vision to detect hidden foes and areas. His ability to clone himself through magic offers opportunities to disrupt the traditional stealth gaming formula. It gives the player a clone for purposes such as scouting without risk and creating a diversion.&lt;ref name="cyanide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyanide-studio.com/games/styx/?language=en|title=Styx: Master of Shadows on developer's website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316094749/http://www.cyanide-studio.com/games/styx/?language=en|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guards, soldiers and other protectors of the Tower will adapt their behavior dynamically, depending on the player's actions. The player is expected to keep a low profile and prepare a course of action beforehand: study the guard patrols closely, use areas of light and shadow to one's advantage, lure a target to a secluded area to assassinate him silently, or arrange "accidents" to remain undetected. 
Styx: Master of Shadows also includes RPG game mechanics, the player gains experience, which can unlock new skills, special moves, new and more lethal weapons, all divided into six talent trees.&lt;ref name="pc-20012093"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/styx-master-of-shadows/pc-20012093/?language=en|title=Styx: Master of Shadows IGN Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Styx infiltrates the Tower of Akenash, a massive flying fortress held aloft by the magic of the World Tree, around which the fortress was built. Styx desires to reach the heart of the World-Tree and rescue an imprisoned friend elsewhere in the fortress, but he doesn't know why he wants to do these things: he suffers from confused memories and a voice in his head that prods him on. When he finally liberates his "friend", he discovers that it is a goblin identical to himself. The protagonist up to this point has in fact been a clone of the real Styx, who has been held in an interrogation chamber all this time.

The original Styx was once an orc scholar who sought to study the World Tree, and somehow was transformed by the tree's magical amber into the first goblin. He has for centuries been plagued by the voices of the elves who sleep among the roots of the World Tree. The elves share a telepathic hive mind, and because they too are creatures of the amber, Styx can hear their chattering and cannot shut it out.  Stealing the heart of the World-Tree will silence the elves permanently and possibly give him a means to become an orc again.

One of the gifts that the amber gave Styx was the ability to spawn clones of himself. Usually these clones are stupid thralls, but when Styx infiltrated Akenash he created a clone with an exceptionally high degree of free will and ability so that it could accomplish more difficult tasks without guidance, such as rescuing Styx if he were captured. The original Styx still considers this clone to be a disposable tool like all the others. Furious, Clone-Styx swears to destroy Original-Styx and make a new life for himself.

With the help of an elf, Clone-Styx breaks the telepathic control that Original-Styx has on him, then chases Original-Styx to the Heart of the World Tree. Clone-Styx destroys the Heart, then commits suicide by leaping into the pool of amber at the base of the tree.  Hordes of goblins, all imperfect clones of Styx, emerge from the amber and tear Original-Styx apart.  This is the birth of the goblin race.  As the World Tree dies, the magic that kept Akenash aloft fails and the tower crashes to the ground.  One clone, perhaps Clone-Styx, emerges from the ruins with his memories gone but with his intellect intact and the awareness that somehow his name is "Styx".

''Styx: Master of Shadows'' received mixed to positive reviews.

Britton Peele of GameSpot complained that the combat "feels stiff and unwieldy, making battle a painful experience whether you win or lose."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; William Murphy of MMORPG said "nothing is more frustrating in Styx’s adventure than its combat," though he also noted that "it feels a bit silly to knock a stealth-based game for its combat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/1095/view/reviews/load/349/Styx-Master-of-Shadows-Master-of-Shadows-But-Jack-of-Everything-Else.html|title=Master of Shadows, But Jack of Everything Else - Styx - Master of Shadows Review - MMORPG.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some publications praised the system for disincentivizing confrontation. Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer said that ''Styx'' "makes full-on assaults next to impossible, and forces you to observe, think, and plan in order to advance.".&lt;ref name="HarcoreGamer"/&gt; Thew went on to say that, as a pure stealth game, ''Styx'' delivers "a satisfying tension that few games can match", and praised its levels for having "much more depth than the flat environments typical of the genre," concluding that ''Styx'' is "one of the best titles the [stealth] genre has to offer." Heather Newman of Venture Beat said that Styx is "truly engrossing for hardcore stealth fans, at a bargain price," and advised that you should "be ready to save often and die a lot — with a smile on your face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/10/styx-helps-you-perfect-the-art-of-death-your-enemies-and-your-own-review/2/|title=Styx helps you perfect the art of death -- your enemies’ and your own (review) page 2 - GamesBeat - Games - by Heather Newman|work=VentureBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sólo Para Mujeres''''' (''Only For Women'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[theatre]] play. It has been running for about a decade. This show was inspired by the 1997 [[United Kingdom|British]] film ''[[Full Monty]]''.

''Sólo Para Mujeres'' came after the success of its predecessor, ''Sólo Para Hombres'' (''For Men Only''), a play that starred [[Lorena Herrera]], among others, and which came about after Herrera's participation in the famous [[telenovela]], ''[[Dos Mujeres, un Camino]]''. ''Sólo Para Hombres'' featured Herrera and other famous Mexican actresses [[dance|dancing]] on stage with scant outfits. ''Sólo Para Mujeres'' followed the same lines: [[Muscle|muscular]] [[actor]]s would dance, for an audience that consists mainly of women, wearing underwear only or suggestive clothing.

Although [[Televisa]] is not directly connected with the play, many of the actors on ''Sólo Para Mujeres'' have had previous experience acting in [[soap opera]]s for the largest Mexican [[television]] network. Among those are [[Alexis Ayala]], [[Jorge Salinas]], [[Sergio Sendel]], [[Alfonso de Nigris]] and the play's producer, [[Sergio Mayer]]. Former [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] [[Johnny Lozada]] also participated at the play for a number of years.

The play was not expected to be as successful as ''Sólo Para Hombres'' was: Mexico, as with most of [[Latin America]], still has a society with relatively [[machista]] views, and so the first expectations for ''Sólo Para Mujeres'' were that it would last, at most, a couple of years. The play managed, however, to outlast ''Sólo Para Hombres''.

==The motorcycle accident==
On May 5, 2005, the production team of ''Sólo Para Mujeres'' suffered a tragedy when, during the filming of a [[video]] at a [[Mexico City]] street, a man who was allegedly driving over the speed limit drove into the scene and crashed his car against the [[motorcycle]]s used by five members of the ''Sólo Para Mujeres'' play, killing actor [[Edgar Ponce]] and injuring three others.

Many among the public are clamoring for a full investigation of the incident. Among some publicly expressed doubts are the fact that the street had not been closed before the filming of the video, and also that the members of ''Sólo Para Mujeres'' were not provided with protective [[helmet]]s before getting on their motorcycles. Also, driving motorcycles on the street where the tragedy happened is prohibited by the law.

Members of the play declared that it was not of their knowledge that driving motorcycles was prohibited on the particular street where the tragedy happened, because they had passed there on their bikes before and no one had admonished them for it. On the other hand, the man who drove the car into the motorcycles was released on [[Bail bond|bond]] until the case is seen at a Mexican [[court]]. Mayer demonstrated great displeasure when given the news that that man was not in [[Prison|jail]] anymore.

'''[[Television]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]''' was [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1964]], however, dominated by just five major companies: [[Dubai TV]], [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]],SM Enterprise TV , [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Rotana (television)|Rotana]] and [[Saudi TV]]. Together, they control 80% of the pan-Arabee ENJ broadcasting market.&lt;ref name=obg&gt;{{cite book|title=The Report: Saudi Arabia 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMPjxHzG1xQC&amp;pg=PA173|publisher=Oxford Business Group|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though private television stations cannot operate from Saudi soil, the country is a major market for pan-Arab satellite and pay-TV. Saudi investors are behind the major networks [[Middle East Broadcasting Center|MBC]], which is based in Dubai, and Emirates based [[OSN]].&lt;ref name="bbcprof"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia profile - Media|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703480|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although satellite dishes have been officially banned since 1990, Saudi Arabia has the second highest satellite TV penetration in the Arab Region, at 97%, and there are 85 free-to-air satellite channels headquartered in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=amo12&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Media Outlook 2011-2015|url=http://www.arabmediaforum.ae/userfiles/EnglishAMO.pdf|pages=159–161|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi government estimated that in 2000 the average Saudi spent 50% to 100% more time watching television than his or her European or US counterpart.&lt;ref name=cordes&gt;{{cite book|last=Cordesman|first=Anthony H.|title=Saudi Arabia enters the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjpExwQWtOsC&amp;pg=PA234}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, 2.7 hours are spent daily watching TV in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

The pay-TV market in Saudi Arabia is small, with a penetration estimated at 21%. [[Al Jazeera Sports]] is one of the largest pay-TV players in terms of subscriptions, with a market share of 59%. Due to the current absence of cinema in the country, pay TV penetration is expected to increase.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

==History==
The first television broadcasts in Saudi Arabia originated from a 200-watt television station, [[AJL-TV]], "The Eye of the Desert".&lt;ref name="amerikingdom"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitalis|first=Robert|title=America's Kingdom: Mythmaking on the Saudi Oil Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW4iR67-3U4C&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=2013-02-13|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-5446-0|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were English-language programs for the personnel of the [[USAF]] [[Dhahran Airfield]], and started on 17 June 1955.&lt;ref name=broadc-journ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Douglas A.|title=Saudi Arabian Television|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|date=Winter 1970–71|volume=15|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programming was from contemporary American television, but all references to Christianity, Israel or alcohol were edited out.&lt;ref name="amerikingdom"/&gt; In September 1957, [[ARAMCO]] began a television service for its 9,000 employees in [[Dhahran]].&lt;ref name=broadc-journ/&gt;

For many years, [[Wahhabi]] clerics opposed the establishment of a national television service, as they believed it [[Aniconism in Islam|immoral to produce images of humans]].&lt;ref name=broadc-journ/&gt; The first national television broadcasts began in 1965,&lt;ref name=pbs-bomb&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Time Bomb?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saudi/etc/cron.html|publisher=Frontline PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first broadcast was a recitation of the Quran.&lt;ref name=chrono-pbs&gt;{{cite web|title=A Chronology - The House Of Saud|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saud/cron/|publisher=Frontline PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of television offended some Saudis,&lt;ref name=pbs-bomb/&gt; and one of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]]'s nephews, [[Prince Khalid ibn Musa'id ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Hrair Dekmejian|title=Islam in Revolution: Fundamentalism in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeVs-4lWeUIC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=2013-02-13|year=1995|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2635-0|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; was killed in a police shootout in August 1965 after he led an assault on one of the new television stations.&lt;ref name=pbs-bomb/&gt;

[[Nawal Baksh]] was the first Saudi woman to appear on Saudi television, in 1966. After the [[1979 Mecca siege]], women were banned from television for a short time, after which written rules for Saudi television continued to include a ban on women appearing during Ramadan.&lt;ref name=sakr&gt;{{cite book|last=Sakr|first=Naomi|authorlink=Naomi Sakr|title=Arab Television Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KAtdOOE251QC&amp;pg=PA99|page=99|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of satellite broadcasting, Saudi TV channels One and Two had a reach of 60% of the adult Saudi population. The exception was with regard to [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] audiences who traditionally tuned into [[Bahrain TV]].&lt;ref name=shoult&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoult|first=Anthony|title=Doing Business with Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=or08gGGX_toC&amp;pg=PA279|page=279|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab satellite first became available in 1985 with the launching of [[Arabsat]], but it was not until the 1990s that satellite television became commercially viable. Accessibility of Western entertainment and news programs had a profound effect, as the foreign programs were instantly popular, leading Saudi TV to respond with more programs, including a live political talk show in which senior officials responded to questions by viewers.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;

The first private satellite channel in the Arab world, the [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]], was founded in 1991.&lt;ref name=long/&gt; In the early 1990s, [[King Fahd]] began to invest in the television business through [[Abdul Aziz Al Ibrahim]] and [[Khalid Al Ibrahim]], the brothers of [[Al Jawhara bint Ibrahim Al Ibrahim|Al-Johara]], his favourite wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom|page=144|chapter=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other private channels soon followed, led for the most part by Saudis and Lebanese.&lt;ref name=long/&gt; By 2003, there were 15 private Arab satellite television channels, four of them owned by Saudis.&lt;ref name=long&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=David E.|title=Culture And Customs Of Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKisHwiTxJQC&amp;pg=PA89|pages=89–90|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-2000s, many women presented shows on Saudi television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Hammond|title=Popular Culture in the Arab World: Arts, Politics, and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O06bOHRW7s8C&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=2013-02-13|date=2007-05-30|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-054-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; After trials in 2004 and 2005 in Jeddah, Digital Terrestrial Television launched in July 2006 and covered five major cities. To continue DTT transition and extend the service across the Kingdom, the [[Ministry of Culture and Information]] signed a contract with [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] in May 2008.&lt;ref name=amo09/&gt; By 2010, its network of 100 digital terrestrial broadcasting towers covered nearly 90% of the population. However, probably due to the adoption of multichannel TV on satellite, the uptake of DTT remains limited; in 2012 it was estimated at 1% of total households.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

==State-run channels==
The terrestrial broadcast sector in Saudi Arabia is state-owned through the [[Ministry of Culture and Information]].&lt;ref name=amo09/&gt; The state-run [[Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] operates almost all domestic broadcasting outlets.&lt;ref name="bbcprof"/&gt; State-run television consists of four channels: [[Saudi T.V. Channel 1|Saudi One]], the main channel in Arabic launched in 1963;&lt;ref name=amo09&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Media Outlook 2009 - 2013|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/arabmedia.pdf|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saudi T.V. Channel II|Saudi Two]], an English language channel; [[Al Riyadiah]], a sports channel; and the news channel [[Al Ekhbariya]].

Government-owned terrestrial television has changed little since 1969. Its programming is still predominantly focused on educational, entertainment, and religious subjects. Reruns of Arabic-language cinema, particularly Egyptian movies, are also broadcast. Political content other than official government announcements has remained relatively limited.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;

==Programming==
[[Kalam Nawaaem]], a popular female-hosted Arabic talkshow discussing various societal topics, and [[Arab Idol]], both showing on MBC, are the most popular TV programs in Saudi Arabia. [[Sada Al Malaeb]], a sports talkshow, is the third preferred show. [[Turkish drama]] series also capture a strong following.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

[[File:Courtship of Miles Standish a Plymouth Pilgrim.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''The Courtship of Miles Standish'', showing Standish looking upon Alden and Mullins during the bridal procession]]
'''''The Courtship of Miles Standish''''' is an 1858 [[narrative poem]] by American poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] about the early days of [[Plymouth Colony]], the colonial settlement established in America by the [[Mayflower Pilgrims|''Mayflower'' Pilgrims]].

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:The courtship of Miles Standish (1903) (14776920651).jpg|thumb|left|&lt;!-- John Alden ??? and --&gt; Priscilla Mullins, illustration from a 1903 printing]]

''The Courtship of Miles Standish'' is set against the backdrop of a fierce Indian war and focuses on a [[love triangle]] among three [[Pilgrim Fathers|Mayflower Pilgrims]]: [[Miles Standish]], [[Priscilla Alden|Priscilla Mullens]], and [[John Alden]]. Longfellow claimed that the story was true, but the historical evidence is inconclusive.  Nevertheless, the ballad was very popular in nineteenth-century America, immortalizing the Pilgrims.

The poem was a literary counterpoint to Longfellow's earlier ''[[Evangeline]]'' (1847), the tragic tale of a woman whose lover disappears during the deportation of the Acadian people in 1755. Together, ''Evangeline'' and ''The Courtship of Miles Standish'' captured the bittersweet quality of America's colonial era. However, the plot of ''The Courtship of Miles Standish'' deliberately varies in emotional tone, unlike the steady tragedy of Longfellow's ''Evangeline''. The Pilgrims grimly battle against disease and Indians, but are also obsessed with an eccentric love triangle, creating a curious mix of drama and comedy.  Bumbling, feuding roommates Miles Standish and John Alden vie for the affections of the beautiful Priscilla Mullins, who slyly tweaks the noses of her undiplomatic suitors.  The independent-minded woman utters the famous retort, "Why don't you speak for yourself, John?" The saga has a surprise ending, one full of optimism for the American future.

This story takes place nearly 400 years ago (c. 1621) and led to a marital union that has produced numerous descendants in North America.  Many Canadians and Americans living today are direct descendants of this love story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/massachusetts/ply_museum_alden_house.htm Tour Alden House Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
A debate persists as to whether the tale is fact or fiction. Main characters Miles Standish, John Alden, and Priscilla Mullins are based upon real ''Mayflower'' Pilgrims. Longfellow was a descendant of the Pilgrims through his mother Zilpah Wadsworth, including John Alden and Priscilla Mullins,&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht, Edward. ''Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Portrait of an American Humanist''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1966: 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and he claimed that he was relating oral history. Skeptics dismiss his saga as a folktale, but no conclusive evidence exists either way.

At minimum, Longfellow used [[poetic license]], condensing several years of events. Scholars have confirmed the cherished place of [[romantic love]] in Pilgrim culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Bruce C. |last= Daniels |title= Puritans at Play: Leisure and Recreation in Early New England |year= 1995 | publisher= Palgrave Macmillan | isbn= 0312125003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have documented the Indian war described by Longfellow.&lt;ref name="Philbrick 2006"&gt;{{cite book| first= Nathaniel |last= Philbrick |title= Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War |year= 2006 |publisher= Penguin |isbn= 0670037605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circumstantial evidence of the love triangle also exists. Miles Standish and John Alden were likely roommates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= John A. |last= Goodwin |title= The Pilgrim Republic| publisher= Houghton Mifflin |year= 1888 |edition= 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priscilla Mullins was the only single woman of marriageable age.&lt;ref name="Philbrick 2006" /&gt;  The families of the alleged lovers remained close for several generations and intermarried, moving together to [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]], Massachusetts in the late 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants still retell the love triangle of their ancestors.

==Composition and publication history==
The first reference to the poem recorded in Longfellow's journal is dated December 29, 1857, where the project is referred to as "Priscilla". By March 1 the next year, it was renamed ''The Courtship of Miles Standish''.&lt;ref name=Wms1964&gt;Williams, Cecil B. ''Henry Wadsworth Longfellow'', New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88}}

It was published in book form on October 16, 1858,&lt;ref name=Wms1964 /&gt;{{rp|89}} and it sold 25,000 copies after two months.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, David Haven. ''Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity''. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2006: 73. {{ISBN|0-300-11017-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, 10,000 copies were sold in London in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Van Wyck. ''The Flowering of New England''. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952: 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetic Meter==
''Courtship of Miles Standish'' is written in [[dactylic hexameter]], the same meter used in classical epic poetry such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. Longfellow used the same meter in his poem ''[[Evangeline]]''. He wrote this poem in the language of English.

'''''The Power of Myth''''' is a book based on the 1988 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary '''''Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth'''''.  The documentary was originally broadcast as six one-hour conversations between mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] (1904–1987) and journalist [[Bill Moyers]]. It remains one of the most popular series in the history of American public television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/|title=Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth {{!}} Shows {{!}} BillMoyers.com|newspaper=BillMoyers.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Power of Myth'' is based on the interviews between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers that were the basis for the acclaimed television series. It deals with the universality and evolution of myths in the history of the human race and the place of myths in modern society. Campbell blends accounts of his own upbringing and experience with stories from many cultures and civilizations to present the reader with his most compelling thesis that modern society is going through a transition from the old mythologies and traditions to a new way of thinking where a global mythology will emerge.

Some of the material in the first chapter comes from Campbell's previously published books, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' and ''The Masks of God''. The main theme of the book is the universality of myths—what Campbell calls "mankind's one great story"— that occur throughout the history of mankind, no matter which epoch or whichever culture or society is considered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Myths are the body of stories and legends that a people perceive as being an integral part of their culture. Before the invention of writing, these stories and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions. The reappearance of certain themes, time and again, in different mythologies, leads to the realization that these themes portray universal and eternal truths about mankind.

Campbell defines the function of a mythology as the provision of a cultural framework for a society or people to educate their young, and to provide them with a means of coping with their passage through the different stages of life from birth to death. In a general sense myths include religion as well and the development of religion is an intrinsic part of a society's culture. A mythology is inevitably bound to the society and time in which it occurs and cannot be divorced from this culture and environment. This is true even though Western society previously learnt from, and was informed by, the mythology of other cultures by including the study of Greek and Roman writings as part of its heritage.

The record of the history of the development of a culture and society is embodied in its mythology. For example, the Bible describes the evolution of the Judeo-Christian concept of God from the time when the Jews were in Babylon and the god they worshiped corresponded to a local tribal god, to when the concept became that of a world savior as a result of the Hebrews becoming a major force in the East Mediterranean region. The geographic context of a specific mythology also plays a role in its evolution. The physical scope of Biblical mythology was limited to the general area of the Middle East but in other parts of the world, Chinese and Aztec religions and cultures emerged as separate and distinct belief systems. When different cultures expand their spheres of influence they eventually come into contact with each other, and the outcome of the collision, be it conquest, subjugation, or amalgamation, will be evident in the resultant mythology.

The form and function of mythology in the modern world is the main topic of this chapter and to illustrate his ideas, Campbell recounts aspects of his own earlier life. Without specifically stating it, the assumption is made that the modern world under consideration is that of Campbell's world—the Christian-based, urbanized culture of North America, the so-called Modern Western Society.

Campbell describes his own upbringing as a Roman Catholic and his early fascination with the myths and stories of the American Indians. He recalls the excitement he felt when he realized that the motifs of creation, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, which the nuns were teaching him at his school, also occurred in American Indian myths. This was the beginning of his lifelong interest in comparative mythology. Later on in life he found the same universal themes in Hinduism and in the medieval Arthurian legends.

The discussion considers the role of myth and ritual in contemporary society. Contemporary rituals are carried out to mark special events in private lives, such as an individual's marriage or enlistment in a branch of the armed forces and, on public occasions such as the inauguration of civil and national leaders. In the Introduction to the book, Moyers recalls Campbell's description of the solemn state funeral after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as an "illustration of the high service of ritual to a society," and where Campbell identifies the ritualized occasion as fulfilling a great social necessity.

In general, however, Campbell and Moyers, reach the conclusion that there is a lack of effective mythology and ritual in modern American society. They find nothing that compares with the powerful puberty rituals of primitive societies. They claim that the exclusion of classical studies from the modern educational syllabus has led to a lack of awareness of the mythological foundations of western society's heritage. This, combined with an increased materialism and emphasis on technology, has led to modern youth in New York, becoming alienated from the mainstream of society and inventing their own morality, initiations and gangs.

Marriage, as an example of a paramount modern social institution, becomes the next subject of discussion. Campbell differentiates between marriage and love affairs and imparts some very lofty ideals to marriage, in contrast to love affairs, that he categorically states inevitably end in disappointment. True marriage, in Campbell's opinion, embodies a spiritual identity and invokes the image of an incarnate God. Campbell and Moyers agree that the main objective of marriage is not the birth of children and the raising of families. They discard the concept of perpetuation of the human species as being the primary function of marriage and relegate this to a first stage. This first stage is followed by a second one where the offspring have departed into the world and only the couple is left. Campbell invokes the image of marriage as being an ordeal in which the ego is sacrificed to a relationship in which two have become one. This, he states, is a mythological image that embodies the sacrifice of the visible for a transcendent good. Campbell labels this stage of marriage as the alchemical stage. On the subject of the ritual of marriage, Campbell and Moyers complain that it has lost its force and has become a mere remnant of the original; they contend that the ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form.

The interviews between Campbell and Moyers are recorded at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. Campbell and Lucas became friends when Lucas publicly acknowledged the influence Campbell's writings had on the development of his hugely successful film "Star Wars." Campbell expresses great enthusiasm for this film; a film that he says conforms to classical mythological legends. So it is not surprising that there are many references to the characters from "Star Wars" throughout the book. In a similar fashion, John Wayne is identified as a modern myth and Campbell recalls Douglas Fairbanks as having been a boyhood hero.

At the beginning of this chapter, and in other parts of the book, Campbell states that modern society lacks the stability it previously derived from being educated in the mythology and legends of the Greek and Roman classics. Campbell and Moyers agree that there is no effective mythology in modern society by which individuals can relate to their role in the world. An analysis of the national symbols of the United States is used by Campbell to illustrate the ability for myths to incorporate the beliefs of a whole society and to provide the mythology to unify a nation. More recently, when the image of the earth, taken from the lunar landings, was published, it led to the universal realization that human beings must identify with the entire planet. This concept of the emergence of a new mythology based on global aspects of life is reiterated several times by Campbell.

==''Star Wars''==
In the first episode of the series, ''The Hero's Adventure'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/the-heros-adventure/episode/432756/summary.html Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure - TV.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fifth chapter of the book, "The Hero's Adventure," Moyers and Campbell discuss [[George Lucas]]' report that Campbell's work directly influenced the creation of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films.
Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999, modeled after ''The Power of Myth''. It was called the  ''Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas &amp; Bill Moyers'' and further discussed the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm Films for the Humanities and Sciences - The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errata==
The words attributed to [[Chief Seattle]], read by Campbell in the fourth episode of the series, were actually written by Ted Perry for a 1972 [[ecology]] film called ''Home''. Perry adapted the text from newspaper accounts that were, in turn, published years after Chief Seattle delivered the actual speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/quotes/seattle.asp snopes.com: Chief Seattle Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newsweek May 4, 1992 p 68 [subject] the Arts "Just Too Good to Be True: another reason to beware of false eco-prophets" by Malcolm Jones Jr. with Ray Sawhill&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campbell's views on religious fundamentalism in the "Power of Myth" ==
Campbell did respond to the yearning by religious fundamentalists for a return to the 'old-time religion'. The following part of the interview reveals Campbell's views on religious fundamentalism which, in the modern world, is conceptualised by the desire by some adherents of world's disparate religions, to return to the old practices of a given religion.

Bill Moyers: You've seen what happens when primitive societies are unsettled by white man's 
civilization. They go to pieces, they disintegrate, they become 
diseased. Hasn't the same thing been happening to us since myths began to disappear?

Joseph Campbell: Absolutely, it has.

Bill Moyers: Isn't that why conservative religions today are calling for the old-time religion?

Joseph Campbell: Yes, and they're making a terrible mistake. They are going back to something that is vestigial {something that has passed}, that doesn't serve life.

Bill Moyers: But didn't it serve us?

Joseph Campbell: Sure it did.

Bill Moyers: I understand the yearning. In my youth I had fixed stars. They comforted me with their permanence. They gave me a known horizon. And they told me there 
was loving, kind, and just father out there looking down on me, ready to receive me, thinking of my concerns all the time. Now, Saul Bellow says that science has made a housecleaning of beliefs. But there was value in these things for me. I am today what I am because of those beliefs. I wonder what happens to children who don't have those fixed stars, that known horizon - those myths?

Joseph Campbell: Well, as I said, all you have to do is read the newspapers. It's a mess. On this immediate level of life and structure, myths offer life models. But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today. ''The virtues of the past are the vices of today. And many of what were thought to be the vices of the past are the necessities of today. The moral order has to catch up with the moral necessities of actual life in time, here and now''. ''And that is what we are not doing. The old-time religion belongs to another age, another people, another set of human values, another universe. By going back you throw yourself out of sync with history. Our kids lose their faith in the religions that were taught to them, and they go inside."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Myths-Dreams-Symbols|url = http://mythsdreamssymbols.com/functionsofmyth.html|website = mythsdreamssymbols.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Puppet Play of Don Cristóbal''''' (''Retablillo de Don Cristóbal'') is a play for [[Puppet|puppet theatre]] by the twentieth-century [[Spain|Spanish]] [[dramatist]] [[Federico García Lorca]]. It was written in 1931 and was first performed on 11 May 1935 at the Book Fair in [[Madrid]], in a performance in which Lorca operated the [[puppet]]s himself.&lt;ref name="edwards1"&gt;Edwards (1980, 35).&lt;/ref&gt; Don Cristóbal is a kind of [[Punch and Judy|Punch]] character (which itself was based on [[Pulcinella]]), who also appears in García Lorca's earlier puppet play, ''[[The Billy-Club Puppets (play)|The Billy-Club Puppets]]'' (written in 1931).&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;García Lorca (1963, 10, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot synopsis ==

The play begins with a prologue within a prologue with a voice addressing the audience as "Ladies and Gentlemen". The voice preaches that the author has written the piece knowing the audience would accept the delight and vulgarity of the puppet show they are about to witness. The Poet enters, and the Voice continues his monologue, telling a child to shut up, telling the audience how quiet they must be during the performance and that he is going to go eat a piece of bread and then iron the company’s costumes. As he begins to tell how roses grow he lowers himself down and his other hand becomes the Director. He tells this puppeteer to put a sock in it and where he should have ended his dialogue. The Poet and the Director begin to quarrel about how the play should be written. The Poet believes Don Cristóbal is good, while the Director says that he is bad. During the fight, there are threats and breaking of the fourth wall, and each of them calls out to the other characters to get ready to being the play. Rosita says she’s putting on her shoes, while Cristóbal says he’ll be out once he has finished peeing. The Director tells him he is a doctor and has to get married.  This is where the play truly begins when the Patient Enters. He tells Cristóbal of a pain in his neck and Cristóbal feels the only way to cure him is by ripping off his head. He seizes the Patient and tries to remove his head, and when he fails, he exits and reenters with a stick. He threatens the Patient demanding money and the Patient tells Cristóbal all the places he has money on his person, a questionable place up his behind being one of them, and Cristóbal begins to beat him multiple times with the stick. Cristóbal beats him to death and the Patient falls with a thud. The Director reenters and asks Cristóbal if he had any money, and with a positive answer tells Cristóbal he can now get married.  The Mother enters, and with a side tells of her daughter and how she needs to find a man to marry. Cristóbal approaches her and tells her he is a gentlemen looking to get married. They negotiate and Mother trades her daughter off to Cristóbal for a Mule. When Mother tells Cristóbal where he can find Rosita, Rosita has a brief monologue depicting her adventures and desires with all of her lovers. During banter between Mother and Cristóbal, he informs her everyone he meets must tremble before him, and he demands she summon Rosita. Cristóbal and Rosita meet, Mother asks him to take care of her, and Cristóbal alls out for the priest with bells ringing out.

The Poet reenters and addresses the audience how the characters could and should play out but the Director keeps them on a narrow path. The Director reenters and the Poet quickly fibs about what he had just spoken aloud. The Director threatens him and Cristóbal and Rosita reenter. He begins to tell her what he plans to do to her in his drunken state, and Rosita has the idea for him to take a nap. When Cristóbal falls asleep a man enters and begins to kiss Rosita. Cristóbal wakes up to the sounds of kissing and the man quickly disappears. Rosita makes an excuse and tells him to go take another nap. This pattern continues with the Poet and the recently deceased Patient entering, kissing Rosita, Cristóbal waking up, and Rosita lying about what he had heard. The Mother enters and tells Rosita the doctor is here and Rosita says she has fallen and ill and the women demand Cristóbal to give them his money. They exit and the Director enters telling Cristóbal that Dona Rosita is not only ill, but she is giving birth. Cristóbal asks who is the father, and is informed she’s already had four children. He threatens her aloud and confronts Mother. He Strikes her when she says he is the father. The Director tells them both she is having the fifth and Cristóbal asks who the father is again, striking her every time she says it’s his. He eventually beats her to death, addressing the murder and boasting he will find out who the father is, but Mother arises and continues to say the baby is Cristóbal’s child. Cristóbal continues to beat her until the Director says enough and addressees the audience. The play ends with the Director telling the audience that we only accept the vulgarity and content of the show because its puppets who are delivering the dialogue instead of real actors and Don Cristóbal is a character the ancient spirit of theatre survives.

==Synopsis==
The story is set during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]].  [[King Jian Zi]] (趙簡子 - BC?-BC 476) was leading a hunting party through [[Zhongshan]] when he happen to come across a [[wolf]].  King Jian takes aim with his bow and arrow but misses and hits a stone instead.  The wolf desperately flees through the forest with the hunting party in pursuit.  As the wolf makes its way through the forest he stumbles upon a traveling [[Mohist]] scholar Mr. Dongguo ({{zh|c=東郭先生|p=Dōngguō Xiānshēng}}).  The wolf appeals to the scholar's belief of "universal love" and implores for his help. Mr. Dongguo takes pity on the creature and hides it in one of his books bags strapped to his donkey.

When the hunters approach him, Mr. Dongguo denies any knowledge of the wolf's whereabouts.  After the hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets the wolf out of his bag, got on his donkey, and was about to take his leave only to be stopped by the wolf.  The wolf now asked the scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation.  Mr. Dongguo offered the wolf some pastries, but the wolf smile and said "I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat".  Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if the wolf intended to eat his donkey and the wolf replies "No, no, donkey meat is no good".  The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with the wolf.  To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, the hungry wolf pounced on him and announced its intention to eat him.  When Mr. Dongguo protests at the wolf's ingratitude, the wolf presents the argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again?  Now that it was starving, only by serving as the wolf's food will the scholar have fulfilled the act of saving his life.  Besides, the wolf complained that it nearly suffocated while it was crammed in the scholar's bag and the scholar now owed him.  Dongguo and the wolf debated and finally decided to present their case to the judgment of three elders.

The first elder they present their argument to is an old withering [[apricot]] tree.  The tree relates its own experience to the two on how when it was young, children used to pick its fruits from its branches and the tree would tell them to eat their fill.  Now it was about to be chopped down to provide firewood.  The tree sides with the wolf.  The wolf is very pleased.

The second elder they present their argument to was an elderly [[water buffalo]].  The buffalo tells its story of how it served its masters for many years dutifully providing him with milk and plowing his fields.  Now his master wants to butcher it so he can eat his meat.  The buffalo too sides with the wolf.  The wolf grins and feels even more justified in his request to eat the scholar.  Mr. Dongguo reminds the wolf that they have one more elder to seek out.

The last elder they present their argument to is an elderly farmer.  The farmer was skeptical and didn't believe that the wolf could fit into the bag.  To illustrate its point, the wolf crawled back into the bag and right away the old farmer tied up the bag and started to beat the wolf with his [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]].  The farmer bashes the wolf to an inch of his life then unties the bag and drags his dying wolf out of the bag.

Seeing the pitiful wolf the scholar thinks that the old farmer was too cruel but just then a weeping woman comes running towards them.  She pointed to the wolf and told Mr. Dongguo and the farmer how it dragged off her little boy.  Mr Dongguo now no longer pitied the wolf.  He picked up the hoe and strikes the final blow to the wolf's head.

==Author==
The authorship of this text is a matter of dispute.  The text originally appeared in the ''Hǎishuō Gǔjīn'' as an anonymous text with no author listed but it has generally been attributed to [[Ma Zhongxi]] ({{zh|c=馬中錫|p=Mǎ Zhōngxí}}) (1446–1512).  In classical Chinese literature, this tale is quite unusual in the fact that it is a fully developed animal [[fable]]. In most prose fables or poems where animals are imbued with human characteristics (e.g., ''[[Huli jing]]''), they are usually first transformed into human form before they are allowed to speak.

The term Mr. Dongguo (Dōngguō Xiānshēng) has now become a Chinese idiom for a naive person who gets into trouble through being softhearted to evil people.

==Variations==

Another variation of this tale can be found in the ''Precious Scroll of [[Sudhana|Shancai]] and [[Longnü]]''.

[[Leo Tolstoy]] in one of his "readers" for elementary school has a similar story, entitled ''The Wolf and the Farmer'' ({{lang-ru|Волк и мужик}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rvb.ru/tolstoy/01text/vol_10/01text/0212.htm Четвертая русская книга для чтения: ВОЛК И МУЖИК (Сказка)] (The Fourth Russian Reader, "The Wolf and the Farmer" (A tale)), in: Л.Н.Толстой, СОБРАНИЕ СОЧИНЕНИЙ В 22 ТОМАХ, Москва � 'Художественная литература', 1982, ТОМ ДЕСЯТЫЙ. Четвертая русская книга для чтения (L.N. Tolstoy, Collected Works in 22 volumes. Moscow, Khudozhestvennaia Literatura Publishers, 1982. Vol. 10, p. 170)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Watchmen: The End Is Nigh''''' is an episodic video game series that serves as a prequel to the [[Watchmen (film)|film adaptation]] of the [[DC Comics]] [[Limited series (comics)|graphic novel]] ''[[Watchmen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]. The game was originally announced for release in downloadable installments on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[Xbox Live Arcade]], with the first one released in March 2009 to coincide with the film's theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment Announces The Launch Of 'Watchmen: The End Is Nigh'|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/warner-bros-interactive-entertainment-announces-launch-%E2%80%9Cwatchmen-end-nigh%E2%80%9D|website=Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment|date=March 4, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second episode was released in July and August 2009.&lt;ref name="Part 2" /&gt;

Both episodes were released together on disc on July 21, 2009 for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].  A limited edition of the [[PlayStation 3]] version was released billed as "The Complete Experience", which also included the extended Director's Cut version of the film in [[Blu-ray]] format.&lt;ref name="Part 2" /&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game allows players to take on the roles of either [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] or [[Nite Owl#Daniel Dreiberg|Nite Owl]] in single player or cooperative multiplayer. Rorschach and Nite Owl are the only playable characters in the game's first episode, which comprises six "chapters." Cutscenes that look like animated comic panels, similar to those seen in the [[Watchmen (film)#Marketing|''Watchmen'' motion comics]] released on [[iTunes]], bookend each chapter. Two of the film's actors, [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Jackie Earle Haley]], provide their voices for their characters Nite Owl and Rorschach, respectively. The game features a mix of beat-em-up and puzzle gameplay, with the two characters having different strengths and abilities. Rorschach is faster with unconventional attacks and makes use of improvised weapons like crowbars and baseball bats; Nite Owl is slower but has a solid martial arts method and uses technological devices, such as "screecher bombs", and the grappling gun. The characters must work cooperatively to pass puzzles and defeat enemies.

The game is set in 1972 during the [[List of Watchmen characters#Minor characters|Crimebusters]] (for the film adaptation, The Watchmen) era. The first chapter of the game is a tutorial taking place while Rorschach and Nite Owl infiltrate a prison. Underboss, a villain mentioned in the comic book, appears in the game, as do other adversaries who are only mentioned or briefly shown in flashbacks in the original comic. Nite Owl's flying craft, ''Archimedes'', appears, though the player never has control over it during the game.

An article on Comicmix.com emphasized the game's focus on teamwork between the two characters: in single-player mode, the AI controls the other character aside from the main character, while the game can be played in Local Co-op with two players as both characters. The article also mentioned there would be no online Co-op mode.

==Plot==
''The End Is Nigh'' takes place during the Crimebusters era (renamed ''Watchmen'' for the film adaptation), when Rorschach and Nite Owl II were crime-fighting vigilantes before the Keene Act passed in 1977. Upon hearing a police bulletin, Nite Owl and Rorschach make their way to [[Sing Sing]] prison to help quell the rioting that has erupted there.

Once there, they find out the riots were a ruse to cover up the escape of The Underboss, a crime lord. They make their way to a bar, the Rumrunner, and question one of the patrons to find out who orchestrated the escape. They find out Jimmy the Gimmick was behind it, so they chase him down the docks to an abandoned amusement park. They corner him on the tracks of a roller coaster, where someone activates the carts to try to kill Jimmy. Nite Owl holds them back with his grappling hook but a mysterious sniper shoots the cable, causing the carts to fly right into Jimmy, causing him to be severely injured. Before his fall off the roller coaster, Jimmy managed to tell them the Underboss is in his old hideout in the sewers, so after calling an ambulance for Jimmy, that is where Nite Owl and Rorschach go.

They don't find him, but they do find a missing FBI associate director, [[Mark Felt]], tied up and bleeding heavily, seemingly tortured. He tells them that someone (who the heroes presume to be Underboss) means to kill two reporters, [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], the would-be informers of the Watergate scandal. Upon leaving the sewers, Nite Owl and Rorschach are ambushed by the police, Rorschach chiming in that they have been set up.

They fight their way through them to get to the construction site where Felt told them Underboss is, only to find that the reporters are already dead. Underboss claims he had nothing to do with it, that he was set up. The duo chases him up the construction site and manages to corner him, but [[Characters of Watchmen#The Comedian|the Comedian]] snipes him from afar. It turned out the Comedian was the mastermind behind all the events, working on behalf of the American government to cover up the Watergate Scandal (a reference to a comment made about Woodward and Bernstein by the Comedian in both the graphic novel and film).

In Part 2, Rorschach sets on the trail of a missing girl named Violet Greene. With a reluctant Nite Owl in tow, they infiltrate a seedy strip club, where they discover that the kidnapper is the Twilight Lady, an old flame of Nite Owl's. They break into her mansion (which acts as a high class brothel) and discover that Violet enjoys being a prostitute, however Rorschach claims that she may have been brainwashed. Nite Owl says that if Violet is there of her "own free will" then there is nothing that they can do. Rorschach disagrees, and the pair chase Twilight Lady through the mansion, before she is thrown into a skylight. The ending of the chapter depends upon the outcome of the final battle (between Nite Owl and Rorschach). If Nite Owl wins, then he throws Rorschach through the skylight and rescues Twilight Lady before ordering her to leave town and never return. If Rorschach wins, however, he throws Nite Owl to one side and shoots Twilight Lady with the harpoon gun, killing her. Whichever character is the victor, the game ends with the partnership between Nite Owl and Rorschach being severed, and Nite Owl teaming up with the Comedian to quell a riot (an event which is depicted both in the graphic novel, and the film).

==Development==
[[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] was announced to be publishing two downloadable games during the theatrical and DVD releases of the 2009 film. [[Deadline Games]] is developing the two properties. WB took this low-key approach to adapting the film to avoid rushing the game on this tight schedule, as most film games are panned by critics and gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Fritz|date=July 23, 2008|title='Watchmen' games a go|url=https://variety.com/2008/digital/features/watchmen-games-a-go-1117989357/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is written by [[Len Wein]], the comic's editor. [[Dave Gibbons]], the comic's artist, is also an advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Totilo|date=July 23, 2008|title='Watchmen' Video Game Preview: Rorschach And Nite Owl Star In Subversive Prequel Set In 1970s|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1591385/watchmen-video-game-preview-rorschach-and-nite-owl-star-in-subversive-prequel-set-in-1970s/|website=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' announced the title of the game to be ''Watchmen: The End Is Nigh'' and had the game as its cover story for December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1UP staff|date=November 6, 2008|title=EGM Watches the Watchmen in Our December Issue|url=http://www.1up.com/news/egm-watches-watchmen-december-issue|website=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529070848/http://www.1up.com/news/egm-watches-watchmen-december-issue|archivedate=May 29, 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the PlayStation 3 version an unfavorable review and called it "a distressingly shallow videogame in which there's nothing for players to do but beat the living crap out of everyone they see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Fritz|date=March 5, 2009|title=Watchmen: The End Is Nigh [Part 1] (PS3)|url=https://variety.com/2009/digital/features/watchmen-the-end-is-nigh-1200474261/|website=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gave the same console version four stars out of ten, saying, "The game requires very little in the way of strategy or timing -- just mashing on the attack buttons is more than enough to get you through half the game. At that point, more and more enemies start piling on you, and getting cheap-shotted in the back is an excellent way to die (and be booted out to a long loading screen while you wait for the exact same level you were just in to be reloaded)."&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; ''[[Teletext Ltd.|Teletext GameCentral]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version a score of four out of ten and said, "It certainly looks and sounds the part but this downloadable game is just as shallow as most retail tie-ins."&lt;ref name="Teletext" /&gt;

The '''''We Will Rock You Original London Cast Recording''''' is a live album released in promotion of the award-winning West End Musical ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)]]'' in 2002. The album was recorded over two nights of the original West End production at the [[Dominion Theatre]] and was the first audio release of the musical. Both instrumental pieces (''Ogre Battle'' and ''One Vision'') are the original recordings made by Queen in 1973 and 1985 respectively. The recording misses several tracks that were present in the original production. These are: ''Bicycle Race'', ''Crazy Little Thing Called Love'', ''Death On Two Legs (Dedicated to...)'', ''Fat Bottomed Girls'' and ''Headlong (Reprise)''.

In 2012, a special 2-CD ''10th Anniversary'' edition was produced, consisting of the original album along with a CD of bonus material.

"'''Whip It'''" is a song by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Devo]] from their third album ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]'' (1980). It is a [[new wave music|new wave]] and [[synth-pop]] song that features a synthesizer, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums in its instrumentation. The apparently nonsensical lyrics have a common theme revolving around the ability to deal with one's problems by "whipping it". Co-written by bassist [[Gerald Casale]] and singer [[Mark Mothersbaugh]], Devo recorded "Whip It" with producer [[Robert Margouleff]] at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles.

Although "Whip It" was released as the second [[single (music)|single]] from ''Freedom of Choice'', [[Warner Bros. Records]] did not expect it to be a hit, due to its nonstandard [[tempo]] and strange lyrics. The [[disc jockey]] [[Kal Rudman]] took an interest in the song and it was soon being played on several radio stations in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Peaking at number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "Whip It" became a [[hit single]] and found chart success in several countries. Mothersbaugh believes the song sold well because some people assumed the lyrics are about [[masturbation]] or [[sadomasochism]].

An accompanying [[music video]] depicts these sexual themes; it features Mothersbaugh whipping clothing from a woman on a [[guest ranch|dude ranch]]. Despite some claims of misogynistic undertones, the video became popular on the fledgling television channel [[MTV]]. In recent years, several journalists have described "Whip It" as a cornerstone of the development of new wave music in the early 1980s and a unique song that transcended mainstream music. In the band's forty-year history, "Whip It" remains the only song by Devo to peak within the top forty of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. As a result, Devo is often labeled by journalists as a [[one-hit wonder]].

==Background and recording==

Devo's 1979 album ''[[Duty Now for the Future]]'' was considered a disappointment by critics and band members; critics regarded it as a formulaic repeat of the band's 1978 debut ''[[Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'' and the band members primarily blamed the formulaic sound on the album's producer [[Ken Scott]].&lt;ref name="Moskowitz"&gt;{{cite book|first= David V. |last= Moskowitz |year= 2015 |title= The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 978-1-4408-0340-6 |page= 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nagy|2015|pp=19–20}} [[Warner Bros. Records]] was also unhappy with ''Duty Now for the Future'' and issued to Devo an ultimatum that they needed to produce a successful follow-up album or be dropped from the label.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|pp=20–21}} The band members believed a hit single would bolster the next album's popularity and finally give them radio exposure.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=35}} In late 1979, audio engineer [[Robert Margouleff]] was brought on to produce "Whip It" and its parent album ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]''.&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Richard |last= Buskin |title= Devo 'Whip It' – Classic Tracks |magazine= [[Sound on Sound]] |date= July 2008 |accessdate= August 31, 2017 |url= https://www.soundonsound.com/people/devo-whip-it-classic-tracks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Whip It" was written by bassist [[Gerald Casale]] and singer/keyboardist [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] between August and October 1979.&lt;ref name="Keyboard"&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Stephen |last= Fortner |title= Devo: The Masters of Subversive Synth Rock Return |magazine= [[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]] |page= 40 |volume= 36 |issue= 9 |date= September 2010 |accessdate= December 28, 2017 |url= https://www.keyboardmag.com/article/devo---masters/September-2010/119085 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101216014357/https://www.keyboardmag.com/article/devo---masters/September-2010/119085 |archivedate= December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Siegal [[Audio engineer|engineered]] the song while Margouleff served as the producer. It was recorded at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles and [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by Ken Perry at [[Capitol Studios]].&lt;ref name="Liner Notes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title= Freedom of Choice |others= Devo |type= liner notes |publisher= [[Warner Bros. Records]] |year= 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was recorded using [[Automated Processes, Inc.|API]] [[mixing console]]s, [[3M]] [[tape recorder|tape machines]], and [[Minimoog]] and [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5|Prophet-5 synthesizers]].&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keyboard"/&gt; Throughout the song, there are [[whipcracking]] noises that were recorded using an [[Electronic Music Laboratories|Electrocomp 500 synthesizer]] and Neumann KM 84 and U 87 microphones.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=36}}

The music for "Whip It" was crafted by taking elements from four different [[Demo (music)|demo]] tapes that Casale had collected. Mothersbaugh composed what became the song's [[break (music)|break]] in his bedroom; the break was originally much slower and had a [[classical music|classical]] sound. On another tape, Mothersbaugh played what became the main [[riff]] with a [[drum machine]]. One of [[Captain Beefheart]]'s drummers created a beat that Mothersbaugh recorded; the last demo was a live recording between Casale and Mothersbaugh. Casale took the four demos and layered them to create a smooth, consistent time signature.&lt;ref name="Rhino"&gt;{{cite web|first= Will |last= Harris |title= Interview: Gerald Casale of Devo |publisher= [[Rhino Entertainment]] |date= June 18, 2015 |accessdate= September 5, 2017 |url= http://www.rhino.com/article/interview-gerald-casale-of-devo/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothersbaugh created the main riff in "Whip It" by taking the riff used in [[Roy Orbison]]'s song "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" and changing the ending slightly.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=35}}

With a [[chord progression]] of D-A-E7[[Suspended chord|sus]]4 in the verses and C-G-D in the choruses, the song is written in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[E major]].&lt;ref name="Music Notes"&gt;{{cite web|title= Whip It by Devo – Digital Sheet Music |website= Music Notes |accessdate= September 5, 2017 |url= http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0075265}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Whip It"{{'s}} main riff alternates between a five-note ascension and a three-note descension, and is played with a synthesizer, electric guitar, and bass guitar.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=35}}&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; The chorus features two synthesizer notes that are a [[semitone|half step]] apart, which creates what [[AllMusic]]'s Steve Huey describes as "a disorienting aural effect".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt;

As the song progresses, a [[Lick (music)|guitar lick]] in the main riff becomes more prominent.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; During the instrumental break, the riff temporarily recofigures to a nonstandard 6/4 beat before returning to the original 4/4 beat.&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; Casale and Mothersbaugh sing the vocals of "Whip It" with a vocal range of A4-F#5.&lt;ref name="Music Notes"/&gt; The singers take alternate turns on vocals; Casale uses a nasal drawl while Mothersbaugh sings in a more powerful "cartoonish" voice.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; The use of two vocalists is a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] that Casale said is "kind of like white boys rapping".{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=36}}

===Lyrics===
The lyrics of "Whip It" are disjointed and nonsensical.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web|first= Steve |last= Huey |title= Devo – Whip It – Song Review |website= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= September 7, 2017 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/whip-it-mt0008523888}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, its central theme revolves around the ability to solve one's problems by "whipping it"; other lines include motivational statements like "go forward, move ahead" and "it's not too late".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; Casale wrote the lyrics, which were intended to satirize American optimism. He took inspiration from [[communist propaganda]] posters and ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]], a 1973 novel that contains satirical limericks about capitalist can-do clichés.{{sfnm|1a1=Majewski|1a2=Bernstein|1y=2014|1p=77|2a1=Nagy|2y=2015|2p=33}} Casale incorporated lyrics that would sound like motivational clichés if taken out of context.&lt;ref name="Flavorwire"&gt;{{cite web|first= Sara Jayne |last= Crow |title= Exclusive: Devo's Jerry Casale on De-evolution and the Meaning of 'Whip It' |website= [[Flavorwire]] |date= March 18, 2009 |accessdate= September 5, 2017 |url= http://flavorwire.com/14378/exclusive-devos-jerry-casale-on-de-evolution-and-the-meaning-of-whip-it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothersbaugh offered a different interpretation of the lyrics, saying they were written in the form of a subtle pep talk for United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]]. The members of Devo supported Carter and feared the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] would win the election.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}} Mothersbaugh jokingly once said in an interview: "Come on Jimmy, get your shit together".&lt;ref name="Rip It Up"&gt;{{cite book|first= Simon |last= Reynolds |authorlink= Simon Reynolds |year= 2005 |title= [[Rip It Up and Start Again]] |publisher= [[Penguin Books]] |isbn= 978-1-1012-0105-3 |page= 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huey notes that despite the song's novelty, there are violent undertones in the lyrics. He describes the process of whipping it to solve one's problems as "a sardonic portrait of a general, problematic aspect of the American psyche: the predilection for using force and violence to solve problems, vent frustration, and prove oneself to others".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt;

==Release==
"Whip It" is one of four songs from ''Freedom of Choice'' to be released as a single. Warner Bros. heavily favored the commercial viability of the first single "[[Girl U Want]]" because its music and lyrics were more radio-friendly and akin to "[[My Sharona]]" by [[the Knack]].&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;{{cite web|first= David |last= Chiu |title= 'Freedom of Choice' Is What You Got: A New Look at Devo's 1980 Hit Album |website= [[PopMatters]] |date= May 21, 2015 |accessdate= September 11, 2017 |url= https://www.popmatters.com/193489-freedom-of-choice-is-what-you-got-new-book-looks-at-devos-1980-hit-a-2495529894.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Girl U Want" failed to reach any record chart and was considered a failure.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=36}} Despite this initial failure, Devo decided to tour in support of the album without a hit single. Shortly into the tour, disc jockey [[Kal Rudman]] began playing "Whip It", and the song was soon being played on several radio stations in the Southeastern U.S. Within a week, "Whip It" had become so popular that Devo was forced to temporarily stop its tour to book larger venues because the concerts were selling out too quickly.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}}

"Whip It" debuted at number eighty-five on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on August 30, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Hot 100 |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= August 30, 1980 |accessdate= September 7, 2017 |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1980-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spent twenty-five weeks on the chart, peaked at number fourteen on November 15, 1980, and finished the year at number ninety-four on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1981|''Billboard'' Year-End singles chart]] for 1981.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Year End"/&gt; In the U.S., the song also reached number thirteen on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cash Box'' Top 100]],&lt;ref name="CashBox"/&gt; number fourteen on the [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart,&lt;ref name="Hot Dance"/&gt;{{efn|name=HD|group=upper-alpha}} and number seventeen on the [[Record World|''Record World'' Singles]] chart.&lt;ref name="Record World"/&gt; "Whip It" found international success, peaking at number seventy-seven on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]],&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt; number eleven on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart,&lt;ref name="CAN"/&gt; number eleven on the [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]],&lt;ref name="NZ"/&gt; and number fifty-one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt; The song was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] gold in the U.S. and Canada, denoting shipments of 1,000,000 and 75,000 copies respectively.&lt;ref name="RIAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

In a retrospective review, Huey said the song has "an irresistibly odd novelty appeal" and that it was "one of the best arguments that punk ideology didn't necessarily lose its bite when placed in the more pop-oriented musical context of new wave".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; ''[[PopMatters]]''{{'}} Chris Gerard noted the song's originality and described it as "a bold and provocative recording that still sounds fantastic blasted out of a good set of speakers".&lt;ref name="Gerard"&gt;{{cite web|first= Chris |last= Gerard |title= The 100 Greatest Alternative Singles of the '80s: Part 3: 60 – 41 |website= [[PopMatters]] |date= September 30, 2015 |accessdate= September 11, 2017 |url= https://www.popmatters.com/the-100-greatest-alternative-singles-of-the-80s-part-3-60-41-2495485637.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website subsequently ranked "Whip It" as the fifty-first best [[alternative rock|alternative]] song of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gerard"/&gt;

When "Whip It" was released, some listeners assumed the lyrics were [[double entendre]]s for [[masturbation]] or [[sadomasochism]].{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=33}} Devo's previous material often included sexual innuendos or blatant references to sex in the lyrics, which made "Whip It" appear consistent with this style of songwriting.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=33}} Mothersbaugh said many disc jockeys would make masturbation jokes to him before interviews.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}} At first, the band members attempted to dissuade them of this assumption but they eventually gave in and helped reinforce these misinterpretations.{{sfn|Majewski|Bernstein|2014|p=77}} Mothersbaugh believed a song about taboo subjects would receive more radio airplay and sell more copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Deanna R. |last= Adams |year= 2002 |title= Rock 'n' Roll and the Cleveland Connection |publisher= [[Kent State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8733-8691-3 |page= 386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==

In the background are onlooking cowboys and cowgirls, four men wearing black turtlenecks playing instruments, and a ranch house.]]

Although "Whip It" was not about masturbation or sadomasochism as some listeners believed, Devo used these sexual themes for an accompanying [[music video]].{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}} The video is set on a [[Guest ranch|dude ranch]] where cowboys and cowgirls are watching Mothersbaugh whip the clothing from a cigarette-smoking woman. A cross-eyed woman and a middle-aged woman making whipped cream watch from a ranch house while the other members of Devo perform the song in a cattle pen. The band members are wearing sleeveless black [[Polo neck|turtlenecks]] and red flowerpot-shaped hats called [[energy dome]]s.&lt;ref name="Rip It Up"/&gt;{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=38}}

Devo was heavily committed to adding film aspects to its act; the band asked Warner Bros. to provide non-recoupable promotional money to make videos for "Girl U Want" and "[[Freedom of Choice (song)|Freedom of Choice]]". This was before the making of music videos had become standard industry practice, which confused label executives. When "Whip It" started to receive radio airplay, the record company embraced the concept and asked the band to produce a video for "Whip It" with a $15,000 budget.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}} The idea for the video came from an article in a 1962 issue of ''[[The Dude (magazine)|The Dude]]'' magazine, which revolved around a former stuntman who marries a stripper and moves to a dude ranch in Arizona. For entertainment, the man would use a whip to remove the clothes from his wife, who would remain unhurt. Mothersbaugh stated; "That's the kind of stuff that fed us creatively. It was just so stupid and so low, and yet so great."{{sfnm|1a1=Majewski|1a2=Bernstein|1y=2014|1p=77|2a1=Nagy|2y=2015|2p=38}}

The video was partially a reaction to Reagan's previous career as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor; Devo wanted to make a video that satirized both the cowboy mythos and "right-wing racist values".&lt;ref name="Rip It Up"/&gt;{{sfn|Majewski|Bernstein|2014|p=78}} In the video, the whip does not strike the woman's clothes; they were tied to a fishing line and pulled away after each whip crack. The whip did, however, strike the cigarette holder to knock it out of her mouth.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=39}} For the first few months after its release, the video was seen by a limited audience, primarily on late-night talk shows. The American television channel [[MTV]], which was  launched in 1981, gave the video so much exposure that it temporarily revived the song's popularity, shortly before the release of Devo's next album ''[[New Traditionalists]]'' (1981).{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=39}}

The video attracted  some controversy, particularly for its perceived misogynistic undertones. Casale said the band members intended the video to appear tasteless and demeaning but also funny.&lt;ref name="Flavorwire"/&gt; The claims of misogyny increased when Devo was cut from a live performance on an episode of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' hosted by [[Lily Tomlin]]. After watching the video, Tomlin refused to host the show unless Devo was cut.&lt;ref name="Rhino"/&gt; There were also claims that MTV banned the video but these claims were ultimately proven false.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Several journalists view "Whip It" as a cornerstone of the development of new wave music in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}}&lt;ref name="Chiu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite book|first= Thomas |last= Harrison |year= 2017 |title= Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 978-1-4408-3667-1 |page= 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties'', Thomas Harrison wrote that the song introduced heavily synthesized music to a mainstream audience while music critic Evie Nagy called it a "defining anthem of new wave's rise".{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}}&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The majority of new wave music in the early 1980s was produced by British bands. Following the success of "Whip It", Devo joined [[the B-52's]] as the face of the emergent American new wave music movement.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=left|quote=If there was a Hall of Fame for early '80s New Wave music, Devo's 'Whip It' would be a shoo-in for induction. Undoubtedly the band's most recognizable song, 'Whip It' elevated Devo from an underground art-rock outfit to a (briefly) mainstream pop act, albeit one that still retained its pointed and satirical view of society. And, of course, who can forget the song's surrealist and now-iconic video that was a staple of MTV during the then-fledgling channel's early years? The fact that ''[[The Simpsons]]'' even paid homage to both the song and the video in an episode demonstrates how much 'Whip It' has transcended pop culture.|source=David Chiu of ''[[PopMatters]]'', discussing the song's legacy.&lt;ref name="Chiu"/&gt;|width=30em|quoted=1}}

The song's popularity can be largely attributed to its distinct originality. Gerard noted, "there's been nothing quite like 'Whip It' in the top 40, before or since".&lt;ref name="Gerard"/&gt; Nagy said the song's drum beat, guitar chords, and keyboard lines are distinct and easily recognizable, even when isolated from the song.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}} In his book ''99 Red Balloons: And 100 All-time One-hit Wonders'', Brent Mann wrote; "It's hard to find anyone between the ages of 30 and 50 who does not have a vivid recollection of 'Whip It'{{nbsp}}... the kind of unusual track that made listeners want to bop their heads and break into a herky-jerky dance".&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|first= Brent |last= Mann |year= 2003 |title= 99 Red Balloons: And 100 All-time One-hit Wonders |publisher= [[Citadel Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8065-2516-7 |pages= 77-78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accompanying music video is also remembered for its bizarre and controversial content.&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; According to Huey, "the song has remained in the public consciousness thanks in part to MTV's extensive airplay for the video".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; With the popularity of the video, MTV began pursuing Devo and promised them a new platform to showcase their visual works. Devo, however, eventually developed a troubled relationship with the channel. Most of the band's subsequent videos were censored for controversial content or were rejected because the song was not a hit single. According to Casale; "As soon as MTV went national, they came up with this new [[Taliban]] set of rules{{nbsp}}... we were stunned and felt jilted".{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=88}}

In the band's forty-year history, "Whip It" remains their only song to chart within the top forty on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt; As a result, some journalists have labeled Devo as a one-hit wonder.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;{{sfn|Nagy|=2015|p=94}}&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|first= Claire |last= Suddath |title= Nada Surf: Life After the One-Hit Wonder |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= January 27, 2012 |accessdate= September 12, 2017 |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2012/01/27/nada-surf-life-after-the-one-hit-wonder/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann noted that the band's strange philosophy on devolution offset its accessibility, and wrote; "Devo's songs were, quite simply, too far out and counter-culture for mainstream radio".&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt; Devo's members have never tried to distance themselves from "Whip It" and {{as of|2018|alt=as of 2018}} still play it live.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Casale said; "I'm glad it was 'Whip It', because it was certainly twisted and original{{nbsp}}... it came from a pure, creative, open collaboration, and that's to me when all the best stuff comes".{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=36}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11636">'''William Dennes Mahan''' (July 27, 1824 - October 19, 1906) was an [[United States|American]] [[Cumberland Presbyterian]] minister in [[Boonville, Missouri|Boonville]], [[Missouri]] and author of a book, commonly known as ''[[The Archko Volume]]'' (1884), purported to be a translation of a [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and other contemporary documents about the [[Trial of Jesus|trial and death]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].  The volume was initially received by some as true, but soon after its publication its authenticity was questioned.  The book has been definitively discredited as a forgery and fraud.

==Life and career==
William Dennes Mahan was born July 27, 1824 in [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia|Pittsylvania County]], [[Virginia]] to William P. and Permelia Mahan.  In 1837 his family moved to Missouri, and by 1845, he was living in [[Saline County, Missouri]] where he was serving as a minister in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Mahan married Martha R. Johnston in 1850, and together they had two daughters.  Mahan was living and preaching in Boonville in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;''Minutes of the General Assembly of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church'', 1872, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahan died October 19, 1906 in Boonville and is buried there in Walnut Grove Cemetery.

==First forgery==
In 1879 Mahan published a pamphlet of thirty-two pages entitled ''A Correct Transcript of Pilate's Court''. It purported to be an official report of the trial and death of Jesus made directly to the [[Tiberius|Roman Emperor Tiberius]] by [[Pilate]] as governor of [[Judaea]]. Mahan claimed the text was supplied to him in 1856 by a [[Germany|German]] scholar, Henry C. Whydaman, from Father Peter Freelinhusen, "the chief guardian of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]," who sent the Latin text to Whydaman’s brother-in-law, C. C. Vantberger of [[New York (state)|New York]], for English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 42; ''Modern Apocrypha'', 1956, 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Whydaman, Freelinhusen, and Vantberger are otherwise unknown, and the documentation of the exchange contains inconsistencies and errors, including Freelinhusen’s request for a fee payable in "[[daric]]s" (ancient [[Persian people|Persian]] coins).&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work was copied almost verbatim from "Ponce Pilate à Vienne", a short story by [[Joseph Méry]] published in ''[[Revue de Paris]]'' in 1837. Méry said he had been inspired by an old Latin manuscript, and an 1842 English translation of the story made the claim that it was in fact taken from an old Latin manuscript. Mahan’s contribution was evidently to create correspondence showing him to be the discoverer of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Per Beskow, ''Strange Tales about Jesus'' (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1983) 53-54: "As Goodspeed has shown, Mahan unabashedly plagiarized an existing story, and I am happy to have identified the original author: it was the French dramatician Joseph Mery (1798-1867), who wrote a number of short stories in his youth. The original story, ''Ponce Pilate à Vienne'', was published in the ''Revue de Paris'' in 1837; a comparison with Mahan's "manuscript" reveals a literal agreement in every detail, except where the text has been distorted by mistranslations or misreadings."&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Archko'' forgery==
In 1884 Mahan published the first version of the Archko Volume, entitled ''The Archaeological Writings of the Sanhedrin and Talmuds of the Jews, Taken from the Ancient Parchments and Scrolls at Constantinople and the Vatican at Rome, Being the Record Made by the Enemies of Jesus of Nazareth in His Day: The Most Interesting History Ever Read by Man''. This included an expanded version of "Pilate's Court" plus a series of other texts that he claimed to have obtained himself in a visit to Rome and Constantinople and translated with the aid of Dr. M. McIntosh of [[Scotland]] and Dr. Twyman of [[England]], also otherwise unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; These texts include interviews with the shepherds, [[Gamaliel]]'s interview with [[Joseph (father of Jesus)|Joseph]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Caiaphas]]'s reports to the [[Sanhedrin]], Eli's story of the [[Magi]], [[Herod the Great|Herod Antipater]]'s defense before the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] for the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], and [[Herod Antipas]]'s defense before the Senate&amp;mdash;all with the claim that they were copied from ancient manuscripts and translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 1931, 49-50; Archko Volume, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts are otherwise unknown to scholarship, and the volume contains various inconsistencies. It quotes an unknown [[Greece|Greek]] philosopher, "Meeleesen", and includes references to [[Josephus]] that do not exist. It mistakenly asserts that [[Philo]] spoke often of Jesus and that "the scribes of those days were most all [[Rabbis]]." There are inaccurate descriptions of the library of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], the making of [[papyrus]], and an inaccurate chronology for both Philo and [[Tacitus]]. Contemporaries raised the question of whether Mahan could have possibly made the trip to [[Rome]] and Constantinople in less than two months. Most tellingly, large portions of "Eli and the Story of the Magi" were copied verbatim from the 1880 novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]''. At one point, a strange word reveals that a single line of the printed text of ''Ben-Hur'' was accidentally omitted during copying.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 35-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure as a fraud==
Among the first to call Mahan's work into question was Rev. Dr. James A. Quarles, of [[Lexington, Missouri|Lexington]], Missouri. He was soon followed by William E. Curtis, a correspondent for the ''Chicago Record-Herald''.  In Rome, Curtis investigated Mahan's claims and declared the manuscript spurious and the alleged translation a forgery.

Mahan denied all the charges against him and asserted the truth of what he had written. He was summoned before church authorities in September 1885 on charges of falsehood and plagiarism, and a church trial was held. The New Lebanon Presbytery, of which he was a member, tried the case at length.

Evidence was introduced to show that Mahan had never been to Rome, but that he had spent the time he was absent from Boonville on a farm in [[Illinois]]. The editor of the ''Boonville Advertiser'' showed that the letters that paper had printed were postmarked from a small town in Illinois. Mahan rebutted the evidence by saying that they had been sent there to be re-mailed.  Additional evidence that Mahan had not traveled to Rome included a letter from Father Ehrie, prefect of the Vatican Library.  Ehrie stated that Mahan was entirely unknown there and that no person connected with the library had ever seen or head of the "Acta Pilati" or any such manuscript.

[[Lew Wallace]], author of ''Ben-Hur'' and [[US Ambassador to Turkey|American Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], testified that no record of Mahan’s visit to Turkey or to the library of the Hagia Sophia existed, and that the primary sources he cited were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict of the presbytery was nearly unanimous.  He was convicted and suspended from the ministry for one year.&lt;ref&gt;''Minutes of the New Lebanon Presbytery of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church'', September 25–29, 1885, 134-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his suspension, Mahan made no effort to return to the pastorate, living the remainder of his life at the home of his son-in-law, a hotel keeper in Boonville. He declined to make any further statements regarding the part he had taken in the preparation of the book except to say when he was told that the literary world pronounced it a forgery: "Well, I have been a much deceived and a much persecuted man."
 
After the trial, Mahan also promised to withdraw the book from publication.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; But the book was reprinted many times beginning in 1887 by various publishers, likely with Mahan's knowledge and profit from the sales. The title ''Archko Volume'' appeared during this time, as did the note "Second edition". This second edition omits "Eli and the Story of the Magi" and also creates a preface using material from the introductions to the texts. No new original material is included, which suggests that this version was produced by a publisher's clerk. The omission of the Eli text suggests that the court verdict was known to the reviser.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 1931, 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after his suspension, the New Lebanon Presbytery submitted a resolution indefinitely dismissing Mahan from the ministry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Your committee to whom was referred the motion to grant W. D. Mahan a letter of dismission [sic] and recommendation after the term of his suspension expires, have had the subject under consideration, and in view of all the surrounding facts, and in view of the interests of the Church, we recommend the following:&lt;br/&gt;

Whereas, This Pres., at its session in Slater, Sept. 29th, 1885, did suspend from the functions of the ministry, for one year, W. D. Mahan; said one year terminating on the 29th of the present month; and&lt;br/&gt;

Whereas, The definite form of said suspension was more the result of sympathy for him and his family, than a desire for rigid administration of the law, and this sympathy being exercised under the hope that said W. D. Mahan would use all proper efforts to heal the wounds his course had inflicted; and,&lt;br/&gt;

Whereas, It now comes to the knowledge of this Pres., that he still occupies the same position, by the sale of his publications, and by negotiations to bring out new editions, therefore;&lt;br/&gt;

Resolved, That the suspension of the said W. D. Mahan, be, and the same is hereby declared indefinite, or, until he shall have complied with the law of the Church, as it applies in the case."&lt;ref&gt;''Minutes of the New Lebanon Presbytery of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church'', September 10, 1886, 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern scholarship==
The circumstances of composition, the letters to the ''Boonville Advertiser'', and the proceedings of the church court were all investigated by [[Edgar J. Goodspeed]] and published in his books ''Strange New Gospels'' (1931) and ''Modern Apocrypha'' (1956).  More recently [[Per Beskow]] (1983) identified Mahan's original sources and reported on subsequent editions of the ''Archko Volume.''
