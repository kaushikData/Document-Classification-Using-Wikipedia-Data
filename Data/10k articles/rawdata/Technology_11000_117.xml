'''ATSC 3.0''' is a major version of the [[ATSC standards]] for television broadcasting created by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] (ATSC).&lt;ref name=ATSCTechGroup&gt;{{cite news |title=Technology Group 3 |publisher=[[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] |url=http://atsc.org/subcommittees/technology-group-3/ |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ATSC 3.0 comprises around 20 standards covering different aspects of the system and in total will have over 1,000 pages of documentation.&lt;ref name=ATSCStandardDocuments&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC 3.0: What will the "standard" look like? |author=Rich Chernock |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/newsletter/atsc-3-0-what-will-the-standard-look-like/ |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards are designed to offer support for newer technologies, including [[HEVC]] for video channels of up to [[4K resolution|2160p 4K]] resolution at [[High frame rate|120 frames per second]], [[wide color gamut]], [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]], [[Dolby AC-4]] and [[MPEG-H 3D Audio]], [[datacasting]] capabilities, and more robust [[mobile television]] support.&lt;ref name=ATSCTechGroup/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GatesAir: Are you ready for ATSC 3.0?|url=http://www.gatesair.com/solutions/are-you-ready-for-atsc-3.0|publisher=GatesAir|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capabilities have also been foreseen as a way to enable [[targeted advertising]] and finer [[Emergency population warning|public alerting]].

The first major deployments of ATSC 3.0 occurred in [[South Korea]], with the country's major television networks launching terrestrial ATSC 3.0 services in May 2017 in preparation for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. In November 2017, the United States' [[Federal Communications Commission]] approved regulations allowing broadcast stations to voluntarily offer ATSC 3.0 services ('''Next Gen TV'''); however, they must be offered alongside a standard ATSC digital signal, and there will not be a mandatory transition as was done with the transition from analog NTSC to ATSC.

==Technical details==
{{Further|List of ATSC standards#ATSC 3.0}}

===Bootstrap===
ATSC 3.0 uses a bootstrap signal which allows a receiver to discover and identify the signals that are being transmitted.&lt;ref name=Atsc3SystemDiscoveryPDFMarch2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Standard: System Discovery and Signaling |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/A321-2016-System-Discovery-and-Signaling-1.pdf |date=March 23, 2016 |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bootstrap signal has a fixed configuration that can allow for new signal types to be used in the future.&lt;ref name=Atsc3SystemDiscoveryPDFMarch2016ATSC/&gt;

===Physical layer===
ATSC 3.0 uses a physical layer that is based on [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) modulation with [[low-density parity-check code]] (LDPC) FEC codes.&lt;ref name=Atsc3PhysicalPDFSeptember2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Standard: Physical Layer Protocol |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/A322-2016-Physical-Layer-Protocol.pdf |date=September 7, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz channel the [[bit rate]] can vary from 1 Mbit/s to 57 Mbit/s depending on the parameters that are used.&lt;ref name=Atsc3PhysicalPDFSeptember2016ATSC/&gt; ATSC 3.0 can have up to 4 physical layer pipes (PLP) in a channel with different robustness levels used for each PLP.&lt;ref name=Atsc3PhysicalPDFSeptember2016ATSC/&gt; An example of how PLP can be used would be a channel that delivers HD video over a robust PLP and enhances the video to UHD with [[Scalable Video Coding]] over a higher bitrate PLP.&lt;ref name=ATSCWhereStand&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC 3.0: Where We Stand |author=Rich Chernock |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/newsletter/atsc-3-0-where-we-stand/ |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
ATSC 3.0 supports [[Dolby AC-4]] and [[MPEG-H 3D Audio]].&lt;ref name=Atsc3AudioCommonPDFSeptember2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Candidate Standard: Audio Common Elements |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A342S34-187r9-Audio-Part-1.pdf |date=June 15, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atsc3AudioAC4PDFMay2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Candidate Standard: AC-4 System |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A342S34-188r7-Audio-Part-2.pdf |date=May 3, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atsc3AudioMPEGHPDFMay2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Candidate Standard: MPEG-H System |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/A342S34-189r3-Audio-Standard-Part-3.pdf |date=May 3, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video===
ATSC 3.0 supports three video formats: Legacy SD Video, Interlaced HD Video, and Progressive Video.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Standard: Video |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/A341-2017-Video-HEVC.pdf |date=May 19, 2017 |accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy SD Video and Interlaced HD Video support [[frame rate]]s up to 60 fps and can only use the [[Rec. 709]] color space.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt; Legacy SD Video and Interlaced HD Video are included for compatibility with existing content and can't use HDR, HFR, or WCG.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt;

;Legacy SD Video
Legacy SD Video supports resolutions up to 720×480 and supports [[High Efficiency Video Coding]] (HEVC) Main 10 profile at Level 3.1 Main Tier.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt;

;Interlaced HD Video
Interlaced HD Video supports 1080-line [[interlaced video]] with 1920 or 1440 pixels per line, and supports HEVC Main 10 profile at Level 4.1 Main Tier.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt;

;Progressive Video
Progressive Video supports resolutions up to 3840×2160 [[progressive scan]] and supports HEVC Main 10 profile at Level 5.2 Main Tier.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt; Progressive Video supports frame rates up to 120 fps and the [[Rec. 2020]] color space.&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt; Progressive Video supports HDR using [[Hybrid Log-Gamma]] (HLG) and [[Perceptual Quantizer]] (PQ).&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoPDFMay2017ATSC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atsc3HDRDeliveryMay2016&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Day Dawning...

===Watermark===
ATSC 3.0 supports [[digital watermarking]] of the audio signal and video signal.&lt;ref name=Atsc3AudioWatermarkPDFSeptember2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Standard: Audio Watermark Emission |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/A334-2016-Audio-Watermark-Emission.pdf |date=September 19, 2016 |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atsc3VideoWatermarkPDFSeptember2016ATSC&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Standard: Video Watermark Emission |format=PDF |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/A335-2016-Video-Watermark-Emission.pdf |date=September 20, 2016 |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public alerting ===
A U.S. consortium known as AWARN has advocated for the use of ATSC 3.0 features, including datacasting, and automatically waking up devices, in order to provide an [[Emergency population warning|emergency alert system]] with support for embedded rich media and finer geotargeting. These features are defined within the "Advanced Emergency Alerting" portions of the ATSC 3.0 standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/98815/awarn-alerting-an-atsc-30-business-model|title=AWARN Alerting: An ATSC 3.0 Business Model|website=TVNewsCheck.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/atsc-30-a-new-valueadded-approach-for-emergency-information/281316|title=ATSC 3.0: A New Value-Added Approach for Emergency Information|work=TV Technology|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On March 26, 2013, the Advanced Television Systems Committee announced a call for proposals for the ATSC 3.0 physical layer which states that the plan is for the system to support video with a resolution of 3840×2160 at 60 fps ([[4k resolution|4K]] [[Ultra high definition television|UHDTV]]).&lt;ref name=AtscPDFMarch20134ATSC3PhysicalLayer&gt;{{cite news|title=Call for Proposals for ATSC-3.0 Physical Layer |format=PDF |publisher=[[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] |url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/ATSC-3-PHY-CFP.pdf |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509105751/http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/ATSC-3-PHY-CFP.pdf |archivedate=May 9, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AtscPRMarch20134ATSC3PhysicalLayer&gt;{{cite news|title=Advanced Television Systems Committee Invites Proposals for Next-Generation TV Broadcasting Technologies |publisher=Advanced Television Systems Committee |url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/index.php/communications/press-releases/315-advanced-television-systems-committee-invites-proposals-for-next-generation-tv-broadcasting-technologies |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401051516/http://www.atsc.org/cms/index.php/communications/press-releases/315-advanced-television-systems-committee-invites-proposals-for-next-generation-tv-broadcasting-technologies |archivedate=April 1, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BroadcastMarch20134ATSC3PhysicalLayer&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC seeks proposals for ATSC 3.0 physical layer |publisher=Broadcast Engineering |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/standards/atsc-seeks-proposals-atsc-30-physical-layer |date=March 27, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TVTechnologyMarch20134ATSC3PhysicalLayer&gt;{{cite news |title=ATSC Seeks Next-Gen TV Physical Layer Proposals |author=Doug Lung |publisher=[[TV Technology]] |url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/atsc-seeks-next-gen-tv-physical-layer-proposals/218643 |date=March 28, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520070147/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/atsc-seeks-next-gen-tv-physical-layer-proposals/218643 |archive-date=2013-05-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a channel-sharing trial began between Los Angeles television stations [[KLCS]] (a [[public broadcasting|public television]] station that is a [[PBS]] member) and [[KJLA]], a commercial ethnic broadcaster owned-and-operated by [[LATV]], with support from the [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA]] and approval of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].  The test involved multiplexing multiple HD and SD subchannels together, experimenting with both current [[MPEG-2]] / [[H.262]] and [[MPEG-4 AVC]] / [[H.264]] video codecs.  Ultimately, it has been decided that H.264 would not be considered for ATSC-3.0, but rather the newer [[High Efficiency Video Coding|MPEG-H HEVC]] / [[H.265]] codec would be used instead, with [[OFDM]] instead of [[8VSB]] for modulation, allowing for 28 Mbit/s&lt;ref name=gigaom-trialresult&gt;{{cite web|title=LA trial finds that broadcasters can share their TV channels|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/03/28/la-trial-finds-that-broadcasters-can-share-their-tv-channels/|work=Gigaom|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctia-klcs-kjla-report&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the KLCS/KJLA Channel Sharing Pilot — A Technical Report|url=http://www.ctia.org/docs/default-source/fcc-filings/technical-report-of-the-klcs-kjla-channel-sharing-pilot.pdf|work=Alan Popkin, Director of Television Engineering &amp; Technical Operations, [[KLCS-TV]], Los Angeles&lt;br /&gt;Roger Knipp, Broadcast Engineer, KLCS-TV, Los Angeles&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Hernandez, Director of Operations &amp; Engineering, [[KJLA-TV]]|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mibuzzboard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=40001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/pdf/pt2/PT2-046r11-Final-Report-on-NGBT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226070820/http://www.atsc.org/cms/pdf/pt2/PT2-046r11-Final-Report-on-NGBT.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mentor.ieee.org/802.18/dcn/12/18-12-0011-00-0000-nab-presentation-on-atsc-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to 36 Mbit/s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/88877/kim-luplow-extol-atsc-30-progress/page/3&lt;/ref&gt; or more of bandwidth on a single 6-MHz channel.

In May 2015, and continuing on for six months afterward, the temporary digital transition transmitter and antenna of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]'s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate, [[WJW (TV)|WJW]], will be used by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] to test the "Futurecast" ATSC 3.0 standard advanced by [[LG Corporation]] and [[GatesAir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/84220/cleveland-to-be-site-of-nextgen-test-station|title=Cleveland To Be Site Of Next-Gen Test Station|last=Jessell|first=Henry|date=April 2, 2015 |publisher=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 further tests in the [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, DC]] area were announced by [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]'s Baltimore station, [[WBFF]], which is also a Fox affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/88176/one-media-to-test-nextgen-sfn-platform|title=ONE Media To Test Next-Gen SFN Platform|last=Miller|first=Mark|date=September 5, 2015|work=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurecast system had previously been tested in October 2014 during off-air hours through [[Madison, Wisconsin]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WKOW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/technology/futurecast-broadcast-system-tested-wkow/135032|title=Futurecast Broadcast System Tested at WKOW|last=Winslow|first=George|date=October 22, 2014|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/distribution/0099/one-media-field-tests-proposed-atsc--system/273323&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[ATSC]] 1.0/2.0's [[Distributed Transmission System]]'s pseudo-single-frequency network operations, [[WBFF|WI9XXT]]'s two transmitters operate as a true [[Single Frequency Network]].&lt;ref&gt;http://atsc.org/newsletter/broadcasters-tech-companies-putting-atsc-3-0-physical-layer-candidate-standard-technologies-through-paces/&lt;/ref&gt;

Further tests began in on January 6, 2016 of ATSC 3.0 with [[High Dynamic Range]] (using the [[High Efficiency Video Coding|Scalable HEVC]] video codec with [[HE-AAC]] audio) from [[Las Vegas]] independent station, [[KHMP-LD]] on UHF 18.  It would later be joined in these tests by Sinclair's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate, [[KVCW]] simulcasting on a temporary test frequency (UHF 45).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/live-atsc-30-broadcast-during-ces-2016-delivers-4k-uhd-hdr-to-next-gen-lg-oled-4k-tvs-300199955.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/khmptv-delivers-live-hdr-4ktv-in-atsc-30-at-ces/277694&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avsforum.com/forum/45-local-hdtv-info-reception/148479-las-vegas-nv-hdtv-326.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2016, a working group in South Korea led by [[LG Electronics]] and others performed the first "end-to-end" broadcast of [[4K resolution]] programming via an ATSC 3.0 signal, using an IP transmission from the [[Seoul Broadcasting System]]'s [[Mok-dong]] studio to feed a transmitter on [[Gwanak Mountain]]. The broadcaster's technical director stated that the successful test "highlights the potential for Korea’s launch of terrestrial UHD TV commercial services using ATSC 3.0 in February 2017."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First End-to-End 4K IP Broadcast in Korea Marks Another Key Milestone for ATSC 3.0|url=https://www.atsc.org/newsletter/first-end-to-end-4k-ip-broadcast-in-korea-marks-another-key-milestone-for-atsc-3-0/|website=atsc.org|publisher=ATSC|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Groves"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘World’s first’ live ATSC 3.0 broadcast|url=http://www.tvbeurope.com/worlds-first-live-atsc-3-0-broadcast/|website=TVB Europe|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the test broadcast, South Korean broadcasters announced that they planned to launch ATSC 3.0 services in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/korea-to-launch-atsc-30-broadcasts-in-2017/278022|title=Korea to Launch ATSC 3.0 Broadcasts in 2017|work=TV Technology|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2016, the Bootstrap component of ATSC 3.0 (System Discovery and Signalling) was upgraded from candidate standard to finalized standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/first-element-of-atsc-30-approved-for-standard/278263&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2016, [[NBC]] affiliate [[WRAL-TV]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], a station known for its pioneering roles in testing the original ATSC standards, launched an experimental ATSC 3.0 channel carrying the station's programming in 1080p, as well as a 4K demo loop.&lt;ref name="tvnc-atsc3"&gt;{{cite web|title=WRAL Launches ATSC 3.0 Service|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/95854/first-again-wral-launches-atsc-30-service|website=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WRAL-EX has also carried 4K coverage of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in an experimental manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/tv/warm-tv-blog/article201303244.html|title=WRAL: ATSC 3.0 Next Generation TV delivers 4K ultra high-def|last=Cain|first=Brooke|date=21 February 2018|work=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/marketshare/2018/02/21/wral-shows-olympics-in-next-gen-tv/|title=WRAL Shows Olympics In Next Gen TV Format|last=Greeley|first=Paul|date=21 February 2018|work=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korean deployment===
On July 27, 2016, South Korea's [[Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning]] officially endorsed ATSC 3.0 as the country's broadcasting standard for ultra-high-definition television.&lt;ref name=Atsc3SouthKoreaJuly2016&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: South Korea Adopts ATSC 3.0 |author=Deborah D.

On May 31, 2017, SBS, [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] officially launched their full-time ATSC 3.0 services in major South Korean markets such as Seoul and Incheon. The launch had been delayed from February 2017 due to issues obtaining the required equipment.&lt;ref name="tvt-skready"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/south-korean-broadcasters-ready-to-launch-atsc-30/281130|title=South Korean Broadcasters Ready to Launch ATSC 3.0|work=TV Technology|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Bladerston"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Counterparts Congratulate Korea on ATSC 3.0 Launch|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/us-counterparts-congratulate-korea-on-atsc-30--launch/280720|website=tvtechnology.com|publisher=TV Technology|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The transition made South Korea the first country in the world to deploy a terrestrial UHD format, and enabled 4K broadcasts of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Steve|title=2018 A Crucial Year for ATSC 3.0|url=https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/gear-and-technology/2018-a-crucial-year-for-atsc-3-0|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Pro Sound News|publisher=Prosoundnetwork.com|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Jamie|title=The top tech at the 2018 Winter Olympics: 5G, VR, 4K, bullet time and SmartSuits|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2131572/top-tech-2018-winter-olympics-5g-vr-4k-bullet-time-and-smartsuits|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=South China Morning Post|publisher=scmp.com|date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. deployment===
On February 2, 2017, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) issued a [[notice of proposed rulemaking]] (NPRM) that would allow for the deployment of ATSC 3.0 in the United States.&lt;ref name=FCCNoticeFebruary2017TVTechnology&gt;{{cite news |title=FCC Proposes ATSC 3.0 Deployment |publisher=TVTechnology |url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/fcc-proposes-atsc-30-deployment/280260 |author=Deborah D. McAdams |date=February 2, 2017 |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comments on issues such as carriage obligations, interference, public interest obligations, simulcasting, and a tuner mandate.&lt;ref name=FCCCommentsFebruary2017TVTechnology&gt;{{cite news |title=FCC@3.0: OET-69, Public Interest, Yes; Tuner Edict, No |publisher=TVTechnology |url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/fcc30-oet69-public-interest-yes-tuner-edict-no/280262 |author=Deborah D. McAdams |date=February 2, 2017 |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Shapiro of the [[Consumer Technology Association]] (CTA) has stated that a TV tuner mandate is not necessary and that it should be market-driven and voluntary.&lt;ref name=ATSCTunderFebruary2017BusinessWire&gt;{{cite news |title=Proposed ATSC 3.0 Rule a Win for Consumers, but Should Exclude TV Tuner Mandate |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170203005731/en/Proposed-ATSC-3.0-Rule-Win-Consumers-Exclude |date=February 2, 2017 |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2017, the FCC voted unanimously to approve two portions of the NPRM, opening the door for manufacturers to begin producing ATSC 3.0 hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah D. McAdams, "FCC Greenlights ATSC 3.0," ''TV Technology'', February 23, 2017, http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/fcc-greenlights-atsc-30/280420&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2017, the Pearl consortium (comprising a number of major broadcasting conglomerates, including [[Cox Media]], [[Graham Media Group]], [[Hearst Television]], [[Meredith Corporation]], [[Nexstar Media Group]], [[Scripps Media]], and [[Tegna Inc.]]) announced that it would use [[Phoenix, Arizona]] as a test market for an ATSC 3.0 transition in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/phoenix-to-serve-as-model-market-for-atsc-30/282269|title=Phoenix To Serve As ‘Model Market’ For ATSC 3.0|work=TV Technology|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the FCC voted 3-2 in favor of an order authorizing voluntary deployments of Next Gen TV (ATSC 3.0); stations that choose to deploy ATSC 3.0 services must continue to maintain an ATSC-compatible signal that is "substantially similar" in programming to their ATSC 3.0 signal (besides programming that leverages ATSC 3.0 features, and advertising), and covers the station's entire community of license (the FCC stated that it would expedite approval for transitions if the loss in over-the-air coverage post-transition is 5% or less). This clause will remain in effect for at least five years; permission from the FCC must be obtained before a full-power station can shut down its ATSC signal, but low-power stations are exempt from the simulcasting requirement and are allowed to flash-cut to ATSC 3.0 if they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-launches-next-gen-broadcast-tv-standard/170165|title=FCC Launches Next-Gen Broadcast TV Standard|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fcc-3order"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-authorizes-next-gen-tv-broadcast-standard|title=FCC Authorizes Next Gen TV Broadcast Standard|website=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATSC 1.0 signals will still be subject to mandatory carriage rules for television providers during the five-year simulcasting mandate; the FCC stated that voluntary carriage of 3.0 signals by television providers would be left to the marketplace. The order does require stations to provide sufficient on-air notice about transitions to ATSC 3.0 services.&lt;ref name="fcc-3order"/&gt; The FCC will not allocate a second channel to each broadcaster to enable a gradual consumer transition. Instead, it has been suggested that multiple broadcasters in each market cooperate by locating multiple degraded ATSC 1.0 services on a single transmitter. At the same time, the broadcasters would share the remaining transmitters for ATSC 3.0 transmissions. After sufficient consumer adoption, ATSC 1.0 transmissions would be abandoned, allowing stations to return to operation on their owned transmitters. It is unclear how the complications of this approach would be overcome, especially in light of [[spectrum reallocation]] in heavily populated markets.&lt;ref name=ReadyAtsc3July2015TVTechnology&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting Ready for ATSC 3.0 |author=Doug Lung |publisher=TVTechnology |url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/expertise/0003/getting-ready-for-atsc-30/276660 |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC published its final rules on ATSC 3.0 to the [[Federal Register]] on February 2, 2018, and they formally take effect 30 days afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/fcc/atsc-30-rollout-can-begin-next-month/417861|title=ATSC 3.0 Rollout Can Begin Next Month |website=Multichannel|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the transition is voluntary, the FCC will not require ATSC 3.0 tuners to be included in new televisions, and there will not be a subsidy program for the distribution of ATSC 3.0-compatible equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Channel Battle Rages in ATSC Rollout|last=Eggerton|first=John|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=2018-03-05|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ATSC 3.0 trials by Pearl, [[Univision]]'s [[KFPH-CD]] in Phoenix was converted to an ATSC 3.0 station on April 9, 2018, which will be shared by Univision and several other broadcasters. Univision and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] are also planning a trial in [[Dallas]], which will utilize spectrum vacated by [[KSTR-DT]] and [[KTXD-TV]] to test ATSC 3.0 transmission using a [[Single-frequency network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/112543/30s-potential-to-be-tested-in-phoenix-dallas|title=3.0's Potential To Be Tested In Phoenix, Dallas|website=TVNewsCheck|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercecable.com/video/univision-switches-first-atsc-3-0-station-phoenix-test-market|title=Univision switches on first ATSC 3.0 station in Phoenix test market|website=FierceCable|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns ==
Consumer advocates have noted the opportunity in which ATSC 3.0 can allow advertisers to run [[targeted advertising]]. The targeted ads would allow advertisers to track more directly [[Audience measurement|viewer ratings]] rather than indirectly by companies such as [[Nielsen ratings]]. The FCC is expected to defer the decision on targeted ads to be in accordance with Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/14/tv-stations-are-about-to-track-you-and-sell-targeted-ads-just-like-google-and-facebook/|title=TV stations are about to track you and sell targeted ads, just like Google and Facebook|last=Fung|first=Brian|date=2017-11-14|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consortium of U.S. television providers criticized the domestic plans for the transition, citing the "voluntary" transition, inconsistencies in commitments to simulcasting arrangements for compatibility, potential downgrades in service for ATSC 1.0 viewers, as well as how these signals will factor into [[retransmission consent]] negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/paytv-consumer-groups-slam-atsc-30-proposal/282172|title=Pay-TV, Consumer Groups Slam ATSC 3.0 Proposal|work=TV Technology|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abigail Gawthern''' (7 July 1757 – 7 January 1822) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]  diarist and lead manufacturer.

==Life==
Gawthern was probably born in Nottingham. Her parents were Ann and Thomas Frost. She was named "Abigail Anna" after her father's mother. This was opportune as the Frosts were to inherit a substantial bequest from her grandmother's brother [[Thomas Secker]]. Secker had been the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Secker died his will was disputed by Thomas Frost and he managed to persuade the court that £11,000 intended for charity should be added to an existing legitimate bequest to his family.&lt;ref name=odndabi/&gt; 

From an early age Gawthern kept a diary.&lt;ref name=odndabi&gt;Adrian Henstock, ‘Gawthern , Abigail Anna (1757–1822)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47589, accessed 8 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 Gawthern, husband died. She took control of the family's [[white lead]] business and its money and property. She continued to live in their substantial house at 26 Low Pavement in Nottingham. When her parents died in 1801 she received another large inheritance.&lt;ref name="Vickery2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda Vickery|title=The Gentleman's Daughter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7C4NRPbK3AC&amp;pg=RA7-PT168|date=11 August 2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17721-3|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business continued and her son briefly led the business until it folded in 1808 due to more efficient methods of production being developed.&lt;ref name=odndabi/&gt; 

Gawthern is remembered because in the early 1800s she to copied her diaries into a single volume that in time would document Nottingham's history for the period 1751–1810.&lt;ref name="Gawthern1980"/&gt; The diaries show how the professional classes lived at that time. In her own street was the home of the "Ladies Assembly" which was run by ladies but which was open to both genders but not the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/city-s-georgians-let-hair/story-27596460-detail/story.html|title=How did Georgian Nottingham let its hair down?|date=2015-08-13|work=Nottingham Post|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawthern died at her home in Low Pavement in 1822. A son, Francis, and a daughter, Anna, survived her.&lt;ref name="Vickery2003"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9565">'''Amorphous computing''' refers to computational systems that use very large numbers of identical, parallel processors each having limited computational ability and local interactions.  The term Amorphous Computing was coined at MIT in 1996 in a paper entitled [http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/amorphous/white-paper/amorph-new/amorph-new.html "Amorphous Computing Manifesto"] by Abelson, Knight, Sussman, et al.

Examples of naturally occurring amorphous computations can be found in many fields, such as: [[developmental biology]] (the development of multicellular organisms from a single cell), [[molecular biology]] (the organization of sub-cellular compartments and intra-cell signaling), [[neural networks]], and [[chemical engineering]] (non-equilibrium systems) to name a few.  The study of amorphous computation is ''hardware agnostic''—it is not concerned with the physical substrate (biological, electronic, nanotech, etc.) but rather with the characterization of amorphous algorithms as abstractions with the goal of both understanding existing natural examples and engineering novel systems.

Amorphous computers tend to have many of the following properties:
* Implemented by redundant, potentially faulty, massively parallel devices.
* Devices having limited memory and computational abilities.
* Devices being asynchronous.
* Devices having no ''a priori'' knowledge of their location.
* Devices communicating only locally.
* Exhibit emergent or self-organizational behavior (patterns or states larger than an individual device).
* Fault-tolerant, especially to the occasional malformed device or state perturbation.

== Algorithms, tools, and patterns ==
(Some of these algorithms have no known names.  Where a name is not known, a descriptive one is given.)

* '''"Fickian communication"'''.  Devices communicate by generating messages which diffuse through the medium in which the devices dwell.  Message strength will follow the inverse square law as described by [[Fick's law of diffusion]].  Examples of such communication are common in biological and chemical systems.
* '''"Link diffusive communication"'''. Devices communicate by propagating messages down links wired from device to device. Unlike "Fickian communication", there is not necessarily a diffusive medium in which the devices dwell and thus the spatial dimension is irrelevant and [[Fick's law of diffusion|Fick's Law]] is not applicable.  Examples are found in Internet routing algorithms such as the [[Diffusing Update Algorithm]].  Most algorithms described in the amorphous computing literature assume this kind of communication.
* '''"Wave Propagation"'''. (Ref 1) A device emits a message with an encoded hop-count.  Devices which have not seen the message previously, increment the hop count, and re-broadcast.  A wave propagates through the medium and the hop-count across the medium will effectively encode a distance gradient from the source.
* '''"Random ID"'''. Each device gives itself a random id, the random space being sufficiently large to preclude duplicates.
* '''"Growing-point program"'''. (Coore). Processes that move among devices according to 'tropism' (movement of an organism due to external stimuli).
* '''"Wave coordinates"'''. [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/tucson-talk/ DARPA PPT slides]. To be written.
* '''"Neighborhood query"'''. (Nagpal) A device samples the state of its neighbors by either a push or pull mechanism.
* '''"Peer-pressure"'''.  Each device maintains a state and communicates this state to its neighbors.  Each device uses some voting scheme to determine whether or not to change state to its neighbor's state.  The algorithm partitions space according to the initial distributions and is an example of a clustering algorithm.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* '''"Self maintaining line"'''. ([http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/amorphous/Robust/laurenc/amorphous/self-repair.html Lauren Lauren, Clement]). A gradient is created from one end-point on a plane covered with devices via Link Diffusive Communication.  Each device is aware of its value in the gradient and the id of its neighbor that is closer to the origin of the gradient.  The opposite end-point detects the gradient and informs its closer neighbor that it is part of a line.  This propagates up the gradient forming a line which is robust against disruptions in the field. (Illustration needed).
* '''"Club Formation"'''. ([http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/2546/http:zSzzSzswissnet.ai.mit.eduzSz~switzzSzamorphouszSzpaperszSzaimemo1614.pdf/coore97paradigms.pdf Coore, Coore ,Nagpal, Weiss]). Local clusters of processors elect a leader to serve as a local communication hub.
* '''"Coordinate formation"''' ([ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-1666.pdf Nagpal]). Multiple gradients are formed and used to form a coordinate system via triangulation.

'''Brainscape''' is a web and mobile education platform that allows students to study adaptive [[flashcards]].  The [[website]] and mobile application allow students, teachers, and corporate trainers to create (or upload) electronic flashcards, and to find flashcards created by other users and publishers around the world.  Flashcards are all stored in [[Cloud computing|the cloud]] and can be shared with groups of other learners.&lt;ref name="Functionality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/05/07/brainscape/#cRBIhWjor8qD |title=Smart, Digital Flashcards Maximize Study Time |publisher=mashable.com |date=2011-05-07 |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brainscape's most distinguishing characteristic is its flashcard repetition algorithm, called Confidence-Based Repetition (CBR).&lt;ref name="CBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2010/01/confidence-based-repetition-cbr/ |title=Confidence-Based Repetition |publisher=brainscape.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBR is a personalized form of [[spaced repetition]], in which the learner rates his/her confidence in each flashcard, on a scale of 1-5, which subsequently determines how frequently to repeat the flashcard.  Lower-confidence items are repeated more frequently until the user upgrades his/her confidence rating, thereby creating an optimized study stream.&lt;ref name="how_it_works"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brainscape.com/how_it_works |title=How Brainscape Works |publisher=brainscape.com |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brainscape has published a white paper&lt;ref name="white_paper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brainscape.com/images/cms/research/Confidence-Based_Repetition.pdf |title=Confidence-Based Repetition white paper |publisher=brainscape.com |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cites academic studies proving the viability of the [[cognitive science]] research that it applies in its technology.

==History==
The idea for Brainscape arose when its founder, Andrew Cohen, was attempting to study Spanish and French while living in [[Panama]] and [[Martinique]] from 2005 to 2007.  When [[Rosetta Stone]] and other educational resources were not working efficiently enough for him, Cohen created a [[Microsoft Excel]] program that would quiz him on individual vocabulary words and verb conjugations, then repeat those concepts within an interval of time that felt appropriate to his pace of learning.&lt;ref name="brainscape_origin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2010/03/how-brainscape-was-born/ |title=How Brainscape Was Born |publisher=brainscape.com |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen later followed this passion by pursuing a master's degree in Education Technology from [[Columbia University]], where he focused his graduate research on the concept of CBR and built a more complete prototype using the Java programming language.  In 2010, he partnered with Andy Lutz, the ex-VP of Product from [[The Princeton Review]], and he began seeking [[venture capital]] and was able to raise over $3 million, in three tranches, by 2015.&lt;ref name="crunchbase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/brainscape |title=Brainscape |publisher=crunchbase.com |date=2015-12-01 |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brainscape has since expanded to several million registered users among students of all ages, especially in graduate and medical programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Services==
Brainscape provides services including electronic flashcards, various study modes, collaborative editing tools, and teacher dashboards, via its website and [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] applications.

'''Capillary action through synthetic mesh''' is the result of the [[intermolecular]] attraction between [[moisture]] and semi-[[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] [[polymers]], causing a current of thermionic energy through a specific pathway within a [[mesh]] material. The combination of the adhesive forces and the [[surface tension]] that arises from cohesion  produces the characteristic upward curve in a fluid, such as water. [[Capillarity]] is the result of cohesion of water [[molecules]] and [[adhesion]] of those molecules to the solid material forming the void. As the edges of the material are brought closer together, such as in a very narrow path, the interaction causes the liquid to be drawn away from the original source. The more narrow the pathway, the greater the rise of the liquid. Greater surface tension and increased ratio of adhesion to cohesion also result in greater rise. Synthetic materials using [[conductive]] polymer as found in [[polypyrrole]] to reduce liquid density to a manageable state.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}

The force with which water is held by capillary action varies with the quantity of water being held. As part of a demonstration conducted by Bright Idea and Webb development: Water entering a natural void, such as a pore within a synthetic mesh material, forms a [[film]] on the surface of the material surrounding the pore. The adhesion of the water molecules nearest the solid material is greatest. As water is added to the pore, the thickness of the film increases, the capillary force is reduced in magnitude, and water molecules on the outer portion of the film may begin to flow away from its source. As more water enters the pore the capillary force is reduced to zero when the pore is saturated, unless a hydrophilic body is introduced. The movement of moisture through the mesh is controlled by this capillary action.

'''Charpai''',&lt;ref name="Jamart1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Corinne Jamart|title=Charpai: Indian Cot Filling, a Visual and Technical Documentation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JatGXwAACAAJ|year=1978|publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Charpaya''' or '''Charpoy''' or '''Manji'''  ([[Hindi]] : चारपाई, [[Urdu]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; ''char'' "four" + ''paya'' "footed") is a traditional woven [[Bed (furniture)|bed]] used in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is also known as Khaat, Khatia, or Manji. 

Charpai is well known due to its natural qualities mostly it is used in warm areas; its net is made out of cotton, natural fibres and date leaves. It's a very simple design that's very easy to construct. There are many interpretations of the traditional design and over the years crafts people have innovated on the weave patterns and materials used. 

The construction is simple, it has a frame of four strong vertical posts connected by four horizontal members. This simple construction of the Charpai also makes it self leveling. Weaving of the Charpai is done in many ways, e.g diagonal cross weave with one end left for adjustments as linear members. This helps in controlling the sagging of the bed as it ages with use.

[[Ibn Battuta]] describes them as having "four conical legs with four crosspieces of wood on which braids of silk or cotton are woven.  When one lies down on it, there is no need for anything to make it pliable, for it is pliable of itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=185,317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">'''Choice in eCommerce - Initiative for Choice and Innovation in Online-Trade''' - is an initiative of online retailers throughout Europe that works for unrestricted trade and innovation in [[Europe]]. Spokesman for the initiative is Oliver Prothmann, founder of the Multi-Channel tool chartixx.

==History==
Choice in [[e-commerce|eCommerce]] was founded on May 8, 2013 by several online retailers in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamebay.com/2013/07/petition-for-choice-in-ecommerce.html |title=Blog : Petition for Choice in Ecommerce |publisher=Tamebay |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newrooms.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/choice-in-ecommerce/ |title=Choice in eCommerce &amp;#124; The newroomsonline blog |publisher=Newrooms.wordpress.com |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trustedshops.co.uk/news/online-retailers-prepare-to-fight-the-sales-ban/ |title=Online retailers prepare to fight the sales ban - Best practices, product updates &amp; news from |publisher=Trustedshops.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529153720/http://www.trustedshops.co.uk/news/online-retailers-prepare-to-fight-the-sales-ban/ |archivedate=2015-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyworldmag.co.uk/news/2013/07/ebay-asks-retailers-to-back-choice-in-ecommerce-campaign |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221205130/http://www.toyworldmag.co.uk/news/2013/07/ebay-asks-retailers-to-back-choice-in-ecommerce-campaign |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webretailer.com/news/1765-choice-in-ecommerce-campaigns-for-resale.asp |title=Choice in eCommerce Campaigns for Resale Rights |publisher=Webretailer.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webretailer.com/news/1777-choice-in-ecommerce-interview.asp |title=Choice in eCommerce Interview |publisher=Webretailer.com |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BILD, Online-Händler kämpfen gegen Hersteller-Boykott, 16.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;eCommerce Magazin 7-2013, Online-Handel gründet Initiative gegen Verkauftsverbot, 17.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/unternehmen/aufstand-gegen-adidas-und-co-online-haendler-stemmen-sich-gegen-verkaufsverbote_aid_1043835.html |title=Aufstand gegen Adidas und Co.: Online-Händler stemmen sich gegen Verkaufsverbote - Unternehmen - FOCUS Online - Nachrichten |language=de |publisher=Focus.de |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause was, in the view of the initiative, sales bans and online restrictions by individual manufacturers. The dealers felt cut off from their main sales channel and thus deprived them the opportunity to use online platforms like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Ebay|eBay]] or [[Rakuten]] in a competitive market for the benefit of their customers. Sales of all products and services traded online in Europe in 2012 counted 311.6 billion Euros. Through online trading in Europe is estimated that up to two million jobs were created.&lt;ref&gt;Ecommerce Europe Report 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The initiative later received support from other industry stakeholders including German BVOH (Bundesverband Onlinehandel) and CCIA ([[Computer and Communications Industry Association]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1886">The '''Committee for Nuclear Responsibility''' was formed as a "political and educational organization to disseminate [[anti-nuclear]] views and information to the public".&lt;ref name=price/&gt; The goals of the organization were a moratorium on [[nuclear power]] and the commercialization of [[Renewable energy commercialization|alternative energy sources]].&lt;ref name=price/&gt; 

[[John Gofman]] founded the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility in 1971, as a small non-profit, public interest association with four Nobel Laureates on its Board.&lt;ref name=irrevy&gt;John W. Gofman, "Irrevy" - An irreverent illustrated view of nuclear power, Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=gof&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/gofman.html John Gofman (USA)]&lt;/ref&gt; These Nobel scientists were [[Linus Pauling]], [[Harold Urey]], [[George Wald]] and [[James D. Watson]]. Other scientists who were involved included [[Paul Ehrlich]], [[John Edsall]], and [[Richard E. Bellman]]. The Board of Directors included [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Ramsey Clark]], [[Ian MacHarg]], and [[Richard Max McCarthy]]. Actor [[Jack Lemmon]] endorsed the goals of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility.&lt;ref name=price&gt;Jerome Price (1982). ''The Anti-nuclear Movement'', Twayne Publishers, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Gofman was Director of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility for many years and his independent research yielded higher risk estimates from low-level radiation than the estimates presented by various government agencies. His books carefully show how his analyses proceed from raw data to final conclusions, with no hidden steps.&lt;ref name=gof/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1454">In [[discrete event simulation]] '''concurrent estimation'''  is a technique used to estimate the effect of alternate parameter settings on a discrete event system. For example from observation of a (computer simulated) telecommunications system with a specified buffer size &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt;, one estimates what the performance would be if the buffer size had been set to the alternate values &lt;math&gt;B_1,\ldots,B_n&lt;/math&gt;. Effectively the technique generates (during a single simulation run) &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; alternative histories for the system state variables, which have the same probability of occurring as the main simulated state path; this results in a computational saving as compared to running &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; additional simulations, one for each alternative parameter value.

The technique was developed by Cassandras,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vita.bu.edu/cgc/ vita.bu.edu] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011127025313/http://vita.bu.edu/cgc/ |date=2001-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strickland and Panayiotou.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.ucy.ac.cy/christos/ vita.bu.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805041605/http://www.eng.ucy.ac.cy/christos/ |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, when a [[company (law)|company]] is threatened with [[takeover]], the '''crown jewel defense''' is a strategy in which the target company sells off its most attractive [[asset]]s to a friendly third party or spin off the valuable assets in a separate entity. Consequently, the unfriendly bidder is less attracted to the company assets. Other effects include dilution of holdings of the acquirer, making the takeover uneconomical to third parties, and adverse influence of current [[stock market|share prices]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Auerbach|first=Alan J.|title=Mergers and acquisitions|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-03209-4|pages=49–68|url=https://www.nber.org/books/auer87-1|author2=[[Richard S.

A '''crystal radio receiver''', also called a '''crystal set''', is a simple [[Receiver (radio)|radio receiver]], popular in the early days of radio. It uses only the power of the received radio signal to produce sound, needing no external power. It is named for its most important component, a [[crystal detector (radio)|crystal detector]], originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as [[galena]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carr | first = Joseph J. | authorlink = | title = Old Time Radios!

Crystal radios are the simplest type of radio receiver&lt;ref name="Petruzellis"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Petruzellis | first = Thomas | authorlink = | title = 22 Radio and Receiver Projects for the Evil Genius | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2007 | location = US | pages = 40, 44 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AJBBf5hCYqIC&amp;pg=PA40 | doi = | isbn = 978-0-07-148929-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be made with a few inexpensive parts, such as a wire for an antenna,  a [[inductor|coil]] of wire, a capacitor, a crystal detector, and [[crystal earpiece|earphones]].&lt;ref name="Gonzo"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Field | first = Simon Quellen | authorlink = | title = Gonzo gizmos: Projects and devices to channel your inner geek | publisher = Chicago Review Press | year = 2003 | location = US | page = 85 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t-N1KdTb0FwC&amp;pg=PT97 | doi = | isbn = 978-1-55652-520-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal radios are [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] receivers, while other radios use an [[amplifier]] powered by current from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or wall outlet to make the radio signal louder. Thus, crystal sets produce rather weak sound and must be listened to with sensitive earphones, and can only receive stations within a limited range.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schaeffer | first = Derek K. | authorlink = |author2=Thomas H.

Around 1920, crystal sets were superseded by the first amplifying receivers, which used [[vacuum tube]]s.

Crystal radio was invented by a long, partly obscure chain of [[history of radio|discoveries]] in the late 19th century that gradually evolved into more and more practical radio receivers in the early 20th century. The earliest practical use of crystal radio was to receive [[Morse code]] radio signals transmitted from [[spark-gap transmitter]]s by early [[Amateur radio operator|amateur radio]] experimenters. As electronics evolved, the ability to send voice signals by radio caused a technological explosion around 1920 that evolved into today's radio [[broadcasting]] industry.

=== Early years ===
[[File:Radio Galena Museo della radio 2.jpg|thumb|Crystal radio (1915) kept at the Museum of the radio - [[Monteceneri]] (Switzerland)]]
Early radio telegraphy used [[Spark-gap transmitter|spark gap]] and [[arc transmitter]]s as well as [[Alexanderson alternator|high-frequency alternators]] running at [[radio frequencies]]. The [[coherer]] was the first means of detecting a radio signal. These, however, lacked the sensitivity to detect weak signals.

In the early 20th century, various researchers discovered that certain metallic [[mineral]]s, such as [[galena]], could be used to detect radio signals.&lt;ref&gt;In May 1901, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] of [[Strasbourg]] used [[psilomelane]], a manganese oxide ore, as an R.F. detector:  Ferdinand Braun (December 27, 1906) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050985140#page/1199/mode/1up "Ein neuer Wellenanzeiger (Unipolar-Detektor)"] (A new R.F. detector (one-way detector)), ''Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift'', '''27''' (52) : 1199-1200.  From page 1119:&lt;br&gt;
"Im Mai 1901 habe ich einige Versuche im Laboratorium gemacht und dabei gefunden, daß in der Tat ein Fernhörer, der in einen aus Psilomelan und Elementen bestehenden Kreis eingeschaltet war, deutliche und scharfe Laute gab, wenn dem Kreise schwache schnelle Schwingungen zugeführt wurden.  Das Ergebnis wurde nachgeprüft, und zwar mit überraschend gutem Erfolg, an den Stationen für drahtlose Telegraphie, an welchen zu dieser Zeit auf den Straßburger Forts von der Königlichen Preußischen Luftschiffer-Abteilung unter Leitung des Hauptmannes von Sigsfeld gearbeitet wurde."&lt;br&gt;
(In May 1901, I did some experiments in the lab and thereby found that in fact an earphone, which was connected in a circuit consisting of psilomelane and batteries, produced clear and strong sounds when weak, rapid oscillations were introduced to the circuit.  The result was verified -- and indeed with surprising success -- at the stations for wireless telegraphy, which, at this time, were operated at the Strasbourg forts by the Royal Prussian Airship-Department under the direction of Capt. von Sigsfeld.)&lt;br&gt;Braun also states that he had been researching the conductive properties of semiconductors since 1874.  See:  Braun, F. (1874) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YBJbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA556#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber die Stromleitung durch Schwefelmetalle"] (On current conduction through metal sulfides), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', '''153''' (4) :  556-563.  In these experiments, Braun applied a cat whisker to various semiconducting crystals and observed that current flowed in only one direction.&lt;br&gt;Braun patented an R.F. detector in 1906.  See:  (Ferdinand Braun), "Wellenempfindliche Kontaktstelle" (R.F. sensitive contact), Deutsches Reichspatent DE 178,871, (filed:  Feb. 18, 1906 ; issued:  Oct. 22, 1906).  Available on-line at:  [http://www.cdvandt.org/Braun%20DE178871A.pdf Foundation for German communication and related technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other inventors who patented crystal R.F. detectors:
*  In 1906, [[Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody]] (1843-1933) of Washington, D.C., a retired general of the US Army's Signal Corps, received a patent for a carborundum R.F. detector.  See:  Dunwoody, Henry H. C. [http://www.google.com/patents/US837616 "Wireless-telegraph system,"] U. S. patent 837,616 (filed:  March 23, 1906 ; issued:  December 4, 1906).
*  In 1907, [[Louis Winslow Austin]] received a patent for his R.F. detector consisting of tellurium and silicon.  See:  Louis W. Austin, [http://www.google.com/patents/US846081 "Receiver,"] US patent 846,081 (filed:  Oct. 27, 1906 ; issued:  March 5, 1907).
*  In 1908, Wichi Torikata of the Imperial Japanese Electrotechnical Laboratory of the Ministry of Communications in Tokyo was granted Japanese patent 15,345 for the “Koseki” detector, consisting of crystals of zincite and bornite.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British India|Indian]] physicist [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] was first to use a crystal as a radio wave detector, using galena detectors to receive microwaves starting around 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Emerson | first = D. T. | authorlink = | title = The work of Jagadish Chandra Bose: 100 years of mm wave research | journal = IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques | volume = 45 | issue = 12 | pages = 2267–2273 | publisher = | date = Dec 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=09Zsv97IH1MC&amp;pg=PA88 | issn = | doi =10.1109/22.643830 | accessdate = 2010-01-19 |bibcode = 1997ITMTT..45.2267E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Bose filed for a U.S. patent for "A Device for Detecting Electrical Disturbances" that mentioned the use of a galena crystal; this was granted in 1904, #755840.&lt;ref&gt;Jagadis Chunder Bose, [http://www.google.com/patents/US755840 "Detector for electrical disturbances"], US patent no. 755,840 (filed: September 30, 1901; issued: March 29, 1904)&lt;/ref&gt; The device depended on the large variation of a semiconductor's conductance with temperature; today we would call his invention a bolometer.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Bose's patent is frequently, but erroneously, cited as a type of rectifying detector. On August 30, 1906, [[Greenleaf Whittier Pickard]] filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, [http://www.google.com/patents/US836531 "Means for receiving intelligence communicated by electric waves"], US patent no. 836,531 (filed: August 30, 1906 ; issued: November 20, 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

A crystal detector includes a crystal, usually a thin wire or metal probe that contacts the crystal, and the stand or enclosure that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used is a small piece of [[galena]]; [[pyrite]] was also often used, as it was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could [[demodulate]] [[amplitude modulated]] signals.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This device brought [[radiotelephone]]s and [[Broadcasting|voice broadcast]] to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals at a time when the embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
In 1922 the (then named) [[National Bureau of Standards|US Bureau of Standards]] released a publication entitled ''Construction and Operation of a Simple Homemade Radio Receiving Outfit''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/xximages/nsb_120.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This article showed how almost any family having a member who was handy with simple tools could make a radio and tune into weather, crop prices, time, news and the opera. This design was significant in bringing radio to the general public. NBS followed that with a more selective two-circuit version, ''Construction and Operation of a Two-Circuit Radio Receiving Equipment With Crystal Detector'', which was published the same year &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/xximages/nbs121.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is still frequently built by enthusiasts today.

In the beginning of the 20th century, radio had little commercial use, and radio experimentation was a hobby for many people.&lt;ref&gt;Bondi, Victor."American Decades:1930-1939"&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians consider the autumn of 1920 to be the beginning of commercial radio broadcasting for entertainment purposes. [[Pittsburgh]] station [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], owned by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], received its license from the United States [[Department of Commerce]] just in time to broadcast the [[United States presidential election, 1920|Harding-Cox presidential election]] returns. In addition to reporting on special events, broadcasts to farmers of crop price reports were an important public service in the early days of radio.

In 1921, factory-made radios were very expensive. Since less-affluent families could not afford to own one, newspapers and magazines carried articles on how to build a crystal radio with common household items. To minimize the cost, many of the plans suggested winding the tuning coil on empty pasteboard containers such as oatmeal boxes, which became a common foundation for homemade radios.

=== Crystodyne ===
In early 1920s [[Russia]], [[Oleg Losev]] was experimenting with applying voltage [[bias]]es to various kinds of crystals for manufacture of radio detectors. The result was astonishing: with a [[zincite]] ([[zinc oxide]]) crystal he gained amplification.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Robin Morris, ''A history of the world semiconductor industry'', IET, 1990, {{ISBN|0-86341-227-0}}, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://earlyradiohistory.us/1924cry.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1924, Losev's research was publicized in several French publications:
*  ''Radio Revue'', no. 28, p. 139 (1924)
*  I. Podliasky (May 25, 1924) (Crystal detectors as oscillators), ''Radio Électricité'', '''5''' : 196-197.
*  Vinogradsky (September 1924) ''L'Onde Electrique''
English-language publications noticed the French articles and also publicized Losev's work:
*  Pocock (June 11, 1924)''The Wireless World and Radio Review'', '''14''' :  299-300.
*  Victor Gabel (October 1 &amp; 8, 1924) "The crystal as a generator and amplifier," ''The Wireless World and Radio Review'', '''15''' :  2ff, 47ff.
*  O. Lossev (October 1924) "Oscillating crystals," ''The Wireless World and Radio Review'', '''15''' :  93-96.
*  Round and Rust (August 19, 1925) ''The Wireless World and Radio Review'', pp. 217-218.
*  "The Crystodyne principle," ''Radio News'', pages 294, 295, 431 (September 1924).  See also the October 1924 issue of ''Radio News''.  (It was Hugo Gernsbach, publisher of ''Radio News'', who coined the term "crystodyne".)  This article is available on-line at:  [http://www.radiomuseum.org/forumdata/users/5944/file/Crystodyne.pdf Radio Museum.org].&lt;/ref&gt; This was [[negative resistance]] phenomenon, decades before the development of the [[tunnel diode]]. After the first experiments, Losev built regenerative and [[superheterodyne]] receivers, and even transmitters.

A crystodyne could be produced in primitive conditions; it can be made in a rural forge, unlike [[vacuum tube]]s and modern semiconductor devices. However, this discovery was not supported by authorities and soon forgotten; no device was produced in mass quantity beyond a few examples for research.

=== "Foxhole radios" ===
[[File:Foxhole radio from WW2.jpg|thumb|left|"Foxhole radio" used on the Italian Front in World War 2. It uses a pencil lead attached to a safety pin pressing against a razor blade for a detector.]]

In addition to mineral crystals, the oxide coatings of many metal surfaces act as [[semiconductor]]s (detectors) capable of rectification. Crystal radios have been improvised using detectors made from rusty nails, corroded pennies, and many other common objects.

When [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops were halted near [[Anzio|Anzio, Italy]] during the spring of 1944, powered personal radio receivers were strictly prohibited as the Germans had equipment that could detect the [[local oscillator]] signal of [[superheterodyne]] receivers.  Crystal sets lack power driven local oscillators, hence they could not be detected. Some resourceful soldiers constructed "crystal" sets from discarded materials to listen to news and music. One type used a blue steel [[razor blade]] and a [[pencil lead]] for a detector.  The lead point touching the semiconducting oxide coating (magnetite) on the blade formed a crude point-contact diode.  By carefully adjusting the pencil lead on the surface of the blade, they could find spots capable of rectification.  The sets were dubbed "[[foxhole radio]]s" by the popular press, and they became part of the [[folklore]] of [[Second World War|World War II]].

In some German-occupied countries during [[World War II|WW2]] there were widespread confiscations of radio sets from the civilian population. This led determined listeners to build their own clandestine receivers which often amounted to little more than a basic crystal set. Anyone doing so risked imprisonment or even death if caught, and in most of Europe the signals from the [[BBC]] (or other allied stations) were not strong enough to be received on such a set.

=== Later years ===
[[File:Crystal radio backup on SS Jeremiah O'Brien.agr.jpg|thumb|Crystal radio used as a backup receiver on a World War II [[Liberty ship]]]]
While it never regained the popularity and general use that it enjoyed at its beginnings, the crystal radio circuit is still used. The [[Boy Scout]]s have kept the construction of a radio set in their program since the 1920s. A large number of prefabricated novelty items and simple kits could be found through the 1950s and 1960s, and many children with an interest in electronics built one.

Building crystal radios was a [[Fad|craze]] in the 1920s, and again in the 1950s. Recently, [[hobbyist]]s have started designing and building examples of the early instruments. Much effort goes into the visual appearance of these sets as well as their performance. Annual crystal radio [[DXing|'DX' contests]] (long distance reception) and building [[competition|contest]]s allow these set owners to compete with each other and form a community of interest in the subject.

* An [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] in which [[electric current]]s are induced by  [[radio wave]]s.
* A [[resonant circuit]] (tuned circuit) which selects the [[frequency]] of the desired [[radio station]] from all the radio signals received by the antenna. The tuned circuit consists of a coil of wire (called an [[inductor]]) and a [[capacitor]] connected together. The circuit has a [[resonant frequency]], and allows radio waves at that frequency to pass through to the detector while largely blocking waves at other frequencies. One or both of the coil or capacitor is adjustable, allowing the circuit to be tuned to different frequencies. In some circuits a capacitor is not used and the antenna serves this function, as an antenna shorter than its resonant length is capacitive.
* A [[semiconductor]] crystal [[detector (radio)|detector]] that [[demodulate]]s the radio signal to extract the [[audio signal]] ([[modulation]]).  The crystal detector functions as a [[square law detector]],&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Torrey, C. A. Whitmer, ''Crystal Rectifiers'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948, pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; demodulating the radio frequency [[alternating current]] to its audio frequency modulation.  The detector's audio frequency output is converted to sound by the earphone. Early sets used a "[[cat's whisker detector|cat whisker detector]]"&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Jensen | first1 = Peter R. | title  = Wireless at War | publisher = Rosenberg Publishing| date   = 2003| pages  = 103| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=9YFRAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT103&amp;dq=%22cat%27s+whisker+detector%22| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 1922013846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book| last1  = Morgan| first1 = Alfred Powell | title  = Wireless Telegraph Construction for Amateurs, 3rd Ed.| publisher = D.

The [[crystal detector]] was the component that gave crystal radios their name.  Modern sets use modern [[semiconductor diode]]s, although some hobbyists still experiment with crystal or other detectors.
* An [[earphone]] to convert the audio signal to sound waves so they can be heard.  The low power produced by a crystal receiver is insufficient to power a [[loudspeaker]], hence earphones are used.

[[File:CrystalRadio.jpg|thumb|300xpx|Pictorial diagram from 1922 showing the circuit of a crystal radio.

As a crystal radio has no power supply, the sound power produced by the earphone comes solely from the [[transmitter]] of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna.&lt;ref name="Gonzo" /&gt; The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the [[radio transmitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fette |first=Bruce A. |title=RF Basics: Radio Propagation |publisher=RF Engineer Network |date=Dec 27, 2008 |url=http://www.rfengineer.net/1170/rf-basics-radio-propagation/ |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even for a powerful commercial [[Radio station|broadcasting station]], if it is more than a few miles from the receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in [[microwatt]]s or [[nanowatt]]s.&lt;ref name="Gonzo" /&gt; In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 [[picowatt]]s at the antenna can be heard.&lt;ref name="Payor42"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Payor | first = Steve | authorlink = | title = Build a Matchbox Crystal Radio | journal = Popular Electronics | volume = | issue = | page = 42 | publisher = | date = June 1989 | url = http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/xximages/matchbox2.jpg | issn = | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-28}} on [http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/ Stay Tuned] website&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using [[Amplifier|amplification]] only due to the great sensitivity of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]],&lt;ref name="Gonzo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lee | first = Thomas H. | authorlink = | title = Planar Microwave Engineering: A practical guide to theory, measurement, and circuits | publisher = Cambridge Univ.

=== Antenna ===
The antenna converts the energy in the electromagnetic [[radio wave]]s to an [[alternating current|alternating]] [[electric current]] in the antenna, which is connected to the tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, it is important that the antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-[[wavelength]] of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long ([[AM broadcast]] band waves are 182-566 [[meter (unit)|m]] or 597–1857&amp;nbsp;ft. long)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Purdie | first = Ian | authorlink = | title = A Basic Crystal Set | work = Ian Purdie's Amateur Radio Pages | publisher = personal website | year = 1999 | url = http://my.integritynet.com.au/purdic/crystal_set.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2010-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the antenna is made as long as possible,&lt;ref name="KuhnAntenna"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kuhn | first = Kenneth | authorlink = | title = Antenna and Ground System | work = Crystal Radio Engineering | publisher = Kenneth Kuhn website, Univ. of Alabama | date = Dec 9, 2007 | url = http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/crystal_radios/antenna_and_ground_system.pdf | doi = | accessdate = 2009-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[Random wire antenna|long wire]], in contrast to the [[whip antenna]]s or ferrite [[loop antenna|loopstick antennas]] used in modern radios.

=== Ground ===
The wire antennas used with crystal receivers are [[monopole antenna]]s which develop their output voltage with respect to ground. The receiver thus requires a connection to [[ground (electricity)|ground]] (the earth) as a return circuit for the current.  The ground wire was attached to a radiator, water pipe, or a metal stake driven into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Collins | first = Archie Frederick | authorlink = | title = The Radio Amateur's Hand Book | publisher = Forgotten Books | year = 1922 | location = US | pages = 18–22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jpMi0V8qoKsC&amp;pg=PA18 | doi = | isbn = 1-60680-119-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pf0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Lescarboura, 1922, p. 102-104]&lt;/ref&gt;  In early days if an adequate ground connection could not be made a [[counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] was sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title  = Radio Communication Pamphlet No. 40: The Principles Underlying Radio Communication, 2nd Ed. | publisher = United States Bureau of Standards | date   = 1922 | location =  | pages  = 309–311 | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=4JVEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA309#v=onepage&amp;q=counterpoise | doi    =  | id     =  | isbn   =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hausmann |first1=Erich |last2=Goldsmith |first2=Alfred Norton |last3=Hazeltine |first3=Louis Alan |title=Radio Phone Receiving: A Practical Book for Everybody |publisher=D.

A low resistance ground connection (preferably below 25 Ω) is necessary because any resistance in the ground reduces available power from the antenna.&lt;ref name="KuhnAntenna" /&gt; In contrast, modern receivers are voltage-driven devices, with high input impedance, hence little current flows in the antenna/ground circuit. Also, [[mains power]]ed receivers are grounded adequately through their power cords, which are in turn attached to the earth by way of a well established ground.

=== Tuned circuit ===
[[File:Simplest crystal radio circuit.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|The earliest crystal receiver circuit did not have a [[tuned circuit]]]]

The [[tuned circuit]], consisting of a coil and a [[capacitor]] connected together, acts as a [[resonator]], similar to a tuning fork.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hausmann|Goldsmith|Hazeltine|1922|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric charge, induced in the antenna by the radio waves, flows rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil. The circuit has a high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the desired radio signal's frequency, but a low impedance at all other frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hayt | first = William H. | first2=Jack E. |last2=Kemmerly | title = Engineering Circuit Analysis, 2nd Ed. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1971 |location=New York |pages=398–399 |isbn=978-0-07-027382-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, signals at undesired frequencies pass through the tuned circuit to ground, while the desired frequency is instead passed on to the detector (diode) and stimulates the earpiece and is heard. The frequency of the station received is the [[resonant frequency]] ''f'' of the tuned circuit, determined by the [[capacitance]] ''C'' of the capacitor and the [[inductance]] ''L'' of the coil:&lt;ref name="KuhnResonantCircuit"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kuhn | first = Kenneth A. | authorlink = | title = Resonant Circuit | work = Crystal Radio Engineering | publisher = Prof. Kenneth Kuhn website, Univ. of Alabama | date = Jan 6, 2008 | url = http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/crystal_radios/resonant_circuit.pdf | doi = | accessdate = 2009-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {1}{ 2 \pi \sqrt {LC}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The circuit can be adjusted to different frequencies by varying the inductance (L), the capacitance (C), or both.  In the lowest-cost sets, the inductor was made variable via a spring contact pressing against the windings that could slide along the coil, thereby introducing a larger or smaller number of turns of the coil into the circuit. Thus the [[inductance]] could be varied, "tuning" the circuit to the frequencies of different radio stations.&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt; Alternatively, a [[variable capacitor]] is used to tune the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clifford | first = Martin | authorlink = | title = The early days of radio | journal = Radio Electronics | volume = | issue = | pages = 61–64 | publisher = | date = July 1986 | url = http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/xximages/earlydays3.jpg | issn = | doi = | accessdate = 2010-07-19}} on [http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/ Stay Tuned] website&lt;/ref&gt;  Some modern crystal sets use a [[ferrite core]] tuning coil, in which a ferrite [[magnetic core]] is moved into and out of the coil, thereby varying the inductance by changing the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] (this eliminated the less reliable mechanical contact).&lt;ref name="Blanchard"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Blanchard | first = T.

The antenna is an integral part of the tuned circuit and its [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a [[capacitance]], as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have [[capacitive reactance]].&lt;ref name="KuhnAntenna" /&gt; Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor,&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{Cite book | authorlink = | title = The Principles Underlying Radio Communication, 2nd Ed., Radio pamphlet no. 40 | publisher = Prepared by US National Bureau of Standards, United States Army Signal Corps | year = 1922 | location = US | pages = 421–425 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4JVEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA422 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant [[parasitic capacitance]] in the coil&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hausmann|Goldsmith|Hazeltine|1922|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to form the tuned circuit with the coil.

The earliest crystal receivers did not have a tuned circuit at all, and just consisted of a crystal detector connected between the antenna and ground, with an earphone across it.&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt; Since this circuit lacked any frequency-selective elements besides the broad [[resonance]] of the antenna, it had little ability to reject unwanted stations, so all stations within a wide band of frequencies were heard in the earphone&lt;ref name="Klase" /&gt; (in practice the most powerful usually drowns out the others). It was used in the earliest days of radio, when only one or two stations were within a crystal set's limited range.

}}

An important principle used in crystal radio design to transfer maximum power to the earphone is [[impedance matching]].&lt;ref name="Klase" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nahin | first = Paul J. | authorlink = Paul J.

Therefore, in improved receiver circuits, in order to match the antenna impedance to the receiver's impedance, the antenna was connected across only a portion of the tuning coil's turns.&lt;ref name="KuhnResonantCircuit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt; This made the tuning coil act as an [[Impedance matching|impedance matching transformer]] (in an [[autotransformer]] connection) in addition to providing the tuning function.

These controls were adjusted until the station sounded loudest in the earphone.

==== Problem of selectivity ====
[[File:Crystal radio with impedance matching.svg|thumb|left|Direct-coupled circuit with impedance matching&lt;ref name="Klase" /&gt;]]

One of the drawbacks of crystal sets is that they are vulnerable to interference from stations near in [[frequency]] to the desired station.&lt;ref name="Petruzellis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payor42" /&gt; Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (low [[Q factor]]) compared to modern receivers, giving the receiver low [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Schaeffer" /&gt;

The crystal detector worsened the problem, because it has relatively low [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], thus it "loaded" the tuned circuit, drawing significant current and thus damping the oscillations, reducing its [[Q factor]] so it allowed through a broader band of frequencies.&lt;ref name="Payor42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenzel"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wenzel |first=Charles |title=Simple crystal radio |work=Crystal radio circuits |publisher=techlib.com |year=1995 |url=http://www.techlib.com/electronics/crystal.html |accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many circuits, the selectivity was improved by connecting the detector and earphone circuit to a tap across only a fraction of the coil's turns.&lt;ref name="Klase" /&gt; This reduced the impedance loading of the tuned circuit, as well as improving the impedance match with the detector.&lt;ref name="Klase" /&gt;

==== Inductive coupling ====

consists of two [[Magnetic coupling|magnetically coupled]] coils of wire, one (the ''primary'') attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the ''secondary'') attached to the rest of the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a [[tuned circuit]]; the primary coil [[Resonant circuit|resonated]] with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station.  The two circuits interacted to form a [[Transformer types#Resonant transformer|resonant transformer]].

Reducing the ''coupling'' between the coils, by physically separating them so that less of the [[magnetic field]] of one intersects the other, reduces the [[mutual inductance]], narrows the bandwidth, and results in much sharper, more selective tuning than that produced by a single tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alley &amp; Atwood (1973) ''Electronic Engineering'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; However, the looser coupling also reduced the power of the signal passed to the second circuit. The transformer was made with adjustable coupling, to allow the listener to experiment with various settings to gain the best reception.

One design common in early days, called a "loose coupler", consisted of a smaller secondary coil inside a larger primary coil.&lt;ref name="Klase" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BgY9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA94 Marx &amp; Van Muffling (1922) ''Radio Reception''], p.96-101&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller coil was mounted on a [[Rack and pinion|rack]] so it could be slid linearly in or out of the larger coil. If radio interference was encountered, the smaller coil would be slid further out of the larger, loosening the coupling, narrowing the bandwidth, and thereby rejecting the interfering signal.

The antenna coupling transformer also functioned as an [[impedance matching|impedance matching transformer]], that allowed a better match of the antenna impedance to the rest of the circuit. One or both of the coils usually had several taps which could be selected with a switch, allowing adjustment of the number of turns of that transformer and hence the "turns ratio".

Coupling transformers were difficult to adjust, because the three adjustments, the tuning of the primary circuit, the tuning of the secondary circuit, and the coupling of the coils, were all interactive, and changing one affected the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = US Signal Corps | authorlink = | title = Radiotelegraphy | publisher = Government Printing Office | date = October 1916 | location = US | page = 70 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PbRBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 | doi = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crystal [[detector (radio)|detector]] [[demodulation|demodulates]] the radio frequency signal, extracting the [[modulation]] (the [[audio signal]] which represents the sound waves) from the radio frequency [[carrier wave]].

The rectified current from the detector has [[radio frequency]] pulses from the carrier frequency in it, which are blocked by the high inductive reactance and do not pass well through the coils of early date earphones. Hence, a small [[capacitor]] called a [[bypass capacitor]] is often placed across the earphone terminals; its low reactance at radio frequency bypasses these pulses around the earphone to ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLhRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA282 Stanley (1919) ''Text-book on Wireless Telegraphy'', p.282]&lt;/ref&gt;  In some sets the earphone cord had enough capacitance that this component could be omitted.&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;

Only certain sites on the crystal surface functioned as rectifying junctions, and the device was very sensitive to the pressure of the crystal-wire contact, which could be disrupted by the slightest vibration.&lt;ref name="Riordan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hausmann2"&gt;{{harvnb|Hausmann|Goldsmith|Hazeltine|1922|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a usable contact point had to be found by trial and error before each use. The operator dragged the wire across the crystal surface until a radio station or "static" sounds were heard in the earphones.&lt;ref name="Lescarboura2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pf0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 Lescarboura (1922), p.143-146]&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, some radios ''(circuit, right)'' used a battery-powered [[buzzer]] attached to the input circuit to adjust the detector.&lt;ref name="Lescarboura2" /&gt; The spark at the buzzer's electrical contacts served as a weak source of static, so when the detector began working, the buzzing could be heard in the earphones.  The buzzer was then turned off, and the radio tuned to the desired station.

In modern sets, a [[semiconductor diode]] is used for the detector, which is much more reliable than a crystal detector and requires no adjustments.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenzel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KuhnDiode"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kuhn | first = Kenneth A. | authorlink = | title = Diode Detectors | work = Crystal Radio Engineering | publisher = Prof. Kenneth Kuhn website, Univ. of Alabama | date = Jan 6, 2008 | url = http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/crystal_radios/diode_detectors.pdf | doi = | accessdate = 2009-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germanium diode]]s (or sometimes [[Schottky diode]]s) are used instead of [[silicon diode]]s, because their lower forward voltage drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V&lt;ref name="Hadgraft"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hadgraft | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = The Crystal Set 5/6 | work = The Crystal Corner | publisher = Kev's Vintage Radio and Hi-Fi page | url = http://oldkevspage.tripod.com/wr/xtal3.html | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) makes them more sensitive.&lt;ref name="Wenzel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kleijer | first = Dick | authorlink = | title = Diodes | work = | publisher = crystal-radio.eu | url = http://www.crystal-radio.eu/endiodes.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All semiconductor detectors function rather inefficiently in crystal receivers, because the low voltage input to the detector is too low to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction.  To improve the sensitivity of some of the early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small [[Biasing (electronics)|forward bias]] voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and [[potentiometer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4JVEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439 ''The Principles Underlying Radio Communication'' (1922), p.439-440]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robison"&gt;"''The sensitivity of the Perikon ''[detector]'' can be approximately doubled by connecting a battery across its terminals to give approximately 0.2 volt''"  {{cite book| last1  = Robison| first1 = Samuel Shelburne | title  = Manual of Wireless Telegraphy for the Use of Naval Electricians, Vol. 2| publisher = US Naval Institute| date   = 1911| location = Washington DC| pages  = 131 | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=7gQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Perikon+crystal+battery| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bucher" &gt;"''Certain crystals if this combination ''[zincite-bornite]'' respond better with a local battery while others do not require it...but with practically any crystal it aids in obtaining the sensitive adjustment to employ a local battery...''"{{Cite book | last = Bucher | first = Elmer Eustace | authorlink = | title = Practical Wireless Telegraphy: A complete text book for students of radio communication, Revised Ed. | publisher = Wireless Press, Inc | year = 1921 | location = New York | pages = 134–135, 140 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DI9RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134 | doi = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio.  This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's [[I-V curve]]. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.

=== Earphones ===
[[File:Poste a diode 1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Modern crystal radio with [[Crystal earpiece|piezoelectric earphone]]]]

The requirements for earphones used in crystal sets are different from earphones used with modern audio equipment. They have to be efficient at converting the electrical signal energy to sound waves, while most modern earphones  sacrifice efficiency in order to gain [[high fidelity]] reproduction of the sound.&lt;ref name="FieldEarphone"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t-N1KdTb0FwC&amp;pg=PT93 Field 2003, p.93-94]&lt;/ref&gt; In early homebuilt sets, the earphones were the most costly component.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pf0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA285 Lescarboura (1922), p.285]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early earphones used with wireless-era crystal sets had [[moving iron speaker|moving iron drivers]] that worked in a way similar to the horn [[loudspeaker]]s of the period. Each earpiece contained a permanent [[magnet]] about which was a coil of wire which formed a second  [[electromagnet]]. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel diaphram of the speaker. When the [[audio signal]] from the radio was passed through the electromagnet's windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying [[magnetic field]] that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull on the air in front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had a low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other sensitive equipment) was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000-8000 Ω.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jpMi0V8qoKsC&amp;pg=PA27 Collins (1922), p. 27-28]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-CwwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 Williams (1922), p. 79]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4JVEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA441 ''The Principles Underlying Radio Communication'' (1922), p. 441]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern crystal sets use [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[crystal earpiece]]s, which are much more sensitive and also smaller.&lt;ref name="FieldEarphone" /&gt; They consist of a [[piezoelectric]] crystal with electrodes attached to each side, glued to a light diaphragm. When the audio signal from the radio set is applied to the electrodes, it causes the crystal to vibrate, vibrating the diaphragm. Crystal earphones are designed as [[ear buds]] that plug directly into the ear canal of the wearer, coupling the sound more efficiently to the eardrum. Their resistance is much higher (typically megohms) so they do not greatly "load" the tuned circuit, allowing increased [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] of the receiver. The piezoelectric earphone's higher resistance, in parallel with its capacitance of around 9 pF, creates a  [[low pass filter|filter]] that allows the passage of low frequencies, but blocks the higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Payor | first = Steve | authorlink = | title = Build a Matchbox Crystal Radio | journal = Popular Electronics | volume = | issue = | page = 45 | publisher = | date = June 1989 | url = http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/xximages/matchbox5.jpg | issn = | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case a bypass capacitor is not needed (although in practice a small one of around 0.68 to 1 nF is often used to help improve quality), but instead a 10-100 kΩ resistor must be added in parallel with the earphone's input.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t-N1KdTb0FwC&amp;pg=PT97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Field (2003), p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the low power produced by crystal radios is typically insufficient to drive a [[loudspeaker]], some homemade 1960s sets have used one, with an audio  [[transformer]] to match the low impedance of the speaker to the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Ford, "[http://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/high-power-crystal-set-august-1960-popular-electronics.htm High Power Crystal Set]", August 1960, ''[[Popular Electronics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, modern low-impedance (8 Ω) earphones cannot be used unmodified in crystal sets because the receiver does not produce enough current to drive them. They are sometimes used by adding an audio transformer to match their impedance with the higher impedance of the driving antenna circuit.

== Use as a power source ==

A crystal radio tuned to a strong local transmitter can be used as a power source for a second amplified receiver of a distant station that cannot be heard without amplification.&lt;ref name="simple_AM_rx"&gt;{{cite book |last = Polyakov |first = V.&amp;nbsp;T. |authorlink =  |script-title = ru:Техника радиоприёма.

There is a long history of unsuccessful attempts and unverified claims to recover the power in the carrier of the received signal itself. Traditional crystal sets use half-wave [[rectifier]]s. As [[AM broadcasting|AM]] signals have a [[modulation]] factor of only 30% by voltage at peaks{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, no more than 9% of received signal power (&lt;math&gt;P = U^2/R&lt;/math&gt;) is actual audio information, and 91% is just rectified DC voltage. Given that the audio signal is unlikely to be at peak all the time, the ratio of energy is, in practice, even greater. Considerable effort was made to convert this DC voltage into sound energy. Some earlier attempts include a one-[[transistor]]&lt;ref&gt;Radio-Electronics, 1966, №2&lt;/ref&gt; amplifier in 1966. Sometimes efforts to recover this power are confused with other efforts to produce a more efficient detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Cutler |first = Bob |journal = [[QST]] |volume = 91 |issue = 1 |pages = 31–?? |date = January 2007 |title = High Sensitivity Crystal Set |url = http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/culter.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This history continues now with designs as elaborate as "inverted two-wave switching power unit".&lt;ref name="simple_AM_rx" /&gt;{{rp|129}}

[[File:Depth charge bd.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mark IX depth charge used by the [[U.S. Navy]] late in World War II. Unlike the cylindrical, barrel-shaped depth charge used earlier, the Mark IX is streamlined and equipped with canted fins to impart rotation, allowing it to fall in a straight [[trajectory]] with less chance of drifting off target. This type of depth charge contained 200 pounds (90 kg) of [[Torpex]].]]

A '''depth charge''' is an [[anti-submarine warfare]] weapon. It is intended to destroy a [[submarine]] by being dropped into the water nearby and detonating, subjecting the target to a powerful and destructive hydraulic shock. Most depth charges use [[explosive|high explosive]] charges and a [[fuze]] set to detonate the charge, typically at a specific depth. Depth charges can be dropped by [[ship]]s, [[patrol aircraft]], and [[helicopter]]s.

Depth charges were developed during World War I, and were one of the first effective methods of attacking a submarine underwater. They were widely used in World War I and World War II. They remained part of the anti-submarine arsenals of many navies during the Cold War. Depth charges have now largely been replaced by [[anti-submarine weapon|anti-submarine homing torpedoes]].

A depth charge fitted with a [[nuclear warhead]] is known as a "[[nuclear depth bomb]]". These were designed to be dropped from a patrol plane or deployed by an [[anti-submarine missile]] from a surface ship, or another submarine, located a safe distance away. All nuclear anti-submarine weapons were withdrawn from service by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China in or around 1990. They were replaced by conventional weapons whose accuracy and range had improved greatly as ASW technology improved.

==History==
The first attempt to fire charges against submerged targets was with aircraft bombs attached to lanyards which triggered them.  A similar  idea was a {{convert|16|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[guncotton]] charge in a lanyarded can.  Two of these lashed together became known as the "depth charge Type A".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with the lanyards tangling and failing to function led to the development of a chemical pellet trigger as the "Type B".&lt;ref name="m49"&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were effective at a distance of around {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="m49"/&gt;

A 1913 Royal Navy Torpedo School report described a device intended for [[Demining|countermining]], a "dropping mine". At Admiral [[John Jellicoe]]'s request, the standard Mark II mine was fitted with a [[hydrostatic]] pistol (developed in 1914 by Thomas Firth and Sons of Sheffield) preset for {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}} firing, to be launched from a stern platform. Weighing {{convert|1150|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and effective at {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the "cruiser mine" was a potential hazard to the dropping ship.&lt;ref name="m49"/&gt; The design work was carried out by Herbert Taylor at the RN Torpedo and Mine School, [[HMS Vernon (shore establishment)|HMS ''Vernon'']]. The first effective depth charge, the Type D, became available in January 1916. It was a barrel-like casing containing a high [[explosive]] (usually [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], but [[amatol]] was also used when TNT became scarce).&lt;ref name="m49"/&gt; There were initially two sizes—Type D, with a {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} charge for fast ships, and Type D* with a {{convert|120|lb|kg|abbr=on}} charge for ships too slow to leave the danger area before the more powerful charge detonated.&lt;ref name="m49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t27"&gt;{{harvnb|Tarrant|1989|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hydrostatic pistol actuated by water pressure at a pre-selected depth [[detonate]]d the charge.&lt;ref name="t27"/&gt; Initial depth settings were {{convert|40|or|80|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="t27"/&gt; Because production could not keep up with demand,&lt;ref name="m50"&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-submarine vessels initially carried only two depth charges, to be released from a chute at the stern of the ship.&lt;ref name="t27"/&gt; The first success was the sinking of [[SM U-68|''U-68'']] off [[County Kerry|Kerry]], Ireland, on 22 March 1916, by the [[Q-ship]] [[HMS Farnborough|''Farnborough.'']]&lt;ref name="t27"/&gt; Germany became aware of the depth charge following unsuccessful attacks on [[SM U-67|''U-67'']] on 15 April 1916, and [[SM U-69|''U-69'']] on 20 April 1916.&lt;ref name="t27"/&gt; The only other submarines sunk by depth charge during 1916 were [[SM UC-19|''UC-19'']] and [[SM UB-29|''UB-29'']].&lt;ref name="t27"/&gt;

Numbers of depth charges carried per ship increased to four in June 1917, to six in August, and 30-50 by 1918.&lt;ref name="m50"/&gt; The weight of charges and racks caused ship instability unless heavy guns and torpedo tubes were removed to compensate.&lt;ref name="m50"/&gt; Improved pistols allowed greater depth settings in 50-foot (15-meter) increments, from {{convert|50|to|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="m49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t40"&gt;{{harvnb|Tarrant|1989|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even slower ships could safely use the Type D at below {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} and at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} or more,&lt;ref name="m50"/&gt; so the relatively ineffective Type D* was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="t40"/&gt; Monthly use of depth charges increased from 100 to 300 per month during 1917 to an average of 1745 per month during the last six months of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="t40"/&gt; The Type D could be detonated as deep as {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} by that date. By the war's end, 74,441 depth charges had been issued by the RN, and 16,451 fired, scoring 38 kills in all, and aiding in 140 more.&lt;ref name="m50"/&gt;

The United States requested full working drawings of the device in March 1917.

The Royal Navy Type D depth charge was designated the "Mark VII" in 1939.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1985|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sinking speed was {{convert|7|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} with a terminal velocity of  {{convert|9.9|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a depth of {{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} if rolled off the stern, or upon water contact from a depth charge thrower.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; Cast iron weights of {{convert|150|lb|kg|abbr=on}} were attached to the Mark VII at the end of 1940 to increase sinking velocity to {{convert|16.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; New hydrostatic pistols increased the maximum detonation depth to {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; The Mark VII's {{convert|290|lb|kg|abbr=on}} amatol charge was estimated to be capable of splitting a {{convert|7/8|inch|mm}} submarine pressure hull at a distance of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and forcing the submarine to surface at twice that.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; The change of explosive to [[Torpex]] (or Minol) at the end of 1942 was estimated to increase those distances to {{convert|26|and|52|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt;

The British Mark X depth charge weighed {{convert|3000|lb|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} and was launched from {{convert|21|inch|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=out|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s of older destroyers to achieve a sinking velocity of {{convert|21|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; The launching ship needed to clear the area at 11 knots to avoid damage, and the charge was seldom used.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; Only 32 were actually fired, and they were known to be troublesome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teardrop-shaped United States Mark 9 depth charge entered service in the spring of 1943.&lt;ref name="c163"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1985|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charge was {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of Torpex with a sinking speed of {{convert|14.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and depth settings of up to {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="c163"/&gt; Later versions increased depth to {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and sinking speed to {{convert|22.7|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} with increased weight and improved streamlining.&lt;ref name="c163"/&gt;

Although the explosions of the standard United States {{convert|600|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Mark 4 and Mark 7 depth charge used in World War II were nerve-wracking to the target, an U-boat’s undamaged pressure hull would not rupture unless the charge detonated closer than about {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Placing the weapon within this range was entirely a matter of chance and quite unlikely as the target maneuvered evasively during the attack. Most U-boats sunk by depth charges were destroyed by damage accumulated from a long barrage rather than by a single charge. Many survived hundreds of depth charges over a period of many hours; [[Unterseeboot 427|''U-427'']] survived 678 depth charges fired against it in April 1945.

==Delivery mechanisms==
[[File:Mk VII depth charge.jpg|thumb|right|Loading a drum-type Mark VII depth charge onto the K-gun of the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette|1}} [[HMS Dianthus (K95)|HMS ''Dianthus'']]]]

The first delivery mechanism was to simply roll the "ashcans" off racks at the stern of the moving attacking vessel. Originally depth charges were simply placed at the top of a ramp and allowed to roll. Improved racks, which could hold several depth charges and release them remotely with a trigger, were developed towards [[Armistice with Germany|the end of the First World War]]. These racks remained in use throughout World War II, because they were simple and easy to reload.

Some Royal Navy [[Naval trawler|trawler]]s used for anti-submarine work during 1917 and 1918 had a thrower on the [[forecastle]] for a single depth charge, but there do not seem to be any records of it being used in action.&lt;ref name="t40"/&gt; Specialized depth charge throwers were developed to generate a wider dispersal pattern when used in conjunction with rack-deployed charges.&lt;ref name="t40"/&gt; The first of these was developed from a [[British Army]] [[trench mortar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1277 were issued, 174 installed in auxiliaries during 1917 and 1918.&lt;ref name="m52"&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKee|1993|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs they launched were too light to be truly effective; only one U-boat is known to have been sunk by them.&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt;

[[Thornycroft]] created an improved version able to throw a charge {{convert|40|yd|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt; The first was fitted in July 1917&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt; and became operational in August.&lt;ref name="t40"/&gt; In all, 351 torpedo boat destroyers and 100 other craft were equipped.&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt; Projectors called "Y-guns" (in reference to their basic shape), developed by the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Ordnance]] from the Thornycroft thrower,&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt; became available in 1918. Mounted on the centerline of the ship with the arms of the ''Y'' pointing outboard, two depth charges&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt; were cradled on shuttles inserted into each arm. An explosive propellant charge was detonated in the vertical column of the Y-gun to propel a depth charge about {{convert|45|yd|m|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt; over each side of the ship. The main disadvantage of the Y-gun was that it had to be mounted on the centerline of a ship's deck, which could otherwise be occupied by superstructure, masts, or guns. The first were built by [[New London Ship and Engine Company]] beginning on 24 November 1917.&lt;ref name="m52"/&gt;

[[File:HMS Ceylon depth charge.jpg|thumb|left|A depth charge explodes after being dropped from [[HMS Ceylon (30)|HMS ''Ceylon'']]]]

The K-gun, standardized in 1942, replaced the Y-gun as the primary depth charge projector. The K-guns fired one depth charge at a time and could be mounted on the periphery of a ship's deck, thus freeing valuable centerline space. Four to eight K-guns were typically mounted per ship. The K-guns were often used together with stern racks to create patterns of six to ten charges. In all cases, the attacking ship needed to be moving above a certain speed or it would be damaged by the force of its own weapons.

[[image:Sunderland db rack 2.JPG|thumb|right|Depth bombs hang under the wings of an RAF [[Short Sunderland]] flying boat on display in the [[RAF Museum]], Hendon]]Depth charges could also be dropped from an attacking aircraft against submarines. At the start of World War II, Britain's aerial anti-submarine weapon was the {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} anti-submarine bomb. This weapon was too light and ultimately a failure.  To remedy the failure of this weapon, the Royal Navy's {{convert|450|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Mark VII depth charge was modified for aerial use by the addition of a streamlined nose fairing and stabilising fins on the tail.

The first to deploy depth charges from airplanes in actual combat were the [[Finland|Finns]]. Experiencing the same problems as the RAF with insufficient charges on anti-submarine bombs, Captain [[Birger Ek]] of [[Finnish Air Force]] squadron [[LeLv 6]] contacted one of his navy friends and suggested testing the aerial use of standard Finnish Navy depth charges. The tests proved successful, and the [[Tupolev SB]] bombers of LeLv 6 were modified in early 1942 to carry depth charges. The success of the anti-submarine missions reached  [[RAF Coastal Command]], which promptly began modifying depth charges for aerial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karhunen|1980}} {{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later depth charges would be developed specifically for aerial use. Such weapons still have utility today and are in limited use, particularly for shallow-water situations where a [[torpedo|homing torpedo]] may not be suitable. Depth charges are especially useful for "flushing the prey" in the event of a diesel submarine lying on the bottom or otherwise hiding, with all machinery shut down. 

==Effectiveness==
[[File:Depthcharge.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.4|To be effective depth charges had to be set to the correct depth. To ensure this, a pattern of charges set to different depths would be laid atop the submarine's suspected position.]]

The effective use of depth charges required the combined resources and skills of many individuals during an attack. Sonar, helm, depth charge crews and the movement of other ships had to be carefully coordinated. Aircraft depth charge tactics depended on the aircraft using its speed to rapidly appear from over the horizon and surprising the submarine on the surface (where it spent most of its time) during the day or night (using radar to detect the target and a [[Leigh light]] to illuminate just prior to the attack), then quickly attacking once it had been located, as the submarine would normally [[crash dive]] to escape attack.

As the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] wore on, British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces became particularly adept at depth charge tactics, and formed some of the first destroyer hunter-killer groups to actively seek out and destroy German U-boats.

Surface ships usually used ASDIC ([[sonar]]) to detect submerged submarines. However, to deliver its depth charges a ship had to pass over the contact to drop them over the stern; sonar contact would be lost just before attack, rendering the hunter blind at the crucial moment. This gave a skillful submarine commander an opportunity to take evasive action. In 1942 the forward-throwing [[Hedgehog (weapon)|"hedgehog"]] mortar, which fired a spread salvo of bombs with contact fuzes at a "stand-off" distance while still in sonar contact, was introduced and proved to be effective.

===Pacific theater===
In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], Japanese depth charge attacks initially proved fairly unsuccessful against U.S. and British submarines.  Unless caught in shallow water, a submarine would just dive below the Japanese depth charge attack. The Japanese were unaware that the submarines could dive so deep. The old [[United States S-class submarine]]s (1918&amp;ndash;1925) had a [[Submarine depth ratings|test depth]] of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}; the more modern fleet-boat [[Salmon-class submarine]]s (1937) had a test depth of {{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Gato-class submarine]]s (1940) were {{convert|300|ft|m}}, and [[Balao-class submarine]]s (1943) were {{convert|400|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

In June 1943, the deficiencies of Japanese depth-charge tactics were inadvertently revealed in a press conference held by [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Andrew J. May]], a member of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Military Affairs Committee]], who had visited the Pacific theater and received many intelligence and operational briefings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|2001|p=397}}, "Lockwood and his staff were appalled&amp;mdash;and furious&amp;mdash;at this stupid revelation. Lockwood wrote Admiral Edwards in acid words, 'I hear ... Congressman May ... said the Jap depth charges ... are not set deep enough. ... He would be pleased to know the Japs set'em deeper now.' And after the war, Lockwood wrote, 'I consider that indiscretion cost us ten submarines and 800 officers and men.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kershaw|2008|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; May mentioned the highly sensitive fact that American submarines had a high survival rate in combat with Japanese destroyers because Japanese depth charges were fuzed to explode at too shallow a depth.

Various press associations reported the depth issue over their wires and many newspapers (including one in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]) published it. Soon, Japanese forces were setting their depth charges to explode at a more effective average depth of {{convert|75|m|ft|sigfig=2|sp=us}}, to the detriment of American submariners. Vice Admiral [[Charles A. Lockwood]], commander of the U.S. submarine fleet in the Pacific, later estimated that May's revelation cost the United States Navy as many as ten submarines and 800 seamen [[killed in action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|2001|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leak became known as [[Andrew J. May#The May Incident|The May Incident]].

==Later developments==
For the reasons expressed above, the depth charge was generally replaced as an anti-submarine weapon. Initially, this was by ahead-throwing weapons such as the British-developed Hedgehog and later [[Squid (weapon)|squid]]. These weapons threw a pattern of warheads ahead of the attacking vessel to bracket a submerged contact. The Hedgehog was contact fuzed, while the squid fired a pattern of three large (200&amp;nbsp;kg) depth charges with clockwork detonators. Later developments included the [[Mark 24 Mine|Mark 24 "Fido"]] acoustic homing torpedo (and later such weapons), and the [[SUBROC]], which was armed with a nuclear depth charge. The [[Soviet Union|USSR]], United States and United Kingdom developed anti-submarine weapons using nuclear warheads,  sometimes referred to as "[[nuclear depth bomb]]s". As of present, the [[Royal Navy]] retains a depth charge labelled as Mk11 Mod 3, which can be deployed from its Wildcat helicopters and Merlin Mk2 helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=815 NAVAL AIR SQUADRON|url=https://www.fleetairarmoa.org/Content/sites/FAAOA/pages/178/20081118-cjj-final-815history.PDF|accessdate=21 June 2018|publisher=Fleet Air Arm Association|date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Type 26 Frigate|url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/defence/141009_SoS_re_Type_26_Global_Combat_Ship.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2018|publisher=parliament.uk|date=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Signaling===
During the [[Cold War]] when it was necessary to inform submarines of the other side that they had been detected but without actually launching an attack, low-power "signalling depth charges" (also called "practice depth charges") were sometimes used, powerful enough to be detected when no other means of communication was possible, but not destructive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S0D_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=signalling+%22depth+charge%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zg_7oFSW5r&amp;sig=y8bj_Gn0PdaYe6l6G3cWBGyOv_M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIjb_lsO7QxwIVBCvbCh2jkQCm#v=onepage&amp;q=signalling%20%22depth%20charge%22&amp;f=false Leadership: Limits and Possibilities, by Keith Grint, p43]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underwater explosions==
[[File:Nuclear depth charge explodes near USS Agerholm (DD-826), 11 May 1962.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[USS Agerholm (DD-826)|USS ''Agerholm'' (DD-826)]] launched an [[ASROC]] anti-submarine rocket, armed with a nuclear depth bomb, during the [[Operation Dominic I and II|Swordfish Test]] of 1962]]
The high explosive in a depth charge undergoes a rapid chemical reaction at an approximate rate of 8,000 meters per second (25,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s).  The gaseous products of that reaction momentarily occupy the volume previously occupied by the solid explosive, but at very high pressure.  This pressure is the source of the damage and is proportional to the explosive density and the square of the detonation velocity.  A depth charge gas bubble expands to reach the pressure of the surrounding water.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1978|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gas expansion propagates a shock wave.  The density difference of the expanding gas bubble from the surrounding water causes the bubble to rise toward the surface.  Unless the explosion is shallow enough to vent the gas bubble to the atmosphere during its initial expansion, the momentum of water moving away from the gas bubble will create a gaseous void of lower pressure than the surrounding water. Surrounding water pressure then collapses the gas bubble with inward momentum causing excess pressure within the gas bubble. Re-expansion of the gas bubble then  propagates another potentially damaging shock wave. Cyclical expansion and contraction continues until the gas bubble vents to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

Consequently, explosions where the depth charge is detonated at a shallow depth and the gas bubble vents into the atmosphere very soon after the detonation are quite ineffective, even though they are more dramatic and therefore preferred in movies. A sign of an effective detonation depth is that the surface just slightly rises and only after a while vents into a water burst.

Very large depth charges, including nuclear weapons, may be detonated at sufficient depth to create multiple damaging shock waves.  Such depth charges can also cause damage at longer distances, if reflected shock waves from the ocean floor or surface converge to amplify radial shock waves. Submarines or surface ships may be damaged if operating in the convergence zones of their own depth charge detonations.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

The damage that an underwater explosion inflicts on a submarine comes from a primary and a secondary shock wave. The primary shock wave is the initial shock wave from the depth charge, and will cause damage to personnel and equipment inside the submarine if detonated close enough. The secondary shock wave is a result from the cyclical expansion and contraction of the gas bubble and will bend the submarine back and forth and cause catastrophic hull breach, in a way that can be best described as bending a plastic ruler back and forth until it snaps. Up to sixteen cycles of the secondary shock wave have been recorded in tests. The effect of the secondary shock wave can be reinforced if another depth charge detonates on the other side of the hull in a close proximity in time of the first detonation, which is why depth charges normally are launched in pairs with different pre-set detonation depths.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;!--nearby shock would trigger second depth charge?--&gt;

The killing radius of a depth charge depends on the depth of detonation, the proximity of detonation to the submarine, the payload of the depth charge and the size and strength of the submarine hull. A depth charge of approximately 100&amp;nbsp;kg of TNT (400 [[megajoule|MJ]]) would normally have a killing radius (hull breach) of only {{convert|3|-|4|m|0|sp=us}} against a conventional 1000-ton submarine, while the disablement radius (where the submarine is not sunk but put out of commission) would be approximately {{convert|8|-|10|m|sp=us}}. A larger payload increases the radius only relatively little because the effect of an underwater explosion decreases as the cube of the distance to the target.

A '''double inverted pendulum''' is the combination of the [[inverted pendulum]] and the [[double pendulum]]. The double inverted pendulum is unstable, meaning that it will fall down unless it is controlled in some way. The two main methods of controlling a double inverted pendulum are moving the base, as with the inverted pendulum, or by applying a torque at the pivot point between the two pendulums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Sickergrube.jpg|thumb|Old drywell.]]
A '''dry well''' or '''drywell''' is an underground structure that disposes of unwanted [[water]], most commonly [[surface runoff]] and [[stormwater]], and in some cases [[greywater]]. It is a covered, porous-walled chamber that allows water to slowly soak into the ground (that is, [[percolation|percolate]]), dissipating into the [[groundwater]]. Such structures are often called a '''soakaway''' in the United Kingdom, a '''soakwell''' in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Jacques|title=Environmentalist|url=http://www.soakwells.com/whatis.html|publisher=Perth Soakwells Pty Ltd|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''soak pit''' in India. 

A [[sump]] in a [[basement]] can be built in drywell form, allowing the [[sump pump]] to cycle less frequently (handling only occasional peak demand). A [[French drain]] can resemble a horizontal dry well that is not covered. A larger open pit or artificial [[swale (landform)|swale]] that receives storm water and dissipates it into the ground is called an [[infiltration basin]] or recharge basin. In places where the amount of water to be dispersed is not as large, a [[rain garden]] can be used instead. 

A dry well is a passive structure.  Water flows through it under the influence of gravity.  A dry well receives water from one or more entry pipes or channels at its top and discharges the same water through a number of small exit openings distributed over a larger surface area in the side(s) and bottom of the dry well.  When a dry well is above the [[water table]], most of its internal volume will contain air.  Such a dry well can accept an initial inrush of water very quickly, until the air is displaced.  After that, the dry well can only accept water as fast as it can dissipate water.  Some dry wells deliberately incorporate a large storage capacity, so that they can accept a large amount of water very quickly and then dissipate it gradually over time, a method that is compatible with the intermittent nature of [[rainfall]].  A dry well maintains the connection between its inflow and outflow openings by resisting collapse and resisting clogging.

Simple dry wells consist of a pit filled with [[gravel]], [[riprap]], [[rubble]], or other [[debris]]. Such pits resist collapse, but do not have much storage capacity because their interior volume is mostly filled by stone.  A more advanced dry well defines a large interior storage volume by a concrete or plastic chamber with perforated sides and bottom.  These dry wells are usually buried completely, so that they do not take up any land area.  The dry wells for a parking lot's storm drains are usually buried below the same parking lot.

A covered pit that disposes of the water component of sewage by the same principle as a dry well is called a [[cesspool]]. A [[septic drain field]] operates on the same slow-drain/large-area principle as an infiltration basin.

'''Dynamic Business Modeling''' ("DBM") describes the ability to automate [[business model]]s within an open framework. The independent analyst firm [[Gartner]] has recently called Dynamic Business Modeling "critical for [[Business Support Systems|BSS]] solutions to succeed".

Dynamic Business Modeling is based on principles wherein the [[business logic]] of an [[Application software|application]] is managed independently from the [[application server]]s that automate the services and processes defined in the business logic. Business modeling and integration (which itself is defined as part of the business model) are defined in a business logic layer, allowing underlying application servers to be business logic agnostic and therefore need no business driven customization. DBM applied correctly should reduce both the cost and risk in the initial implementation and its future evolution of systems.

Previous generations of IT systems (from 1990 to approximately 2001) were designed to address specific business models and regulatory practices and no value was given to [[logic]]–[[infrastructure]] segregation.  These systems provided value by automating predefined business models (commonly referred to as "off-the-shelf").  As a result, they implicitly drove [[business strategy]] where DBM states that they should be driven by it.  By being "predefined" they do not:

* openly incorporate business changes in the business landscape of an industry
* leverage potential business models that new technologies allow

Dynamic Business modeling is suited for open automation of strategy-driven business models. By removing the need for customization of core application servers it is postulated as more [[Cost efficiency|cost efficient]], rapidly deployed and evolveable. Dynamic Business Modeling was initially described (though applied much earlier in practice) by Doug Zone at MetraTech Corp. in reference to the billing segment of the enterprise software market.  "Service Oriented Applications" (also known as "service based applications") coined by IBM describe potential methodologies to achieve DBM.

==Technical definition ==

Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the automation of Enterprise Business Models based on the principle that the model's underlying [[business process]]es and business services need to be dynamically and openly definable and re-definable.

==Business definition ==

Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the enabler of a strategic advantage achieved by focused [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] in any aspect of business (from marketing to finance to operations). This differentiation is achieved through how business is conducted: openly and dynamically defining the business model.  [[Capital investment]] – human, physical and intellectual – must be aimed at allowing the definition of the business model to be dynamic.

Dynamic Business Modeling recognises that businesses dynamically evolve, re-inventing their (business) models to achieve strategic advantage. DBM posits that the role of [[enterprise software]] (CRM, billing, ERP) is to dynamically automate and advance the business processes and services that lie behind these Business models.

==History==

The term was first used to describe the architecture of MetraNet, a [[wiktionary:Charging|charging]], [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing, [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]] and [[customer care]] from [[MetraTech]] Corp.

==Core principles ==

# Business strategy drives selection of business models.
# These business models drive the design of underlying processes and services.
#* ''Business Analysis is critical: Any number of models can address a strategic imperative. But the best models, services and processes will exploit existing business capabilities (human, IT and physical), the areas where change is possible and the areas where [[investment]] will make most change possible at the lowest cost.''
# Enterprise software automates these services and processes.
# DBM enables change: Strategic adeptness requires tuning and/or the re-definition of the present Business Model.
#* ''The business must begin with the principle that allows rapid tuning and/or re-definition of the underlying services and processes. This must apply at human and technological levels''.

==Key success criteria ==

# Open modeling capabilities:
#* ''Dynamic Business Modeling requires [[IT architecture]] and [[enterprise application]]s that automate the business model  – not just a business model.''
# Ease of modeling:
#* ''Definition and [[automation]] of new and evolved business services and processes must be accessible at the [[business analysis]] level.  Ideally the models and its services and processes are defined and stored in open [[business analyst]] oriented data (for example [[metadata]].)''
# Open integration:
#* ''Dynamic Business Modeling must work with processes and services (both automated and human) that are NOT dynamic. These fixed constraints are not external to the new business model but are part of its fabric. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be able to incorporate, embed and/or build upon these existing processes and services.''
# Robustness:
#* ''Regardless of the dynamism of the business model. The automated and human-based business processes and services must have all the robustness of long standing static processes and services.  Dynamic IT automation must have a full [[audit]] capability, reprocessing ability and standards compliance (i.e. PCI).''
# Perpetual dynamism:
#* ''Automation is never finished. Processes and services change and are added constantly. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be designed to prevent “lock down” where the service and process automation on “Day One” is so tightly coupled that only minor evolution is economic.  SOA principles of openness and loss coupling must be applied inside business applications.''

==Best practice ==

# DBM is service-based:
#* '' The application should be based on the principle that processes and integration can be de-constructed internally into services.''
# Services and processes are loosely coupled:
#* ''Changing one should not impact the others.''
# Services and process definitions are open:
#* ''And accessible to a business analyst. Ideally definitions are kept in metadata.''
# Application servers must be free of embedded business logic:
#* ''For services, processes, data, workflows alike.''
# Dynamic documentation is a feature:
#* ''As the model evolves the documentation must evolve as well. The application should allow the business analyst to document at service level and then generate a cohesive document that encompasses entire model.''
# Business Analyst Interface is friendly and flexible:
#* ''The application must provide a way to put the definition of services and processes in analyst terms – using universal concepts such as flows and tables. The interface should encourage documentation, warn on inconsistencies, and allow testing.''

== History ==
EKWB was founded in 1999 by Edvard König, who wanted better thermal and acoustic performance for his [[personal computer]]. The company released new versions of their products, resulting in a 40% cooling performance increase from 2006 to 2011. As of 2011 EKWB was one of the three largest personal computer water cooling companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=EK Water Blocks; EK Water Blocks Leaps Into Upper Tier, as Fastest Growing Company in PC Water Cooling Industry|date=July 26, 2011|work=Technology &amp; Business Journal|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; EKWB works with the [[overclocking]] community through forums to better understand the needs of its customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=EK Water Blocks; EK Water Blocks Pushing the Bar for PC Water Cooling Computer Enthusiasts|date=January 6, 2011|work=NewsRX|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

EKWB specialises in cooling supplies. Its product line includes: Supremacy CPU [[water block]]s, GPU [[Water block|water blocks]], [[radiator]]s,  [[computer fan]]s, AIO (All-in-one) liquid cooling sets and several accessories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/about-us/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=EKWB|publisher=|access-date=Nov 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CPU Water Blocks ===
Currently EKWB sell a number of CPU water cooling blocks, primarily EK-Annihilator designed for [[LGA 3647|socket LGA 3647]], EK-Supremacy sTR4 designed for [[Socket TR4|Socket SP3r2]], EK-Supremacy EVO, an evolution of a EK-Supremacy water block, EK-Supremacy MX, a reduced cost version of the Supremacy EVO, and EK-Velocity, their new flagship CPU waterblock, launched 1st October 2018. 

The EK-Supremacy EVO, EK-Supremacy MX and EK-Velocity have mounting kits available for Intel's Socket [[LGA 775|T]], [[LGA 1366|B]], [[LGA 1156|H]], [[LGA 1155|H2]], [[LGA 1150|H3]], [[LGA 1151|H4]], [[LGA 2011|R]], [[LGA 2011|R3]] and [[LGA 2066|R4]]. (N.B. Socket [[LGA 2011|R2]] is also compatible but was only used for certain server processors) and AMD's Socket 754, 939, 940, AM2(+), AM3(+), AM4, FM1 and FM2(+). The  EK-Annihilator is required for Intels server [[LGA 3647]] and the EK-Supremacy sTR is required for AMD's [[Epyc|EPYC]] and [[Threadripper]] CPU's mounting holes, respectfully. 

EKWB also sells a range of '''Monoblocks''', a CPU block that is much larger and also cools the motherboard's [[Voltage regulator module|VRM]], ensuring it does not overheat from high load. These monoblocks are based off the EK-Supremacy EVO.

Blocks are offered in a number of finishes, with interchange top parts. Blocks are made from copper (or in the Fluid Gaming case aluminium) and either left as bare copper, nickel plated or gold plated. The block's top, as they call it, are made from either nickel plated brass, [[Polyoxymethylene|Acetal]] (usually black, though white is an option) or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexi]] tops (both clear and colour tinted).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/water-blocks/cpu-blocks|title=CPU Blocks - Water Blocks  – EK Webshop|website=www.ekwb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GPU Water Blocks ===
EKWB produces both universal GPU water blocks, that only cool the GPU's silicon die itself, and full cover water blocks that cool the [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], [[Video RAM (dual-ported DRAM)|VRAM]] and [[Voltage regulator module|VRM]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of a graphics card. EKWB makes a number of versions for so called AIB parner cards such as [[Sapphire Technology|Sapphire]], [[Asus|ASUS]] and [[EVGA Corporation|EVGA]], custom PCB versions of the standard video card, which have different [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] layouts. Full cover blocks are not compatible with different versions, even with the same GPU core, eg. a block for a [[GeForce 10 series|Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080]] Founders Edition will not an ASUS ROG Strix version of the [[GeForce 10 series|GeForce GTX 1080]].

EKWB Universal GPU blocks, marketed as EK-VGA Supremacy for single graphics card setup, and a larger version called EK-Thermosphere, designed for use with more than one graphics card. These blocks only cool the GPU core, and so leave the VRAM and VRMs on a card to be cooled by air, usually. Should a user fail to ensure these vital parts of the card are also cooled, either by placing a fan to direct air over them, or by the use of stick on heat sinks, it's possible for the card to shutdown, or die even, from overheating. 

Just like the CPU blocks, they offer the blocks in different style offerings in both bare copper and nickel plating, and cover plates made from Acetal or Plexi. EK-VGA Supremacy can also be found with a nickel plated brass top option. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/water-blocks/vga-blocks|title=GPU Blocks - Water Blocks  – EK Webshop|website=www.ekwb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RAM Water Blocks ===
EKWB offer a range of blocks for RAM DIMM modules, marketed as EK-RAM Monarch. Due to the tight spaces involved in RAM DIMM layouts on modern PCs, the water blocks do not sit directly on the RAM modules, but rather connect to special [[Heat spreader|heat spreaders]] attached to the DIMM's, they then screw into the RAM block which sits on top and is thermally connected via [[Thermal interface material|TIM]]. They sell these blocks in two and four DIMM versions. They are available as both bare copper and nickel plated copper, as well as in acetal and plexi versions. The heat spreaders are offered in aluminium with black or nickel finishes. Copper versions are also available for the extreme cooling version. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/water-blocks/ram-blocks|title=RAM Blocks - Water Blocks  – EK Webshop|website=www.ekwb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PC Case Fans ===
EKWB have their own range of fans especially designed for use with PC water cooling radiators. These fans are marketed as being high [[static pressure]] and low noise, both factors to be considered for airflow through a radiator. These fans are available in a number of colour combinations, rotational speed and in sizes of 120mm and 140mm, the two main PC cooling standards for enthusiasts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/radiators-fans/fans|title=Fans - Radiators &amp; Fans  – EK Webshop|website=www.ekwb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PC Water Cooling Radiators ===
EKWB offer radiators in a number of sizes and thicknesses, marketed as CoolStream. 

They offer their 120mm radiator options as single (120mmx120mm), dual (240mmx120mm), triple (360mmx120mm) and quad (480mmx120mm) fan places in thicknesses of 28mm (SE line) 38mm (PE line) and 60mm (XE line)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/radiators-fans/120mm-series-radiators|title=120mm Series Radiators - Radiators &amp; Fans  – EK Webshop|website=www.ekwb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They offer 140mm radiator options as single (140mmc140mm), dual (280mmx140mm), triple (420mmx140mm) and quad (560mmx140mm) fan places in thicknesses of 28mm (SE Line) and 45mm (CE line). Recently, following the revival of 180mm fans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3229-revisiting-the-best-200mm-fan-silverstone-ap-180mm|title=Revisiting the Best ~200mm Fan: SilverStone Penetrator AP181|last=Burke|first=Steve|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they also started offering 180mm size rads, in single (180mmx180mm), dual (360mmx180mm) and triple (540mmx180mm) in a thickness of 35mm (WE line).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/radiators-fans|title=Radiators and Fans  – EK Webshop|website=www.ekwb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radiators are made with copper tubes, brass end tanks soldered to the tubes and copper fins in an aluminium housing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-coolstream-se-480-slim-quad-5014|title=EK-CoolStream SE 480 (Slim Quad)|last=|first=|date=30 September 2018|website=EKWB|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== PC All-In-One (AIO) and Water Cooling bundled Kits ===
EKWB offer their own range of [[Computer cooling#Liquid cooling|AIO]]'s which use their own parts and are ready to use, or a DIY kit, featuring all the parts you need to build a custom loop out of the box. These ready packaged kits feature all the same parts as you'd get if you buy the parts separately, but all arranged neatly. Marketed as being for beginners to take all the guess work out of getting into custom watercooling&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

The '''G.I. pocket stove''' is a [[World War II]]–era [[Portable stove#Pressurized liquid fuel stoves|portable pressurized-burner liquid-fuel stove]] made by the [[Coleman Company]] of [[Wichita, Kansas]].

== History ==
[[File:Patent Drawing for Coleman Model 520 Stove.jpg|thumb |135px|Patent drawing of Coleman Model 520 stove]]

During [[World War II]], the U.S. government tasked Coleman to develop a compact stove for [[military]] use.  The stove had to be lightweight, no larger than a [[quart]]-sized [[thermos]] bottle, burn any kind of fuel, and operate in weather from −60 to +125&amp;nbsp;°Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;B. Tanner, "Coleman Created Stove to Fill G.I.s’ Needs," Wichita Eagle, Page 1E, Aug. 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heat of the Battle"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coleman.com/coleman/ColemanCom/tales_062.asp |title=Coleman History – The Heat of the Battle |publisher=Coleman Co. |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718061956/http://www.coleman.com/coleman/ColemanCom/tales_062.asp |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within 60 days, Coleman came up with what became the G.I. Pocket Stove.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. McDermott, “The Triumph of W.C. Coleman,” in The Rotarian Magazine, Vol. 78, No. 6 (Dec. 1950), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Designated the Model 520 Coleman Military Burner,&lt;ref&gt;Coleman Lamp and Stove Co., “Operating Instructions for Coleman Military Burner Model 520 (Apr. 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; the stove first saw service in November 1942 when 5,000 of the stoves accompanied U.S. forces during the invasion of [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].&lt;ref name="Heat of the Battle"/&gt;  Over 1 million of the stoves were produced for war use,&lt;ref&gt;G. Winegar, “Coleman Shining Example of Outdoors Ingenuity,” Richmond Times-Dispatch, Page D11, July 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Million"/&gt; where it won high praise in the field:  [[Ernie Pyle]] ranked it "just behind the [[Jeep#The origins of the vehicle: the first jeeps|Jeep]]” in its usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cole, "Chairman Offers to Buy Coleman," New York Times, Page D1, Feb. 15, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Scott|title=How to think like Einstein simple ways to break the rules and discover your hidden genius|year=2000|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Ill.|isbn=1402253028|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yrYQxBgIYEC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=just%20behind%20the%20jeep%20in%20its%20usefulness&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, Coleman began production of a civilian version of the Model 520, designated the Model 530, and advertised as the "G.I. pocket stove."&lt;ref name="Million"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Over a Million Gone to War!|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=August 1945|volume=84|issue=2|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P98DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20coleman%201945&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman advertisement “Born of War – You’ll Use It For Fun,” in Popular Mechanics Magazine,  Vol. 84, No. 4, p. 6A (Oct. 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Model 530 was promoted by Coleman as the "perfect pal for hunting, fishing and camping trips" that would "slip easily into a hunting coat pocket, glove compartment of a car, or corner of [a] picnic hamper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Every Outing is More Fun with the "G.I."

Pocket Stove was only manufactured between 1946 and 1949; Coleman did not manufacture another single-burner, non-military backpacking stove until 1972. Larger single-burner stoves continued in production, starting with the 500 Sportster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coleman.com/coleman/ColemanCom/newsrelease.asp?releasenum=338 |title=History of Coleman Stoves |publisher=Coleman Press Release Aug. 24, 2006 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921100908/http://coleman.com/coleman/colemancom/newsrelease.asp?releasenum=338 |archivedate=2010-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
The G.I. pocket stove is 8½ inches high and 4½ inches in diameter, and weighs about three pounds.  It was designed to burn either [[Leaded gasoline#Lead|leaded]] or [[Gasoline|unleaded automobile gasoline]] (sometimes referred to as “[[white gas]]oline” or pure gasoline, without lead or [[Gasoline additive|additives]]).  It can hold a  [[pint]] of fuel, burn for over 3 hours on a full tank, and generate over {{convert|5,000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour.  Six small hinged metal pieces on the top fold outward for use as pot supports, and fold inward for storage.  The stove comes with a two-piece telescoping aluminum case, which can be used as cook pots, a steel wrench that also serves as a handle for the cooking pots, a small metal disc or top plate which is placed on the burner grate to help disperse the flame, and a fuel funnel.  An integrated hand-operated cleaning needle is used to remove [[soot]] or other impurities that can clog the burner tip.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman Co., “Coleman G.I. Pocket Stove: A Handbook On Its Operation and Many Uses,” pp. 18–19 (undated, circa 1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilian version differs only slightly from its military cousin: the Model 530 G.I. pocket stove has a [[nickel]]-plated [[brass]] fuel tank, while the model 520 military version was painted olive drab.  The military Model 520 also has three small folding legs at the base, which are omitted on the Model 530, and the civilian version has four vertical supports for the upper frame assembly (supporting the cooking grate) while the military version has three.

== Operation ==
The fuel tank must first be pressurized by using the small hand-pump on the side of the stove.  After pumping, the control valve is opened just slightly, allowing a mix of fuel (drawn from the bottom of the tank) and pressurized air (drawn from the top of the tank) to reach the burner head. There, the mixture is ignited using a match or lighter. Once the flame burns steadily for 2 to 3 minutes and the burner head is sufficiently heated up, the control valve is opened as far as possible. This cuts off the air from the tank, changing the mix to pure fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post: Coleman Fuel/Air Tubes and Instant Lighting Explained|url=http://www.spiritburner.com/fusion/showtopic.php?tid/26765/|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat of the burner head is then sufficient to vaporize the pure fuel prior to combustion. The size of the flame depends on the amount of pressure in the tank, which must be re-pressurized periodically using the hand pump.

Since the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) was introduced in the late 1980s there have been many attempts to integrate it into a navigation-assistance system for [[blindness|blind]] and visually impaired people.

== Software ==
=== Android ===
==== Corsair GPS ====
Corsair is a GPS for pedestrians. It allows you to discover places around you and take you there. A new way of guidance has been developed by using the smartphone's vibration feature to indicate the direction to follow. This solution is particularly useful for people with visual impairments.

==== Cydalion ====
Cydalion is a navigation aid for people with visual impairments for [[Tango (platform)|Tango]]-enabled devices. Cydalion detects objects (including their height), offers custom sounds, and has a personalized user interface.

==== Lazarillo ====
Lazarillo is based on Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and Foursquare alongside they own databases and with this information, Lazarillo collects the necessary data about the surroundings of the user to support the following features:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lazarillo |url=https://www.lazarillo.cl/es/ |website=Lazarillo |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Exploration: Can provide you guidance through voice notifications/warnings. It will tell you where you are and what services are around you
# Specific Searches: By the “search” tab you can obtain search a specific location.
# Search by categories: Look for places around you, using categories; such as restaurants, health centers and services of transportation.
# Save favorites: In order to quickly access your favorite spots in the city, click on “save” so they become immediately available.
# Customize: Modify the voice that will pilot you through the city.
# Routing or guiding from one point to another: By walking, car, bus or subway, you will get from one point to other by the guidance service. Following the place you want to reach, an alarm will announce if you are getting closer to the spot. This feature also works if the scan mode is paused.

=== ANGEO ===
Was designed in France to compensate for the limitations of traditional GPS and smartphone applications for the blind and visually impaired .{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
The fruit of 8 years of research in collaboration with the CNRS, ANGEO is the only device capable of discretely, reliably guiding you when crossing areas where GPS satellites are masked.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== iOS ===
When Apple introduced the iPhone 3GS in 2009, it was the first ever touch screen device accessible to the blind. iOS device usage has steadily increased among the blind and visually impaired population and numerous GPS apps targeting this user group have been developed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey5/|title=WebAIM: Screen Reader User Survey #5 Results|website=webaim.org|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ariadne GPS ====
Ariadne GPS, developed by Luca Giovanni Ciaffoni, was released in June 2011 and was one of the first GPS apps specifically designed for blind and visually impaired users. It is based on Google map data and has the following features:
# Informing the user about their location on request and in configurable intervals.
# Letting the user save points that are important to them. The app will alert the user when they approach the point. The users can define the alert distance separately for each point.
# Accessible map: The user can slide their finger on the screen and the app will announce the area or street address (depending on zoom) under their finger. Ciaffoni has developed his own accessible map for Ariadne GPS. His solution was available before Apple’s accessible maps came out in iOS 6.
# Import and export of points of interest.

==== BlindSquare ====
BlindSquare is developed by MIPsoft and was first released in May 2012. It uses data from [[Foursquare]] and [[OpenStreetMap]] and offers a large feature set covering the needs of blind and visually impaired travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blindsquare.com/about/|title=What is BlindSquare|publisher=MIPsoft|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on Foursquare, Open Street Map, and Apple Maps data and supports the following features:

==== iMove ====
iMove has been developed by EveryWare Technologies and was first released in January 2013. It is unique, because it lets users record sound clips and associate them with saved locations. iMove offers the following features:
# Reporting public points of interest as the user walks.
# Saving user points and alerting the user when these points are approached.
# Recording of short sound clips, which are linked to saved locations and are played back when approaching the location.

==== MyWay Classic ====
MyWay Classic was first released in January 2012 and is developed by the Swis Federation of the Blind. It has evolved into an app with a large set of features covering the needs of blind and visually impaired travelers. It uses Open Street Map data and includes the following features:
# Inform users about their current location on request and automatically.
# Users can record their own points of interest and be alerted when they approach them.
# Users can record their own routes and be guided by the app when they walk one of the recorded routes. 
# Once the necessary Open Street Map data has been downloaded and imported into the app, MyWay can announce street intersections and public points of interest as the user approaches them.
# Once the necessary Open Street Map files have been downloaded and imported into the app, the user can filter the categories of public points of interest to be announced by editing the files or by creating their own files and pasting the required data into the newly created files.
# Using Open Street Map data, MyWay offers turn-by-turn navigation.
# Import and export of points of interest.
# Support of indoor navigation using Bluetooth beacons.

==== Seeing Assistant Move ====
Seeing Assistant move is developed by Transition Technologies S.A. and was first released in March 2013. It is the only GPS app designed for blind and visually impaired people that lets the user operate the app through predefined speech commands. It is based on Open Street Map and supports the following features:
# Announcing current location of user
# Automatic announcement of public points of interest, provided the necessary Open Street Map files have been downloaded.
# Saving user points of interest and announcing these points when they are approached. 
# Announcing points of interest located in the direction the user points their device in.
# Simulation of places, letting users explore distant places before traveling there.
# Recording of user-defined routes and walking of these routes.
# Integrated accessible map.
# App operation through predefined speech commands.
# Sending coordinates of point to Apple Maps or Google Maps to initiate turn-by-turn navigation.

==== Sendero Seeing Eye GPS ====
Sendero Seeing Eye GPS is developed by the Sendero Group in collaboration with several organizations for the blind (Seeing Eye, RNIB, Guide Dogs NSW ACT) and was first released in July 2013. The Seeing Eye GPS is a fully accessible turn-by-turn GPS iPhone app developed by Sendero Group. It has all the normal navigation features plus features unique to blind users, such as simple menu structure, automatic announcements of intersections and points of interest, and routes for both pedestrian and vehicle with heads-up announcements for approaching turns.
It uses [[Foursquare]] and [[Google Places]] for points of interest and [[Google Maps]] for street info.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senderogroup.com/products/shopseeingeyegps.htm|title=What is Seeing Eye GPS|publisher=Sendero Group|accessdate=6 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717210052/http://www.senderogroup.com/products/shopseeingeyegps.htm|archivedate=17 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing Eye is not available globally and is offered under various names:
* Seeing Eye GPS (subscription, North America)
* Seeing Eye XT (onetime purchase, North America)
* RNIB Navigator (subscription, UK, Ireland, Germany, France)
* Guide Dogs NSW ACT (subscription, Australia)
The Sendero apps include the following features:
# Turn-by-turn navigation.
# Saving of user points of interest.
# Automatic announcement of public and user points of interest and intersections.
# Description of intersections.
# Announcing public and user points of interest and intersections located in the direction the user points their device in.

==== ViaOpta Nav ====
ViaOpta Nav is developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and was first released in August 2014. It is available for both IOS and Android devices. It is the only GPS app targeting blind and visually impaired users that offers the possibility to search for accessibility information for example information about intersections, tactile paving, and audible traffic signals. Although Open Street Map supports respective categories, this information is not very widely available yet in the map data itself.

ViaOpta Nav uses Apple Maps (on iOS devices) and Google Maps (on Android devices) for address retrieval, and Open Street Map for route calculation, intersection information, and public points of interest. ViaOpta Nav supports the following main features:
# Announcing user’s current location.
# Spoken turn-by-turn navigation.
# Automatic announcement of intersections.
# Saving of user points of interest.
# Exploring of public points of interest nearby and selecting them as a destination. However, these points are not announced as the user walks.
# Headset support lets users request some information by pressing buttons on their headset.

=== Symbian OS ===
==== Loadstone GPS ====
The Loadstone project is developing an [[Open-source software|open source]] software for [[Global Navigation Satellite System|satellite navigation]] for blind and visually impaired users. The software is free and runs currently on many different [[Nokia]] devices with the [[S60 platform]] under all versions of the [[Symbian]] operating system. A [[Global Positioning System|GPS receiver]] must be connected to the cell phone by [[Bluetooth]]. Many blind people around the world are using Nokia cell phones because there are two [[screen reader]] products for the S60 Symbian platform; Talks from [[Nuance Communications]] and [[Mobile Speak]] from the Spanish company Code Factory. This makes these devices accessible by output of [[speech synthesis|synthetic speech]] and also allow the use of third party software, such as Loadstone GPS.

The Loadstone developers, who are blind, are from Vancouver, Glasgow, and Amsterdam. Many users from around the world have contributed improvement proposals as they know exactly what functionality helps to increase their pedestrian mobility. Monty Lilburn and Shawn Kirkpatrick started the project in 2004. After the first development successes, they made it public in May 2006. Since then, other volunteers have found their way to this project of global self-help. The program is under the [[GPL|GNU General Public License]] (GPL), and was financed entirely by the private developers and by donations of users. This product provides blind people with more independence from the trading policy and prices of the few global vendors of accessible satellite navigation solutions.

In large rural regions and developing or newly industrializing countries, nearly no exact map data is available in common map databases. As such, the Loadstone software provides users an option to create and store their own waypoints for [[navigation]] and share them with others. The Loadstone community is working on importing coordinates from free sources, such as the OpenStreetMap project. In addition they are searching for a [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of licenses for commercial [[GIS|map data]], such as is offered by the company [[Tele Atlas]]. The other major supplier is [[Navteq]], which belongs to Nokia.

[[Lodestone]] is the name of a natural magnetic iron that was used throughout history in the manufacturing of compasses.&lt;br /&gt; Sighted owners of S60 devices can use Loadstone for leisure-time activities [[geocaching]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== JavaME ===
==== LoroDux ====
LoroDux was a project by [[Fachhochschule Hannover]]. Like in Loadstone the user is led by direction and distance information. The text on the screen is read out by a screenreader. Vibration-Only navigation is possible. Data can be imported from the OpenStreetMap project. The development is discontinued because the team prefers to use Java on Android for the future. LoroDux LoroDux{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Windows Mobile ===
====Mobile Geo====

Mobile Geo is Code Factory’s GPS navigation software for Windows Mobile-based Smartphones, Pocket PC phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Powered by GPS and mapping technology from the Sendero Group, Mobile Geo is the first solution specifically designed to serve as a navigation aid for people with a visual impairment which works with a wide range of mainstream mobile devices. Though it is a separately licensed product, Mobile Geo is seamlessly{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} integrated with Code Factory’s popular screen readers – [[Mobile Speak]] for Pocket PCs and Mobile Speak for Windows Mobile Smartphones.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Standalone Devices ==
===Trekker===

The Victor Trekker, designed and manufactured by HumanWare (previously known as VisuAide), was launched on March 2003. It is a personal digital assistant ([[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]) application operating on a Dell Axim 50/51 or later replaced by HP IPAQ 2490B [[Pocket PC]], adapted for the blind and visually impaired with talking menus, talking maps, and GPS information. Fully portable (weight 600g), it offered features enabling a blind person to determine position, create routes and receive information on navigating to a destination. It also provided search functions for an exhaustive [[database]] of point of interests, such as restaurants, hotels, etc.

The PDA's touch screen is made accessible by a tactile keypad with buttons that is held in place with an elastic strap.

It is fully upgradeable, so it can expand to accommodate new hardware [[platform (computing)|platform]]s and more detailed geographic information.

Trekker and Maestro, which is the first off-the-shelf accessible [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] based on Windows Mobile Pocket PC, are integrated and available since May 2005.

The Trekker is no longer sold by Humanware; the successor "Trekker Breeze" is a standalone unit. The software has fewer features than the original Trekker.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Trekker Breeze ===
The Trekker Breeze is standalone hardware. Routes need to be recorded before they can be used. POIs are supported.

===BrailleNote GPS===

The BrailleNote GPS [[Information appliance|device]] is developed by Sendero Group, LLC, and Pulse Data International, now called HumanWare, in 2002. It is like a combination of a personal digital assistant, Map-quest software and a mechanical voice.

With a receiver about the size of a small cell phone, the BrailleNote GPS utilizes the GPS network to pinpoint a traveler’s position on earth and nearby points of interest. The BrailleNote receives radio signals from satellites to chart the location of users and direct them to their destination with spoken information from the [[speech synthesizer]]. The system uses satellites to triangulate the carrier’s position, much like a ship finding its location at sea.

Users can record points of interest such as local restaurants or any other location into the PDA’s database. Afterward, they can use keyboard commands on the unit’s keyboard to direct themselves to a specific point of interest.

== Navigation systems that are not designed for blind people, but are accessible ==
=== Kapsys Kapten ===
The French company Kapsys offers a navigation system without a display, that works with speech input and output, called Kapten.

It was originally developed for cyclists but soon became a favourite in blind communities because of its low price compared to other accessible navigation solutions. Later Versions took feedback about accessibility into account.

== Historical or research projects ==
===Trinetra ===

The Trinetra project aims to develop cost-effective, independence-enhancing technologies to benefit blind people. One such system addresses accessibility concerns of blind people using public transportation systems. Using GPS receivers and staggered [[Infrared]] sensors, information is relayed to a centralized fleet management server via a cellular modem. Blind people, using common text-to-speech enabled cell phones can query estimated time of arrival, locality, and current bus capacity using a [[web browser]].

Trinetra, spearheaded by Professor Priya Narasimhan, is an ongoing project at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Additional research topics include item-level [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] and [[RFID]] identification while grocery shopping and indoor navigation in retail settings.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===MoBIC===

MoBIC means ''Mobility of Blind and Elderly people Interacting with Computers'', which was carried out from 1994 to 1996 supported by the [[European Commission|Commission of the European Union]]. It was developing a route planning system which is designed to allow a blind person access to information from many sources such as bus and train timetables as well as electronic maps of the locality. The planning system helps blind people to study and plan their routes in advance, indoors.

With the addition of devices to give the precise current position and orientation of the blind pedestrian, the system could then be used outdoors. The outdoor positioning system is based on [[Signal (information theory)|signal]]s and [[satellite]]s which give the [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] to within a metre; the computer converts this data to a position on an electronic map of locality. The output from the system is in the form of spoken messages.

===Drishti===

Drishti is a wireless pedestrian navigation system. It integrates several technologies including wearable computers, voice recognition and synthesis, wireless networks, [[Geographic information system]] (GIS) and GPS. It augments contextual information to the visually impaired and computed optimized routes based on user preference, temporal constraints (e.g. traffic congestion), and dynamic obstacles (e.g. ongoing ground work, road blockade for special events).

The system constantly guides the blind user to navigate based on static and dynamic data. Environmental conditions and landmark information queries from a [[spatial database]] along their route are provided on the fly through detailed explanatory voice cues. The system also provides capability for the user to add intelligence, as perceived by the blind user, to the central server hosting the spatial database.

===UCSB Personal Guidance System===

In 1985, Jack Loomis, a Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], came up with the idea of a GPS-based navigation system for the visually impaired. A short unpublished paper (Loomis, 1985) outlined the concept and detailed some ideas for implementation, including the idea of a virtual sound interface. Loomis directed the project for over 20 years, in collaboration with [[Reginald Golledge]] (1937–2009), Professor of Geography at UCSB, and [[Roberta Klatzky]], Professor of Psychology (now at Carnegie Mellon University). Their combination of development and applied research was supported by three multi-year grants from the National Eye Institute (NEI) and another multi-year consortium grant from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), headed by Michael May of Sendero Group. In 1993, the UCSB group first publicly demonstrated the Personal Guidance System (PGS) using a bulky prototype carried in a backpack. Since then, they created several versions of the PGS, one of which was carried in a small pack worn at the waist. Their project mostly focused on the user interface and the resulting research has defined the legacy of the project. As indicated earlier in this entry, several wearable systems are now commercially available. These systems provide verbal guidance and environmental information via speech and Braille displays. But just as drivers and pilots want pictorial information from their navigation systems, survey research by the UCSB group has shown that visually impaired people often want direct perceptual information about the environment. Most of their R&amp;D has dealt with several types of “spatial display”, with researchers Jim Marston and Nicholas Giudice contributing to the recent efforts. The first is a virtual acoustic display, which provides auditory information to the user via earphones (as proposed in the 1985 concept paper). With this display, the user hears important environmental locations, such as turn points along the route and points of interest. The labels of these locations are converted to synthetic speech and then displayed using auditory direction and distance cues, such that the spoken labels appear in the auditory space of the user. A second type of display, which the group calls a “haptic pointer interface”, was inspired by the hand-held receiver used in the Talking Signs© system of remote signage. The user holds a small wand, to which are attached an electronic compass and a small loudspeaker or vibrator. When the hand is pointing toward some location represented in the computer database, the user hears a tone or feels a vibration. Supplementary verbal information can be provided by synthetic speech. The user moves toward the desired location by aligning the body with the hand while maintaining the "on-course" auditory or vibratory signal. Other variants of the pointer interface involve putting the compass on the body or head and turning the body or head until the on-course signal is perceived. Six published route-guidance studies indicate that spatial displays provide effective route guidance, entail less cognitive load than speech interfaces, and are generally preferred by visually impaired users.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Brunel navigation system for the blind===

Prof. W. Balachandran is the pioneer and the head of GPS research group at [[Brunel University]]. He and his research team are pursuing research on [[navigation]] system for blind and visually impaired people. The system is based on the integration of state of the art current technologies, including high-accuracy GPS positioning, GIS, electronic compass and [[wireless]] [[Digital data|digital]] video [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] (remote vision) facility with an accuracy of 3~4m. It provides an automated guidance using the information from daily updated digital map datasets e.g. roadworks. If required the remote guidance of visually impaired pedestrians by a sighted human guide using the information from the digital map and from the remote video image provides flexibility.

The difficulties encountered include the availability of up to date [[information]] and what information to offer including the navigation [[Communications protocol|protocol]]. Levels of functionality have been created to [[tailor]] the information to the user’s requirements.

===NOPPA===

NOPPA navigation and guidance system was designed to offer public [[transport]] passenger and route information using GPS technology for the visually impaired. This was a three-year (2002~2004) project in VTT Industrial Systems in Finland. The system provides an unbroken trip chain for a pedestrian using buses, commuter trains and trams in three neighbor cities’ area. It is based on an information server concept, which has user-centered and task oriented approach for solving information needs of special needs groups.

In the system, the Information [[Server (computing)|Server]] is an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] between the user and [[Internet]] information systems. It collects, filters and integrates information from different sources and delivers results to the user. The server handles speech recognition and functions requiring either heavy [[calculations]] or data transfer. The data transfer between the server and the client is minimized. The user terminal holds [[speech synthesis]] and most of route guidance.

NOPPA can currently offer basic route planning and navigation services in Finland. In practice, map data can have outdated information or inaccuracies, positioning can be unavailable or inaccurate, or wireless data transmission is not always available.

===Navig===

NAVIG is a multidisciplinary project, with fundamental and applied aspects. The main objective is to increase the autonomy of blind people in their navigation capabilities. Reaching a destination while avoiding obstacles is one of the most difficult issue that blind individuals have to face.&lt;br /&gt; Achieving autonomous navigation will be pursued indoor and outdoor, in known and unknown environments. The project consortium is composed by two research centers in computer sciences specialized in human-machine interaction (IRIT) for handicapped people and in auditory perception, spatial cognition, sound design and augmented reality (LIMSI). Another research center is specialized in human and computer vision (CERCO), and two industrial partners are active in artificial vision (Spikenet Technology) and in pedestrian geolocalisation (Navocap). The last member of the consortium is an educational research center for the visually impaired (CESDV – IJA, Institute of Blind Youth).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== TANIA ===

TANIA is a project founded at the [[University of Stuttgart]], Germany. The hardware is based on GPS and RFID. It allows navigation for blind and deafblind persons with step accuracy. It only works where special maps have been created for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blindnavigationinternational.org/|title=Index (German)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.blindnavigationinternational.org|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wayfinder access===

Wayfinder Access was a GPS solution from the Swedish company Wayfinder Systems AB. This application for Symbian phones was designed especially to work with screen readers, such as Mobile Speak from Code Factory or [[TALKS]] from Nuance Communications and offers text-to-speech technology. It is able to take the special needs of the blind and visually impaired into consideration. Symbian screen reader software offers more than just the reading of the application’s screens, but also supports Braille devices.

Highlights of Wayfinder Access include, but are not limited to:
* Information provided for both pedestrian and vehicular navigation.
* A database of 20 million points of interest.
* Online maps that are regularly updated.
* The "Where am I?" feature that readily gives information about your current location.
* The "What is in my surrounding?" feature that initiates a scan of the immediate area to inform you of street names, intersections and nearby points of interest such as restaurants, banks, and much more.
* The new “Vicinity View” feature that allows you to hear audible references for an area with a scope that you can later adjust based on the radius of the scanned vicinity.
* Feedback on points of Interest (POI), crossings or favorites that can be restricted, prioritized, and presented according to their distance from your location.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
The Wayfinder Access Service was shut down in 2011 after the company was taken over by Vodafone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7631">'''Gas Cluster Ion Beams''' ('''GCIB''') is a technology for nano-scale modification of surfaces. It can smooth a wide variety of surface material types to within an [[angstrom]] of roughness without subsurface damage.  It is also used to chemically alter surfaces through infusion or deposition.

==Process==
Using GCIB a surface is bombarded by a beam of high-energy, nanoscale [[Cluster (physics)|cluster]] [[ion]]s. The clusters are formed when a high pressure gas (approximately 10 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] pressure) expands into a [[vacuum]] (1e-5 atmospheres).  The gas expands [[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]] and cools then [[Condensation|condenses]] into clusters.  The [[Cluster (physics)|cluster]]s are nano-sized bits of crystalline matter with unique properties that are intermediate between the realms of atomic physics and those of solid state physics.  The expansion takes place inside of a nozzle that shapes the gas flow and facilitates the formation of a jet of clusters.  The jet of clusters passes through differential pumping apertures into a region of high vacuum (1e-8 atmospheres) where the clusters are ionized by collisions with energetic [[electron]]s.  The ionized clusters are accelerated electrostatically to very high velocities, and they are focused into a tight beam.

The GCIB beam is then used to treat a surface — typically the treated substrate is mechanically scanned in the beam to allow uniform irradiation of the surface.  [[Argon]] is a commonly used gas in GCIB treatments because it is chemically inert and inexpensive.  Argon forms clusters readily, the atoms in the cluster are bound together with [[Van der Waals forces]].  Typical parameters for a high-energy, Argon GCIB are :  acceleration voltage 30 kV, average cluster size 10,400 atoms, average cluster charge +3.2, average cluster energy 64 [[Electronvolt|keV]], average cluster velocity 6.5 [[Metre per second|km/s]], with a total electrical current of 200 [[Ampere|µA]] or more[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X04002903][http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X05012838].  When an Argon cluster with these parameters strikes a surface, a shallow crater is formed with a diameter of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;nm and a depth of 10&amp;nbsp;nm.  When imaged using [[Atomic force microscope|Atomic Force Microscopy]] (AFM) the craters have an appearance much like craters on planetary bodies[http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1506422] [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X09001025][http://doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2012.11.074]. A typical GCIB surface treatment allows every point on the surface to be struck by many cluster ions, resulting in smoothing of surface irregularities.

Lower energy GCIB treatments can be used to further smooth the surface, and GCIB can be used to produce an atomic level smoothness on both planar and nonplanar surfaces.  Almost any gas can be used for GCIB, and there are many more uses for chemically reactive clusters such as for [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] [[semiconductor]]s (using B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas), cleaning and etching (using NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gas), and for depositing chemical layers.

==Industrial applications==
In industry, GCIB has been used for the manufacture of [[semiconductor device]]s[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X05015661], optical [[thin films]][https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=OIC-2004-MB5], trimming [[Surface Acoustic Wave|SAW]] and [[Thin film bulk acoustic resonator|FBAR]] filter devices [http://www.tel.com/product/spe/mm/UltraTrimmer30.htm], [[Hard drive|fixed disk memory systems]] and for other uses.  GCIB smoothing of high voltage electrodes has been shown to reduce [[field electron emission]], and GCIB treated RF cavities are being studied for use in future high energy [[particle accelerator]]s [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/uploads/cels/papers/P1558.pdf].

Small argon cluster GCIB sources are increasingly used for analytical depth-profiling by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Argon clusters greatly reduce the damage introduced to the specimen during depth-profiling, making it practical to do so for many organic and polymeric materials for the first time. This has greatly extended the range of materials to which XPS (for example) can be applied [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-013-7139-z?no-access=true].

A related technique, with a limited range of applications, using high-velocity carbon [[Fullerene]]s to treat surfaces, has been studied (reference?).

Accelerated Neutral Atoms Beams (ANAB) is a recent variation on GCIB [https://www.exogenesis.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Industrial-Applications-Overview.pdf].  With ANAB the high velocity clusters are heated and evaporated by collisions with thermal energy gas molecules and the charged cluster remnants are deflected out of the beam leaving an intense focused beam of individual fast neutral monomers/atoms.  The monomers are evaporated from the clusters with low thermal energies and they retain the center of mass velocity of the cluster and hence do not move out of the beam before colliding with the surface.  When used to treat a surface, an ANAB beam has nearly the same total energy and velocity of the original GCIB beam but the smoothing effect on the surface is much different as the dispersed impacts of the individual fast atoms is more gentle than that of the clusters.  With ANAB there is even less subsurface damage than with GCIB.  The lack of electrical charge eliminates space-charge defocusing of the beam and static charge buildup on surfaces which is very useful for applications such as semiconductor device manufacturing [http://www.neutralphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SEMICON-West-Exogenesis-07-05-15sm.pdf].

'''Jennifer S. Light''' is Professor of Science, Technology and Society at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].    Light's research investigates the work of technical experts in the political process, with special interest in these figures' influences on US urban history.  Light serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Communication and the [[IEEE]] Annals of the [[History of Computing]].&lt;ref name="communication.northwestern.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/?PID=JenniferLight|title=Faculty - Northwestern University School of Communication|website=www.communication.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An essay by Light from 1999, "When Computers Were Women", discusses an aspect of the history of computers — specifically that women were not credited for their work on the [[ENIAC]] computer, which was America's first electronic computer to automate ballistics computations during World War II. The women built the machine which replaced them, yet their contributions to it were kept out of history.

'''Xcerra Corporation (formerly LTX-Credence Corporation)''' is a semiconductor [[Automatic Test Equipment]] (ATE) vendor, founded in 1976 and headquartered in [[Norwood, MA]] (Greater [[Boston]] area).

The focus of the company is the design and development of ATE for the [[semiconductor]] marketplace, but it distinguished itself in the early days as a provider of functional and parametric testers for discrete component RF products. Today, LTX offers test platforms capable of testing mixed signal (analog &amp; digital) devices.

== History ==
{{More citations needed|date=July 2007}}
LTX was founded by Graham Miller, Roger Blethen, et al. All of the  founders left nearby competitor, [[Teradyne]]. Although never verified, corporate lore holds that the name LTX was an abbreviation for the clarion call of its founders: "Leave Teradyne by Christmas (Xmas)" or possibly "Left Teradyne at Christmas." Others believe that LTX stands for "Linear Test eXcellence", "Linear Test eXperts", or is simply an abbreviation of the word "Electronics".

On June 22, 2008 LTX signed a merger agreement with one of its principal competitors: [[Credence Systems Corporation]]. LTX CEO and President David Tacelli became CEO of merged company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltx.com/ltxxweb.nsf/published/062208release?Open Credence and LTX Sign Merger Agreement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019204556/http://www.ltx.com/ltxxweb.nsf/published/062208release?Open |date=2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2008 LTX and [[Credence Systems Corporation]] completed a merger to form [[LTX-Credence Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=108944&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1192176&amp;highlight= LTX and Credence Complete Merger to Form LTX-Credence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Xcerra Corporation was formed in 2014 following the LTX-Credence acquisition of Everett Charles Technologies (ECT) and Multitest from Dover Corporation in December 2013. Xcerra Corporation is the parent company of four powerful brands that have been supplying innovative products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry for more than 30 years. Xcerra’s four brands are atg-Luther &amp; Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies, LTX-Credence, and Multitest.&lt;ref&gt;http://xcerra.com/corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Unic Capital Management, an affiliate of Chinese private equity fund [[Sino IC Capital]], announced plans to purchase Xcerra in April 2017 for approximately $580 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2017/04/10/semiconductor-test-firm-sells-for-580m-to-chinese.html|title=Semiconductor test firm sells for $580M to Chinese private equity group|last=|first=|date=April 10, 2017|work=Boston Business Journal|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2018 Xcerra terminated the deal due to difficulties securing approval from the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States|Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.]], which oversees deals with the potential for national-security concerns.&lt;ref name="al-muslim"&gt;Aisha Al-Muslim, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/xcerra-calls-off-580-million-deal-amid-scrutiny-1519349186 "Xcerra Calls Off $580 Million Deal Amid Scrutiny,"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leblanc process''' was an early industrial process for the production of ''soda ash'' ([[sodium carbonate]]) used throughout the 19th century, named after its inventor, [[Nicolas Leblanc]].  It involved two stages: production of [[sodium sulfate]] from [[sodium chloride]], followed by reaction of the sodium sulfate with [[coal]] and [[calcium carbonate]] to produce sodium carbonate.  The process gradually became obsolete after the development of the [[Solvay process]].

== Background ==

[[Soda ash]] ([[sodium carbonate]]) and [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]), collectively termed ''alkali'', are vital chemicals in the [[glass]], [[textile]], [[soap]], and [[paper]] industries.  The traditional source of alkali in western Europe had been potash obtained from [[wood]] ashes.  However, by the 13th century, [[deforestation]] had rendered this means of production uneconomical, and alkali had to be imported.  Potash was imported from North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, where large forests still stood. Soda ash was imported from Spain and the Canary Islands, where it was produced from the ashes of [[glasswort]] plants (called [[barilla]] ashes in Spain), or imported from Syria.&lt;ref&gt;"Levantine Alkali Ashes and European Industries", by E. Ashtor &amp; G. Cevidalli, in ''Journal of European Economic History'', year 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The soda ash from glasswort plant ashes was mainly a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In addition in Egypt, naturally occurring sodium carbonate, the mineral [[natron]], was mined from dry lakebeds. In Britain, the only local source of alkali was from [[kelp]], which washed ashore in Scotland and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Clow52"&gt;

''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65-90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiefer"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kiefer, David M.|year=2002|url=http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/11/i01/html/01chemchron.html|title=It was all about alkali|publisher=Today's Chemist at Work|volume=11|issue=1|pages=45–6|accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783, King [[Louis XVI of France]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered a prize of 2400 [[French livre|livres]] for a method to produce alkali from sea salt ([[sodium chloride]]).  In 1791, [[Nicolas Leblanc]], physician to [[Louis Philip II, Duke of Orléans]], patented a solution.  That same year he built the first Leblanc plant for the Duke at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], and this began to produce 320 [[ton]]s of soda per year.&lt;ref name='Aftalion11'&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 11–13 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was denied his prize money because of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Aftalion14"/&gt;

''For more recent history, see [[#Industrial history|industrial history]] below.''

== Chemistry ==
[[File:Leblanc process reaction scheme.svg|thumb|250px|Reaction scheme of the Leblanc process (green = reactants, black = intermediates, red = products)]]
The Leblanc process was a [[Batch production|batch process]] in which sodium chloride was subjected to a series of treatments, eventually producing sodium carbonate.  In the first step, the sodium chloride was heated with [[sulfuric acid]] to produce [[sodium sulfate]] (called the ''salt cake'') and [[hydrogen chloride|hydrogen chloride gas]] according to the [[chemical equation]]

: 2 [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] + [[sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] &amp;rarr; [[sodium sulfate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]

This [[chemical reaction]] had been discovered in 1772 by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]].  Leblanc's contribution was the second step, in which the salt cake was mixed with crushed [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and [[coal]] and fired.  This reaction happens in two parts. First the coal ([[carbon]]) was [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[carbon dioxide]], [[Redox|reducing]] the [[sulfate]] to [[sulfide]]. Second, the calcium and sodium swap their ligands to leave the thermodynamically favorable combination of [[sodium carbonate]] and [[calcium sulfide]]. This mixture is called ''black ash''.

: [[sodium sulfate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2&amp;nbsp;[[carbon|C]] &amp;rarr; [[sodium sulfide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] + 2&amp;nbsp;[[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
: [[sodium sulfide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] + [[calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] &amp;rarr; [[sodium Carbonate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[calcium sulfide|CaS]]

The soda ash was then separated from the black ash by washing it with water.  The wash water was then evaporated to yield solid sodium carbonate.  This extraction process was termed lixiviation.

== Process detail ==

The sodium chloride is initially mixed with  concentrated sulfuric acid  and the mixture exposed to low heat. The hydrogen chloride gas bubbles off and was  discarded to atmosphere before gas absorption towers were introduced. This continues until all that is left is a fused mass. This mass still contains enough chloride to contaminate the later stages of the process. The mass is then exposed to direct flame, which evaporates nearly all of the remaining chloride.&lt;ref name="lenn2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/Chemistry/Hydrochloric-Acid-Sodium-Sulphate.htm|publisher=Lenntech| title=Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Sulphate|accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Alkali Manufacture|volume=1|pages=674–685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coal used in the next step must be low in nitrogen to avoid the formation of [[cyanide]]. The calcium carbonate, in the form of limestone or chalk, should be low in magnesia and silica. The weight ratio of the charge is 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a [[reverberatory furnace]] at about 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="lenn1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/Chemistry/Soda-%20industries.htm|publisher=Lenntech|title=The Soda Industries|accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black-ash product of firing must be lixiviated right away to prevent oxidation of sulfides back to sulfate.&lt;ref name="lenn1" /&gt; In the lixiviation process, the black-ash is completely covered in water, again to prevent oxidation. To optimize the leaching of soluble material, the lixiviation is done in cascaded stages. That is, pure water is used on the black-ash that has already been through prior stages. The liquor from that stage is used to leach an earlier stage of the black-ash, and so on.&lt;ref name="lenn1" /&gt;

The final liquor is treated by blowing [[carbon dioxide]] through it. This precipitates dissolved calcium and other impurities. It also volatilizes the sulfide, which is carried off as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas. Any residual sulfide can be subsequently precipitated by adding [[zinc hydroxide]]. The liquor is separated from the precipitate and evaporated using waste heat from the reverberatory furnace. The resulting ash is then redissolved into concentrated solution in hot water. Solids that fail to dissolve are separated. The solution is then cooled to recrystallize nearly pure sodium carbonate decahydrate.&lt;ref name="lenn1" /&gt;

== Industrial history ==

Leblanc established the first Leblanc process plant in 1791 in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St. Denis]].  However, [[French Revolution]]aries seized the plant, along with the rest of Louis Philip's estate, in 1794, and publicized Leblanc's [[trade secret]]s.  [[Napoleon I]] returned the plant to Leblanc in 1801, but lacking the funds to repair it and compete against other soda works that had been established in the meantime, Leblanc committed [[suicide]] in 1806.&lt;ref name="Aftalion14"/&gt;

By the early 19th century, French soda ash producers were making 10,000 - 15,000 tons annually.  However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process became most widely practiced.&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 14–16 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first British soda works using the Leblanc process was built by [[William Losh|the Losh family of iron founders]] at the [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] works in Walker on the [[River Tyne]] in 1816, but steep British [[tariff]]s on salt production hindered the economics of the Leblanc process and kept such operations on a small scale until 1824.  Following the repeal of the salt tariff, the British soda industry grew dramatically, and the chemical works established by [[James Muspratt]] in [[Liverpool]] and [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], and by [[Charles Tennant]] near [[Glasgow]] became some of the largest in the world.  By 1852, annual soda production had reached 140,000 tons in Britain and 45,000 tons in France.&lt;ref name="Aftalion14"/&gt;  By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.

== Pollution issues ==

The Leblanc process plants were quite damaging to the local environment.  The process of generating salt cake from salt and sulfuric acid released [[hydrogen chloride|hydrochloric acid gas]], and because this acid was industrially useless in the early 19th century, it was simply vented into the atmosphere. Also, an insoluble, smelly solid waste was produced.  For every 8 tons of soda ash, the process produced 5.5 tons of [[hydrogen chloride]] and 7 tons of calcium sulfide waste.  This solid waste (known as galligu) had no economic value, and was piled in heaps and spread on fields near the soda works, where it weathered to release [[hydrogen sulfide]], the toxic gas responsible for the odor of rotten eggs.

Because of their noxious emissions, Leblanc soda works became targets of lawsuits and legislation.  An 1839 suit against soda works alleged, "the gas from these manufactories is of such a deleterious nature as to blight everything within its influence, and is alike baneful to health and property. The herbage of the fields in their vicinity is scorched, the gardens neither yield fruit nor vegetables; many flourishing trees have lately become rotten naked sticks. Cattle and poultry droop and pine away. It tarnishes the furniture in our houses, and when we are exposed to it, which is of frequent occurrence, we are afflicted with coughs and pains in the head ... all of which we attribute to the Alkali works."

In 1863, the British Parliament passed the first of several [[Alkali Act]]s, the first modern [[air pollution]] legislation.  This act allowed that no more than 5% of the hydrochloric acid produced by alkali plants could be vented to the atmosphere.  To comply with the legislation, soda works passed the escaping hydrogen chloride gas up through a tower packed with [[charcoal]], where it was absorbed by water flowing in the other direction.  The chemical works usually dumped the resulting [[hydrochloric acid]] solution into nearby bodies of water, killing [[fish]] and other aquatic life.

The Leblanc process also meant very unpleasant working conditions for the operators.  It originally required careful operation and frequent operator interventions (some involving heavy manual labour) into processes giving off hot noxious chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Russell. Colin Archibald, Chemistry, society and environment: a new history of the British chemical industry, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2000. {{ISBN|0-85404-599-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This improved somewhat later as processes were more heavily mechanised to improve economics and uniformity of product.

By the 1880s, methods for converting the hydrochloric acid to [[chlorine]] gas for the manufacture of [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]ing powder and for reclaiming the sulfur in the calcium sulfide waste had been discovered, but the Leblanc process remained more wasteful and more polluting than the [[Solvay process]].  The same is true when it is compared with the later electrolytical processes which eventually replaced it for chlorine production.

== Obsolescence ==

In 1861, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed a more direct process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone through the use of [[ammonia]].  The only waste product of this [[Solvay process]] was [[calcium chloride]], and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method.  From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the [[Europe]]an continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc-based British soda industry. Additionally the [[Brunner Mond]] Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at [[Winnington]] near [[Northwich]] provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, bleaching powder etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products).  The development of electrolytic methods of [[chlorine]] production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by "gentlemen's' agreements" with Solvay producers.&lt;ref&gt;Reader W J ''Imperial Chemical Industries; A History Volume 1 The Forerunners 1870-1926'' Oxford University Press 1970 SBN 19 215937 2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, 90% of the world's soda production was through the Solvay method, or on the North American continent, through the mining of [[trona]], discovered in 1938, which caused the closure of the last North American Solvay plant in 1986.  The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant closed in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Kiefer"/&gt;  However, because of solubility of the bicarbonate, the Solvay process does not work for the manufacture of [[potassium carbonate]], and the Leblanc process continued in limited use for its manufacture until much later.

== Biodiversity ==

There is a strong case for arguing that Leblanc process waste is the most endangered habitat in the UK, since the waste weathers down to [[calcium carbonate]] and produces a haven for plants that thrive in lime-rich soils, known as [[calcicole]]s. Only four such sites have survived the new millennium; three are protected as local nature reserves of which the largest, at [[Nob End]] near [[Bolton]], is an [[SSSI]] and [[Local Nature Reserve]] - largely for its sparse orchid-calcicole flora, most unusual in an area with acid soils.  This alkaline island contains within it an acid island, where acid boiler slag was deposited, which now shows up as a zone dominated by heather, ''[[Calluna vulgaris]]''.&lt;ref name="shawhalton"&gt;Shaw, PJA &amp; Halton W. (1998). Classic sites: Nob End, Bolton. ''British Wildlife'' 10, 13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leica Geosystems ''' (formerly known as '''[[Wild Heerbrugg]]''' or just '''Wild''') based in eastern [[Switzerland]] produces products and systems for [[surveying]] and geographical measurement ([[geomatics]]). Its products employ a variety of technologies including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellite navigation and [[laser rangefinder]]s to enable users to model existing structures, terrains in computer based systems to high accuracies, often under 1&amp;nbsp;cm.

The brand Leica, better known for its [[Leica Camera|cameras]], was formed on 2 April 1990 after the merger of several companies. In 2005, the company was acquired  by [[Hexagon AB]]. Leica was listed on the Swiss stock exchange until the 7 August 2006 which saw the cancellation of all publicly held registered shares in Leica Geosystems Holdings Ltd and delisting of all listed registered shares of a par value of CHF 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.leica-geosystems.com/corporate/en/news/lgs_360.htm?id=1284 | title = Cancellation of all publicly held registered shares in Leica Geosystems Holdings Ltd and delisting of all listed registered shares of a par value of CHF 50 | publisher = Leica Geosystems | date = 2006-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging is a Strategic Member in the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] since 2008. Strategic Membership is the highest level of membership in the OGC. Strategic Members provide significant resources to support OGC objectives in the form of funding for program initiatives and staff resources inserted into the OGC process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2008-01/9986349-leica-geosystems-geospatial-imaging-takes-strategic-membership-in-the-ogc-r-004.htm Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging Takes Strategic Membership in the OGC(R)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Wild]] (1877–1951) of [[Glarus|Glarus, Switzerland]], a leading designer of geodetic and astronomical instruments, began his career as an apprentice [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]].  In 1908, having invented a military rangefinder and convinced [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] to manufacture it, Wild moved to the city of [[Jena]] and became head of the new Zeiss branch responsible for surveying instruments, GEO.

Wild returned to Switzerland after the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild-heerbrugg.com/History.htm Wild Heerbrugg History]&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1921, with Colonel Jacob Schmidheiny of Balgach and geologist Dr. Robert Helbling of Flums and with the help of Swiss financiers, he founded the ''Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik'' in [[Heerbrugg]] in the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]]. In the early 1930s, having recognized that he was not cut out to be a factory manager, Wild moved to [[Zurich]], severed his connections with the firm in Heerbrugg, and designed instruments for [[Kern &amp; Co]] in Aarau. His old firm became Wild Heerbrugg in 1937.

It merged with the optical firm of [[Ernst Leitz]] of [[Wetzlar]] in 1987, acquired a majority interest in Kern in 1988, was renamed '''Wild Leitz AG''' in 1989, and became part of the Leica holding company in 1990. Starting in 1996, the company was divided gradually into smaller units.  Thus in 1996, [[Leica Camera]] AG was founded, followed in October 1997 by '''Leica Geosystems''' AG, and on April 1, 1998 by [[Leica Microsystems]] AG. The Swedish company [[Hexagon AB]] purchased Leica Geosystems in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.com/hexagon/acquisition-of-outstanding-leica-shares-and-resolution-on-new-issue|title=Hexagon - Press release|publisher=''[[Cision|Cision Wire]]''|accessdate=2005-12-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722190549/http://www.cisionwire.com/hexagon/acquisition-of-outstanding-leica-shares-and-resolution-on-new-issue|archivedate=2012-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today these three companies are all independent public companies. Leica Geosystems produces - in continuation of Wild Heerbrugg - the geodetic instruments and is the global market leader in this section. The main customers of Leica Geosystems are surveyors, manufacturers and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] companies.

In 2000 Leica Geosystems purchased [[Cyrax (HDS system)|Cyra Technologies]], maker of the Cyrax laser 3D scanner line. In April 2001, Leica Geosystems acquired ERDAS, Inc and LH Systems. ERDAS is a remote sensing software firm, while LH Systems was a photogrammetric software firm. These two companies were merged into software company, ERDAS, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=104 |title=Leica Acquires ERDAS, LH Systems; Expands its Focus on the GIS/RS Market |publisher=directionsmag.com |date=2001-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERDAS purchased Acquis, ER Mapper and IONIC in 2007.&lt;!-- dead link ref&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/news/viewn.asp?id=GIS:N_lmefkqrgvs gisdevelopment.net], Retrieved August 27, 2009&lt;/ref --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/press.releases/index.php?duty=Show&amp;id=17885 |title=Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging Acquires IONIC |publisher=directionsmag.com |date=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directionsmag.com/press.releases/index.php?duty=Show&amp;id=17348 |publisher=directionsmag.com |title=Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging Acquires Acquis ADE Technology but not the Acquis organization |date=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded further ERDAS in the remote sensing market, let them enter the enterprise topological GIS market, and expanded their footprint in the image web serving and image enterprise market.

In October 2010, Intergraph was acquired by Hexagon AB. As part of the Hexagon acquisition, Hexagon moved ERDAS from under Leica Geosystems to Intergraph, and Z/I Imaging airborne imaging sensors from under Intergraph to Leica Geosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergraph]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Leica Geosystems Mining announced an exclusive industry partnership with [[Locata Corporation]] to provide the mining industry with the world’s only high precision radio positioning system that is not reliant on GPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constructionequipment.com/leica-geosystems-mininglocata |publisher=Construction Equipment |title=Leica Geosystems Mining/Locata |date=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[government agency|government agencies]] engaged in activities related to [[outer space]] and [[space exploration]]. (There is also a [[List of private spaceflight companies]].)

As of 2018, 72 different government space agencies are in existence; 14 of those have launch capability. Six government space agencies—the [[China National Space Administration]] (CNSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO), the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RFSA or Roscosmos)—have full launch capabilities; these include the ability to launch and recover multiple satellites, deploy cryogenic rocket engines and operate extraterrestrial probes. 

The name given is the English version, with the native language version below. The acronym given is the most common acronym: this can either be the acronym of the English version (e.g. JAXA), or the acronym in the native language. Where there are multiple acronyms in common use, the English one is given first.

The date of the founding of the space agency is the date of first operations where applicable. If the space agency is no longer running, then the date when it was terminated (i.e. the last day of operations) is given. A link to the Agency's primary website is also given.

==Budgets==
The annual budgets listed are the official budgets for national space agencies available in public domain. The budgets are not normalized to the expenses of space research in different countries, i.e. higher budget does not necessarily mean more activity or better performance in space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereport.org/resources/overview/space_budgets.php|title=Global Space Revenues and Budgets|publisher=The Space Report|year=2009|accessdate=2015-12-11|archivedate=2009-11-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128013657/http://www.thespacereport.org/resources/overview/space_budgets.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereport.org/resources/government/intl_budgets.php |title=The Space Report 2011 &amp;#124; Resources |publisher=Thespacereport.org |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712235215/http://www.thespacereport.org/resources/government/intl_budgets.php |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note also that budget could be used for different projects: e.g. GPS is maintained from the US defence budget, whereas ESA's money is used for developing the European Galileo positioning system. The data for authoritarian countries are unreliable. For European contributors to ESA, the national budgets shown include also their contributions to ESA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">A '''loading arm''' permits the transfer of [[liquid]] or liquefied gas from one tank to another through an articulated pipe system consisting of rigid piping and [[swivel joint]]s to obtain [[flexibility]].

Transfer to or from a [[truck]] transported tank or [[rail transport]]ed tank requires a Top Loading Arm or a Bottom Loading Arm.  Transfer to or from a [[ship]] or [[barge]] requires a [[marine loading arm]].

==Top and Bottom loading arm==
* '''''General feature of Top and Bottom loading arms'''''
[[File:Top Loading Arm.jpg|thumb|alt=Un ruban de pellicule de film déroulé|Top loading arms]]
Both types of loading arms are typically made of 3 [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s – respectively called inner arm, outer arm and drop pipe.
The size can be from 2” to 6”. These 3 pipes are connected by swivel joints. Swivel joints are required to provide the flexibility needed. The loading arm unfolds to get the required [[working envelope]] to load or unload the tanker, and the reverse is to retract or get a minimal space for parking or storage.
Both types of loading arms may be mounted on a column or via a plate to an existing wall.
Balancing is needed due to the weight of the [[steel]] piping. Balancing of the arm is made by [[counterweight]] or by a [[spring balance]] cylinder.

=== Top loading arm ===
[[File:Bottom Loading Arm.jpg|thumb|alt=Un ruban de pellicule de film déroulé|Bottom loading arms]]
Top loading arms are used to load or unload road or [[Tank car|rail tanker]]s.
Loading or unloading is done through the [[manhole]] on the top of the tanker.
Depending on the nature of the product (not dangerous, without any toxic vapors…), the connection may be “open”, this means that the manhole is not sealed.
A “Semi-Closed” connection can be made by a cone on the manhole of the tanker.
A “Closed” connection is required for all dangerous and toxic products. This connection is made by a [[flange]] to the top of the tanker.
A cone can be equipped with a vapour hose to prevent the vapors from being released to the atmosphere.
Numerous accessories are available to make a loading arm more [[ergonomic]] and more effective: press down system, pneumatic up/down system, top level control, safety break valve, purge, drain…etc.

=== Bottom loading arm ===
This kind of arm is reserved for the unloading of road/rail tanker from the bottom, at the rear or side.
The location of the connection has an influence on the length of the pipes. As an example, a rear connection requires a longer length of arms than for a side connection.
The connection of this kind of loading arm can be made by flange, thread or by quick connection coupler such as a Dry Disconnect.
There are also a numerous accessories which can be fitted to the Bottom loading arm to make it more ergonomic and more effective as described for the Top loading arm.

== Marine loading arm ==
{{details|marine loading arm}}
To load or unload a ship, a hose or loading arm is needed to follow the movement of the ship due to the dynamics of changing draft, changing [[tide]], [[wind]] and other factors.
A  Marine Loading Arm offers a significant improvement over a hose in the transfer of liquids between vessel and shore because It provides an easier and more ergonomic operation, gives longer  service life and permits Emergency Release Action without any spillage of product and without any [[pollution]].

Like the Top and Bottom loading arm, the Marine Loading Arm is a system consisting of rigid piping and swivel joints to obtain flexibility. The OCIMF ([[Oil Companies International Marine Forum]]) and [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] have established guidelines for matters of strength calculations, working envelope and accessories. However the design of the loading arm is not included in this guideline and left to the individual [[manufacturer]].

* '''''Different design for Marine loading arm'''''
The [[product line]] reposes on a fixed stand post or riser and is connected by an inner and an outer arm – both arms are movable parts. Balancing is needed due to the weight of the steel piping. Balancing of the Marine Loading Arm is done by a rotating counterweight, which is connected to the inner arm and the outer arm via a rigid [[pantograph]].
Small loading arms may be manually operated. The bigger ones are [[Hydraulics|hydraulically]] operated.

The product line can be self supported or mounted on an independent support frame.
Since the swivels are strong enough to absorb the weights of the product line, the liquid in the arms and the forces of the wind, the marine loading arm can be built as a self-supporting structure.
Nowadays marine loading arms can also be built on an independent support frame as is required for [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] and highly [[Corrosive substance|corrosive liquids]].

Recently the design of the marine loading arms has been significantly improved by the [[Symmetry|symmetric]] design. This new concept offers many advantages such as the equal distribution of forces on the swivel joints under all conditions, less force within the structure, reduces the weight of the loading arm, and permits larger working envelopes without requiring significantly stronger [[construction]].
Since the symmetric design has proven its effectiveness and its reliability. The symmetric design is also applicable to marine loading arms requiring an independent support frame.

In [[computing]], '''Machine Check Architecture''' ('''MCA''') is an [[Intel]] mechanism in which the [[CPU]] reports hardware errors to the [[operating system]].

[[Intel]]'s Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, P6 family processors as well as the Itanium architecture implement a machine check architecture that provides a mechanism for detecting and reporting hardware (machine) errors, such as: system bus errors, [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|ECC]] errors, parity errors, [[CPU cache|cache]] errors, and [[translation lookaside buffer]] errors. It consists of a set of model-specific registers ([[Model-specific register|MSR]]s) that are used to set up machine checking and additional banks of MSRs used for recording errors that are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5332">In [[combustion]] engineering and [[explosion]] studies, the '''Markstein number''' characterizes the effect of local heat release of a propagating [[flame]] on variations in the surface topology along the flame and the associated local [[flame front]] curvature. The [[dimensionless]] Markstein number is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = \frac{\mathcal{L}}{\delta_L}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the Markstein length, and &lt;math&gt;\delta_L&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic laminar flame thickness. The larger the Markstein length, the greater the effect of curvature on localised burning velocity. It is named after [[George H. Markstein]] (1911—2011), who showed that thermal diffusion stabilized the curved flame front and proposed a relation between the critical wavelength for stability of the flame front, called the Markstein length, and the thermal thickness of the flame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Clavin–Williams equation==

The Markstein number with respect to the unburnt gas mixture for a one step reaction in the limit of large [[activation energy asymptotics]] was derived by [[Paul Clavin]] and [[Forman A. Williams]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Clavin, Paul, and F. A. Williams. "Effects of molecular diffusion and of thermal expansion on the structure and dynamics of premixed flames in turbulent flows of large scale and low intensity." Journal of fluid mechanics 116 (1982): 251–282.&lt;/ref&gt; The Markstein number then is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_u = \frac{1}{\alpha}\ln \frac{1}{1-\alpha} + \frac{\beta(\mathrm{Le}-1)}{2} \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} \int_0^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat release parameter]] defined with density ratio,
*&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Zel'dovich number]],
*&lt;math&gt;\rm{Le}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lewis number]] of the deficient reactant (either fuel or oxidizer)

and the Markstein number with respect to the burnt gas mixture is derived by Clavin (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Clavin, Paul. "Dynamic behavior of premixed flame fronts in laminar and turbulent flows." Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 11.1 (1985): 1–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_b = \frac{1}{\alpha} \ln \frac{1}{1-\alpha} + \frac{\beta(\mathrm{Le}-1)}{2\alpha}\int_0^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

==Second Markstein number==

In general, Markstein number for the curvature effects &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_c&lt;/math&gt; and strain effects &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_s&lt;/math&gt; are not same in real flames&lt;ref&gt;Clavin, Paul, and Geoff Searby. Combustion Waves and Fronts in Flows: Flames, Shocks, Detonations, Ablation Fronts and Explosion of Stars. Cambridge University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;. In that case, one defines a second Markstein number as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_2=\mathcal{M}_c-\mathcal{M}_s.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Micromirror devices''' are devices based on microscopically small mirrors. The mirrors are [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), which means that their states are controlled by applying a voltage between the two electrodes around the mirror arrays. Digital micromirror devices are used in [[video projector]]s and optics and micromirror devices for light deflection and control.

== Digital Micromirror Devices ==

''→ See main article [[digital micromirror device]]''

Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD) were invented by Texas Instruments in 1987 and are the core of the [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] technology used for video projection. The mirrors are arranged in a matrix and have two states, "on" or "off" (digital). In the on state, light from the projector bulb is reflected into the lens making the pixel appear bright on the screen. In the off state, the light is directed elsewhere (usually onto a [[heatsink]]), making the pixel appear dark. Colours could be produced by various technologies like different light sources or gratings.

== Light Deflection and Control ==

The mirrors could not only be switched between two states, their rotation is in fact continuous. This could be used for controlling the intensity and direction of incident light. One future application is controlling the light in buildings, based on micromirrors between the two panes of [[Insulated glazing]]. The power and direction of the incident light is determined by the mirrors state, which itself is controlled electrostatically.&lt;ref name=""&gt;Viereck, V., Ackermann, J., Li, Q., Jakel, A., Schmid, J. and Hillmer, H., [http://www.ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=4610837&amp;arnumber=4610860&amp;count=87&amp;index=22 ''Sun glasses for buildings based on micro mirror arrays: Technology, control by networked sensors and scaling potential''], Networked Sensing Systems, 2008. INSS 2008. 5th International Conference on, 2008, page 135-139&lt;/ref&gt;

== MEMS Scanning Micromirror ==

A MEMS scanning micromirror consists of a silicon device with a millimeter-scale mirror at the center. The mirror is typically connected to flexures that allow it to oscillate on a single axis or biaxially, to project or capture light.&lt;ref&gt;http://nanophotonics.eecs.berkeley.edu/Publications/Conference/files/4481/Patterson%20et%20al.%20-%202004%20-%20Scanning%20micromirrors%20an%20overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A mounted or bar [[corkscrew]] is a device screwed or clamped to a wall or counter top, used to draw corks from beer, wine or other bottles.

== History ==
Corks have been used to seal jars and bottles for over 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#Cork_closure Closure types]&lt;/ref&gt; (Modern, machine made bottles with threaded tops for [[screw cap (wine)|screw cap]]s date from the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bottlebooks.com/dating%20old%20bottles/dating_bottles_by_their_tops_and.htm Screw caps]&lt;/ref&gt;) Early glass bottles were cumbersome (and possibly dangerous, being hand-blown) to hold, and the simple “T” corkscrew required strength to use.
The first mounted corkscrews, made some time in the mid 1800s, were very simple, consisting of a frame incorporating a bracket that held the bottle down and a metal hook that pulled almost any “T” handled corkscrew up. The [[helix]] or worm was turned into the cork, then the bottle was held with the protruding corkscrew in the frame, with the lever hooked onto it.  Pulling the lever extracted the cork. The [[mechanical advantage]] incorporated into these frames consisted of various types of [[rack and pinion]], [[gear]] or [[lever]] mechanisms.

Turning the worm into the cork and then turning the cork off the worm was a time-consuming process. Eventually, the popularity of bottled beer stopped with corks would necessitate the invention of a faster, simpler method of removing the corks.

== Mechanical mounted corkscrews ==

The first mounted mechanical corkscrews are known as “coffee grinder” or “crank and pump” types.  Introduced in the late 1800s, this invention combined the corkscrew and mechanical advantage in one device.  In most examples the worm was attached to a stem, with a crank, inserted through a frame with a lever.  In most examples the worm was cranked into the cork, and then a lever was pressed or pulled to extract the cork.  Then, the cork was held by hand, and the crank operated in reverse, turning it off the worm. For the most part, this style of corkscrew was confined to the home consumer market. John Bloeser of St. Louis, Missouri patented a floor-stand model of the crank and pump in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US337921 Bloeser patent]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automatic bar corkscrews ==

[[File:Wall-mounted corkscrew 2.jpg|thumb|The screw enters the cork below. When the lever is lifted, the screw is pulled directly up, and then unscrewed from the cork. The freed cork falls out of the hole on the side.]]
Until many years after the invention in 1892&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US468226 Crown cap patent]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[crown cork]]s, beer bottles were stopped with corks.  The increasing popularity of bottled beer created a need for a faster corkscrew. This led to the invention of a variety of “automatic” corkscrew mechanisms patented in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States, England and several European countries.

In 1865, Henry John Sanders of England patented a machine that would hold the bottle, turn the worm into the cork, remove the cork and release it “by one up-and-down motion of a lever or treadle, or by turning a handle or cam.”&lt;ref&gt;Watney, Bernard M. and Homer D. Babbidge. ''Corkscrews for Collectors'' London, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; No example of this invention is known to exist.  The first automatic mounted corkscrew still in existence (two are known) was patented in 1870 by P.F. Lindstrom of Stockholm, Sweden. Weighing over thirty pounds, with 144 different components, it was not commercially viable.

== Mounting methods ==

Mounted corkscrews were originally screwed to a wall (wall mount), clamped to a counter (clamp mount), or screwed to a counter top (top mount).  In recent years, some have been adapted to operate from floor stands.

== Mechanisms:  Stem nut and worm nut ==

The challenge for inventors of automatic corkscrews was to devise a method of turning the worm in both directions, while preventing it from turning during the cork extraction phase of the operation. There are only two practical mechanisms that have been manufactured to cause the worm to turn in an automatic bar corkscrew.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Wayne. ''Compendium of Bar Corkscrews'', Vancouver, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem Nut===

A stem is fastened to the worm and causes the stem to turn by attaching a gear, rack or stem carrier to the threading of the stem and pushing it through a stem-nut. This is the method used by Sanders in his 1865 patent.

===Worm Nut===

The worm is pushed or pulled through a worm nut, causing it to rotate. The first patent for a worm nut was awarded to an American inventor M. Redlinger in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.ca/patents/US589574 Redlinger patent]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patents ==

A vast number of [[Utility (patent)|utility]] and [[design patent]]s were registered for mechanical and automatic mounted and bar corkscrews.  These were manufactured in many countries, but mostly in the United States.  Arcade Manufacturing Co. of Freeport, Illinois held forty-five different patents, from R. Gilchrist’s “Lightning” and  #384,839 (both 1888) to C. Morgan’s “Pix” (1913).  Next came Edwin Walker’s Erie Specialty Co. with sixteen different patents, including three crank and pump variations.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Wayne. ''Compendium of Bar Corkscrews'', Vancouver, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturers and distributors ==

American, German and French bar corkscrews were made of [[cast iron]], often plated with [[nickel]]. The British favoured [[brass]], as did the Spanish.

== Advertising and Names ==

Because the bar corkscrews were mounted on counters in full view of customers, they offered a [[point of sale]] advertisement for breweries, such as [[Anheuser-Busch]], and cigar makers who affixed  private label advertising plates to them.

Like the marketing departments of the auto makers who followed them, the bar corkscrew sales gurus came up with model names to appeal to customers.  Some gave an indication of function (Extractee, Pullmee, Yankee), some of size (Midget, Little Giant, Jumbo) some of strength (Champion, Hero, Invincible, Titan), some of how slickly they worked (Quick &amp; Easy, Simple, Express, Safety, Perfect, Presto, Little Quicker, Schnell, Swift) and some of class (Ritz, Luxury, L’Élégant).  Some were named in a spirit of celebration (New Century, Jubilee, Triumph, Victor).

== History ==
In October 2015, Musk, Altman and other investors announced the formation of the organization, pledging over US$1 billion to the venture.&lt;ref name="bbc-giants" /&gt;

On April 27, 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of “OpenAI Gym”, its platform for [[reinforcement learning]] research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

On December 5, 2016, OpenAI released Universe, a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications&lt;!--AI training ground that spans any software running on any machine, from games to web browsers to protein folders--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/openais-universe-computers-learn-use-apps-like-humans/|title=Elon Musk’s Lab Wants to Teach Computers to Use Apps Just Like Humans Do|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/openais-universe-is-the-fun-parent-every-artificial-intelligence-deserves/|title=OpenAI’s Universe is the fun parent every artificial intelligence deserves|last1=Mannes|first1=John|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://universe.openai.com/|title=OpenAI - Universe|language=en-us|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/05/openai_universe_reinforcement_learning/|title=Elon Musk-backed OpenAI reveals Universe – a universal training ground for computers|last1=Claburn|first1=Thomas|publisher=The Register|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 2018, Musk resigned his board seat, citing “a potential future conflict (of interest)” with [[Tesla Autopilot|Tesla AI development for self driving cars]], but remained a donor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17036214/elon-musk-openai-ai-safety-leaves-board&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, OpenAI is headquartered in [[Mission District, San Francisco|San Francisco's Mission District]], sharing an office building with [[Neuralink]], another company co-founded by Musk.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-neuralink-sought-to-open-an-animal-testing-f-1823167674|title=Elon Musk's Neuralink Sought to Open an Animal Testing Facility in San Francisco|last=Conger|first=Kate|date=|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Infosys]], an IT consulting firm

The group started in early January 2016 with nine researchers. According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Brockman met with [[Yoshua Bengio]], one of the “founding fathers” of the [[deep learning]] movement, and drew up a list of the “best researchers in the field”. Microsoft's [[Peter Lee (computer scientist)|Peter Lee]] stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback prospect. While OpenAI pays corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, it doesn't currently pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google. Nevertheless, Sutskever stated that he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI “partly of because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.” Brockman stated that “the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.” OpenAI researcher [[Wojciech Zaremba]] stated that he turned down “borderline crazy” offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.&lt;ref name=wired_inside /&gt;

==Motives==
Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], believed that if advanced AI someday gains the ability to re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate, an unstoppable “[[intelligence explosion]]” could lead to [[human extinction]].  Musk characterizes AI as humanity's "biggest existential threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anthony Patch|title=Elon Musk   Artificial Intelligence could be our biggest existential threat  720p|date=2018-03-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjcifdMg6s4&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenAI's founders structured it as a non-profit so that they could focus its research on creating a positive long-term human impact.&lt;ref name=bbc-giants&gt;{{cite news|title=Tech giants pledge $1bn for 'altruistic AI' venture, OpenAI|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35082344|accessdate=19 December 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenAI states that “it's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society,” and that it's equally difficult to comprehend “how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly”.&lt;ref name=bbc-giants/&gt; Research on safety cannot safely be postponed: “because of AI's surprising history, it's hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jessica|title=Tech leaders launch nonprofit to save the world from killer robots|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/1214/Tech-leaders-launch-nonprofit-to-save-the-world-from-killer-robots|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenAI states that AI “should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible...”&lt;ref name=bbc-giants/&gt;, and which sentiment has been expressed elsewhere in reference to a potentially enormous class of AI-enabled products: "Are we really willing to let our society be infiltrated by autonomous software and hardware agents whose details of operation are known only to a select few? Of course not." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/2/15|author=Glenn W. Smith|date=10 April 2018|title=Re: Sex-Bots—Let Us Look before We Leap|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7020015|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-chair Sam Altman expects the decades-long project to surpass human intelligence.&lt;ref name=wired_far_more&gt;{{cite news|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Elon Musk’s Billion-Dollar AI Plan Is About Far More Than Saving the World|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/elon-musks-billion-dollar-ai-plan-is-about-far-more-than-saving-the-world/|accessdate=19 December 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=15 December 2015|quote=“Altman said they expect this decades-long project to surpass human intelligence.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vishal Sikka]], former CEO of [[Infosys]], stated that an “openness” where the endeavor would “produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity” was a fundamental requirement for his support, and that OpenAI “aligns very nicely with our long-held values” and their “endeavor to do purposeful work”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Vishal Sikka]]|title=OpenAI: AI for All|url=http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|website=InfyTalk|publisher=[[Infosys]]|accessdate=22 December 2015|date=14 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094518/http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cade Metz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' suggests that corporations such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] may be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] that own enormous supplies of proprietary data. Altman states that [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] companies will share their data with OpenAI.&lt;ref name=wired_far_more/&gt;

==Strategy==
Musk posed the question: “what is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity.” Musk acknowledged that “there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about”; nonetheless, the best defense is “to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower.”&lt;ref name="seattle-investors"&gt;{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley investors to bankroll artificial-intelligence center|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|accessdate=19 December 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk and Altman's counter-intuitive strategy of trying to reduce the risk that AI will cause overall harm, by giving AI to everyone, is controversial among those who are concerned with [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk from artificial intelligence]]. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] is skeptical of Musk's approach: “If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone.”&lt;ref name=wired_inside&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cade Metz|title=Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=[[Wired magazine]]|date=27 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2016 conversation about the technological singularity, Altman said that “we don’t plan to release all of our source code” and mentioned a plan to “allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board”. Greg Brockman stated that “Our goal right now... is to do the best thing there is to do. It’s a little vague.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sam Altman’s Manifest Destiny|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=The New Yorker|issue=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this adversarial learning process, the agents learn how to adapt to changing conditions; when an agent is then removed from this virtual environment and placed in a new virtual environment with high winds, the agent braces to remain upright, suggesting it had learned how to balance in a generalized way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AI Sumo Wrestlers Could Make Future Robots More Nimble|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-sumo-wrestlers-could-make-future-robots-more-nimble/|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=Wired|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OpenAI’s Goofy Sumo-Wrestling Bots Are Smarter Than They Look|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609117/openais-goofy-sumo-wrestling-bots-are-smarter-than-they-look/|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenAI's Igor Mordatch argues for that competition between agents can create an intelligence “arms race” that can increase an agent's ability to function, even outside the context of the competition.

=== Debate Game ===
In 2018, OpenAI launched the Debate Game, which teaches machines to debate toy problems in front of a human judge. The purpose is to research whether such an approach may assist in auditing AI decisions and in developing [[explainable AI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/05/04/openais-debate-game-teaches-you-and-your-friends-how-to-lie-like-robots/|title=OpenAI's Debate Game teaches you and your friends how to lie like robots|last=Greene|first=Tristan|date=2018-05-04|work=The Next Web|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Scientists Think AI Systems Should Debate Each Other |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40569116/why-scientists-think-ai-systems-should-debate-each-other |accessdate=2 June 2018 |work=Fast Company |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''post hole digger''' is a tool used to dig narrow holes to install posts, such as for [[fence]]s and [[signpost|signs]].

There are different kinds of post hole diggers. A '''post hole pincer''' (pictured) is jabbed into the ground in the open position until the blades are buried. At that point the handles are pulled apart to close the tool and grab the chunk of soil loosened. They are then pulled out of the ground with the chunk of soil. The process is repeated until the hole is deep enough, or until the hole is so deep and narrow that the handles can no longer be pulled apart fully. This is one of the weaknesses of this kind of post hole digger.

There are also [[auger (drill)|auger]] type post hole diggers. These are generally easier to use, and they can be used to a much greater depth, as the hole can be dug as deep as the entire length of the shaft.  More importantly, they form a much neater hole, with a well-defined circumference. However, the very fact that the person doing the digging is [[guarantee]]d a perfect hole with an auger post hole digger is also its greatest weakness:  any given auger style post hole digger can only dig one size hole—a hole with the same diameter as the auger's screw.

[[File:Woodchips for paper production.jpg|thumb|Woodchips for paper production]]
A '''pulp mill''' is a manufacturing facility that converts wood chips or other [[Fibre crop|plant fibre source]] into a thick [[fibre board]] which can be shipped to a [[paper mill]] for further processing.  [[Wood pulp|Pulp]] can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods ([[kraft process|kraft]] and [[sulfite process|sulfite]] processes).  The finished product may be either [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.

[[Wood]] and other plant materials used to make pulp contain three main components (apart from water): [[cellulose]] [[fibres]] (desired for [[paper]]making), [[lignin]] (a three-dimensional polymer that binds the [[cellulose]] fibres together) and [[hemicellulose]]s, (shorter branched [[carbohydrate]] polymers).  The aim of pulping is to break down the bulk structure of the fibre source, be it chips, stems or other plant parts, into the constituent fibres.

Chemical pulping achieves this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules which can be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another.  Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres.  Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. Related hybrid pulping methods use a combination of chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres.  These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping (TMP) and chemithermomechanical pulping (CTMP).  The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.

==The mill==
[[Image:InternationalPaper6413.jpg|thumb|[[International Paper]] Company, pulp mill]]
Much of the information about the technology in following subsections is from the book by C.J. Biermann.&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Essentials of Pulping and Papermaking |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemistry of the various pulping processes can be found in Sjöström's book.&lt;ref name="eero"&gt;{{cite book |author= Eero Sjöström |title= Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |location=San Diego |publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 1993 |isbn=0-12-647481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation of fibre source===
The most common fibre source for pulp mills is [[pulpwood]]. Other common sources are [[bagasse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rainey |first1=Thomas |last2=Covey |first2=Geoff |title=Sugarcane-based Biofuels and Bioproducts: Pulp and Paper Production from Sugarcane Bagasse |date=16 May 2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1118719913 |page=259 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ORDRCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;ots=bDgYshu96E&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fibre crops. The first step in all mills using wood (trees) as the fibre source is to remove the [[bark (botany)|bark]]. Bark contains relatively few usable fibres and darkens the pulp. The removed bark is burned, along with other unusable plant material, to generate [[steam]] to run the mill. Almost all wood is then [[woodchipping|chipped]] before being processed further in order to free the fibres.

Removal of the bark is done in a ''barker'' (or ''debarker''). The bark adhesion is about 3–5&amp;nbsp;kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the growing season (summer) and 2-3 times higher in the dormant season (winter). The bark of frozen logs is even more difficult to remove.

In chemical pulp mills, the bark introduces unwanted contaminants such as [[calcium]], [[silica]] and [[aluminium]] that cause [[fouling|scaling]] and give an extra loading for the chemical recovery system. Birch bark contains [[betulin]], a [[terpenoid]] that easily creates deposits in a pulp mill.

===Mechanical pulp mills===
The earliest mills used sandstone grinding rollers to break up small wood logs called "bolts", but the use of natural stone ended in the 1940s with the introduction of manufactured stones with embedded [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminum oxide]]. The pulp made by this process is known as "stone groundwood" pulp (SGW). If the wood is ground in a pressurized, sealed grinder the pulp is classified as "pressure groundwood" (PGW) pulp. Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called "refiner mechanical" pulp (RMP), if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called "thermomechanical" pulp (TMP). Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibers. Mechanical pulp mills use large amounts of energy, mostly electricity to power motors which turn the grinders. A rough estimate of the electrical energy needed is  10,000 mega[[joule]]s (MJ) per [[tonne]] of pulp (2,750&amp;nbsp;[[kWh]] per [[tonne]])

===Chemical pulp mills===
[[Image:Zellstoffwerk Rosenthal 4.jpg|thumb|Pulp mill at [[Blankenstein]] ([[Germany]])]]
{{Main|Kraft process|Sulfite process|Soda pulping}}
Chemical pulping processes such as the [[Kraft process|kraft]] (or sulphate) process and the [[sulfite process]] remove much of the hemicelluloses and lignin.  The kraft process does less damage to the cellulose fibres than the [[sulfite process]], thereby producing stronger fibres, but the sulfite process makes pulp that is easier to bleach.  The chemical pulping processes use a combination of high temperature and alkaline (kraft) or acidic (sulfite) chemicals to break the chemical bonds of the lignin.

The material fed into the digester must be small enough to allow the pulping liquor to penetrate the pieces completely. In the case of wood, the logs are chipped and the chips screened so that what is fed to the digester is a uniform size. The oversize chips are rechipped or used as fuel, sawdust is burned.  The screened chips or cut plant material ([[bamboo]], [[kenaf]], etc.) goes to the [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]] where it is mixed with an aqueous solution of the pulping chemicals, then heated with steam. In the kraft process the pulping chemicals are [[sodium hydroxide]] and [[sodium sulphide]] and the solution is known as white liquor. In the sulfite process the pulping chemical is a mixture of metal (sodium, magnesium, potassium or calcium) and [[ammonium sulfite]] or sulphite.
 
After several hours in the digester, the chips or cut plant material breaks down into a thick porridge-like consistency and is "blown" or squeezed from the outlet of the digester through an airlock.  The sudden change in pressure results in a rapid expansion of the fibres, separating the fibres even more.  The resulting fibre suspension in water solution is called "brown stock".

Brown stock washers, using [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent]] flow, remove the spent cooking chemicals and degraded lignin and hemicellulose. The extracted liquid, known as [[black liquor]] in the kraft process, and red or brown liquor in the sulfite processes, is concentrated, burned and the sodium and sulphur compounds recycled in the recovery process. [[Lignosulphonates]] are a useful byproduct recovered from the spent liquor in the sulfite process.&lt;ref name="ligno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lignin.org/whatis.html|title=Uses of lignosulphonates|accessdate=2007-10-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009004745/http://www.lignin.org/whatis.html|archivedate=2007-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clean pulp (stock) can be [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] in the bleach plant or left unbleached, depending on the end use. The stock is sprayed onto the pulp machine wire, water drains off, more water is removed by pressing the sheet of fibres, and the sheet is then dried. At this point the sheets of pulp are several millimetres thick and have a coarse surface: it is not yet paper. The dried pulp is cut, stacked, bailed and shipped to another facility for whatever further process is needed.

Bleached kraft pulp and bleached sulfite pulp are used to make high quality, white printing paper. One of the most visible uses for unbleached kraft pulp is to make brown paper shopping bags and wrapping paper where strength is particularly important. A special grade of bleached sulfite pulp, known as dissolving pulp, is used to make cellulose derivatives such as [[methylcellulose]] which are used in a wide range of everyday products from [[laxatives]] to [[baked goods]] to [[wallpaper paste]].

===Chemi-mechanical pulp mills===
Some mills pretreat wood chips or other plant material like straw with [[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium hydroxide]], [[sodium sulfite]], and other chemical prior to refining with equipment similar to a mechanical mill. The conditions of the chemical treatment are much less vigorous (lower temperature, shorter time, less extreme pH) than in a chemical pulping process, since the goal is to make the fibers easier to refine, not to remove lignin as in a fully chemical process. Pulps made using these hybrid processes are known as chemi-thermomechanical pulps (CTMP). Sometimes a CTMP mill is located on the same site as a kraft mill so that the effluent from the CTMP mill can be treated in the kraft recovery process to regenerate the inorganic pulping chemicals.

==Scheduling in pulp mills==
The pulp process involves many production stages, usually coupled with intermediate storage tanks. As each stage has a different reliability and bottlenecks may vary from day to day, scheduling a pulp mill needs to take into account these bottlenecks and the probability of a disturbance or breakdown.&lt;ref name=Gunnarsson2008&gt;Gunnarsson, H., Rönnqvist, M. (2008). ''Solving a multi-period supply chain problem for a pulp company using heuristics - an application to Södra Cell ab''.  International Journal of Production Economics 116 (1): 75-94&lt;/ref&gt; Each stage also may have different decision variables, such as steam / water / chemical input, etc. Finally, scheduling needs to consider fuel optimisation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, because part of the energy requirements may be met from fossil-fuel boilers.&lt;ref name=Klugman2009&gt;Klugman, S., Karlsson, M., Moshfegh, B. (2009). ''A Swedish integrated pulp and paper mill energy optimisation and local heat cooperation''.  Energy Policy 37 (7): 2514-2524&lt;/ref&gt; The overall aim is to maximise production at minimum cost.

'''SMS ''Magdeburg''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Magdeburg''"){{efn|name=SMS|}} was a [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Magdeburg|cruiser|4}} of [[light cruiser]]s in the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy). Her class included three other ships: {{SMS|Breslau||2}}, {{SMS|Strassburg||2}}, and {{SMS|Stralsund||2}}. ''Magdeburg'' was built at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] from 1910 to August 1912, when she was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]]. The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] and had a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}. ''Magdeburg'' was used as a torpedo test ship after her commissioning until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, when she was brought to active service and deployed to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].

In the Baltic, ''Magdeburg'' fired the first shots of the war against the Russians on 2 August, when she shelled the port of [[Liepāja|Libau]]. She participated in a series of bombardments of Russian positions until late August. On the 26th, she participated in a sweep of the entrance to the [[Gulf of Finland]]; while steaming off the Estonian coast, she ran aground off the island of [[Odensholm]] and could not be freed. A pair of Russian cruisers appeared and seized the ship. Fifteen crew members were killed in the brief engagement. They recovered three intact German code books, one of which they passed to the British. The ability to decrypt German wireless signals provided the British with the ability to ambush German units on several occasions during the war, including the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The Russians partially scrapped ''Magdeburg'' while she remained grounded before completely destroying the wreck.

==Design==
{{main|Magdeburg class cruiser}}

''Magdeburg'' was ordered under the contract name "''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Bussard||2}}"{{efn|name=provisional names}} and was laid down at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in 1910 and launched on 13 May 1911, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 20 August 1912.&lt;ref name=G107&gt;Gröner, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was {{convert|138.7|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.5|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.4|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|4570|t|abbr=on}} at full combat load.&lt;ref name=G108&gt;Gröner, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[AEG]]-Vulcan [[steam turbine]]s driving two {{convert|3.4|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|25000|shp|lk=in}}, but reached {{convert|33482|shp|abbr=on}} in service. These were powered by sixteen coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s, although they were later altered to use [[fuel oil]] that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}. ''Magdeburg'' carried {{convert|1200|t|LT}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|106|t|LT}} of oil that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|5820|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. She had a crew of 18 officers and 336 enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G1078&gt;Gröner, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft.&lt;ref name=C159&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The guns had a maximum elevation of 30&amp;nbsp;degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to {{convert|12700|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; They were supplied with 1,800 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]]. She could also carry 120 [[naval mine|mines]]. The ship was protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to 60&amp;nbsp;mm thick armor plate.&lt;ref name=G107/&gt;

==Service history==
After her commissioning, ''Magdeburg'' was used as a torpedo test ship. Following the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, she was assigned to the [[Baltic Sea]],&lt;ref name=G107/&gt; under the command of Rear Admiral [[Robert Mischke]]. ''Magdeburg'' fired the first shots of the war with Russia on 2 August when she shelled the Russian port of [[Liepāja|Libau]] while {{SMS|Augsburg||2}} laid a minefield outside the harbor. The Russians had in fact already left Libau, which was seized by the German Army. The minefield laid by ''Augsburg'' was poorly marked and hindered German operations more than Russian efforts. ''Magdeburg'' and the rest of the Baltic forces then conducted a series of bombardments of Russian positions, including one ten days later, on 12 August, where ''Magdeburg'' shelled the [[Kalana, Hiiu County|Dagerort]] [[Ristna Lighthouse|lighthouse]]. On 17 August, ''Magdeburg'', ''Augsburg'', three [[destroyer]]s, and the [[minelayer]] {{SMS|Deutschland|1914|2}} encountered a pair of powerful Russian [[armored cruiser]]s, {{ship|Russian cruiser|Admiral Makarov|1906|2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Gromoboi||2}}. The Russian commander, under the mistaken assumption that the German armored cruisers {{SMS|Roon||2}} and {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}} were present, did not attack and both forces withdrew.&lt;ref name=H184&gt;Halpern, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-B2501, Kleiner Kreuzer Magdeburg.jpg|thumb|''Magdeburg'' aground off [[Odensholm]]]]
[[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich]], the overall commander of the Baltic naval forces, replaced Mischke with Rear Admiral Behring. Behring ordered another operation for 26 August to sweep for Russian reconnaissance forces in the entrance to the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Early that morning, ''Magdeburg'' ran aground off the lighthouse at [[Odensholm]] on the Estonian coast. Her escorting destroyer, {{SMS|V.26||2}}, attempted to pull her free but was unable to do so and began taking off part of ''Magdeburg''{{'}}s crew. While the evacuation was going on, the Russian cruisers {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bogatyr||2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pallada|1906|2}} appeared and shelled the stranded cruiser.&lt;ref name=H184/&gt; The Germans destroyed the forward section of the ship, but could not complete her destruction before the Russians reached the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen crew members from ''Magdeburg'' were killed in the attack.&lt;ref name=G107/&gt; The German code books were also not destroyed; the Russians were able to recover three of the books along with the current encryption key. They passed one copy to the British [[Royal Navy]] via a pair of Russian couriers on 13 October.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Navy partially scrapped the ship [[in situ]] and eventually destroyed the wreck.&lt;ref name=G107/&gt;

The capture of the code books proved to provide a significant advantage for the Royal Navy. The [[Admiralty]] had recently created a deciphering department known as [[Room 40]] to process intercepted German wireless signals. With the code books and cipher key, the British were able to track the movements of most German warships; this information could be passed on to the Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], the commander of the [[Grand Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the British to ambush parts of or the entire German fleet on several occasions, most successfully at the Battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] in January 1915 and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] in May 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, pp. 151, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selection and amplification binding assay (SAAB)''' is a [[molecular biology]] technique typically used to find the [[DNA]] binding site for [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Blackwell_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[T. Keith Blackwell]] and [[Harold M. Weintraub]] in 1990.

== Method ==

SAAB experimental procedure consists of several steps, depending upon the knowledge available about the binding site. A typical SAAB consists of the following steps:

# Synthesis of template with random sequence in binding site: three situations are possible: (i) when both the binding site and the protein are known and available; (ii) when only a consensus binding site is available and the binding protein is not; and (iii) when the protein is available, but the binding site is unknown. When the binding site is not known, the number of random nucleotide positions in the template must be large.
# Incubate labeled double stranded template with protein: usually the protein has to be synthesized in a host cell with fusion techniques. Longer incubation time and large quantity are provided in case of an unspecific binding site.&lt;ref name="Amendt_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amendt BA, Sutherland LB, Russo AF | title = Transcriptional antagonism between Hmx1 and Nkx2.5 for a shared DNA-binding site | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 17 | pages = 11635–42 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10206974 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.17.11635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Isolate the DNA bound protein by EMSA: the DNA bound protein, migrated in acrylamide gel, is isolated by autoradiography as per an [[Electrophoretic mobility shift assay]] (EMSA) protocol.&lt;ref name="Rienhoff_1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rienhoff HY | title = Identification of a transcriptional enhancer in a mouse amyloid gene | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 264 | issue = 1 | pages = 419–25 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2909529 | doi = | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/264/1/419.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Amplify the bound template by PCR. For positive control, amplify the starting template also; The bound DNA is isolated via gel excision, purified, and amplified using PCR.
# Label amplified binding site and reselect for binding by EMSA. Precede the binding step at least for 5 times with the amplified labeled DNA sample and fusion protein.
# [[DNA sequencing|Sequence the DNA]]: After final step of selection and electrophoresis, clone the DNA into a cloning vector and sequence it. Originally Blackwell used Pyro sequencing, which can be replaced by modern techniques.&lt;ref name="Kim_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TG, Kraus JC, Chen J, Lee Y | title = JUMONJI, a critical factor for cardiac development, functions as a transcriptional repressor | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 43 | pages = 42247–55 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12890668 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M307386200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications  ==

=== Quox homeodomain  ===

Quox1 is a [[homeobox]] gene involved in the regulation of patterns of development ([[morphogenesis]]) in animals, fungi and plants and was originally isolated from cDNA library of five week [[quail]] embryo. It is the only gene in the hox family that has been found to express in both [[prosencephalon]] and [[mesencephalon]] involved in the differentiation of the central and peripheral nerve cells. The optimal DNA binding site for Quox1 or its mammalian homologs was identified by SAAB in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;not sourced [6]&lt;/ref&gt; The amplified Quox1  DNA fragment obtained from PCR amplification from a human embryo cDNA librarywas digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the SmaI and XhoI restriction site of the expression vector pGEMEXxBal. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 and Quox1 fusion proteins were isolated by chromatographic techniques.

The radio labeled probe was incubated with 25 pmol of purified Quox1 homeodomain fusion protein in binding buffer for EMSA. The protein bound DNA was detected by autoradiography, and the bands representing protein–DNA complexes were excised from the gel and the eluted DNA were amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the 20 bp nonrandom flanking sequences. After 5 set of the same procedure,the purified DNA was cloned into pMD 18T and sequenced. Finally the sequence {{DNA sequence|CAATC}} was identified as the consensus binding sequence for Quox1 homeodomain.

=== Screening ===

By combining the power of random-sequence selection with pooled sequencing, the SAAB imprint assay makes possible simultaneous screening of a large number of binding site mutants.&lt;ref&gt;not sourced [7]&lt;/ref&gt; SAAB also allows the identification of sites with high relative binding affinity since the competition is inherent in the protocol. It can also identify site positions that are neutral or specific bases that can interfere with binding, such as a T at - 4 in the E47 half-site.&lt;ref&gt;not sourced [8]&lt;/ref&gt; We can apply the technique to less affinity binding sequence also, provided to keep high concentration of binding protein at each step of binding. It is also possible to identify the binding site even if both the protein and sequence is not known.&lt;ref name="Blackwell_1990" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">In the economics of [[Extraction of petroleum|petroleum extraction]], the term '''shale band''' refers to the range of [[Price of oil|global oil prices]] that can support current levels of United States [[shale oil extraction]] via [[hydraulic fracturing]] techniques.

==Price range==
The term was defined on May 8, 2015 by Olivier Jakob, the director of Petromatrix, a Swiss-based consultancy company that publishes a daily note on the oil markets. Petromatrix described the shale band as a price range between $45 and $65 per barrel for [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil. Below $45 per barrel, production of US shale oil would fall sharply, and above $65 production would surge. According to Olivier Jakob, the price of crude oil would, therefore, remain within that range as long as the US remained the [[swing producer]] of crude oil in an environment where [[OPEC]] is producing at capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21651267-american-shale-firms-are-now-oil-markets-swing-producers-after-opec|title=After OPEC|date=2015-05-16|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the shale band was subsequently verified in the market action of 2015 and the Wall Street Journal characterized the shale band as one of the key terms and phrases from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/01/01/year-in-review-the-terms-and-phrases-from-2015/|title=Year in Review: The Terms and Phrases From 2015|last=Grocer|first=Stephen|newspaper=WSJ|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now widely used in by the financial press and market analysts to describe the price action of oil during over the year of 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/if-oil-prices-have-hit-bottom-the-top-may-not-be-too-far-away|title=If Oil Prices Have Hit Bottom, the Top May Not Be Too Far Away|date=2016-03-15|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/can-oil-break-out-of-its-narrow-band-anytime-soon-cm669378|title=Can Oil Break Out Of Its Narrow Band Anytime Soon?|date=2016-08-24|newspaper=NASDAQ.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/4001899-production-freeze-put-oil-markets-daily|title=The Production Freeze 'Put' - Oil Markets Daily|last=HFI|date=2016-08-24|newspaper=Seeking Alpha|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price reference used by Petromatrix for the shale band is based on the [[CME Group|CME]] WTI [[futures contract]] for the month of December of the next calendar year, a contract also known as the Red December contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3069">'''Sheet explosives''' are materials formed by combining an [[explosive]] with a "rubberizer"—a flexible binding agent.  The resulting compound is cast into a flat sheet which is typically pliable and deformable over a wide range of temperature.  Typical products are generally shock-insensitive [[secondary explosives]], requiring a [[blasting cap]] or other [[detonator]].

[[Explosive velocity|Detonation velocities]] are frequently very high, which can improve the detonation synchronicity across the area of a [[tertiary charge]] with a low detonation velocity.  This property makes them suitable for use in detonation trains which require precise timing and homogeneous delivery of force across a complex surface (but see also [[shaped charge]] for an orthogonal technique).

== Applications: As a Main Charge ==

=== Magnetic flux compression generator ===

In an '''explosively-pumped magnetic flux compression generator''', explosives are used to accelerate the plates of a large capacitor at each other, while the capacitor has a charge.  The result is a colossal spike in amperage that can be used, in a typical application, to fire a [[railgun]] for kinetic effects or a [[Electromagnetic pulse|transient electromagnetic munition]] for [[electronic warfare]] applications.  For maximum amperage, the plates must remain parallel as they accelerate towards each other; high detonation velocity is required.  In typical designs, however, the capacitor is not made from two flat plates, but from two concentric cylinders.  Therefore, sheet explosives simplify construction.  The reference cited for this section demonstrates a railgun design using [[Detasheet]] C as the sheet explosive.&lt;ref name="Hawke"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Explosive welding]]
* [[Explosive forming]]

=== Rocketry ===
(references pending)
Rocket engines have been created out of a large number of sequentially-fired "stages" of sheet explosive discs.  (This approach is a rough conventional-explosive analogue to the [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] nuclear rocket, although with many more explosions per second.)  Note that this differs from a [[pulsed detonation rocket]] because the fuel consists solely of pre-positioned solid explosives.

The primary advantages of the technique are reliability, stable long-term storage, and the complete absence of any moving parts or pumps for fuel delivery—the design is merely a set of alternating disks of explosives and delayed primers.

== Applications: As a Boosting Charge ==

(section pending)

== Example Materials ==

* [[Detasheet]] (legacy; used in 1980s MFCG/railgun experiments, among others)
* [[Primasheet]] (in service as of 2013)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2599">[[File:Spurtle.jpg|thumb|right|67px|A 28cm (11 inch) spurtle, with decorated end resembling a Scottish [[thistle]]]]
The '''spurtle''' (or "spurtel", "spurtil", "spirtle" or "spartle")&lt;ref name="DSL" /&gt; is a wooden [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish]] kitchen tool, dating from the fifteenth century, that is used to stir [[porridge]], [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s and [[broth]]s.&lt;ref name="PorridgeLady" /&gt;

The rod-like shape means that porridge can be stirred without congealing and forming lumps,&lt;ref name="PorridgeLady" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NT_2007" /&gt; unlike a spoon that would have a dragging effect during stirring, and the low surface area reduces the chances of porridge sticking to the instrument.&lt;ref name="PorridgeLady" /&gt;

Spurtles are made from wood, including [[beech]], [[cherry wood]], and [[maple]]. They come in a range of sizes. Traditional spurtles have thistles at the top, while modern ones often have a smooth taper.&lt;ref name="PorridgeLady" /&gt;

The custom is that a spurtle should be used to stir in a [[clockwise]] direction with the right hand.&lt;ref name="PorridgeLady" /&gt;

== Couthie spurtle ==
Early spurtles were flat, wooden or metal instruments, with long handles and flat blades.&lt;ref name="DSL" /&gt; The spatula-like utensils, known as 'Couthie Spurtles,' can be used for flipping [[oatcakes]] or making [[pancake]]s - but not for making porridge.&lt;ref name="PorridgeLady" /&gt;

The '''THUMS Islands''' or '''Astronaut Islands''' are a set of four [[artificial islands]] in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]] off the coast of [[Long Beach, California]]. They were built in 1965 to tap into the East [[Wilmington Oil Field]]. The landscaping and sound walls were designed to camouflage the operation and reduce noise, and they are the only decorated oil islands in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kathy Strong2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kathy Strong|first=Kathy|title=Southern California Off the Beaten Path, 7th (Off the Beaten Path Series)|edition=7th|year=2007|publisher=Globe Pequot|location=Guilford, Conn|isbn=0-7627-4429-4|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 1964 court case that gave the state of California mineral rights to the area,&lt;ref name="sidel" /&gt; the islands were built at an estimated cost of $22 million in 1965,&lt;ref name="300M"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil Pumping Mark Reached in Long Beach|last=Ruhlow|first=Jerry|date=29 March 1974|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=F23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-laoil-20100718,0,634353.story|title=Los Angeles oil history runs deep|last=Reynolds|first=Chris|date=19 July 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the islands were operated by THUMS, a consortium named after the parent companies who bid for the island contract: [[Texaco]], [[Humble Oil|Humble]] (now [[Exxon]]), [[Unocal|Union Oil]], [[Mobil]], and [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of OECON IV, Offshore Exploration Converence 1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZZTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=THUMS+long+beach&amp;dq=THUMS+long+beach&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fOFFTem9MoqksQPK38hQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|accessdate=31 January 2010|year=1969|publisher=University of Michigan|oclc= 41657854}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rim of the islands are made of 640,000 tons of boulders from [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]], and the islands were then filled with 3.2 million cubic yards of dredged material from the bay.&lt;ref name="sidel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schoch" /&gt; The islands contain significant landscaping, a waterfall, and tall structures concealing the [[drilling rig]]s, including one known as The Condo and mistaken for "a ritzy hotel" by those on land.&lt;ref name="sidel"&gt;{{cite news|title=HIDDEN TREASURE: You can't see them, but Long Beach oil wells earn big profits for energy giants and the state|last=Sidel|first=Robin|date=26 November 1994|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schoch" /&gt; The structures are lit by colored lights at night.

In 1975, the state of California and the city of Long Beach sued the THUMS oil companies for artificially depressing oil prices. A federal jury cleared Exxon of all charges, and the other four oil companies settled out of court for "hundreds of millions of dollars".&lt;ref name="sidel" /&gt;

[[File:THUMS oil island (4270970590).jpg|thumb|THUMS oil island White in 2010]]
The islands and operation were purchased by [[Occidental Petroleum]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="oxy" /&gt; In 2014, Occidental Petroleum spun off all California assets into California Resources Corporation (CRC), who still owns and operates THUMS Islands as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Olabi |first1=Nora |title=Occidental Petroleum completes California spin-off |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2014/12/01/occidental-petroleum-completes-california-spin-off.html |accessdate=31 May 2018 |agency=American City Business Journals |publisher=Houston Business Journals |date=Dec 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, they have been known as the Astronaut Islands, having been renamed in honor of four American [[astronauts]] who lost their lives in the service of [[NASA]].

Sinclair, with leading USA military officials and aviators in Washington, DC's military departments' area, ''The Air-Scout'', November 1910.]]

The '''United States Aeronautical Reserve (U.S.A.R.)''' &lt;ref&gt;"An Army of the Air: The Inauguration of the United States Aeronautical Reserve and the Plans that Have Been Made for the Aerial Scouting Force" ''Harper's Week'', pages 10-11. January 14, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;  was an early aviation organization created by [[Harvard University]]’s Aero Club on September 8, 1910.  The founder was John H. Ryan, and the General Secretary Richard R. Sinclair.  The earliest aviators and others to enroll near the founding date were: “Glen H. Curtiss, Wilbur Wright, Harry S. Harkness,  Augustus Post, Clifford B. Harmon, Allan R. Ryan, Herbert L. Saterlee, ex-governor Curtis Guild, Jr.,, Edwin Gould, Charles K. Hamilton, Horace F. Karnay, John G. Stratton, George M. Cox, Gen. Nelson A. Miles, Commodore John H. Hubbard, Charles F. Willard, Charles J. Glidden, Walter Brookins, Ralph J. Stone, William Hilliard, Cromwell Dixon, Samuel F. Perkins, Capt. Thomas F. Baldwin, Greeley S. Curtiss, General  W. A. Bancroft, and Adams D. Clafton.”,&lt;ref&gt;“New Aero Organization: Aviators Form U.S. Aeronautical Reserve—Bomb Throwing Trophy, ''New York Times'', page 3.  September 10, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Aeronauts Perform National Defense:  Serve to Help Uncle Sam in U.S. Aeronautical Re- Time of Need.” ''New York Times'', January 22, 1911."&lt;/ref&gt; Recruiting stations were at [[Harvard University]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Mineola, Long Island]]; and Belmont Park, Long Island (Belmont Park is most known for its racetrack but it also has quite an early aviation history that became U.S.A.R.'s earliest members such as [[Glenn Curtiss]] and Wilber Wright of the [[Wright Bros]]).&lt;ref&gt;International aviation tournament at the Belmont Park racetrack, Long Island, New York, October 22–30, 1910:  https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005682299/  (Photographs show airplanes in flight; rows of hangars bearing manufacturers' signs (Barrier, Curtiss, DeLesseps, Latham, LeBlanc, Wright Bros., etc.); some close-up views of aircraft. Also, Charles E. Taylor, mechanic for Wright Brothers, looking at engine.) (Accessed May 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the United States Aeronautical Reserve's General Board were Clifford Harmon, Chief of Staff; John Barry Ryan, Commodore; Herbert I. Satterlee, NY; John Barry Ryan, NY; [[Wilbur Wright]], [[Dayton, Ohio]]; [[Glenn Curtiss]], Hammondsport, NY; Cortland Field Bishop, NY; Hon. [[John F. Fitzgerald]], Boston, MA; Charles H. Allen (Treasurer), NY and Richard R. Sinclair (Assistant Treasurer) NY.  The United States Aeronautical Reserve military contacts were the Army’s Brigadier General James Allen, [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]], Chief Signal Officer; and, Captain W. Irving Chambers of the Navy; and Major General [[Leonard Wood]], Chief of Staff and U.S.A.R. member.

"With offices not far from those of the Aero Club of America in New York City, the U.S.A.R. by November 1910 claimed no less than 3,200 members, including President Taft [U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]]]."&lt;ref&gt;Air Force Research Institute, ''ASPJ The Air and Space Power Journal'', http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/nov-dec/johnson.html (accessed May 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S.A.R. was officially recognized by the [[United States Department of War]] and [[United States Department of the Navy]]==
The United States Aeronautical Reserve was officially recognized by the “War and Navy Departments,” and was “organized along strictly military lines, with a view of advancing the science as a means of supplementing the national defense . . . And they are anxious that the U.S.A.R. shall not be confused with other aero clubs in New York and other cities, which appear to be striving for existence along lines made famous by certain characteristics peculiar to the female inhabitants of Kilkenny.”  &lt;ref&gt;“Aeronauts Perform National Defense:  Serve to Help Uncle Sam in U.S. Aeronautical Re-Time of Need.” ''New York Times'', January 22, 1911."&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Target practice bombing competition==

In 1910, The United States Aeronautical Reserve founder John H. Ryan also started the Commodore [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] International Target Practice Cup through the Aeronautical Society and offered a $10,000.00 prize for a winning “bomb throwing” contest from an airplane, and the bronze trophy statue was of “Commodore Barry who was the first Commodore in the American Navy.”  ''The Washington Post'' reported in a social article in October 1910 that Harmon and Grahame-White split the prize.,&lt;ref&gt;"People met in Hotel Lobbies,"
''The Washington Post'', page 6.  Oct 13, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“New Aero Organization: Aviators Form U.S. Aeronautical Reserve—Bomb Throwing Trophy, New York Times, page 3,  September 10, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;Ryan's plan in 1910 to create an airplane landing strip on the roof of the U.S.A.R.'s main headquarters in Manhattan's 53rd Fifth Avenue address in New York City was covered by the media.

==''The Air-Scout'', U.S.A.R.'s official publication==

In 1910, The United States Aeronautical Reserve’s General Board produced its official monthly publication, ''The Air-Scout'', that later merged into ''Town &amp; Country'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;“Aeronauts Perform National Defense:  Serve to Help Uncle Sam in U.S. Aeronautical Re- Time of Need.” ''New York Times'', January 22, 1911."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Air Force Research Institute, ''ASPJ The Air and Space Power Journal'', http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/nov-dec/johnson.html (accessed May 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air-Scout was an upscale glossy magazine, approximately 14 inches long and 17 inches wide, filled with U.S. aviation and foreign news.  It also contained social pages (such as with socialite aeroplane supporters:  Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney, Miss Vivien Gould, Mrs. August Belmont, Mr. Allan A. Ryan, Colonel John Jacob Astor, Mrs. Mortimer Schiff, Mrs. Charles Gibson, Miss Lilla B. Gilbert, Miss Hannah Randolph . . .); a woman's aviator page (Baroness Raymond de La Roche of France was said to be the first woman to obtain a pilot license and operate an airplane) in several issues; wireless technology news; airship news, airplane contests, military aviation news including where the U.S.A.R. may be needed; and more.  There were plenty of photos from war correspondents and other professional photographers and agencies. Many of the feature writers were U.S.A.R. members including Harry M. Horton credited with "creating the earliest longest distance wireless apparatus that was first used on an airplane in flight, military aviators and similar."  There were many advertisements in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;''The Air-Scout'', Vol. 1., Issues 1-6, November 1910-April 1911, United States Aeronautical Reserve.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation in industrial airplane shows==
In 1911, the First International [[:Industrial Airplane Show]] was held in conjunction with the 11th U.S. International Auto Show at [[Manhattan]]’s [[:Grand Central Palace]], in [[New York City]].  The aviation show was the invent of the Aero Club of New York, and the event had the largest Palace attendance ever recorded back then.,&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Central Palace Automobile Show has Auspicious Opening,” ''New York Times'', page, 34. January 1, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;regarding the First International Airplane Exhibition, ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', page 71.  December 31, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Aeronautical Reserve had an exhibition booth with interesting airplane displays and a demonstration on January 5, 1911 of early wireless communication technology utilizing the "Wilcox aeroplane equipped with Horton [Harry M. Horton] wireless apparatus" used to communicate from the airplane to the land-based news media and to test distance with steamships out at sea.,&lt;ref&gt;''The Air-Scout'', Vol. 1., Issues 1-6, November 1910-April 1911, United States Aeronautical Reserve.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Central Palace Automobile Show has Auspicious Opening,” ''New York Times'', page, 34. January 1, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aeronautical Society and the United States Aeronautical Reserve had their full-size airplane displays in the second gallery of the [[:Grand Central Palace]] among other full-size airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;"The New York Show."  ''AERO'', Vol. 1., page 18.  January 7, 1911. (1911 Aero Publication Company, St. Louis).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles W. Chappelle]], a member of the United States Aeronautical Reserve, exhibited a full-size airplane which won him a medal for being the only African-American to invent and display an airplane.&lt;ref&gt;“A Successful Negro Aviator. Charles Ward Chappelle Invents and Aeroplane Which Attacks Attention.” News/Opinion, Savannah Tribune, Page 1, February 11, 1911. Savannah, Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military Airplane display in Washington, D.C., U.S.A.R. requests Grahame-White as pilot==

''The Air-Scout,'' October 1910.]]

Both the ''Boston Daily Globe'' and the United States Aeronautical Reserve's (U.S.A.R.'s) ''The Air-Scout'' covered [[Grahame-White]] landing an airplane near the War Office in Washington, D.C. in October 1910.  It was a distance and speed demonstration display, with the U.S.A.R. requesting Grahame-White to perform the test in front of hundreds of military personnel that stood outside and watched as he successfully landed his airplane in a narrow street within a few minutes from a satisfactory distance.

According to the ''Boston Daily Globe'',  ". . . and within 10 minutes, had landed lightly on the narrow roadway between the White House and the war department, at the feet of General [[Leonard Wood]] and within a few yards of the window of President Taft's office."  The ''Boston Daily Globe'' mentioned General [[Nelson A. Miles]] stating, "I am convinced that one aeroplane would annihilate an entire fleet by dropping bombs upon the deck, or the more vital spot--their engine rooms by way of the funnels . . .", and Major General [[Leonard Wood]], commander of the army spoke on how the escalation of airplane technology and the wanted airplane capabilities would be "fulfilled" in the future.&lt;ref&gt;"Use of Aeroplanes in War: Graham-White Landed in the Street Beside the War Office in Washington Without Trouble--General Leonard Wood and Gen Miles Tell How Aircraft May Affect Future Wars."  ''Boston (Daily) Globe'', page 51, October 30, 1910.  Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First use of airplane by military in war is from the United States Aeronautical Reserve==

Although the U.S.A.R. had much bigger plans for many of their airplanes to be used by the U.S. military, the U.S. military did utilize at least one of their airplanes in a peacekeeping effort with two of the U.S.A.R. members, according to ''The Air-Scout's'' March 1911 issue:
“On February 16 [1911], the General Staff of the United States Army accepted the service of Mr. Collier’s biplane offered by the U.S.A.R. On the same day, Major General [[Leonard Wood]] publicly announced that the craft would be ordered to the Mexican frontier.  On the next day, for the first time in the history of man, an aeroplane was ordered to the scene of the battle, with instructions to patrol the Mexican border in order to preserve neutrality laws.  Lieutenant Foulios, a trained United States Army aviator officer, stationed at Fort Sam Houston near San Antonio, Texas, was commanded to report for service on board the airplane.  Phillip O. Parmalee, one of the Wright aviators, a lieutenant of the U.S.A.R., native of Michigan, volunteered his services to the government through the reserves which were accepted.  He was also commanded to proceed to Texas.”  Photos of this were published in ''The Air-Scout''.&lt;ref&gt;The Air-Scout, Vol. 1., Issues 1-6, November 1910-April 1911, United States Aeronautical Reserve.)&lt;/ref&gt;
