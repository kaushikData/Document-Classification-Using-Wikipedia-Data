The '''1917 [[Victorian Football Association]] season''' was not played owing to [[World War I]], which was at its peak at the time.

==Abandonment of the season==
To support the war effort in [[World War I]], the Association had curtailed its [[1915 VFA season|1915 season]] by five weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Association season curtailed|date=15 July 1915|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then cancelled its [[1916 VFA season|1916 season]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|date=26 February 1916|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=18|title=Football and war}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the war still ongoing, the Association voted on 5 February 1917 to cancel the 1917 season as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|date=6 February 1917|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=8|title=Sport and war}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1917 was the last Association season cancelled during World War I, with a premiership season held in [[1918 VFA season|1918]] with a reduced number of clubs.

The '''AcciMap approach''' is a systems-based technique for [[accident analysis]], specifically for analysing the causes of accidents and incidents that occur in complex [[sociotechnical systems]].

The approach was originally developed by [[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)|Jens Rasmussen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmussen|first=Jens|title=Risk management in a dynamic society: A modelling problem|journal=Safety Science|year=1997|volume=27|issue=2–3|pages=183–213|doi=10.1016/S0925-7535(97)00052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a proactive [[risk management]] strategy, but its primary application has been as an accident analysis tool.

== Overview ==
The approach is not domain-specific and has been used to analyse accidents in a range of industries including aviation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Debrincat|first=J|author2=Bil, C|author3= Clark, G.|title=Assessing organisational factors in aircraft accidents using a hybrid Reason and AcciMap model|journal=Engineering Failure Analysis|year=2013|volume=27|pages=52–60|doi=10.1016/j.engfailanal.2012.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mishaps&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branford|first=Kate|title=Seeing the big picture of mishaps: Applying the AcciMap approach to analyze system accidents|journal=Aviation Psychology and Human Factors|year=2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–37|url=http://173.254.28.36/~dedalene/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1027/2192-0923/a00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; defence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Royal Australian Air Force|title=Chemical exposure of air force maintenance workers: Report of the Board of Inquiry into F111 (Fuel Tank) Deseal/Reseal spray seal programs|year=2001|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|location=Canberra, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil and gas,&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Andrew|title=Lessons from Longford: The Esso Gas Plant explosion|year=2000|publisher=CCH Australia|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; public health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piche|first=A.C.|author2=Vicente, K.J.|title=A sociotechnical systems analysis of the Toronto SARS outbreak|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 49th Annual Meeting|year=2005|pages=507–511|doi=10.1177/154193120504900362|volume=49|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woo|first=D.M.|author2=Vicente, K.J.|title=Sociotechnical systems: Comparing the North Battleford and Walkerton outbreaks|journal=Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety|year=2003|volume=80|pages=253–269|doi=10.1016/S0951-8320(03)00052-8|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; risk management, policing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=D.P.|author2=Salmon, P.M. |author3= Stanton, N.A. |author4= Walker, G.H. |title=A systemic approach to accident analysis: A case study of the Stockwell shooting|journal=Ergonomics|year=2010|volume=53|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/00140130903311625}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public health and rail transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Andrew|title=Safety, culture and risk: The organisational causes of disasters|year=2005|publisher=CCH Australia|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is used to analyse the contributing factors of accidents at all levels of the system, and can also be utilised to formulate safety recommendations.

== Features ==
The AcciMap approach is useful for uncovering how factors in the various parts of the system contributed to an accident, and for arranging those factors into a logical causal diagram that illustrates how they combined to result in that event.&lt;ref name=Guidelines&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branford|first=K|author2=Naikar, N.|author3= Hopkins, A.|title=Guidelines for AcciMap analysis|journal=In A. Hopkins (Ed.) Learning from high reliability organisations|year=2011|pages=193–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The method also promotes a systemic view of accident causation as the AcciMap diagram extends well beyond the most immediate causes of the event to reveal the full range of higher-level factors that contributed to the outcome (or failed to prevent it from occurring). It therefore assists analysts in understanding how and why an accident took place, and prevents attention from focusing disproportionately on the immediate causes (such as errors made by front-line workers), because the factors that provoked or permitted those factors are also revealed. The approach therefore helps to avoid blaming frontline individuals for accidents and leaving the factors that contributed to their behaviour unaddressed.&lt;ref name="Mishaps"/&gt; In extending to consider contributing factors at governmental, regulatory and societal levels, the approach also has the capacity to capture and address high-level contributing factors that are typically excluded from accident analyses developed using other methods.

== Structure ==
The AcciMap approach involves the construction of a multi-layered causal diagram in which the various causes of an accident are arranged according to their causal remoteness from the outcome (depicted at the bottom of the diagram). The most immediate causes are shown in the lower sections of the diagram, with more remote causes shown at progressively higher levels, so that the full range of factors that contributed to the event are modelled.&lt;ref name="Mishaps" /&gt;

The precise format of the diagram varies depending on the purpose of analysis, but the lower levels typically represent the immediate precursors to the event, relating to the activities of workers and to physical events, processes and conditions that contributed to the outcome. The next highest levels typically represent company and organisational-level factors. The highest levels generally incorporate governmental or societal-level causal factors, which are external to the organisation(s) involved in the event. Compiling the multiple contributing factors and their interrelationships into a single logical diagram in this way helps analysts understand how and why the event took place and pinpoints problem areas that can be addressed to improve system safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Branford|first=Kate|title=An investigation into the validity and reliability of the AcciMap approach (Doctoral Dissertation)|year=2007|publisher=Australian National University|location=Canberra, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Events leading to World War I}}

The '''Balkan Wars''' ({{lang-tr|Balkan Savaşları}}, literally "the Balkan Wars" or ''Balkan Faciası'', meaning "the Balkan Tragedy") consisted of two conflicts that took place in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, suffered defeat in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a "prelude to the [[First World War]]".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}

By the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912 these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The First Balkan War had three main causes:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}

# The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.
# The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.
# Most importantly, the Balkan League had been formed, and its members were confident that it could defeat the Turks.

The Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]] from the lost lands. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.

Citizens of Turkey regard the Balkan Wars as a major disaster (''Balkan harbi faciası'') in the [[Ottoman Empire#Defeat and dissolution (1908–1922)|nation's history]]. The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a [[Psychological trauma|psycho-traumatic]] event amongst many Turks that is said{{by whom|date=December 2015}} to have triggered the ultimate [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|collapse]] of the empire itself within five years. [[Nazım Pasha]], Chief of Staff of the [[Ottoman Army]], was held responsible for the failure and was assassinated on 23 January 1913 during the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;Gul Tokay. "Ottoman diplomacy, the Balkan Wars and the Great Powers". In Dominik Geppert, William Mulligan, Andreas Rose, eds. ''The Wars before the Great War'' {{ISBN|978-1-107-06347-1}}, 2015, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Balkan War]] began when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire on 8 October 1912 and ended eight months later with the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913. Both Serbia and Greece, utilizing the argument that the war had been prolonged, repudiated important particulars of the pre-war treaty and retained occupation of all the conquered districts in their possession, which were to be divided according to specific predefined boundaries. Seeing the treaty as trampled, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and Greece) and commenced military action against them. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with, invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining [[Adrianople]]. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of [[Dobruja|Dobroudja province]] to [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911–1918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}
The background to the wars lies in the incomplete emergence of [[nation-states]] on the European territory of the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century. Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].

===Policies of the Great Powers===
Throughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the "[[Eastern Question]]" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the "warm waters" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the "warm waters" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Israel]]).

[[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the "[[Drang nach Osten]]" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced "Hellenization" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought "Bulgarization" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.

===Young Turk Revolution===
{{Main article|Young Turk Revolution}}
The 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.

At the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognised. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has large influence in the consequent world order.

===Reaction in the Balkan States===

Serbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pašić]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably "Old Serbia" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).

On 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the League summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 "Military League"], Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,&lt;ref name="Congress"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate =15 April 2008 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.

===Balkan League===
{{Main article|Balkan League}}
[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]

Following Italy's victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911–1912, the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and fulfill their desires of expansion.

With the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was not advanced, so most reinforcements would have to come by sea through the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912.

Montenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide the territory of northern Macedonia.

This alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable for all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.

==First Balkan War==

Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]

The three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.

The Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.

With the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.

Montenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[Çatalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait and after capturing [[Thessaloniki]] on 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) expanded its occupied area and linked up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].&lt;ref name="BA01"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}

In January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the Çatalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.

==Second Balkan War==
{{Main article|Second Balkan War}}
[[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]]
[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912–1913)]]

Though the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29(16) June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.

When the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be a 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedeağaç (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.

Greece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace—and confirming Greek concerns—Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, together with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized.

Similarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter's aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).

The Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}, while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}

On 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.&lt;ref name="macedonia-istinata"&gt;{{cite web |date=Winter 1995|url = http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html|title = THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA|publisher=Magazine: Australia &amp;World Affairs, | accessdate =15 April 2008 | last=George Phillipov |quote=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies. Montenegro's forces were just a few kilometers away and also rushed to the battle. The Bulgarian attack was halted.

The Greek army was also successful.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} It retreated according to plan for two days while [[Thessaloniki]] was cleared of the remaining Bulgarian regiment. Then, the Greek army counter-attacked and defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Kilkis|Kilkis]] (Kukush), after which the mostly Bulgarian town was destroyed and part of its mostly Bulgarian population massacred by the Greek army &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keWGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=kukush+massacre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vl7nRdQrCQ&amp;sig=U5ZmW08ZeHX49vRhVaDuR2ljpmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2qv-p6O3dAhWmVN8KHXDYCWUQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kukush+massacre&amp;f=false|title=Report of the International Commission to Inquire Into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars|first=International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan|last=Wars|date=26 October 2018|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following the capture of Kilkis, the Greek army's pace was not quick enough to prevent the retaliatory destruction of [[Nigrita]], [[Serres]], and [[Doxato]] and massacres of non-combatant Greek inhabitants at [[Sidirokastro]] and Doxato by the Bulgarian army.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars, published by the Endowment Washington, D.C. 1914, p. 97-99 [http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/carnegie/chapter2_2.html pp.79–95]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek army then divided its forces and advanced in two directions. Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].

[[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis–Lachanas]]]]
By 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&amp;nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.

Romania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], 7 miles from the center of [[Sofia]].

Seeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].

==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==
[[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]

The developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:

*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.&lt;ref name="Stowell1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].
*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.
*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.
*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances—even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.
*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders—an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.

The '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the "warm seas". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.

Austria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.

Finally, when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], no-one could stop the conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.

==Aftermath==
Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' (1960) that in the first and second Balkan wars there were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 dead of wounds, and 82,000 dead of disease.

'''Billie Sol Estes''' (January 10, 1925 – May 14, 2013) was an American [[businessman]] and financier best known for his involvement in a business fraud scandal that complicated his ties to friend and future [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]].

==Early life==
Estes was born January 10, 1925 to John and Lillian Estes on a farm near [[Clyde, Texas]], one of six children. Estes never attended college but nonetheless demonstrated a natural talent for business from an early age.

{{Quote|text="At 13, [Estes] received a lamb as a gift, sold its wool for $5, bought another lamb and went into business. At 15, he sold 100 sheep for $3,000. He borrowed $3,500 more from a bank, bought government surplus grain and sold it for a big profit. By 18, he had $38,000."&lt;ref name=McFadden/&gt;}}

He served in the [[U.S. Merchant Marine]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=McFadden/&gt;

==Fraud Schemes==

In the late 1950s, Estes was heavily involved in the Texas anhydrous [[ammonia]] business. He produced mortgages on nonexistent ammonia tanks by convincing local farmers to purchase them on credit, sight unseen, and leasing them from the farmers for the same amount as the mortgage payment, paying them a convenience fee as well. He used the fraudulent mortgage holdings to obtain loans from banks outside Texas who were unable to easily check on the tanks.

At the same time, [[United States Department of Agriculture]] began controlling the price of cotton, specifying [[Production quota|quota]]s to farmers. The program included an acreage allotment that normally was not transferable from the land it was associated with, but which could be transferred if the original land was taken by [[eminent domain]].

Estes worked out a method to purchase large numbers of cotton allotments, by dealing with farmers who had been dispossessed of land through eminent domain. He convinced the farmers to purchase land from him in Texas and transfer their allotments there, with a mortgage agreement delaying the first payment for a year. Then he would lease the land and allotments back from the farmer for $50 per acre. Once the first payment came due, the farmer would intentionally default and the land would revert to Estes; in effect, Estes had purchased the cotton allotments with the lease fees. However, because the original sale and mortgage were a pretext rather than a genuine sale, it was illegal to transfer the cotton allotments this way. Estes, however, a smooth talker revered by many of his fellow members of the [[Churches of Christ]], asserted the allegations as politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Garrett | first = Leroy | date = 1962-04-01 | title = The church of Billy Sol Estes | journal = Restoration Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | place = Denton, Texas }} Garrett returned to the story with articles in several later volumes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, after information came to light that Estes had paid off four Agriculture officials for grain storage contracts, President [[John F. Kennedy]] ordered the Justice Department and FBI to open investigations into Estes' activities and determine if Secretary of Agriculture [[Orville L. Freeman]] had also been "compromised" (Freeman was cleared).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Dallek |last=Dallek |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917–1963 |page=500 |isbn=978-0-316-17238-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress conducted hearings on Estes' business dealings, including some that led to Vice President Johnson, a long-time associate of Estes.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=501}}&lt;!-- Dallek, Robert (2003), ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917–1963'', p. 501 --&gt;

In 1963 Estes was tried and convicted on charges related to the fraudulent ammonia tank mortgages on both federal and state charges and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. His state conviction was later overturned by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Estes v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|381|532|1965}}. His appeal hinged upon the alleged impossibility of a fair trial due to the presence of television cameras and broadcast journalists in the courtroom. He prevailed by a 5-4 vote. Estes was paroled in 1971. Eight years later, he was convicted of other fraud charges and served four more years.

[[Oscar Griffin, Jr.]], the journalist who uncovered the storage tank scandal, later received the 1963 [[Pulitzer Prize]]. His articles for a weekly newspaper in [[Pecos, Texas]] outlined how the businessman masterminded a Byzantine scheme to borrow money using nonexistent fertilizer storage tanks as collateral, leading to the FBI's investigation.  To improve his 1961 candidacy for [[Reeves County]] [[school board]], Estes offered the local newspaper large advertising buys in exchange for not opposing him.  The ''Pecos Independent'' responded with an editorial that said, “We will put our advertising columns up for sale, as will any other newspaper, but we WILL NOT sell our editorial support.”  In response, Estes launched the rival ''Pecos Daily News'' on August 1, 1961. He spent about $600,000 and the ''Independent'' lost $400,000.   It was nearly bankrupt when Griffin, its editor, ran (February 12, 1962) the first of four articles describing Estes's fraud but without naming him.  Estes was arrested ten days after the last article ran in March.  After his arrest, the ''Daily News'' went into [[receivership]] and the ''Independent'' bought it and merged the two newspapers into the ''[[Pecos Enterprise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=BloombergView |publisher=[[Bloomberg (company)|Bloomberg]] |title=How a Texas Paper Brought Down Billie Sol Estes |first=Amy |last=Reading &lt;!-- |authorlink=Amy Reading --&gt; |date=May 16, 2013  |accessdate=2014-02-26 |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-05-16/how-a-texas-paper-brought-down-billie-sol-estes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Griffin died in 2011, Estes remarked, "It’s a good riddance that he left this world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaney |first=Betsy |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/28/2521971/editor-who-won-pulitzer-for-estes.html |title=Editor who won Pulitzer for Estes scandal dies - Obituaries |publisher=Miami Herald |date=1933-04-28 |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations linking Johnson to the assassination of Kennedy and others==
Estes also alleged in the 1980s that he had inside knowledge that Johnson was involved in the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="ARRB"&gt;{{cite book |author=Assassination Records Review Board |authorlink1=Assassination Records Review Board |title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/review-board/report/arrb-final-report.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=May 15, 2013 |date=September 30, 1998 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |chapter=Chapter 6, Part I: The Quest for Additional Information and Records in Federal Government Offices}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Bud|title=Even for Texas, Billie Sol Estes was a big talker, a big dealer and a big storyteller|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/05/15/4850107/even-for-texas-billie-sol-estes.html|accessdate=May 21, 2013|newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=May 15, 2013|location=Fort Worth, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he provided a voluntary statement to a grand jury in Texas alleging that the homicide of a key investigator in the Department of Agriculture case was perpetrated by [[Malcolm Wallace]], an aide to Johnson, upon orders from the then-Vice President.&lt;ref name=McFadden/&gt; Estes claimed that Johnson was involved in the fraud schemes and had the official killed in order to prevent him from exposing Johnson's role&lt;ref name="The New York Times; March 24, 1984"&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Wayne |title=ESTES LINKS JOHNSON TO PLOT|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/24/us/estes-links-johnson-to-plot.html |accessdate=2017-02-25 |newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 24, 1984|authorlink=Wayne King|location=Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two former Johnson associates responded to the allegations stating Estes was a "pathological liar".&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune; March 25, 1984"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hirsley |first=Michael |date=March 25, 1984 |title=Billie Sol Estes returns to spotlight with testimony |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1984/03/25/page/3/article/billie-sol-estes-returns-to-spotlight-with-testimony/index.html |work=Chicago Tribune |volume=137 |issue=85 |at=Section 1, page 3 |access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] asked for more information, Estes responded that he would provide information on eight other murders ordered by Johnson, including the assassination of Kennedy, in exchange for immunity from prosecution and a pardon. According to Estes, Johnson set up the assassination in order to become president.&lt;ref name=McFadden/&gt;

Estes reiterated the claim in, ''"JFK Le Dernier Témoin: Assassinat De Kennedy, Enfin La Vérité!"'' ("JFK The Last Witness: Kennedy's Assassination, Finally The Truth!"){{citation needed|date=April 2017}}, a book he co-wrote with a French writer in 2003.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Billie Sol Estes dies at 88; notorious Texas con man in 1960s scandal|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-billie-sol-estes-20130516,0,3004371.story|accessdate=May 16, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 16, 2013|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he was not interested in writing the book&amp;nbsp;– published only in France&amp;nbsp;– but that he was offered "a few hundred thousand dollars" to contribute to it.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; According to the [[Associated Press]], the allegation was "rejected by prominent historians, Johnson aides and family members."&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

'''''Calamity Jane (A Musical Western)''''' is a [[musical theatre|stage musical]] based on the historical figure of frontierswoman [[Calamity Jane]]. The non-historical, somewhat [[farce|farcical]] plot involves the authentic Calamity Jane's professional associate [[Wild Bill Hickok]], and presents the two as having a contentious relationship that ultimately proves to be a facade for mutually amorous feelings. The ''Calamity Jane'' stage musical originated as a live adaption of ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'', the 1953 [[Warner Bros.]] [[musical film|movie musical]] with [[Doris Day]]. First produced in 1961, the stage musical ''Calamity Jane'' features six songs not heard in the movie. According to [[Jodie Prenger]], star of the ''Calamity Jane'' 2014 - 15 UK tour, the songs added for the stage musical had been written for but not included in the ''Calamity Jane'' movie&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Calamity-Jane/story-26729737-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004050012/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Calamity-Jane/story-26729737-detail/story.html# |archive-date=2015-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Love You Dearly" had been used in the 1954 Doris Day musical film ''[[Lucky Me (film)|Lucky Me]]'').

==Synopsis==
Deadwood City's two most famous peace officers, Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickock, get involved in saving the neck of Henry Miller, the local saloon operator. It seems that "Millie" has been promoting a beautiful actress named Frances Fryer, but Frances turns out to be a male, Francis. Millie's attempt to cover up is soon unmasked by the angry miners, and only Calamity can cool the crowd with her trusty pistols. To keep the peace, Calamity sets out for Chicago to bring back the miner's real heart-throb, Adelaide Adams. In Chicago Calamity mistakes Adelaide's maid, Katie Brown, for the actress and hauls her back to Deadwood. Onstage Katie is greeted warmly, but breaks down and confesses that she is not the famous star. Calamity once more has to restore order and persuades the audience to give Katie a chance. They do, and she wins the heart of every male in town including Calamity's dashing love hope, Lt. Danny Gilmartin. Calamity reluctantly overcomes her jealousy over losing Danny and discovers her true love for Wild Bill.

==Production history==
===In the US===
The world premiere production of the stage musical version of ''Calamity Jane'' ran 27 May - 17 June 1961 at the [[Casa Mañana]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth TX]]: Casa Mañana [[repertory theatre|stock]] actress Betty O'Neill led this production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2901452|title=Calamity Jane (World Premiere, 1961) - Ovrtur|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; touted as "the first try-out of a musical ever staged outside the East or in-the round." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jan L.| last=Jones| title=Renegades, Showmen &amp; Angels: A Theatrical History of Fort Worth from 1873-2001| year=2006| publisher=Texas Christian University Press| location=Fort Worth TX| page=228| ISBN=978-0875653181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play then ran from 21 June - 18 July 1961 at [[the Muny]] in [[St Louis]] with [[Edie Adams]] in the title role while [[Allyn Ann McLerie]] played Katie - a role she had originated in the 1953 film ''Calamity Jane'' - and [[George Gaynes]] - McLerie's husband - starred as Wild Bill Hickok. The role of Danny Gilmartin was played by [[Nolan Van Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2882689|title=Calamity Jane (St. Louis MUNY Production, 1961) - Ovrtur|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| "'Calamity Jane' is a loud, rollicking show" which "aside from the comedy of Martha Raye&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;contains a number of attractive &amp; talented people who sing &amp; dance the evening away"; "No one could accuse Martha Raye of being a great actress, &amp; certainly there were more than a few ''in the audience'' who must have winced inwardly over her rendering of 'Secret Love'. But ''she is'' a natural slapstick comedienne"&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;"this singer without a voice &amp; heroine without glamour whacked &amp; wailed her energetic, boisterous &amp; fun-filled way through 'Calamity Jane'&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;Sometimes she is mugging &amp; ad-libbing so furiously that the performance becomes more of a nightclub act than a book show. But after all, the audience has presumably come to see Martha Raye, &amp; that is what it sees."&lt;br&gt;- Michael Holmberg ([[The Pittsburgh Press]]) &lt;ref&gt;The Pittsburgh Press 2 July 1961 ''Fanciful Fun by Miss Raye Opens Opera'' p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 – 8 July 1961 the [[Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera|Pittsburgh CLO]] (Civic Light Opera) production of ''Calamity Jane'' with [[Martha Raye]] in the title role played the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)]]: this production featured George Gaynes as Wild Bill and Allyn Ann McLerie, Gaynes and McLerie transferring from the Muny production to that of the Pittsburgh CLO for the duration of the latter's engagement.&lt;ref&gt;The Pittsburgh Press 2 July 1961 page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

| "As a musical comedy 'Calamity Jane'&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;was nothing to shoot up the town about. But as a vehicle tailored to Carol Burnett's special talents - &amp; they are certainly special - it served very nicely indeed. The 90 minute comedy was taped last summer ''after playing at State Fair Music Theater (Dallas) &amp;'' therefore had a polish which is all too often lacking in television productions of this type. This was especially evident in the song-&amp;-dance sequences which were as smooth as a Broadway stage ''production''. The plot was corny enough to afford light-hearted amusement, &amp; Miss Burnett gave it all the hell-bent-for-leather whoop it up treatment which it required. ''In'' fact Carol's enthusiasm ''in the role'' was at times a bit too much. But never mind. She mugged &amp; yelled &amp; pranced about like a mad woman while giving the broad comedy lines &amp; rowdy songs the merry Dickens as only she can. Then, as a welcome relief, she sang the lovely 'My &lt;small&gt;[sic]&lt;/small&gt; Secret Love' straight in a surprisingly enchanting voice&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;All in all a jolly good show.

In 1979, [[Barbara Windsor]] headlined the first UK tour of ''Calamity Jane''. After its premiere engagement at the [[Billingham Forum]], which opened 27 August 1979, this production toured for twelve weeks to conclude with a November 1979 date at the [[Sunderland Empire Theatre|Sunderland Empire]].&lt;ref name="its-behind-you.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2897008|title=Calamity Jane (UK Premiere, 1979)|publisher=Ovrtur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windsor's co-star as Wild Bill was [[Eric Flynn]], and [[Norman Vaughan (comedian)|Norman Vaughan]] was featured as Francis Fryer: at the tour's premiere engagement in Billingham the role of Henry Miller was played by [[Jeffrey Holland]] filling in for the ailing Dudley Owen who evidently played out the remaining engagements. [[Toyah Willcox]], while promoting her own headlining ''Calamity Jane'' tour in 2002, told Terry Grimley of the [[Birmingham Post]]: "Barbara Windsor did this show twenty years ago and it was due to go into the [[West End (theatre)|West End]], but there were some problems with her private life." The touring production of ''Calamity Jane'' with Barbara Windsor did occasion the musical's London-area premiere, as the production played the [[Ashcroft Theatre|Ashcroft Theatre (Croydon)]] 18–29 September 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatricalia.com/play/9ca/calamity-jane/production/k6z|title=Production of Calamity Jane - Theatricalia|website=theatricalia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| "The somewhat naive charm of the thigh-slappin' gun-totin' original ''movie'' has dissolved in a production reeking of gingham &amp; lukewarm feminism, which does not have enough tongue-in-cheek humour to carry off Calamity's transition from bar-brawling man-fighter to petticoatwearing man-eater&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;despite Ed Curtis's lively direction &amp; Sammy Fain's catchy tunes, the script is not nearly sharp enough for 'Calamity Jane' to be admired either as a period piece or as a retro-classic. As a result, the production lives or dies by Willcox's performance, an unfortunately forced twodimensional affair" - Rachel Hallibuton ([[London Evening Standard]]) 27 June 2003 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-186465/Toyah-gets-gun.html|title=Toyah gets her gun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| "This stage adaptation&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;is considerably more hit-and-miss ''than the Doris Day movie''&lt;/small&gt;...You can't accuse ponytail-tossing Toyah of giving less than her heart &amp; soul to the part. She throws herself into the sharpshooting tomboy athleticism, &amp; she's fine at projecting the heroine's emotional innocence &amp; fired-up enthusiasm. But Calamity needs to be able to dominate vocally too, &amp; Willcox does not have the necessary command. She's heavily miked &amp; this emphasises that distracting sibilance in her delivery&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;''compared to'' Day's crispness of attack Willcox sounds soggy...There are sequences where the show springs fully to life, as when our heroine stirs the town to a shuffling dance with her report on 'The Windy City'.

| "Now touring the UK is Charles K Freeman’s adaptation of the 'Calamity Jane' film, a production that began life at the resourceful Watermill Theatre under the direction of Nikolai Foster. It's another of their musicians-as-performers productions, which see the traditional pit orchestra replaced by onstage performers who play various instruments. More than that, the entire production adopts a make-do philosophy which sees the orchestral accompaniment as just another of the clever something-from-nothing design imperatives"; "Prenger, though wildly miscast ''since she'' is unmistakably all woman&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;has an easy, broad comic style&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;Vocally, she is in good form ''although'' 'Secret Love' is not the peak musical moment it could be, the long brilliant notes that make that song wonderful don't get proper attention, but that is not to say Prenger does not get away with it"; "This ''production'' is a theatrical treat: a good, old fashioned musical done in a new fangled way. It's great to hear such good songs so well sung by a cast that basically accompanies itself. Prenger’s crowd pleasing turn as Calamity, together with first class support&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;ensures an evening that moves along at 'Whip Crack Away' pace &amp; makes you long for those 'Black Hills of Dakota'." - Stephen Collins (BritishTheatre.com) 23 March 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishtheatre.com/review-calamity-jane-new-wimbledon-theatre-4stars/|title=REVIEW: Calamity Jane, New Wimbledon Theatre ✭✭✭✭|date=23 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jodie Prenger]] starred in a production of ''Calamity Jane'' whose 17 July - 6 September 2014 engagement at the [[Watermill Theatre]] ([[Berkshire|Berks]]) inaugurated a national tour of intended six months duration: however interest in booking this production was sufficiently high as to allow for its playing constant engagements for more than twelve months, with venues played throughout Great Britain - plus a 19 – 23 May 2015 engagement at [[Bord Gáis Energy Theatre]], [[Dublin]] - with two London-area engagements: 17–21 March 2015 at the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]] and - as the tour's final engagement - 4 – 8 August 2015 at the [[Richmond Theatre]].

| To begin with when producer Jamie Wilson suggested it my heart sank, I thought it was an old potboiler of a thing. And actually the film is so beautiful &amp; gracious and Doris Day is captured in that iconic &amp; breathtakingly brilliant performance. So why on earth would you try &amp; do it on stage? Having seen Ed Curtis’s 2003 production with Toyah Willcox, I thought the script was not very good &amp; didn’t offer anything up that is better than the film. Then we were given permission to really look at the script to make it feel fresh &amp; contemporary. Crucially we cut out all the racism, the way the indigenous Native Americans are dealt with stereotypically. It's a love story &amp; about Calamity Jane being accepted how we view women, how women have had to assume a more masculine role to be seen as equals to their male counterparts. At the end Calamity Jane is accepted for who she is &amp; that's quite a powerful message today." &lt;ref name="Northern Soul"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

| What's extraordinary about her is that while remaining true to the essence of who she is throughout the whole play she goes on this extraordinary journey where through the people she meets &amp; the new friends she makes on this wonderful journey she learns to accept help &amp; crucially to accept love, &amp; to let people into her life &amp; she realizes she doesn't quite have to be as tough &amp; as fiery all the time, &amp; that actually a bit of love &amp; a bit of fire make for a really well-rounded human being. She's an incredible woman &amp; just a joy to be creating our version of her with Jodie&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;

One of the principal reasons for choosing to work on this new production of 'Calamity Jane' was that I think as a director that it appeals to young theatre-goers today but also those people who might remember it from the first time 'round still sort of get that nostalgiac kick from it so sort of mixing a bit of new with the old&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;

I think fans of 'Calamity Jane' the movie will be just as intoxicated &amp; will fall in love with our production just as much, &amp; I think the principal reason for that is of course this iconic central character &amp; when you think of Calamity Jane as a character in history she's an incredibly rich detailed dynamic sort of leading role. Then of course when you add to that real person Doris Day &amp; her incredible portrayal on film, &amp; then we're blessed with Jodie Prenger taking the title role in our production I think it sort of means all of the ingredients are just coming together at the right time.

And Jodie's extraordinary because of course she has all of the modern sensibilities that are attractive to us in a leading performer but she also has a great appreciation of the past &amp; the line[&lt;/small&gt;age&lt;small&gt;]&lt;/small&gt;  of those sort of incredible Broadway performances &amp; those performers &amp; I think on top of that Jodie's relationship with her audience &amp; her sense of humanity, of warmth, &amp; chutzpah &amp; life are just intoxicating. Jodie's got all of the technical ability: that's a given but it's the star quality, that sort of thing: that spell that you can't quite quantify but of course Doris Day had in the film &amp; we're blessed that Jodie brings in such extraordinary generous bucketfuls to this production.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"/&gt;

! Jodie Prenger on the role of Calamity Jane
|-
| She &lt;small&gt;ie. the historical Calamity Jane&lt;/small&gt; was obviously quite a gal, &amp; there are so many stories about her, both for her &amp; against her. Her own account of her life is, as you’d suspect, very positive &amp; very colourful. Other people who knew her were less enthusiastic. She was certainly feisty &amp; very gutsy. But in the end all I can do is play her as she’s been written for the show, larger than life but with a vulnerable side. And I rather like those two contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jodie Prenger’s journey from reality TV to the West End|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/what-s-on/theatre/jodie-prenger-s-journey-from-reality-tv-to-the-west-end-1-7060547|accessdate=2018-05-14|work=Yorkshire Post|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| "The highfalutin' way to describe director Richard Carroll's 'Calamity Jane' is to say its abundant meta-theatrics put a contemporary, ironic frame around an old-fashioned musical, revealing fresh insights. The perky simplicity of the 1953 Doris Day film&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;gives way to a much more nuanced 21st-century take on a mid-20th-century interpretation of an unconventional 19th-century woman&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;The low-falutin' truth is that along with being outstandingly clever, 'Calamity Jane' is gut-bustingly funny and has an extraordinarily generous heart."

"Crucially, it is blessed with a central performance as fine as any seen on our musical stages since, I don't know, forever. Virginia Gay's Calamity ''is'' a roiling mass of powerful contradictions'':'' physically strong and emotionally insecure'','' she can ride and shoot with the best of them but off a horse is a klutz; she’s blustery and bashful; resourceful and inept.
Most of all, she is desperate to be loved and perhaps it doesn't really matter by whom. Whether Gay is assiduously tending to the wounds of dashing Lieutenant Danny Gilmartin (Matthew Pearce), getting domestic with imported pin-up Katie Brown (Laura Bunting) or discovering&lt;small&gt;...&lt;/small&gt;that her old sparring mate Wild Bill Hickok (Anthony Gooley) feels something for her, her eagerness makes Calam achingly vulnerable."

"Carroll’s production makes having a tiny budget look like a brilliant artistic choice. With music director Nigel Ubrihien at the upright piano there’s a band of precisely one, augmented by cast members on guitar, ukulele, trombone, accordion and tuba. As there are only seven actors, Ubrihien is conscripted into the ensemble, as is the audience. Participation has never seemed so natural. Sheridan Harbridge, Rob Johnson and Tony Taylor round out the whip-smart acting team in a variety of secondary roles that provide comedy gold of the highest grade, designer Lauren Peters’s Old West saloon is beautifully lit by Trent Suidgeest and Cameron Mitchell’s choreography is a hoot. Adding to the general delight is the truly gorgeous score by Sammy Fain (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics), blissfully heard unamplified."

"I confidently predict 'Calamity Jane' will get a standing ovation from the entire house at every performance. I have my reasons, but see for yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/stage/calamity-jane-21stcentury-take-on-contradictions-of-an-old-west-heroine/news-story/82eb082d6ccdee912fd500680b343dad|title=Subscribe to The Australian - Newspaper home delivery, website, iPad, iPhone &amp; Android apps|website=www.theaustralian.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was marketed by the [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Bayer|Bayer A.G.]] in the late 1990s, competing with [[Pfizer Inc.|Pfizer]]'s highly successful [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor). Cerivastatin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001, due to reports of fatal [[rhabdomyolysis]].

During [[postmarketing surveillance]], 52 deaths were reported in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant [[renal failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Furberg CD, Pitt B|title=Withdrawal of cerivastatin from the world market|journal=Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med|year=2001|volume=2|page=205&amp;ndash;207|pmid=11806796|doi=10.1186/cvm-2-5-205|pmc=59524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risks were higher in patients using [[fibrate]]s, mainly [[gemfibrozil]] (Lopid), and in patients using the highest (0.8&amp;nbsp;mg/day) dose of cerivastatin.

This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 times that of the other [[statin]]s.

== Structure and reactivity ==
Cerivastatin consists of a fluorophenyl linked to a pyridine. The pyridine has two propanyl groups, one methoxy group and dihydroxyheptanoic acid. The dihydroxyheptanoic acid group is the functional part of the molecule. This part will bind to the HMG-CoA reductase making it unavailable for HMG-CoA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00439]&lt;/ref&gt; Cerivastatin is a pure synthetic drug, produced to create a more potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Cerivastatin was the most potent inhibitor with an inhibitory constant of 0.5 µg/L, which made it already effective at a low dose. It is taken up orally as tablets, where it is combined with sodium salt. The IUPAC name is then (+)-(3R,5S,6E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,6-diisopropyl-5-methoxymethylpyridin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid monosodium salt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-200039020-00002#Sec1], 7.Mück W. 2000. Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Cerivastatin. Clinical Pharmacokinetics 39(2):99-116&lt;/ref&gt; Cerivastatin sodium (C22H33FNO3Na) is administered orally via a tablet. The molecular weight is 481.5 g/mol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00439]&lt;/ref&gt; It is odorless and it is soluble in water, methanol and ethanol. Under acidic circumstances, it undergoes cyclization to form pyridinolactone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-200039020-00002#Sec1], 7.Mück W. 2000.

== Mechanism of action ==
Five main classes of agents can be used to treat hyperlipidemia, a condition that comes with high cholesterol levels. Those are bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, probucol and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Cerivastatin mainly acts by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA-reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme step in cholesterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1527-3466.1998.tb00357.x/pdf], 8.

Cerivastatin is a synthetic and enantiomerically pure inhibitor of the reductase, meaning it can fit into the enzyme’s active site, and therefore compete with the substrate HMG-CoA, which is the native substrate for the reductase.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.2165%2F00003495-200666020-00002.pdf], 11.	Laufs U, Custodis F, Böhm M (2006). “HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors in Chronic Heart Failure”. Drugs, 66: 145&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the competition, the rate of mevalonate production by the enzyme is reduced. This also means that the rates subsequent biosynthesis is reduced, since less starting material is available.  Eventually, this will lead to lower cholesterol levels.

The location of cholesterol biosynthesis and inhibition of HMG-CoA is of significance, since most circulating cholesterol originates from internal production, rather than the diet. If the liver cannot produce more cholesterol, the cholesterol levels in the blood will decrease. Also, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors cause secondary up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors, with increased LDL-cholesterol clearance and reduction of both total and LDL cholesterol in the serum.

== Metabolism ==
Cerivastatin is metabolized via the hepatic pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, K.E.; Turner, N.A.; Statins and myocardial remodeling: cell and molecular pathways; expert reviews in molecular medicine, 2011, 13 (22): pp.1-18&lt;/ref&gt; ''In vitro'' studies with human liver cells showed that two metabolic pathways are equally important; demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether and hydroxylation at one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jlr.org/content/23/3/466.full.pdf+html], Miettinen TA (1982). “Diurnal variation of cholesterol precursors squalene and methyl sterols in human plasma lipoproteins”. The Journal of Lipid Research, 23: 466-473&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/dmd/25/3/321.full.pdf], Boberg M, Angerbauer R, Fey P, Kanhai WK, Karl W, Kern A, Ploschke J, Radtke M (1996). “Metabolism of cerivastatin by human liver microsomes in vitro”. Drug Metabolism and Dispersion, 25 (3): 321-331&lt;/ref&gt; Demethylation is catalysed by the enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which generates a metabolite that is known as M-1 in the cerivastatin metabolite pathway. Hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C8, which generates the major active metabolite, M-23.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00439]&lt;/ref&gt; M-1 and M-23 are, like cerivastatin, pharmacologically active, with comparable potencies. Combination of the latter leads to another minor metabolite, that is not detectable in plasma, which is also known as M-24. Following a 0.8 mg dose of cerivastatin, the mean steady state C¬max values for cerivastatin, M-1 and M-23 were 12.7, 0.55 and 1.4 μg/L, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the cholesterol-lowering effect is mostly due to the cerivastatin itself.

== Efficacy, toxicity and side effects ==
=== Efficacy and toxicity ===
The inhibitory activity of cerivastatin was compared to that of other statins, specifically lovostatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. This comparison was made by determining the IC50 values of each compound. These values were 77 nM, 66 nM and 176 nM for these statins, respectively, while the value for cerivastatin was found to be 1.1 nM.
Using Dixon plots, the inhibitory constant of cerivastatin was found to be 1.3 x 10-9 M, which is over 100 times lower than the inhibitory constant of lovastatin, known to be 150 x 10-9 M.
To compare cerivastatin activity to that of other statins, its IC25 value was also determined for various types of human smooth muscle cells: cells from the left internal mammary artery (HSMC), cornea fibroblasts (HCF), myoblasts from striated muscle (HM) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The activity in these groups of muscle cells was compared to the activity of the statins listed above, as well as atorvastatin and Fluvastatin.

The pharmacological results from cerivastatin show that it is the most active HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor among reported statins. Due to its high enzyme affinity, it would seem to offer ultra-low dose therapy in the microgram range. However, due to its relatively severe adverse effects in comparison to other statins, its market use was discontinued.

The strengths of the available cerivastatin medicine ranged from 0.2 - 0.8 mg, resulting in an actual dose of 1.9 - 13.1 μg/kg body weight for which rhabdomyolysis has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Kalaria, D.; Wassenaar, W.; “Rhabdomyolysis and cerivastatin: Was it a problem of dose?” CMAJ, 167 (7), 2002, p. 737&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mechanism of the cerivastatin induced myopathy is not exactly known,&lt;ref&gt;Moßhammer, D.; Schaeffeler, E.; Schwab, M.; Mörike, K.; Mechanisms and assessment of statin-related muscular adverse effects.

N Engl J Med, 346: 539-540&lt;/ref&gt; concomitantly, and there is a known interaction between these drugs and cerivastatin. There are 31 cerivastatin-related deaths reported in the USA and a further 21 deaths worldwide. There were also 385 cases of non-fatal rhabdomyolysis reported among the estimated 700.000 users in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[doi:10.1001/jama.292.21.2622. {{PMID|15572720}}.], Psaty BM, Furberg CD, Ray WA, Weiss NS (2004). "Potential for conflict of interest in the evaluation of suspected adverse drug reactions: use of cerivastatin and risk of rhabdomyolysis". JAMA. 292 (21): 2622–31&lt;/ref&gt; In 12 of the 31 reported deaths of cerivastatin-related rhabdomyolysis in the US the cerivastatin-Gemfibrozil interaction was implicated, while in 7 of the 31 fatal cases in the US, cervastatin was combined with Iovstatin.[19][20] The reporting rate of fatal rhabdomyolysis in association with Cerivastatin monotherapy is 1.9 per million prescriptions, which is 10-50 times as high as for other statins.&lt;ref&gt;Staffa JA, Chang J, Green L (2002). “Cerivastatin and Reports of Fatal Rhabdomyolysis”. N Engl J Med, 346: 539-540&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adverse effects ===
Cerivastatin was generally found to be well tolerated, side effects being rare. Minor side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, gas, heartburn, nasal congestion and headache. Patients with alcoholic or other liver diseases were advised to use cerivastatin with caution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/dmd/25/3/321.full.pdf], 15.

'''City Challenge''' is an event organisation that holds motorsports, arts and entertainment events in major city centres. It has its headquarters in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

==History==
City Challenge CEO Hartmut Beyer started to plan a race circuit downtown [[Bucharest]], Romania, in 2004. After fulfilling the role as organiser and promoter for the [[FIA GT Championship]] rounds in Bucharest 2007, 2008 (under the name of [[Bucharest Ring]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucharest-ring.com/news.php?id=58 ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Budapest, Hungary, in 2009, Mr. Beyer and his team performed negotiations with multiple cities around the world in order to establish its own GT championship that will take place from 2013 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport-total.com/mehr/news/2012/08/City-Challenge_Neue_GT3-Rennserie_auf_Stadtkursen_12080308.html |title=Sonstiges: City-Challenge: Neue GT3-Rennserie auf Stadtkursen? - Mehr Motorsport bei |publisher=Motorsport-total.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==City Challenge Baku==
The inaugural Baku City Challenge event was being held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], during 26–28  October 2012. The event attracted 42,000 spectators over the weekend, about 150 national and international journalists were reporting about the event and 100 crew members of the TV production provided the footage either live or as highlight in over 120 countries, reaching a total of 650 million households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citychallenge.com/baku/news/bnbroadcasters |accessdate=February 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028052953/http://www.citychallenge.com/baku/news/bnbroadcasters |archivedate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On day time, the Historic Grand Prix and the [[Gymkhana (motorsport)|Gymkhana Drift Series]] acted as support races of the Baku event. The evening show programme included the “CoGo show”, featuring international artists, and on-stage performances by, among others, DJ Pancho and [[Rafet el Roman]]. 

A total of 13 teams, 24 cars of the makes BMW, McLaren, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Chevrolet participated during the City Challenge event on the 2,144 metres long racetrack that was homologated with FIA grade 3. Among the drivers were five times DTM champion Bernd Schneider, former Formula 1 driver and 2008 Le Mans class winner [[Jos Verstappen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilsport.com/jos-verstappen-compete-city-challenge-gt-race-baku-azerbaijan---102631.html |title=Jos Verstappen to compete in City Challenge GT Race Baku |publisher=automobilsport.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 F1 World Champion and Indy 500 winner [[Jacques Villeneuve]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auto123.com/en/news/gt-jacques-villeneuve-to-race-in-azerbaijan?artid=147214 |title=GT: Jacques Villeneuve to race in Azerbaïjan - Car News |publisher=Auto123 |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mathias Lauda]], son of three-time F1 World Champion [[Niki Lauda]].

The City Challenge GT main race was won by drivers Frédéric Makowiecki and Stef Dusseldorp, driving the McLaren MP4-12C GT3 for HEXIS Racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/gt-hexis-mclaren-wins-city-challenge-baku/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030110323/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/gt-hexis-mclaren-wins-city-challenge-baku/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-30 |title=SPEED &amp;#124; The Motors On FOX Blog |publisher=Auto-racing.speedtv.com |date=2014-05-04 |accessdate=2014-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Kechele and Mathias Lauda driving the BMW Z4 GT3 for Vita4One Racing Team were ranked second and the podium was concluded by Yelmer Buurman and Nicolaus Mayr-Melnhof, also driving a BMW Z4 GT3 for Vita4One Racing Team.

==Future==
City Challenge has the ambition to grow to a stable event calendar that contains a minimum of five events in Europe, Middle East, America and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/102251 |title=Azerbaijan City Challenge street race pushed back three weeks - GT news |publisher=Autosport.Com |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar is to be announced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5145">''[[Computer crime]]'', or '''[[cybercrime]] in Canada''', is an evolving international phenomenon. People and businesses in 
a and other countries may be affected by computer crimes that may, or may not originate within the borders of their country. From a Canadian perspective, 'computer crime' may be considered to be defined by the Council of Europe – [[Convention on Cybercrime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185|title=Convention on Cybercrime|work=www.coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; (November 23, 2001). Canada contributed, and is a signatory, to this international  of criminal offences involving the use of computers:

* Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems;
* Computer-related offences;
* Content-related offences;
* Offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights; and
* Ancillary liability.

Canada is also a signatory to the [[Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/189|title=Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime|work=www.coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems (January 28, 2003). As of July 25, 2008 Canada had not yet ratified the Convention on Cybercrime or the Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalization of acts of a Discriminatory nature committed through computer systems.

== Canadian computer crime laws ==

The [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] contains a set of laws dealing with [[computer crime]] issues.

=== Criminal Offences Contained in the Convention on Cybercrime (November 23, 2001) ===

As Canada has not yet ratified the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] its Criminal Code may not fully address the areas of criminal law set out in the Convention on Cybercrime.

==== Computer-related offences ====
* Computer-related forgery
* Computer-related fraud

==== Content-related offences ====
* Offences related to child pornography
==== Offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights ====

==== Ancillary liability ====
* Attempt and aiding or abetting
* Corporate liability

==== Criminal offences in the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime ====

As Canada has not yet ratified this [[Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime]], its Criminal Code may not fully address the following criminal offences:

* Dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems

In [[military]] terminology, '''desertion''' is the abandonment of a [[military duty|duty]] or [[Military base|post]] without permission (a [[Pass (military)|pass]], [[Shore leave|liberty]] or [[Leave (U.S. military)|leave]]) and is done with the intention of not returning. In contrast, '''unauthorized absence''' ('''UA''') or '''absence without leave''' (U.S.: '''AWOL''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|w|ɒ|l}}; British and Commonwealth: '''AWL''') refers to a temporary absence.

==Desertion versus absence without leave==
{{anchor|Absence_without_leave}}
In the [[United States Army]], [[British Armed Forces]], [[Australian Defence Force]], [[New Zealand Defence Force]], and [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]], military personnel will become "'''AWOL'''" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|w|ɒ|l}}; U.S.A. and Canada: '''absence without leave'''&lt;ref name=UCMJ86/&gt;) or "'''AWL'''" (UK and Australia: '''absent without leave'''){{citation needed|date=June 2016}} if absent from their post without a valid [[Pass (military)|pass]], [[Shore leave|liberty]] or [[Leave (U.S. military)|leave]]. The [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy]], and [[United States Coast Guard]] generally refer to this as "'''unauthorized absence'''" or "'''UA'''". Personnel are dropped from their [[Military organization|unit]] rolls after thirty days and then listed as ''deserters''; however, as a matter of U.S. [[Military justice|military law]], desertion is not measured by time away from the unit, but rather:
* by leaving or remaining absent from their unit, organization, or place of duty, where there has been a determined [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to not return;
* if that intent is determined to be to avoid hazardous duty or shirk contractual obligation;
* if they enlist or accept an appointment in the same or another branch of service without disclosing the fact that they have not been properly separated from current service.&lt;ref name=UCMJ85/&gt;

People who are away for more than thirty days but return voluntarily or indicate a credible intent to return may still be considered AWOL. Those who are away for fewer than thirty days but can credibly be shown to have no intent to return (for example, by joining the armed forces of another country) may nevertheless be tried for ''desertion''. In rare occasions, they may be tried for [[treason]] if enough evidence is found.

'''Missing movement''' is another term used to describe when members of the armed forces fail to arrive at the appointed time to deploy (or "move out") with their assigned unit, ship, or aircraft. In the [[United States Armed Forces]], this is a violation of the Article 87 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). The offense is similar to absence without leave but may draw more severe punishment.&lt;ref name=UCMJ87/&gt;

'''Failure to repair'''&lt;!-- "Repair" rather than "Appear" is the correct word, according to the cited sources. --&gt; consists of missing a formation or failing to appear at an assigned place and time when so ordered. It is a lesser offense within article 86 of the UCMJ.&lt;ref name=Anderson1989/&gt;

==Australia==
[[File:Cartoon by Cecil Lawrence Hartt about an Australian soldier reporting back after six months AWL.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1918 cartoon by [[Cecil Hartt]] making light of the high incidence of soldiers going absent without leave in the  Australian Imperial Force]]
During World War I, the Australian Government refused to allow members of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) to be executed for desertion, despite pressure from the British Government and military to do so. The AIF had the highest rate of soldiers going absent without leave of any of the national contingents in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], and the proportion of soldiers who deserted was also higher than that of other forces on the Western Front in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Peter|title=Between Acceptance and Refusal - Soldiers' Attitudes Towards War (Australia)|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/between_acceptance_and_refusal_-_soldiers_attitudes_towards_war_australia|website=International Encyclopedia of the First World War|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austria==

In 2011, [[Vienna]] decided to honour Austrian [[Wehrmacht]] deserters.&lt;ref name=guardian9606158/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC13179406/&gt; In 2014, on October, 24th a [[Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Military Justice]] was inaugurated on Vienna's [[Ballhausplatz]] by [[Austria]]'s President [[Heinz Fischer]]. The monument was created by German artist [[Olaf Nicolai]] and is located opposite the President's office and the Austrian [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellery]]. The inscription on top of the three step sculpture features a poem by Scottish poet [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] (1924–2006) with just two words: ''all alone''.

==France==
During WWI approximately 600 French soldiers were executed for desertion.&lt;ref name="Shot at Dawn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shot at Dawn|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-shotatdawn.html|website=The Heritage of the Great War|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
During the First World War, only 18 Germans who deserted were executed.&lt;ref name="Shot at Dawn"/&gt; In contrast of the Germans who deserted the [[Wehrmacht]], 15,000 men were executed.  In June 1988 the Initiative for the Creation of a Memorial to Deserters came to life in [[Ulm]]. A central idea was, "Desertion is not reprehensible, war is".&lt;ref name=Hatlie2005/&gt;

==New Zealand==
{{see also|List of New Zealand soldiers executed during World War I}}
During WWI a total of 28 New Zealand soldiers were sentenced to death for desertion; of these, five were executed.&lt;ref name="First New Zealand Soldier Executed"&gt;{{cite web|title=First New Zealand Soldier Executed|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/first-new-zealand-soldier-executed|website=New Zealand History Online|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These soldiers  were posthumously pardoned in 2000 through the ''Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act''.&lt;ref name="First New Zealand Soldier Executed"/&gt; Those who deserted before reaching the front were imprisoned in what were claimed to be harsh conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZTR19180928.2.30.3|title=Camp or Starvation?

==Soviet Union==
[[Order No. 270]], dated August 16, 1941, was issued by [[Joseph Stalin]]. The order required superiors to shoot deserters on the spot.&lt;ref name=Stalinism/&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2015}} Their family members were subjected to arrest.&lt;ref name=Roberts2006/&gt; [[Order No. 227]], dated July 28, 1942, directed that each [[Army (Soviet Army)|Army]] must create "blocking detachments" ([[barrier troops]]) which would shoot "cowards" and fleeing panicked troops at the rear.&lt;ref name=Roberts2006/&gt;

===Soviet desertion in the Afghan Civil War===
Many Soviet soldier deserters of the Soviet War in Afghanistan  explain their reasons for desertion as political and in response to internal disorganization and disillusionment regarding their position in the war.&lt;ref name=Borovik1990/&gt; Analyses of desertion rates argue that motivations were far less ideological than individual accounts claim. Desertion rates increased prior to announcements of upcoming operations, and were highest during the summer and winter. Seasonal desertions were probably a response to the harsh weather conditions of the winter and immense field work required in the summer. A significant jump in desertion in 1989 when the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan may suggest a higher concern regarding returning home, rather than an overall opposition towards the war itself.&lt;ref name=Sinno01/&gt;

====Inter-ethnic explanation for desertion====
In the beginning of the [[War in Afghanistan (1978-present)#Soviet invasion and withdrawal|Soviet invasion]], the majority of Soviet forces were soldiers of [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asian republics]].&lt;ref name=Sinno01/&gt; The Soviets believed that shared ideologies between Muslim Central Asians and Afghan soldiers would build trust and morale within the army. However, Central Asians' longstanding historical frustrations with Moscow degraded soldiers' willingness to fight for the Red Army. As Afghan desertion grew and Soviet opposition was strengthened within Afghanistan, the Soviet plan overtly backfired.&lt;ref name=Feifer2009/&gt;

The personal histories of Central Asian ethnic groups – especially between [[Soviet Central Asia#Soviet Republics|Pashtuns, Uzbeks, and Tajiks]], caused tension within the Soviet military. Non-Russian ethnic groups easily related the situation in Afghanistan to Communist takeover of their own states' forced induction into the USSR.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; Ethnic Russians suspected Central Asians of opposition, and fighting within the army was prevalent.&lt;ref name=Feifer2009/&gt;

Upon entering Afghanistan, many Central Asians were exposed to a Koran for the first time uninfluenced by Soviet propagandist versions, and felt a stronger connection towards the opposition than their own comrades.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; The highest rates of desertion were found among Border Troops, ranging from 60–80% during the first year of the Soviet invasion.&lt;ref name=Sinno02/&gt; In these areas, strong ethnic clashes and cultural factors influenced desertion.

As Afghan soldiers continued to desert the Soviet army, a united [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Islamic Alliance for the Liberation of Afghanistan]] began to form. Moderates and fundamentalists banded together to oppose Soviet intervention. The Islamic ideology solidified a strong base of opposition by January 1980, overriding ethnic, tribal, geographic and economic differences among Afghans willing to fight the Soviet invasion, which attracted Central Asian deserters.&lt;ref name=Feifer2009/&gt; By March 1980, the Soviet army made an executive decision to replace Central Asian troops with the European sectors of the USSR to avoid further religious and ethnic complications, drastically reducing Soviet forces.&lt;ref name=Sinno02/&gt;

====Soviet disillusionment upon entering the war====
Soviet soldiers entered the war under the impression that their roles were primarily related to organization of Afghan forces and society. Soviet media portrayed the Soviet intervention as a necessary means of protecting the Communist uprising from outside opposition.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; Propaganda declared that Soviets were providing aid to villagers and improving Afghanistan by planting trees, improving public buildings and “generally acting as good neighbors”.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; Upon entering Afghanistan, Soviet soldiers became immediately aware of the falsity of the reported situation.

In major cities, Afghan youth that originally supported the leftist movement soon turned to Soviet oppositional forces for patriotic and religious reasons.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; The opposition built resistance in cities, calling Soviet soldiers infidels that were forcing an imperialist Communist invasive government on Afghanistan's people.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; As Afghan troops continued to abandon the Soviet army to support the mujahideen, they became anti-Russian and antigovernment.&lt;ref name=Kakar136/&gt; Opposition forces emphasized the Soviets' atheism, demanding support for the Muslim faith from civilians.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; The hostility shown towards soldiers, who entered the war believing their assistance was requested, grew defensive. The opposition circulated pamphlets within Soviet camps stationed in cities, calling for Afghan freedom from the aggressive Communist influence and a right to establish their own government.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt;

The native Afghan army fell from 90,000 to 30,000 by mid-1980, forcing Soviets into more extreme combative positions. The mujahideen's widespread presence among Afghan civilians in rural regions made it difficult for Soviet soldiers to distinguish between the civilians they believed they were fighting for and the official opposition. Soldiers that had entered the war with idealistic viewpoints of their roles were quickly disillusioned.&lt;ref name=Feifer2009/&gt;

====Problems in Soviet army structure &amp; living standards====
The structure of the Soviet army, in comparison to the [[Afghan mujahideen|mujahideen]], set the Soviets at a serious fighting disadvantage. While the mujahideen structure was based on kinship and social cohesion, the Soviet army was bureaucratic. Because of this, mujahideen could significantly weaken the Soviet army by the elimination of a field commander or officer. Resistance forces were locally based, more ready to address and mobilize the Afghan population for support. The Soviet army was centrally organized; its regime structure emphasized rank and position, paying less attention to the well-being and effectiveness of its army.&lt;ref name=Sinno01/&gt;

The initial Soviet plan relied on Afghan troops' support in the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. The majority of the Afghan army support crumbled easily as forces lacked strong ideological support for Communism from the beginning.&lt;ref name=Kakar175/&gt;

The Afghan army, comprising 100,000 men before 1978, was reduced to 15,000 within the first year of the Soviet invasion.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; Of the Afghan troops that remained, many were considered untrustworthy to Soviet troops.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt; Afghans that deserted often took artillery with them, supplying the mujahideen. Soviet troops, to fill Afghan soldiers' place, were pushed into mountainous tribal regions of the East. Soviet tanks and modern warfare was ineffective in the rural, mountainous regions of Afghanistan. Mujahideen tactics of ambush prevented Soviets from developing successful counterattacks.&lt;ref name=Bradsher1983/&gt;

In 1980, the Soviet army began to rely on smaller and more cohesive units, a response to mirror mujahideen tactics. A decrease in unit size, while solving organizational issues, promoted field leaders to head more violent and aggressive missions, promoting Soviet desertion. Often, small forces would engage in rapes, looting, and general violence beyond what higher ranks ordered, increasing negative sanctions in undesirable locations.&lt;ref name=Sinno02/&gt;

Within the Soviet army, serious drug and alcohol problems significantly reduced the effectiveness of soldiers.&lt;ref name=Sinno02/&gt; Resources became further depleted as soldiers pushed into the mountains; drugs were rampantly abused and available, often supplied by Afghans. Supplies of heating fuel, wood, and food ran low at bases. Soviet soldiers often resorted to trading weapons and ammunition in exchange for drugs or food.&lt;ref name=Feifer2009/&gt; As morale decreased and infections of hepatitis and typhus spread, soldiers became further disheartened.

====Soviet deserters to the Mujahideen====
Interviews with Soviet soldier deserters confirm that much of Soviet desertion was in response to widespread Afghan opposition rather than personal aggravation towards the Soviet army. Armed with modern artillery against ill-equipped villagers, Soviet soldiers developed a sense of guilt for the widespread killing of innocent civilians and their unfair artillery advantage. Soviet deserters found support and acceptance within Afghan villages. After entering the mujahideen, many deserters came to recognize the falsity of Soviet propaganda from the beginning. Unable to legitimize the unnecessary killing and mistreatment of the Afghan people, many deserters could not face returning home and justifying their own actions and the unnecessary deaths of comrades. Upon deserting to the mujahideen, soldiers immersed themselves into Afghan culture. Hoping to rectify their position as the enemy, deserters learned the Afghan language and converted to Islam.&lt;ref name=Borovik1990/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Historically, one who was paid to enlist and then deserted could be arrested under a type of writ known as ''[[arrestando ipsum qui pecuniam recepit]]'', or "For arresting one who received money".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0187&amp;q1=arrestando|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences: Arboreus - artery|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoleonic Wars===
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] desertion was a massive drain on British army resources, despite the threat of court martial and the possibility of the capital punishment for the crime. Many deserters were harbored by citizens who were sympathetic to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/628301|title=Desertion from the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|first=Kevin|last=Linch|date=11 August 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=49|issue=4|pages=808–828|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===

"306 British and Commonwealth soldiers were executed for...desertion during World War I," records the [[Shot at Dawn Memorial]]. Of these, 25 were Canadian, 22 Irishmen and five New Zealanders.&lt;ref name="Shot at Dawn"/&gt;

"During the period between August 1914 and March 1920 more than 20,000 servicemen were convicted by courts-martial of offences which carried the death sentence. Only 3,000 of those men were ordered to be put to death and of those just over 10% were executed."&lt;ref name=BBC1399983/&gt;

===World War II===
Throughout [[World War 2]], almost 100,000 British troops deserted from the armed forces, some of which due to French and Italian women. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite article|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/books/the-deserters-a-world-war-ii-history-by-charles-glass.html | title=Into the Lives of Three Deserters Who Did Not Have a Good War | date=9 June 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===
On May 28, 2006, the UK military reported over 1,000 absent without leave since the beginning of the [[Iraq War]], with 566 still missing since 2005 and that year to date. The Ministry of Defence said that levels of absence were fairly constant and "only one person has been found guilty of deserting the Army since 1989".&lt;ref name=BBC5024104 /&gt;

==United States==

===Legal definition===
[[File:" A Black Mark for the Squad. A.W.O.L." - NARA - 512701.jpg|thumb|A United States wartime poster deprecating absence]]
According to the United States [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], desertion is defined as:&lt;br&gt; 
"(a) Any member of the armed forces who–&lt;br&gt;
(1) without authority goes or remains absent from his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to remain away therefrom permanently;&lt;br /&gt;
(2) quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service; or&lt;br /&gt;
(3) without being regularly separated from one of the armed forces enlists or accepts an appointment in the same or another one of the armed forces without fully disclosing the fact that he has not been regularly separated, or enters any foreign armed service except when authorized by the United States; is guilty of desertion.&lt;br&gt;
(b) Any commissioned officer of the armed forces who, after tender of his resignation and before notice of its acceptance, quits his post or proper duties without leave and with intent to remain away therefrom permanently is guilty of desertion.&lt;br&gt;
(c) Any person found guilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the desertion or attempt to desert occurs at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct."&lt;ref&gt;Sub Chapter 10, Punitive Articles, Section 885, Article 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===
The desertion rate for American soldiers in the [[War of 1812]] was 12.7%, according to available service records. Desertion was especially common in 1814, when enlistment bonuses were increased from $16 (1h 4m) (1h 4m) to $124, (8h 17m) (8h 17m) inducing many men to desert one unit and enlist in another to get two bonuses.&lt;ref name=Stagg1986/&gt;

===Mexican–American War===
The desertion rate in the U.S. Army was 8.3% (9,200 out of 111,000), compared to 12.7% during the War of 1812 and usual peacetime rates of about 14.8% per year.&lt;ref name=Coffman1988/&gt; Many men deserted in order to join another U.S. unit and get a second enlistment bonus. Others deserted because of the miserable conditions in camp, or were using the army to get free transportation to California, where they deserted to join the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=Foos2002/&gt; Several hundred deserters went over to the Mexican side; nearly all were recent immigrants from Europe with weak ties to the United States. The most famous group was the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]], about half of whom were Catholics from Ireland, anti-Catholic prejudice reportedly being another reason for desertion. The Mexicans issued [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] and leaflets enticing U.S. soldiers with promises of money, [[land grant]]s, and [[Commission (document)|officers' commissions]]. Mexican [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] shadowed the U.S. Army, and captured men who took unauthorized leave or fell out of the ranks. The guerrillas coerced these men to join the Mexican ranks—threatening to kill them if they failed to comply. The generous promises proved illusory for most deserters, who risked execution if captured by U.S. forces. About fifty of the San Patricios were tried and hanged following their capture at [[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]] in August 1847.&lt;ref name=Foos2002/&gt;

In the [[Mexican–American War]], high desertion rates were a major problem for the Mexican army, depleting forces on the eve of battle. Most of the soldiers were peasants who had a loyalty to their village and family but not to the generals who conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, never well paid, under-equipped and only partially trained, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the Americans. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.&lt;ref name=Meed2003/&gt;

===American Civil War ===
{{main|Confederate States Army#Desertion}}
During the American Civil War, both the Union and Confederacy had a desertion problem. From its 2.5 million or so men, the [[Union Army]] saw about 200,000 desertions. Over 100,000 deserted the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]], which was less than a million men and possibly as little as a third the size of the Union one.&lt;ref name=North/&gt;&lt;ref name=South/&gt;

New York suffered 44,913 desertions by the war's end, Pennsylvania recorded 24,050, with Ohio reporting desertions at 18,354.&lt;ref name=North/&gt; About 1 out of 3 deserters returned to their regiments, either voluntarily or after being arrested and being sent back. Many of the desertions were by "professional" bounty men, men who would enlist to collect the often large cash bonuses and then desert at the earliest opportunity to repeat another enlistment elsewhere. If caught they would face execution; otherwise it could prove a very lucrative criminal enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Smith Bennett, "Draft Resistance and Rioting." in Maggi M. Morehouse and Zoe Trodd, eds., ''Civil War America: A Social and Cultural History with Primary Sources'' (2013) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levine, "Draft evasion in the North during the Civil War, 1863–1865." ''Journal of American History'' (1981): 816–834. [http://www.oah.org/site/assets/documents/08_JAH_1981_levine.pdf  online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192058/http://www.oah.org/site/assets/documents/08_JAH_1981_levine.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of Confederate deserters was officially 103,400.&lt;ref name=South/&gt; Desertion was a major factor for the Confederacy in the last two years of the war. According to Mark A. Weitz Confederate soldiers fought to defend their families, not a nation.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Weitz, ''A higher duty: desertion among Georgia troops during the Civil War'' (U of Nebraska Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a hegemonic "planter class" brought Georgia into the war with "little support from non-slaveholders" (p.&amp;nbsp;12), and the ambivalence of non-slaveholders toward secession, he maintains, was the key to understanding desertion. The privations of the home front and camp life, combined with the terror of battle, undermined the weak attachment of southern soldiers to the Confederacy. For Georgian troops, [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's march]] through their home counties triggered the most desertions.

[[File:The execution of a deserter in the Federal Camp, Alexandria, Wellcome V0041826.jpg|thumb|The execution of a U.S. deserter in the Federal Camp, Alexandria]]
Adoption of a localist identity caused soldiers to desert as well. When soldiers implemented a local identity, they neglected to think of themselves as Southerners fighting a Southern cause. When they replaced their Southern identity with their previous local identity, they lost their motive to fight and, therefore, deserted the army.&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. Bearman, "Desertion as localism: Army unit solidarity and group norms in the US Civil War." ''Social Forces'' 70#2 (1991): 321-342. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580242 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing threat to the solidarity of the Confederacy was dissatisfaction in the Appalachian mountain districts caused by lingering unionism and a distrust of the slave power.  Many of their soldiers deserted, returned home, and formed a military force that fought off regular army units trying to punish them.&lt;ref&gt;Rand Dotson, "'The grave and scandalous evil infected to your people': The erosion of Confederate loyalty in Floyd County, Virginia."

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27567243 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  North Carolina lost 23% of its soldiers (24,122) to desertion. The state provided more soldiers per capita than any other Confederate state, and had more deserters as well.&lt;ref&gt;Scott King-Owen, "Conditional Confederates: Absenteeism among Western North Carolina Soldiers, 1861–1865." ''Civil War History'' 57.4 (2011): 349-379. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v057/57.4.king-owen.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
Toward the end of [[World War I]], when the US eventually joined the war, desertion still occurred amongst American armed forces. One US Navy deserter, Henry Holscher, later joined a UK regiment and won the Military Medal. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite article | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-39589995 | title=US Navy 'jack-the-lad' deserter turned WW1 military hero | date= 15 April 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Over 20,000 American soldiers were tried and sentenced for desertion during World War II. Forty-nine were sentenced to death, though 48 of these death sentences were subsequently commuted. Only one US soldier, Private [[Eddie Slovik]], was executed for desertion in World War II.

===Vietnam War===
Approximately 50,000 American servicemen deserted during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=PNS2005/&gt; Some of these [[Canada and the Vietnam War#Deserters|migrated to Canada]]. Among those who deserted to Canada were [[Andy Barrie]], host of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio's [[Metro Morning]], and [[Jack Todd (journalist)|Jack Todd]], award-winning sports columnist for the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name=letthemstay/&gt; Other countries also gave asylum to deserted U.S. soldiers. For example, Sweden allows asylum for foreign soldiers deserting from war, if the war does not align with the current goals of Swedish foreign policy.

===Iraq War===
According to the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], more than 5,500 military personnel deserted in 2003–2004, following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion and occupation]].&lt;ref name=CBS2004/&gt; The number had reached about 8,000 by the first quarter of 2006.&lt;ref name=Nicholas2006/&gt; Another source states that since 2000, about 40,000 troops from all branches of the military have deserted. More than half of these served in the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=truthout2006/&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=March 2017}} Almost all of these soldiers deserted within the United States. There has been only one reported case of a desertion in Iraq. The Army, Navy, and Air Force reported 7,978 desertions in 2001, compared with 3,456 in 2005. The Marine Corps showed 1,603 Marines in desertion status in 2001. That had declined to 148 by 2005.&lt;ref name=Nicholas2006/&gt;

===Penalties===
In the United States, before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], deserters from the Army were [[flogging|flogged]]; after 1861, [[tattoo]]s or [[branding persons|branding]] were also used. The maximum U.S. penalty for desertion in wartime remains [[death penalty|death]], although this punishment was last applied to [[Eddie Slovik]] in 1945. No U.S. serviceman has received more than 24&amp;nbsp;months imprisonment for desertion or missing movement after September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=Branum2012/&gt;

A U.S. service member who is AWOL/UA may be punished with [[non-judicial punishment]] (NJP) or by [[court martial]] under Article 86 of the UCMJ for repeat or more severe offenses.&lt;ref name=UCMJ86/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCMJ15/&gt; Many AWOL/UA service members are also given a discharge in lieu of court-martial.&lt;ref name=Branum2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=usaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=usn/&gt;&lt;ref name=usmc/&gt;&lt;ref name=uscg/&gt;&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;

The 2012 edition of the United States [[Manual for Courts-Martial]] states that:{{quote|Any person found guilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the desertion or attempt to desert occurs at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref name=UCMJ85/&gt;}}

==Legal status of desertion in cases of war crime==
Under [[international law]], ultimate "[[duty]]" or "[[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" is not necessarily always to a "government" nor to "a superior," as seen in the fourth of the [[Nuremberg Principles]], which states:{{quote|text="The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him."}}

Although a soldier under direct orders, in battle, is normally not subject to prosecution for war crimes, there is legal language supporting a soldier's refusal to commit such crimes, in military contexts outside of immediate peril.

In 1998, [[UNCHR]] resolution 1998/77{{efn|''"[[Conscientious objection]] to military service: [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] resolution 1998/77"'' (1998), [[United Nations]] [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]}} recognized that "persons [already] performing military service may ''develop'' conscientious objections" while performing military service.&lt;ref name=UNHCHR01/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNHCHR02/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNHCHR03/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYU2000/&gt; This opens the possibility of desertion as a response to cases in which the soldier is required to perform crimes against humanity as part of his mandatory military duty.

The principle was tested unsuccessfully in the case of U.S. Army deserter [[Jeremy Hinzman]], which resulted in a Canadian [[Immigration and Refugee Board|federal immigration board]] rejecting refugee status to a deserter invoking Nuremberg Article IV.&lt;ref name=IRBC2005/&gt;

The execution of soldiers for desertion is controversial, particularly considering the age of some of the soldiers and the potential of shell-shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War One Executions|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world_war_one_executions.htm|website=History Learning Site|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Humanitarian Network''' is a network-of-networks, enabling a consortium of Volunteer and Technical Communities (V&amp;TCs) to interface with [[humanitarian organization]]s that seek their services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanitarians.com/: DHNetwork] Main website for the consortium: [http://digitalhumanitarians.com/ digitalhumanitarians.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As a community-based network, the DHN has a growing list of member-groups and organizations.

== Mission ==

The '''Digital Humanitarian Network'''’s (DHNetwork) website was launched on April 9, 2012 by its co-founders:

* Andrej Verity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.veritythink.com/: "Verity Think"] Blog from Andrej Verity.&lt;/ref&gt; [[OCHA]]
* Patrick Meier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irevolution.net/bio/: Patrick Meier's Biography] from Blog iRevolution.&lt;/ref&gt; [http://irevolution.net/ iRevolution]

The purpose is to '''support humanitarian organizations''' in their '''[[disaster response]]''' efforts around the world.&lt;ref name="newswatch.nationalgeographic"&gt;[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/12/19/digital-disaster-response/: "Digital Disaster Response to Typhoon Pablo"] by Patrick Meier.&lt;/ref&gt; The network consists of member '''V&amp;TCs''' (entities that manage networks of technically trained volunteers around the globe, who can be activated to backstop disaster response operations and produce information with limited turn over time). These groups have a wide range of skills from [[GIS]] mapping, crowdsourcing, and data analysis and collection, to volunteer management and process design. The DHNetwork puts groups that have existed for years under one umbrella and provides a single outlet for traditional responders to access the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techchange.org/2012/10/16/activation-successful-the-digital-humanitarian-network-simulation-at-iccm/: "Activation Successful: The Digital Humanitarian Network Simulation at ICCM"] at TechChange.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In recent crises, like the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], members of online technology communities have cooperated to gather, process and share crucial information resources to help [[aid agencies]] on the ground, without contributing to 'data noise', by focusing on the information needs of aid agencies and other responders. This collective action was recognised and legitimized after the Haiti earthquake when volunteer communities established a ''''network of networks'''' with the aim of concentrating the abilities online responders on the most urgent information needs during each new emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/02/crisis-mapping-haiti/: "How Crisis Mapping Saved Lives in Haiti"] by Patrick Meier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DHNetwork''', has been created precisely in order to coordinate their action&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapaction.org/more-news/300-teaming-up-with-the-digital-humanitarians.html: Article: "Teaming up with the Digital Humanitarians"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartdatacollective.com/kathryn1723/106266/big-data-natural-solution-disaster-relief: "Big Data: A Natural Solution for Disaster Relief"] by Kathryn Kelly.&lt;/ref&gt;  with, at its heart, a [http://digitalhumanitarians.com/coordinators '''coordinator's group''']. The network brings together many of the major V&amp;TCs thereby increasing their visibility both amongst themselves and amongst the traditional humanitarian community, and has defined a '''clear activation process''' between the VT&amp;Cs and coordinators, so that traditional organizations are able to submit one request and rely on the DHNetwork to build a '''solution team''' with the relevant V&amp;TC members. DHNetwork also makes it simpler for organizations to define collaborative projects with the V&amp;TCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowdsourcing.org/document/digital-humanitarian-network-established-by-crowdsource-community/16468/: "Digital Humanitarian Network"]&lt;/ref&gt; As Jacobo Quintanilla underlines it: "humanitarian actors too, are finally adopting some of these tools (i.e. crowdsourcing and mapping tools) more systematically within their work, relying on input from affected populations", citing initiatives such as the DHNetwork as an example "to create important inroads in the way aid organisations leverage technology and the power of VT&amp;Cs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/03/disaster-communications-ict-internews: "Disaster communications: covering the ‘last mile’"] by Jacobo Quintanilla.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Humanitarian Network Coordinators ==

The DHNetwork is composed of several members who form '''Solution Teams''' when the network is activated. DHNetwork Coordinators review '''activation requests''' and rapidly liaise with the different volunteer &amp; technical teams who are members of Digital Humanitarians to build a Solution Team best able to act on a request. The Coordinators aim to provide a response to every request within 24 hours.

== Previous activations ==

In the past year, the '''DHNetwork''' has been activated five times by '''OCHA South Sudan, ACAPS, OCHA Philippines, Samoa government''' and '''UNHCR (Syria)'''. In each case, the requesting entity sent a central request to the DHNetwork. These efforts resulted in such things as rapid data collection, social media filters to augment traditional assessments, and a translation of the UNHCR Syria portal into Arabic allowing regional civilians to access normally inaccessible information.

1) [http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/ocha-south-sudan-deployment-curating-data-for-preparedness/ '''OCHA South Sudan''']. Searching the internet for 3 days looking for reports, articles, and data, the team collected 15,271 unique pieces of information.

2) [http://www.acaps.org/ '''ACAPS''']. The team surveyed the internet for Democratic Republic of Congo-related assessments, population statistics, historical IDP numbers, humanitarian events, and indicator values. The group also created several maps.

Results were compiled and organized in a structured database. The Solution team used a variety of methods ranging from automated algorithms to micro-tasking. They used [http://corp.geofeedia.com/ Geofeedia] to identify all relevant pictures/videos that were already geo-tagged by users, [https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa PyBossa] and a free and [[open-source]] [[Microwork#Microtasking|microtasking]] platform.

The '''Eminence Symphony Orchestra''' founded in [[Sydney, Australia]] is an independent [[symphony orchestra]] which delves into the [[classical music]] featured in [[video games]] and [[anime]], as well as [[film score]]s.

== History ==
Eminence was founded in 2003 by a small group of friends, led by the virtuoso solo violinist [[Hiroaki Yura]]. The difference in the cultural backgrounds between these friends as well as their differing experiences and qualifications contributed to what would be their first concert.

Eminence focuses particularly on the music of notable Japanese [[video games]] and [[anime]]. The orchestra's vision is to "inject something bold, dynamic and fresh into classical music". Eminence wishes to "break down the barriers between the audience and the musicians, and to revive orchestra in today's society; particularly amongst youth".

While the trademark of Eminence is the symphony orchestra, the organisation also delves into smaller-based concerts featuring three to five musicians as well as small [[musical ensemble|ensemble]]s, branded differently under Eminence Artists. More recently, the orchestra has offered their services to a wide range of entertainment media such as video games and anime, including the recording of music for many notable game publishers and developers, and for a number of film scores. These services were initially provided through a Sydney-based business entity, Eminence Group Pty Ltd, while the orchestra continued to operate under its existing name.

Awareness of the Eminence brand increased over time, and many opportunities for performances, recording and production services arose in other countries, prompting offices to be established in USA and Japan.

This facilitated further work in those countries, particularly in Japan. Australia continues to be the home base for the orchestra, with the majority of recordings being performed in Sydney.

Meanwhile, Eminence Group Pty Ltd which represented Eminence Symphony Orchestra and its services through license was placed into voluntary liquidation with an appointed liquidator on 21 December 2010. A resolution to wind up the company was made on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.search.asic.gov.au/cgi-bin/gns030c?acn=115_806_767&amp;juris=9&amp;hdtext=ACN&amp;srchsrc=1 |title=Eminence Group under external administration |date=21 January 2010 |publisher=Australian Security and Investments Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706121441/http://www2.search.asic.gov.au/cgi-bin/gns030c?acn=115_806_767&amp;juris=9&amp;hdtext=ACN&amp;srchsrc=1 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eminence Symphony Orchestra continues to operate through Eminence Artists in Australia, Creative Intelligence Arts,Inc. in Japan and Eminence Group North America in the United States of America.

== Concerts and performances ==

=== ''A Night in Fantasia'' ===
Eminence's debut concert, ''A Night in Fantasia'', was held on 31 October and 1 November 2003. It was born out of the idea that such an event had never been done before in Australia.
The first of a series of concerts was mainly composed of music from ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and [[Studio Ghibli]] films,  and took place at Sydney Congress Hall with tickets that sold well before the night. The overall success as well as the enthusiastic support of the first concert proved a point to the organisers that such a concept of cultural music would appeal to a wide range of people. At this point the company running the concert was 'Infinity 8LUE', and the orchestra was the 'Infinity 8LUE Symphony Orchestra'.

=== ''A Night in Fantasia 2004'' ===
In 2004, the orchestra was fully formed, and held ''A Night in Fantasia 2004'' at Verbrugghen Hall at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music on 30 and 31 October. William Motzing became the Chief Conductor and Artistic Director, Daniel Smith became the Assistant Conductor and ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] was a guest of honour at all four performances. This concert marked the name change for the orchestra, as they became known as the Eminence Symphony Orchestra. Infinity 8LUE was the company behind the concert, and shortly after finalised the name change by becoming Eminence.

Special guest composers included [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], [[Junichi Nakatsuru]] and [[Go Shiina|Masaru Shiina]], present at all of the concerts. [[Yoko Shimomura]] was also slated to appear at all concerts, but was prevented from attending the Melbourne concert for unknown reasons.

=== ''A Night in Fantasia 2007: Anime Edition'' ===
The second part of the concert series focused entirely on anime, and the programme given out at Passion indicated a 'late 2007' concert date for both Sydney and Melbourne. At the 2007 Symphonic Games Edition concert, questionnaires were handed out, one of which asked attendees to list music found in various anime that they would like to hear in the concert. In October, entertainment website IGN announced the date - two consecutive concerts would be held on 18 November in the Sir John Clancy Auditorium of the [[University of New South Wales]]. Both concerts would feature music from famous anime including: ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''Tsubasa Chronicle'', ''Noir'', ''[[Le Portrait de Petit Cossette]]'', ''Xenosaga II'', ''Porco Rosso'', ''.hack//Liminality'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]''.
Famous Japanese composer and music producer [[Yuki Kajiura]] was the special guest during the concert and participated in a question and answer session with the host. Pamphlets were then handed out, which detailed the next future concert of the Eminence Symphony Orchestra, ''Unearthing Eden''.

=== ''Unearthing Eden ~The sounds of AINARU~'' ===
A follow-up on A Night in Fantasia 2007: Anime Edition, this performance was again a smaller-sized quintet, which featured a collaboration with Japanese composer, Kow Otani and Japanese singer [[AIKa]]. The concert was held in the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in Sydney for two days, but both days saw little audience in the performances.

=== ''A Night in Fantasia 2009'' ===
After two years without having performed a concert of the magnitude of A Night in Fantasia 2007: Symphonic Games Edition, Eminence announced in February on a teaser website their next event, A Night in Fantasia 2009. Performed on 26 September 2009, the concert was held only on one night in Sydney at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]]. Music featured included suites from ''[[Death Note|DEATH NOTE]]'', ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]''. Full pieces performed included James Hannigan's ''Soviet March'' from ''[[Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'', ''The Unsung War'' from ''[[Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War]]'', ''Tonari Ni'' (Beside Me) from ''[[The Idolmaster]]'' composed by Go Shiina and performed by Chiaki Takahashi, and the world premiere of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' ending theme, ''I Am The One'', sung by Aubrey Ashburn. The majority of the arrangements were created by ''AFRIKA'' composer [[Wataru Hokoyama]]. Other guests included [[Kow Otani]] and AIKA Tsuneoka, who performed a suite from ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', [[Inon Zur]], [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] and [[Cris Velasco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/?p=5604|title=The Renewal of Eminence: A Night in Fantasia 2009 Report|date=5 November 2009|publisher=OSV|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5824">[[Image:European Heritage Days map.svg|thumb|Countries participating in the European Heritage Days in 2007]]
'''European Heritage Days''' ('''EHD''') is a joint action of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Commission]] involving all 50 signatory states of the [[European Cultural Convention]] under the motto, ''Europe: a common heritage''. The annual programme offers opportunities to visit buildings, monuments and sites, many of which are not normally accessible to the public. It aims to widen access and foster care for architectural and environmental heritage. These events are also known as [[Doors Open Days]] and Open Doors Days in English-speaking countries.

The event began in [[France]] in 1984, with ''La Journée Portes Ouvertes'', sponsored by the Ministry of Culture. In 1985, in [[Granada]], at the 2nd European Conference of Ministers responsible for Architectural Heritage, the French Minister of Culture proposed that the project be internationalised under the Council of Europe. The [[Netherlands]] held their first ''Open Monumentendag'' in 1987. [[Sweden]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] joined in 1989, and [[Belgium]] and [[Scotland]] in 1990.

In 1991 these events were united as European Heritage Days at the initiative of the Council of Europe, supported by the EU. By 2010, 50 signatory states of the European Cultural Convention had joined the EHDs.

The Directorate General IV – Education, Culture and Heritage, Youth and Sport of the [[Council of Europe]], in close cooperation with the Directorate General for Education and Culture of the [[European Commission]], ensures the general orientation, definition and execution of the tasks to be achieved within the framework of the EHD. The Secretariat of the EHD is carried out by the Directorate of Culture and Cultural and Natural Heritage, under the responsibility of the [[Council of Europe]]’s Steering Committee for Cultural Heritage.

This idea is popular outside Europe, too, with similar schemes in Canada (since 1974 - [[Heritage Day (Alberta)]]), the [[US]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage-week.govspace.gov.au/ |title=Australian Heritage Week |publisher=Australian Government, Department of the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other lands, at different times of year. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] the corresponding ''Día del Patrimonio'' is held on the last weekend of September, while in [[Chile]] the same event is held on the last Sunday of May.

|constructor=}} The '''[[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Masters Historic Formula One Championship''' is a championship that has old [[Formula One]] cars from "the golden era", which caters for 3-litre engine Formula 1 cars from [[1966 Formula One season|1966]] to [[1985 Formula One season|1985]].&lt;ref name="Official Website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themastersseries.com/race-series/item/4-fia-historic-formula-one |title=FIA Masters Historic Formula One Championship |publisher=Themastersseries.com |accessdate=18 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826183041/http://www.themastersseries.com/race-series/item/4-fia-historic-formula-one |archivedate=26 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NSA surveillance}}
'''Fairview''' is a secret program under which the [[National Security Agency]] cooperates with the American telecommunications company [[AT&amp;T]] in order to collect phone, internet and e-mail data mainly of foreign countries' citizens at major cable landing stations and switching stations inside the United States. The FAIRVIEW program started in 1985, one year after the [[Bell breakup]].&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015&gt;New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html?_r=0 AT&amp;T Helped U.S. Spy on Internet on a Vast Scale] &amp; Pro Publica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-spying-relies-on-atts-extreme-willingness-to-help NSA Spying Relies on AT&amp;T’s ‘Extreme Willingness to Help’], August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate partner ==
The "key corporate partner" for cooperation under the FAIRVIEW program was first identified on October 23, 2013 by ''[[The Washington Post]]''—quoting NSA historian [[Matthew Aid]]—as
AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=matthewAid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2013/10/22/whats-the-deal-with-nsas-operation-names/ |title=What's the deal with NSA's operation names? |author=Emily Heil |work=The Washington Post |date=October 22, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHgpNwv5?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2013/10/22/whats-the-deal-with-nsas-operation-names/ |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was confirmed by a joint report by ''Pro Publica'' and ''The New York Times'' from August 15, 2015, based upon NSA documents that describe the company as "highly collaborative" and praise the company's "extreme willingness to help".&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

In 2011, the FAIRVIEW program cost the NSA $188.9 million, which was twice as much as the costs for [[STORMBREW]], which is the second-largest program.&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

== Scope of the program ==
According to 2013 revelations by whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The NSA partners with a large US telecommunications company ... [which] partners with telecoms in the foreign countries, [which] then allow the US company access to those countries' telecommunications systems, and that access is then exploited to direct traffic to the NSA's repositories.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying |title=The NSA's mass and indiscriminate spying on Brazilians |author=Glen Greenwald |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J5ahUofg?url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying |archivedate=August 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the revelations, the NSA had collected 2.3&amp;nbsp;billion separate pieces of data from Brazilian users in January 2013 alone.&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-espionaram-milhoes-de-mails-ligacoes-de-brasileiros-8940934 |title=EUA espionaram milhões de e-mails e ligações de brasileiros |author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Roberto Kaz |author3=José Casado |work=O Globo |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHg7um4t?url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-espionaram-milhoes-de-mails-ligacoes-de-brasileiros-8940934 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks earlier, Snowden had revealed that the NSA was also harvesting the telephone [[metadata]] and text messages from over a billion subscribers in China; however, no precise program name was reported at the time.&lt;ref name="scmp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266821/us-hacks-chinese-mobile-phone-companies-steals-sms-data-edward-snowden | title=EXCLUSIVE: US spies on Chinese mobile phone companies, steals SMS data: Edward Snowden |author1=Lana Lam |author2=Stephen Chen | work=South China Morning Post | date=June 22, 2013 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=March 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323084637/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266821/us-hacks-chinese-mobile-phone-companies-steals-sms-data-edward-snowden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US-990 Fairview Map - crop.jpg|thumb|right|FAIRVIEW: Map shown on Brazilian television in 2013]]
A slide about the FAIRVIEW program that was seen on Brazilian television in 2013 showed a map with markers all over the United States, but without a legend that explained what they stood for. From a similar map with the proper legend, that was published in August 2015, it became clear that in 2010 the NSA had access to the following AT&amp;T facilities:&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2015/08/fairview-collecting-foreign.html FAIRVIEW: Collecting foreign intelligence inside the US], August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8 [[internet peering point]]s
* 26 [[VoIP]] router facilities
* 1 VoIP hub router facility (with 30 planned)
* 9 submarine [[cable landing point]]s (with 7 planned)
* 16 [[4ESS]] circuit switching stations
Except for the VoIP facilities, most of these access points are situated along the US borders.

The collection of data under the FAIRVIEW program takes place under different legal authorities: [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]], which requires individualized warrants from the FISA Court, section 702 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FAA]] for when one end of the communications if foreign, and the Transit Authority for when both ends of a communications are foreign.

Under the FAIRVIEW program, AT&amp;T also provided the NSA with domestic telephone metadata in bulk, which was authorized under section 215 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. First this was from landline connections, but in 2011, AT&amp;T also started handing over cell phone metadata: 1.1 billion a day.&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

'''''Free to Be… You and Me''''' was a children's entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author [[Marlo Thomas]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]],&lt;ref name=NPR-MorningEdition-40th-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rachel|title=40 Years On, 'Free To Be' Still Resonates|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166735512/40-years-on-free-to-be-message-still-resonates|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[NPR]]|date=7 December 2012|format=Audio interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a [[record album]] and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as "[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends") including [[Alan Alda]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Carol Channing]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Jack Cassidy]], and [[Diana Ross]]. An ABC special, also created by [[Marlo Thomas]], using poetry, songs, and sketches followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s [[gender neutrality]], saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one's identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.

== Overview ==
The original idea to create the album began with [[Marlo Thomas]],&lt;ref name=Makers-Birth-FTBYAM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Marlo|title=Birth of 'Free to Be... You and Me'|url=http://www.makers.com/marlo-thomas/moments/birth-free-be%E2%80%A6-you-and-me|website=[[Makers: Women Who Make America|Makers]]|accessdate=19 October 2014|format=Video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to teach her then-young niece Dionne about life, in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children's books of the period. In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told my sister Terre "it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it (stories featuring traditional gender roles) the same as it took all of us. We need to find her some different books to read" and she said "You go and find 'em." 

Well there weren't any. And not only weren't there any, I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one (picture book - I'm Glad I'm a Boy! I'm Glad I'm a Girl! by [[Whitney Darrow, Jr.]]) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page (with a caption) that said "Boys are pilots, girls are stewardesses." Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore. 

So I said "I'll make a record for Dionne. I'll ask everybody to donate their talents and it'll be fun." [[Larry Uttal]] at [[Bell Records]] told me, this kind of record might sell 15,000 copies tops. Well it went Gold right away, went Platinum within two years and went Diamond in under ten years. EVERYBODY was amazed it had touched such a nerve. It's still in the top 100 albums of all time over 40 years later.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Produced by [[Carole Hart]], with music produced by [[Stephen J. Lawrence]] and [[Bruce Hart (songwriter)|Bruce Hart]], with stories and poems directed by [[Alan Alda]], the title has never been out of print.

Proceeds went to the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]]. The album was originally released on [[Bell Records]] in 1972 and since 1975 has been available on [[Arista Records]] cassettes and CDs. 

Well-known songs include "It's All Right to Cry," sung by football hero [[Rosey Grier]]; the title track by [[the New Seekers]]; "Helping," a Shel Silverstein poem performed by [[Tom Smothers]]; "Sisters and Brothers" by the [[Voices of East Harlem]]; and "When We Grow Up" performed by [[Diana Ross]] on the album and by [[Roberta Flack]] and a teenage [[Michael Jackson]] on the special.

Other sketches, some of them animated in the television special, include "Atalanta," co-narrated by Thomas and Alda, a retelling of the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]] of [[Atalanta]]; "Boy Meets Girl" with Thomas and [[Mel Brooks]] providing the voices for puppets, designed, performed and manipulated by [[Wayland Flowers]], resembling human babies, who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl; "[[William's Doll]]", based on [[Charlotte Zolotow]]'s picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father; and "Dudley Pippin" with [[Robert Morse]] and [[Billy De Wolfe]], based on stories by Phil Ressner.

A number of pieces from the record did not make the special, most for lack of time, although ''Housework'' was left off due to the somewhat condescending tone it lent to its' description of domestic workers.

Marlo Thomas says in the Emmy Legends 40th anniversary interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In among all the praise we got for the project as a whole, we kept getting all these letters and phone calls talking about the track sounding as if it wasn't normal to be fond of cooking and cleaning and caretaking etc. So we left that off the special for that reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail, Robin, and David Pogrebin, children of [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], then editor of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' Most of the children attended Corlears School.

"[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends" followed ''Free to Be... You and Me'' with a 1988 sequel, ''[[Free to Be... a Family]]'', the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union.

In her 2010 memoir, ''Growing Up Laughing'', [[Marlo Thomas]] reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The show won an Emmy and a Peabody, the book became number one on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list and the record went gold. We were floored by the impact it all had. My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and, most of all, teachers, who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Television special ==
The television special, produced by [[Marlo Thomas]] and Free to Be Productions, in association with Teru Murakami-[[Fred Wolf Films]], Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation, first aired March 11, 1974, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  It earned an 18.6 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]/27 share and went on to win an [[Emmy]]. Sixteen-mm prints of the special were also struck, and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special, or the filmstrip based on the special, in their school during that period.

The special appeared occasionally on [[HBO]] in the 1980s. It was released on VHS through [[Vestron Video]] subsidiary [[Children's Video Library]] in 1983.  It was also seen on the cable channel TV Land, yet has not been aired on any network since.

A [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] DVD of the television special was released in November 2001, and in 2010, a newly remastered version was released featuring a number of new extras including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman.

[[File:Garrick Theatre, Stockport (1).JPG|thumb|The Stockport Garrick Theatre, Exchange Street, Stockport]]
'''Stockport Garrick Theatre''' was founded in 1901 and in 1904 obtained its own premises in Cobden Place, Wellington Street, [[Stockport]], thereby becoming the oldest "little theatre" in the U.K. A "little theatre" is defined as being an amateur theatre that owns, leases or otherwise has control of its own premises.

== Foundation and early years ==

In the summer and autumn of 1901 the drama group that was based at the Stockport Unitarian Sunday School on Petersgate was rehearsing a production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. The church organist who was also directing the production and who was a qualified engineer, Edwin T. Heys, decided that to avoid the tortuous trek through the church on the floor above the playing space to get from one wing to the other, the solution would be to dig a tunnel under the stage. This he and his headstrong colleagues proceeded to do until the excavations were discovered by the authorities and put a stop to. The incensed actors gathered at the Church Coffee Tavern opposite under the chairmanship of Heys on 24 October and formed themselves into an independent dramatic literary company which they decided to call the Garrick Society.

It was decided that the production in rehearsal would be the first play presented by the new society and a semi-professional director, Ryder Boys, was engaged to produce the work at the [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics Institute]] at the end of February and the beginning of March 1902.  It played to great acclaim and was followed in the same year by Sheridan's ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' and then by ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[The Rivals]]''. Some of the larger scale plays were performed at Stockports' Frank Matcham theatre, the Theatre Royal. The premises on Wellington Street were used for more intimate productions and ones which had not been licensed by the Lord Chamberlain such as Maeterlinck's ''Monna Vanna'' and several works by Ibsen and Shaw.

Despite the calling up of many of the society's young men during the First World War, the society continued its work during the war years and seems to have escaped relatively unscathed, continuing to present between four and eight plays per season until peace came in November 1918.

== 1920–62 ==

During the First World War a scheme for acquiring new larger premises was being mooted. This came to fruition in 1920 with the formation of a limited company, the chairman of which was Edwin Heys. The building which was acquired was on the corner of Exchange Street and Wellington Road South where the present theatre stands today. It was then an engineering works and contained various other enterprises including a Spiritualist Church. In 1925 funds were raised to raise the roof, which was until then supported on low beams and in 1935-6 new rooms were constructed above what was then called the Minor Hall and which is now the bar and studio theatre.

As well as continuing to present productions of the classics, especially Shakespeare, Ibsen and Shaw, the 1920s and '30s saw a flowering of home-grown talent in the presentation of works by Garrick members including Ross Hills, Channon Collinge, Percy Corry and Alfred Jepson. The Second World War seems to have been more traumatic for the society than the First, with many members who had joined the forces not returning and several of the founder members dying during the war years. However the seasons of plays continued throughout, boosted it would seem by an influx of members of Stockport Operatic Society who had ceased to function for the time being, enabling the Garrick to put on several [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]s and a couple of other operas.

After the war a general sense of exhaustion and depression seemed to have set in, relieved somewhat by the 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1951 and even more so by the extensive rebuilding and refurbishment work in 1962, necessitated and financed by the local council's compulsory purchase of a "slice" of the building to enable the widening of Exchange Street. The cantilevered extension over the Exchange Street pavement was constructed, the auditorium was raked, new seats installed, the windows closed off and open fireplaces removed. The name of the building, which had until then been known as the Garrick Hall, was changed to the Garrick Theatre as it has been known ever since.

== 1962 to the present ==

The installation of a bar in 1973, despite strong opposition from certain die-hard members, further lifted the spirits as did another major reconstruction of the auditorium and the creation of further rooms at the rear in 1984; much of the preparatory work was carried out by members themselves. Most recently a major reconstruction of the bar area, providing facilities for it to double as a studio theatre, took place in 2010.

From the outset the Garrick Theatre has often been adventurous in its choice of plays, with a particular love of Shakespeare which continues to this day (recently being involved with the RSC's Open Stages project), early productions of Ibsen, Shaw, Synge, Yeats, Hauptmann and Tagore gradually giving way in the middle years of the century to the more frivolous offerings of Noël Coward, Somerset Maugham, Alan Melville and the like. After the radical shift in theatrical tastes caused by the 1956 production of [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back In Anger]]'' the Garrick gradually began to come up to date with productions of Osborne himself, [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Arnold Wesker]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] and [[Simon Gray]] whilst continuing to lighten the mix with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], popular West End hits and the occasional musical when the membership's talents lay in that direction. In the 1980s and '90s a number of amateur premieres were secured, including ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (Sondheim &amp; Wheeler), ''[[My Mother Said I Never Should]]'' ([[Charlotte Keatley]]), ''Corpse'' (Gerald Moon), ''Fools and Star-Spangled Girl'' (both by Neil Simon) and also from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the theatre took several productions on tour to Buxton Opera House, the Isle of Man Festival, the Dundalk Festival in Eire, several venues in the U.S.A. and also two trips to Stockport's twin town in Germany, Heilbronn.

Since the bar refurbishment the Garrick Studio has produced a wider variety of plays, presenting intimate, exciting and sometimes controversial plays by playwrights such as [[David Mamet]], [[David Harrower]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Yasmina Reza]], [[Andrew Bovell]], [[John Godber]], [[Laura Wade]], [[Dennis Kelly]], [[Joe Penhall]] and [[Simon Stephens]]. It also enabled the theatre to encourage the development of new writing for the stage in Stockport. 

The Youth Theatre has flourished in the past few years, presenting main stage productions and showcase performances each year. In recent years, Garrick Youth has grown from 1 weekly group of 20 students (aged 14-18) to 5 Weekly groups for around 100 students (aged 7-18). 

In 2016 [[BBC Radio 4]] recorded [[Mark Steel's in Town]] from the theatre. 

In May 2018, Stockport Garrick hosted their first Stockport Festival of New Writing. A week long festival championing new writing for the stage. It included development performances by brand new plays by Stockport and Greater Manchester Playwrights and talks and workshops by theatre Makers. [[Simon Stephens]], patron for the Festival, gave a talk discussing his Stockport Plays (Port, [[On the Shore of the Wide World]], [[Punk Rock (play)|Punk Rock]] and Blindsided) with Stockport actor Katie West. Extracts from the Stockport Plays were directed and performed by Garrick members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1998">The '''Greek Food Festival of Dallas''' is a [[food festival]] held annually in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]), featuring tradiational [[Greek cuisine]] and [[Greek culture]].  

The Festival was first held in Dallas in 1956 and having celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006, the Greek Food Festival has grown into an event of national importance, featuring the best of Greek dinners, homemade pastries, wines, Greek music and dances. In addition to this, the spectators have a chance to learn more of Greek history and culture and enjoy cooking demonstrations from Dallas chefs.

Like the majority of Greek festivals, which are organized by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], recognized as the center of cultural activities of the Greek community, Greek Food Festival of Dallas is also organized by the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37169">The '''Historiography of World War II''' is the study of how [[historian]]s portray the causes, conduct, and outcomes of [[World War II]].

There are different perspectives on the causes of the war the three most prominent are the orthodox from the 1950s, Revisionist from the 1970s and Post-Revisionism which offers the most contemporary perspective.  The orthodox perspective arose during the aftermath of the war. The main historian noted for this perspective is [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]].  Orthodox historians argue that [[Hitler]] was a master planner who intentionally started [[World War II]] due to his strong beliefs on [[fascism]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[expansionism]], and the supremacy of the German State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wartime Journals|last=Trevor-Roper|first=Hugh|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2011|isbn=978-1848859906|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist historians argue that it was an ordinary war by world standards and that Hitler was an opportunist of the sort who commonly appears in world history; he merely took advantage of the opportunities given to him. This viewpoint became popular in the 1970s, especially in the revisionism of [[A. J. P. Taylor]]. Throughout the course of the war, orthodox historians argue as if the [[Axis powers]] were a sort of evil consuming the world with their powerful message and malignant ideology, while the [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied powers]] were trying to protect democracy and freedom.  Post-revisionist historians of the causes, such as [[Alan Bullock]], argue that the cause of the War was a matter of both the evil and the banal.   Essentially Hitler was a strategist with clear aims and objectives, that would not have been achievable without taking advantage of the opportunities given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitler And Stalin: Parallel Lives.|last=Bullock|first=Alan|publisher=Knopf|year=1992|isbn=9780771017742|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each perspective of [[World War II]] offers an insightful analysis and allows us to expand our curiosity on the blame, conduct and causes of the war.

On the result of the war, historians in countries occupied by the Nazis developed strikingly similar interpretations celebrating a victory against great odds, with national liberation based on national unity. That unity is repeatedly described as the greatest source of future strength. Historians in common glorified the resistance movement (somewhat to the neglect of the invaders who actually overthrew the Nazis). There is great stress on heroes — including celebrities such as Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill and Josip Broz Tito — but also countless brave partisans and members of the resistance. Women rarely played a role in the celebrity or the histories, although since the 1990s, social historians have been piecing together the role of women on the home fronts.  In recent years much scholarly attention has focused on how popular memories were constructed through selection, and how commemorations are held.

==Historiographical viewpoints==

===Self esteem and glory===
R.J. Bosworth argues the major powers have experienced intellectual conflict in interpreting their wartime stories. Some have ignored the central issues. Germany and, to a much lesser extent, Japan have experienced a collective self-analysis. But these two, as well as Great Britain, France, Russia, and Italy, have largely ignored many roles and have looked instead for glory even when it was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;R.J.B.  Bosworth, "Nations Examine Their Past: A Comparative Analysis of the Historiography of the" Long" Second World War." ''History Teacher'' 29.4 (1996): 499-523. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/494801 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blame===
Blame as the driving force during World War II, is a widely known orthodox perspective. Especially directly after World War II, [[Nazi Germany]] was held to blame for starting the war. Orthodox historians cited several reasons for this. Germany was the one who initially invaded [[Poland]] against the recommendation of the [[Allies of World War II|allies]], and also attacked the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rabbi Saved by Hitler's Soldiers: Rebbe Joseph Isaac Schneersohn and His Astonishing Rescue|last=Rigg|first=Brian Mark|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–35|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the system of alliances between the [[Axis Powers]] was one that was only meant for war. The [[Tripartite Pact]] stated that if any country declared war on one of the Axis countries, the other two would also declare war on those countries. Another reason, historians saw, is that the policies of [[Hitler]] were overly aggressive; not only did Hitler preach war with [[France]] and the Soviet Union, but he followed a careful pre-made plan of [[expansionism]]. Additionally, the events that took place in unveiling of the war such as the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]], [[Anschluss]], and the German involvement during the [[Spanish Civil War]], showed that Hitler was anticipating the possibility of war and intentionally gearing up for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Memory|last=Uldricks|first=Teddy J.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Indianapolis|pages=60–82|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Canada deployed trained historians to Canadian Military Headquarters in the United Kingdom during the war, and paid much attention to the chronicling of the conflict, not only in the words of the official historians of the Army Historical Section, but also through art and trained painters. The official history of the Canadian Army was undertaken after the war, with an interim draft published in 1948 and three volumes in the 1950s. This was in comparison to the First World War's official history, only 1 volume of which was completed by 1939, and the full text only released after a change in authors some 40 years after the fact. Official histories of the RCAF and RCN in the Second World War were also a long time coming, and the book ''Arms, Men and Government'' by Charles Stacey (one of the main contributors to the Army history) was published in the 1980s as an "official" history of the war policies of the Canadian government.  The performance of Canadian forces in some battles have remained controversial, such as Hong Kong and Dieppe, and a variety of books have been written on them from various points of view. Serious historians - mainly scholars - emerged in the years after the Second World War, foremost Terry Copp (a scholar) and Denis Whitaker (a former soldier).&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cook, ''Clio's Warriors: Canadian Historians and the Writing of the World Wars'' (UBC Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taylor ''The Origins of the Second World War'' (1961)==
In 1961, English historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] published his most controversial book, ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'', which earned him a reputation as a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]—that is, a historian who sharply changes which party was "guilty."  The book had a quick, profound impact, upsetting many readers.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel, ed. ''Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered'' (2nd ed. 2002) p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor argued against the standard thesis that the outbreak of the Second World War – by which Taylor specifically meant the war that broke out in September 1939 – was  the result of an intentional plan on the part of guilty [[Adolf Hitler]]. He began his book with the statement that too many people have accepted uncritically what he called the "Nuremberg Thesis", that the Second World War was the result of criminal conspiracy by a small gang comprising Hitler and his associates. He regarded the "Nuremberg Thesis" as too convenient for too many people and claimed that it shielded the blame for the war from the leaders of other states, let the German people avoid any responsibility for the war and created a situation where West Germany was a respectable [[Cold War]] ally against the Soviets.

Taylor's thesis was that Hitler was not the demoniacal figure of popular imagination but in foreign affairs a normal German leader. Citing [[Fritz Fischer]], he argued that the foreign policy of the [[Third Reich]] was the same as those of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[German Empire|Second Reich]]. Moreover, in a partial break with his view of [[History of Germany|German history]] advocated in ''The Course of German History'', he argued that Hitler was not just a normal German leader but also a normal Western leader. As a normal Western leader, Hitler was no better or worse than [[Gustav Stresemann|Stresemann]], [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] or [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier]]. His argument was that Hitler wished to make Germany the strongest power in Europe but he did not want or plan war. The outbreak of war in 1939 was an unfortunate accident caused by mistakes on everyone's part.

Notably, Taylor portrayed Hitler as a grasping opportunist with no beliefs other than the pursuit of power and [[anti-Semitism]]. He argued that Hitler did not possess any sort of programme and his foreign policy was one of drift and seizing chances as they offered themselves. He did not even consider Hitler's anti-Semitism unique: he argued that millions of Germans were just as ferociously anti-Semitic as Hitler and there was no reason to single out Hitler for sharing the beliefs of millions of others.

Taylor argued that the basic problem with an interwar Europe was a flawed [[Treaty of Versailles]] that was sufficiently onerous to ensure that the overwhelming majority of Germans would always hate it, but insufficiently onerous in that it failed to destroy Germany's potential to be a Great Power once more. In this way, Taylor argued that the Versailles Treaty was destabilising, for sooner or later the innate power of Germany that the Allies had declined to destroy in 1918–1919 would inevitably reassert itself against the Versailles Treaty and the international system established by Versailles that the Germans regarded as unjust and thus had no interest in preserving. Though Taylor argued that the Second World War was not inevitable and that the Versailles Treaty was nowhere near as harsh as contemporaries like [[John Maynard Keynes]] believed, what he regarded as a flawed peace settlement made the war more likely than not.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Wood, "A Historical Debate of the 1960s: World War II Historiography-The Origins of the War, AJP Taylor, and his Critics." ''Australian Journal of Politics &amp; History'' 26.3 (1980): 403-410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of France, 1940==
{{main|Historiography of the Battle of France}}

The German victory over French and British forces in the [[Battle of France]] was one of the most unexpected and astonishing events of the 20th century and has generated a large popular and scholarly literature.&lt;ref&gt;For historiographical overviews see Martin S.

Observers in 1940 found the events unexpected and earth-shaking. Historian Martin Alexander notes that Belgium and the Netherlands fell to the German army in a matter of days and the British were soon driven back to their home islands:

:But it was France's downfall that stunned the watching world. The shock was all the greater because the trauma was not limited to a catastrophic and deeply embarrassing defeat of her military forces - it also involved the unleashing of a conservative political revolution that, on 10 July 1940, interred the Third Republic and replaced it with the authoritarian, collaborationist Etat Français of Vichy. All this was so deeply disorienting because France had been regarded as a great power....The collapse of France, however, was a different case (a '[[Strange Defeat|strange defeat]]' as it was dubbed in the haunting phrase of the Sorbonne's great medieval historian and Resistance martyr, [[Marc Bloch]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Alexander, "The Fall of France, 1940" in  John Gooch, ed.|title=Decisive Campaigns of the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zYVvfZb_I4C&amp;pg=PA10|year=2012|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential books on the war was written in summer 1940 by French historian [[Marc Bloch]]: ''L'Étrange Défaite'' ("Strange Defeat").  He raised most of the issues historians have debated since. He blamed France's leadership:
:What drove our armies to disaster was the cumulative effect of a great number of different mistakes. One glaring characteristic is, however, common to all of them. Our leaders...were incapable of thinking in terms of a new war.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Bloch, ''Strange Defeat: a Statement of Evidence Written in 1940'' (Oxford U.P., 1949), p 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt was widespread. Carole Fink argues that Bloch:
:blamed the ruling class, the military and the politicians, the press and the teachers, for a flawed national policy and a weak defense against the Nazi menace, for betraying the real France and abandoning its children. Germany had won because its leaders had better understood the methods and psychology of modern combat.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fink, "Marc Bloch and the ''drôle de guerre'' Prelude to the '"Strange Defeat'" p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Front==
It is commonly said that history is written by the victors, but the exact opposite occurred in the chronicling of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]], particularly in the West. Soviet secrecy and unwillingness to acknowledge events that might discredit the regime led to them revealing little information, always heavily edited - leaving western historians to rely almost totally on German sources. While still valuable sources, they tended to be self-serving; German generals, in particular, tried to distance themselves and the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' as a whole away from the Nazi Party, while at the same time blaming them for their defeat (individuals supporting these arguments are commonly called part of the 'Hitler Lost Us The War' group). While this self-serving approach was noticed at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Alan. ''Barbarossa''. Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated, 1966. {{ISBN|0-451-02848-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was still generally accepted as the closest version of the truth. The end result was a commonly held picture of the ''Heer'' being the superior army, ground down by the vast numbers of the 'Bolshevik horde' and betrayed by the stupidity of Hitler. Not only did this ignore Hitler's talent as a military leader, an erratic talent that was sometimes brilliantly incisive and sometimes grossly in error, it also severely undervalued the remarkable transformation of the Soviet armed forces, especially the [[Red Army]], from the timid, conservative force of 1941 to an effective war-winning organisation.

After the fall of the Berlin wall, Western historians were suddenly exposed to the vast number of Soviet records of the time. This has led to an explosion of the works on the subject, most notably by [[Richard Overy]], [[David Glantz]] and [[Antony Beevor]]. These historians revealed the brutality of Stalin's regime, the recovery of the USSR and the Red Army in 1942 and the courage and abilities of the average Soviet soldier, relying heavily on Soviet archival material to do so.

===War crimes of the Wehrmacht ===
{{main|Clean Wehrmacht|War crimes of the Wehrmacht}} 
At the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) was declared a [[criminal organization]], but the regular armed forces (Wehrmacht) were not. Although some high-ranking field marshals and generals were convicted of [[war crimes]]  for issuing [[superior orders|criminal orders]], Nazi war crimes were mostly blamed on the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (concentration camp guards) and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (death squads), overlooking the participation of Wehrmacht soldiers in the [[Holocaust]]. More recent scholarship has challenged this view. An [[Wehrmachtsausstellung|exhibition]] on the [[war crimes of the Wehrmacht]] sparked demonstrations. 

===Davies===
''[[Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory]]'' was written by the English historian [[Norman Davies]], best known for his books on Poland. Davies argues although the war was over for 60 years that a number of misconceptions about the war are still common and then sets out to correct them. Two of his main claims are that contrary to popular belief in the West, the dominant part of the conflict took place in Eastern Europe between the two totalitarian systems of the century, communism and Nazism; and that Stalin's USSR was as bad as Hitler's Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2007-03-01/europe-war-1939-1945-no-simple-victory-europe-east-and-west |work= [[Foreign Affairs]] |first= Philip H. |last= Gordon |title= Review of Europe at War, 1939-1945: No Simple Victory; Europe East and West |year= 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle ''No Simple Victory'' does therefore not just refer to the losses and suffering the allies had to endure in order to defeat the enemy, but also the difficult moral choice the Western democracies had to make when allying themselves with one criminal regime in order to defeat another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Norman |last= Davies |authorlink= Norman Davies |title= Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory |year= 2006 |location= London |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |isbn= 9780333692851 |pages= 63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust denial===
A field of [[pseudohistory]] has emerged which attempts to deny the existence of [[the Holocaust]] and the mass extermination of [[Jews]] in [[German-occupied Europe]]. The proponents of the belief, known as [[Holocaust denier]]s or "negationists", are usually associated with [[Neo-Nazism]] and their views are rejected by professional historians.

==German-occupied Europe==
{{main|German-occupied Europe}}
[[File:World War II in Europe, 1942.svg|thumb|300px|Europe at the height of German control (in blue) in 1942]]
The Nazis perfected the art of stealing, draining the local economies to the maximum or beyond, so that overall production fell.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Otto Frøland, Mats Ingulstad, and Jonas Scherner. "Perfecting the Art of Stealing: Nazi Exploitation and Industrial Collaboration in Occupied Western Europe." in ''Industrial Collaboration in Nazi-Occupied Europe'' (Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2016). 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all occupied countries resistance movements sprang up.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shepherd and Juliette Pattinson. "Partisan and Anti-Partisan Warfare in German-Occupied Europe, 1939–1945: Views from Above and Lessons for the Present." ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 31.5 (2008): 675-693.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Germans tried to infiltrate and suppress them, but after the war they emerged as political actors. The local Communists were especially active in promoting resistance movements,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt, ''Resistance and revolution in Mediterranean Europe, 1939-1948'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; as was the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE).&lt;ref&gt;M.R.D. Foot, ''SOE: The Special Operations Executive, 1940-1946'' (London: Pimlico, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common themes: heroic liberation from Nazis===

Almost all national narratives of the Second World War—ranging from historiography in liberal democracies to that of Communist dictatorship,  fit the same European pattern. The French-German historian Etienne Francois has identified the common themes, as paraphrased by Johan Östling:
:Fundamental to them all...was the victory over Nazi Germany. In descriptions of the end of the war and the liberation, national unity was often stressed. This newly won liberty opened a door to the future and marked the beginning of a new, bright chapter in history. A common characteristic in most national narratives was the glorification of the resistance movement, while in countries that had been liberated by foreign troops, domestic efforts tended to be highly praised. In addition, the 'heroisation' of the war was another common denominator in the narratives – not only were charismatic victors such as Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill and Josip Broz Tito designated as heroes, but also brave partisans and members of the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Johan Östling, "Swedish Narratives of the Second World War: A European Perspective" ''Contemporary European History''. May2008, 17#2 pp 197-211, quote pp 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
{{main|Denmark in World War II}}
Denmark frustrated the Holocaust by slipping almost all of its 7200 Jews into Sweden in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana Brustin-Berenstein, "The historiographic Treatment of the abortive Attempt to deport the Danish Jews." ''Yad Vashem Studies'' 17 (1986): 181-218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar S. Paulsson, "The 'Bridge over the Øresund: The Historiography on the Expulsion of the Jews from Nazi-Occupied Denmark." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 30.3 (1995): 431-464. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/261157 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kirchhoff, "Denmark: A Light in the Darkness of the Holocaust? A Reply to Gunnar S. Paulsson," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 30#3 (1995), pp. 465-479 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/261158 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark has a large popular literature on the war years that has helped shaped national identity and politics.  Scholars have also been active but have much less influence on this topic. After the liberation two conflicting narratives emerged. A consensus narrative told how Danes were united in resistance. However, there was also a revisionist interpretation which paid attention to the resistance of most Danes, but presented Danish establishment as a collaborating enemy of Danish values. The revisionist version from the 1960s was successfully adopted by the political Left for two specific goals: to blemish the establishment now allied with the "imperialist" United States, and to argue against Danish membership in the European Community. From the 1980s, the Right started to use also used revisionism to attack asylum legislation. Finally around 2003, Liberal Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] started using it as his basic narrative of the war years (partly to legitimize his government's decision to join the war against Iraq in 2003). The occupation has thus played a central role in Danish political culture since 1945, although the role of professional scholars has been marginal.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Arne Sørensen, "Narrating the Second World War in Denmark since 1945." Contemporary European History 14.03 (2005): 295-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

====Resistance====
{{main|French Resistance}}
The heroism of the French Resistance has always been a favoured topic in France and Britain, with new books in English appearing regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gildea, ''Fighters in the Shadows: A New History of the French Resistance'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Wieviorka, ''The French Resistance'' (Harvard UP, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vichy====
{{main|Vichy France}}
After 1945 the French ignored or downplayed the role of the Vichy regimer .  Since the late 20th century it has become a major research topic.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso and Arthur Goldhammer, ''The Vichy syndrome: History and memory in France since 1944'' (Harvard Univ Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaboration====
{{further|French Resistance#Vichy collaborators}}
Collaboration with the Germans was long denied by the French, but since the late 20th century has generated a large literature.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Burrin, ''France under the Germans: Collaboration and Compromise'' 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bertram M. Gordon, ''Collaborationism in France during the Second World War'' (Cornell UP, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civilian conditions====
The roles of civilians,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, ''Unfree French: Life under the Occupation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; forced labourers and  POW's has a large literature.

There are numerous studies of women.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Diamond, ''Women and the Second World War in France, 1939-1948: choices and constraints'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Fishman, ''We Will Wait: Wives of French Prisoners of War, 1940–1945'' (Yale UP, (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Pollard, ''Reign of Virtue: Mobilizing Gender in Vichy France'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francine  Muel-Dreyfus, Kathleen A.

====Alsace  Lorraine====
Germany integrated Alsace-Lorraine into its [[German Empire]] in 1871. France recovered it in 1918. Germany was again in occupation 1940-45. There was widespread material damage. The first wave of destruction in 1940 was inflicted by German forces, the second was caused by Allied bombers in 1944, and the final wave surrounded bitter fighting between German occupiers and American liberators in 1944-1945.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Clout, "Alsace–Lorraine/Elsaß–Lothringen: destruction, revival and reconstruction in contested territory, 1939–1960." ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 37.1 (2011): 95-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===

Dutch historiography of World War II focused on the government in exile, German repression, Dutch resistance, the Hunger Winter of 1944-45 and, above all, the Holocaust. The economy was largely neglected. The economy was robust in 1940-41 then deteriorated rapidly as exploitation produced low productivity, impoverishment and hunger.&lt;ref&gt;Hein A.M.  Klemann, "Did the German Occupation (1940–1945) Ruin Dutch Industry?." ''Contemporary European History'' 17#4 (2008): 457-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
{{update |section |Polish Holocaust law|date=August 2018}} 
{{main|General Government|Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany}}

On August 1, 1944, the clandestine [[Polish Home Army]], owing allegiance to the exiled government in London, initiated an uprising in Warsaw against the occupying Germans. There is a large literature in several languages.  The Warsaw Rising Museum (WRM), opened in Warsaw in 2004 to commemorate it.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Żychlińska and Erica Fontana, "Museal Games and Emotional Truths: Creating Polish National Identity at the Warsaw Rising Museum."

Polish Jews made up about half of Holocaust victims. There is a large literature on the Holocaust in Poland and its memory and memorials,&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Steinlauf, ''Bondage to the Dead: Poland and the Memory of the Holocaust'' (Syracuse UP, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  and also the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|Jewish uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943]].&lt;ref&gt;Markus Meckl,  "The Memory of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising."

'''International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions''' (ICTer) is the successor to the seminal '''International Information Technology Conference''' (IITC) held in Sri Lanka since 1998. It provides a platform where research done in ICT is presented by both local and foreign Computer Scientists and IT Professionals. In order to get wider international participation and to promote computing research in the fast emerging regions of the world especially in Asia-Pacific, it was decided to broadbase the IITC conference and link it with the related International Journal ICTer (www.icter.org).

==Overview==
Conference is attended by about 200 researchers and students each year. Topics of interest have included Technology, Applications, Human Computer Interaction, Development Processes and Social, Legal and Ethical Issues. The conference usually includes pre-conference and/or post-conference high quality tutorials/workshops in areas of current interest in Information and Communication Technology.

Conference was initiated to mark the year of IT declared by the Government of Sri Lanka in 1998. Initially it was organised by Infotel Lanka Society and managed by the Council for Information Technology (CINTEC). Management was taken over by the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) in 2003. Infotel Lanka Society organised by conference until 2006. Currently the UCSC organise and manage the conference.

{{History of Iranian hostage crisis}}
}}
The '''Iran hostage crisis''' was a diplomatic standoff between [[Iran]] and the [[United States of America]]. Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days from November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981, after a group of Iranian college students belonging to the [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], who supported the [[Iranian Revolution]], took over the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. Embassy]] in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History Guy: Iran-U.S. Hostage Crisis (1979–1981)|url=http://www.historyguy.com/iran-us_hostage_crisis.html|publisher=historyguy.com|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands as the longest hostage crisis in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Köhler, Michael; 'Two Nations, a Treaty, and the World Court – An Analysis of United States-Iranian Relations under the Treaty of Amity before the International Court of Justice'; ''Wisconsin International Law Journal'', 18 (Winter 2000), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis was described by Western media as an "entanglement" of "vengeance and mutual incomprehension".&lt;ref name="TIME_1981-01-26"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Long Ordeal of the Hostages |last=Skow |first=John |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=26 January 1981 |accessdate=2015-05-27 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954605,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; American President [[Jimmy Carter]] called the hostage-taking an act of "blackmail" and the hostages "victims of terrorism and anarchy".&lt;ref name=Carter1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2010/April%202010/0410fullkeeper.pdf |title=Air Force Magazine |publisher=Air Force Magazine |date=2016-04-05 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran it was widely seen as an act against the U.S. and its influence in Iran, including its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution and its longstanding support of the Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was overthrown in 1979.&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kinzer|first1=Stephen|title=Thirty-five years after Iranian hostage crisis, the aftershocks remain |publisher= The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/11/04/thirty-five-years-after-iranian-hostage-crisis-aftershocks-remain/VIEKSajEUvSmDQICGF8R7K/story.html|website=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being overthrown, Shah Pahlavi was admitted to the U.S. for cancer treatment. Iran demanded that he be returned to stand trial for crimes he was accused of committing during his reign. Specifically, he was accused of committing crimes against Iranian citizens with the help of [[SAVAK|his secret police]]. Iran's demands were rejected by the United States, and Iran saw the decision to grant him asylum as American complicity in those atrocities. The Americans saw the hostage-taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|Vienna Convention]], which granted [[diplomatic immunity|diplomats immunity from arrest]] and made diplomatic compounds inviolable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/11/06/111115000.pdf|title=Doing Satan's Work in Iran |date=November 6, 1979 |access-date=January 4, 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, Stephen.

''National Review'', 55 (17), 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis reached a climax after diplomatic negotiations failed to win release for the hostages. Carter ordered the U.S. military to attempt a rescue operation using warships—including the {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} and {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}—that were patrolling the waters near Iran. On April 24, 1980, the attempt, known as [[Operation Eagle Claw]], failed, resulting in the accidental deaths of eight American servicemen and one Iranian civilian, as well as the destruction of two helicopters. Six American diplomats who had evaded capture were eventually rescued by a [[Canadian Caper#Rescue|joint CIA-Canadian effort]] on January 27, 1980.

Shah Pahlavi left the United States in December 1979 and was ultimately granted asylum in [[Egypt]], where he died from complications of cancer on July 27, 1980. In September 1980 the [[Iraqi security forces|Iraqi military]] invaded Iran, beginning the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. These events led the Iranian government to enter negotiations with the U.S., with [[Algeria]] acting as a mediator. The crisis is considered a pivotal episode in the history of [[Iran–United States relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130419175811/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 19, 2013 |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iran the crisis strengthened the prestige of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] and the political power of [[theocracy|theocrats]] who opposed any normalization of relations with the West.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, Sandra, ''The Iranians: Persia, Islam and the Soul of a Nation'', New York: Dutton, c.&amp;nbsp;1996 (p. 298)&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis also led to American economic [[sanctions against Iran]], further weakening ties between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm |title=A Review Of US Unilateral Sanctions Against Iran |website=Mafhoum.com |date=2002-08-26 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===1953 coup d'état===
{{further|Operation Ajax|Iranian Revolution}}
In February 1979, less than a year before the crisis, the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown during the [[Iranian Revolution]].  For several decades before that, the United States had [[United States–Iran relations|allied with and supported]] the Shah. During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] powers [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupied]] Iran to force the abdication of first Pahlavi monarch [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], in favor of his eldest son, Crown Prince Mohammad.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'', (1982), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies feared that Reza Shah intended to align his petroleum-rich country with [[Nazi Germany]], but Reza Shah's earlier declaration of neutrality, and his refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train or supply Soviet troops against Germany, were the strongest motives for the Allied invasion of Iran. Because of its importance in the Allied victory, Iran was subsequently called "The Bridge of Victory" by [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country name calling: the case of Iran vs. Persia. |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6583215/Country-name-calling-the-case.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213175117/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6583215/Country-name-calling-the-case.html |archivedate=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was engaged in a power struggle with Iran's prime minister, [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], an immediate descendant of the preceding [[Qajar dynasty]]. Mosaddegh led a general strike on behalf of impoverished Iranians, demanding a share of the nation's petroleum revenue from Britain's [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. However, he overstepped in trying to get $50 million in damages and lost revenue from the British.&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;52 poverty p.&amp;nbsp;54 Postwar Brit, p.&amp;nbsp;63 acceptance of 50:50 split, demand for $50 million in damages &amp; back revenues, The Persian Puzzle, Kenneth M. Pollack. New York: Random House, 2004.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2014}} In 1953, the British and American spy agencies helped Iranian royalists depose Mosaddegh in a military ''[[coup d'état]]'' codenamed [[Operation Ajax]], allowing the Shah to extend his power. The Shah appointed himself an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] rather than a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]], his position before the 1953 crisis, with the aim of assuming complete control of the government and purging the disloyal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Reilly |first=Kevin |title=Decision Making in U.S.&amp;nbsp;History.

===Carter administration===
Months before the revolution, on New Year's Eve 1977, President Carter further angered anti-Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi, declaring how beloved the shah was by his people. After the revolution culminated in February 1979 with the return of Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] from France, the American Embassy was occupied and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy's front-facing windows that they had been replaced with [[bulletproof glass]].

The Carter administration tried to mitigate anti-American feeling by promoting a new relationship with the ''de facto'' Iranian government and continuing military cooperation in hopes that the situation would stabilize. However, on October 22, 1979, the United States permitted the Shah, who had [[lymphoma]], to enter [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]] for medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Lee A.|date=October 24, 1979|title=Medical tests in Manhattan|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/24/archives/medical-tests-in-manhattan-jaundice-in-patient-reported.html}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=October 24, 1979|title=Jaundice in patient reported|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/24/archives/medical-tests-in-manhattan-jaundice-in-patient-reported.html}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=October 25, 1979|title=Shah's surgeons unblock bile duct and also remove his gallbladder|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/25/archives/shahs-surgeons-unblock-bile-duct-and-also-remove-his-gallbladder.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department had discouraged the request, understanding the political delicacy.&lt;ref name="Bowden 2006, p. 19"/&gt; But in response to pressure from influential figures including former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Chairman [[David Rockefeller]], the Carter administration decided to grant it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/archives_roll/2003_01-03/dauherty_shah/dauherty_shah.html |title=Daugherty &amp;#124; Jimmy Carter and the 1979 Decision to Admit the Shah into the United States |website=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Farber"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOc-SCVsfJAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=us+hostage+crisis+chase+manhattan&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XNzMh-F0Ev&amp;sig=T8rxK2qMhpUpyVQfbEcRSWF-DuA |title=Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with ... |author=David Farber |page=122 |website=Books.google.com |date=1979-11-04 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005063.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610193827/http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005063.php |archivedate=June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shah's admission to the United States intensified Iranian revolutionaries' anti-Americanism and spawned rumors of another U.S.–backed coup that would re-install him.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/3/stephen_kinzer_on_the_us_iranian |title=Stephen Kinzer on US-Iranian Relations, the 1953 CIA Coup in Iran and the Roots of Middle East Terror |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayatollah Khomeini, who had been exiled by the shah for 15 years, heightened the rhetoric against the "[[Great Satan]]", as he called the United States, talking of "evidence of American plotting".&lt;ref&gt;Moin ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ending what they believed was American sabotage of the revolution, the hostage takers hoped to depose the [[The Interim Government of Iran|provisional revolutionary government]] of Prime Minister [[Mehdi Bazargan]], which they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the United States and extinguish Islamic revolutionary order in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of the embassy on November 4, 1979, was also intended as leverage to demand the return of the shah to stand trial in Iran in exchange for the hostages.

A later study claimed that there had been no American plots to overthrow the revolutionaries, and that a CIA intelligence-gathering mission at the embassy had been "notably ineffectual, gathering little information and hampered by the fact that none of the three officers spoke the local language, [[Persian language|Persian]]." Its work, the study said, was "routine, prudent espionage conducted at diplomatic missions everywhere."&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecurity.org/newjournal/BookReviews/displayBookReview2.asp?review=63 |title=Journal of Homeland Security review of Mark Bowden's "Guests of the Ayatollah" |accessdate=2007-02-25 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===First attempt===
{{further|Kenneth Kraus}}
On the morning of February 14, 1979 – the same day that the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Adolph Dubs]], was kidnapped and fatally shot by Muslim extremists in [[Kabul]]&lt;ref name=Spectator_Dubs&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lord |first1=Jeffrey |title=Jimmy Carter's Dead Ambassador |url=http://spectator.org/articles/34550/jimmy-carters-dead-ambassador  |publisher=The American Spectator |date=23 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took a Marine named [[Kenneth Kraus]] hostage.

===Second attempt===
The next attempt to seize the American Embassy was planned for September 1979 by [[Ebrahim Asgharzadeh]], a student at the time. He consulted with the heads of the Islamic associations of Tehran's main universities, including the [[University of Tehran]], [[Sharif University of Technology]], [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] (Polytechnic of Tehran), and [[Iran University of Science and Technology]]. They named their group [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]].

Asgharzadeh later said there were five students at the first meeting, two of whom wanted to target the Soviet Embassy because the USSR was "a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and anti-God regime". Two others, [[Mohsen Mirdamadi]] and [[Habibolah Bitaraf]], supported Asgharzadeh's chosen target: the United States. "Our aim was to object against the American government by going to their embassy and occupying it for several hours," Asgharzadeh said. "Announcing our objections from within the occupied compound would carry our message to the world in a much more firm and effective way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Mark Bowden|Bowden, Mark]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200412/bowden |title=Among the Hostage-Takers |work=The Atlantic |date=December 2004 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirdamadi told an interviewer, "We intended to detain the diplomats for a few days, maybe one week, but no more."&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;335&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]], the spokeswoman for the Iranian students during the crisis, said that those who rejected Asgharzadeh's plan did not participate in the subsequent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irannegah.com/Video.aspx?id=579 |title=Iran Negah |publisher=Iran Negah |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The students observed the procedures of the [[Marine Security Guard]]s from nearby rooftops overlooking the embassy. They also drew on their experiences from the recent revolution, during which the U.S. Embassy grounds were briefly occupied. They enlisted the support of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 8, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the group and other sources, Ayatollah Khomeini did not know of the plan beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Radicals Reborn |author=Scott Macleod |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992548,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=November 15, 1999|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students had wanted to inform him, but according to the author [[Mark Bowden]], Ayatollah [[Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha]] persuaded them not to. Khoeiniha feared that the government would use the police to expel the students as they had the occupiers in February. The provisional government had been appointed by Khomeini, and so Khomeini was likely to go along with the government's request to restore order. On the other hand, Khoeiniha knew that if Khomeini first saw that the occupiers were faithful supporters of him (unlike the leftists in the first occupation) and that large numbers of pious Muslims had gathered outside the embassy to show their support for the takeover, it would be "very hard, perhaps even impossible", for him to oppose the takeover, and this would paralyze the Bazargan administration, which Khoeiniha and the students wanted to eliminate.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the takeover stated that their motivation was fear of another American-backed coup against their popular revolution. They claimed that in 1953, the American Embassy had acted as a "den of spies" from which the coup was organized. Documents were later found in the embassy suggesting that some staff members had been working with American intelligence agencies. After the Shah entered the United States, Ayatollah Khomeini called for street demonstrations.

===Takeover===
[[File:Two American hostages in Iran hostage crisis.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Two American hostages during the siege of the U.S. Embassy.]]
On November 4, 1979, one of the demonstrations organized by Iranian student unions loyal to Khomeini erupted into an all-out conflict right outside the walled compound housing the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Embassy.

Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., the ringleaders gathered between three hundred and five hundred selected students and briefed them on the battle plan. A female student was given a pair of metal cutters to break the chains locking the embassy's gates and hid them beneath her [[chador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macleod |first=Scott |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992548,00.html |title=Radicals Reborn |publisher=TIME |date=1999-11-15 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the students planned a symbolic occupation, in which they would release statements to the press and leave when government security forces came to restore order. This was reflected in placards saying: "Don't be afraid. We just want to sit in." When the embassy guards brandished firearms, the protesters retreated, with one telling the Americans, "We don't mean any harm."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 40, 77&lt;/ref&gt; But as it became clear that the guards would not use deadly force and that a large, angry crowd had gathered outside the compound to cheer the occupiers and jeer the hostages, the plan changed.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt; According to one embassy staff member, buses full of demonstrators began to appear outside the embassy shortly after the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line broke through the gates.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Bowden 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As Khomeini's followers had hoped, Khomeini supported the takeover. According to Foreign Minister Yazdi, when he went to [[Qom]] to tell Khomeini about it, Khomeini told him to "go and kick them out." But later that evening, back in Tehran, Yazdi heard on the radio that Khomeini had issued a statement supporting the seizure, calling it "the second revolution" and the embassy an "American spy den in Tehran".&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iran Hostage Crisis Newsreel.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=7|A two-minute [[video clip|clip]] from a [[newsreel]] regarding the hostage crisis (1980)]]
The occupiers bound and blindfolded the Marines and staff at the embassy and paraded them in front of photographers. In the first couple of days, many of the embassy workers who had sneaked out of the compound or had not been there at the time of the takeover were rounded up by Islamists and returned as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 50, 132–34&lt;/ref&gt; Six American diplomats managed to avoid capture and took refuge in the British Embassy before being transferred to the Canadian Embassy. Others went to the Swedish Embassy in Tehran for three months. In a joint covert operation known as the [[Canadian caper]], the Canadian government and the CIA managed to smuggle them out of Iran on January 28, 1980, using Canadian passports and a cover story that identified them as a film crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/list_of_hostages.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041108083936/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/list_of_hostages.phtml |archivedate=November 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
The Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi return to Iran for trial and execution. The U.S. maintained that the Shah—who was to die less than a year later, in July 1980—had come to America for medical attention. The group's other demands included that the U.S. government apologize for its interference in the internal affairs of Iran, including the overthrow of Prime Minister Mosaddegh in 1953, and that [[Iran's frozen assets]] in the United States be released.

The man on the right holding the briefcase is [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the 1979 hostage crisis|alleged by some former hostages]] to be future President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], although he, Iran's government, and the [[CIA]] deny this.]]
The initial plan was to hold the embassy for only a short time, but this changed after it became apparent how popular the takeover was and that Khomeini had given it his full support.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt; Some attributed the decision not to release the hostages quickly to President Carter's failure to immediately deliver an ultimatum to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2001), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; His initial response was to appeal for the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds and to share his hopes for a strategic [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] alliance with the Ayatollah.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 221; "America Can't do a *** Thing" by Amir Taheri ''New York Post,'' November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As some of the student leaders had hoped, Iran's moderate prime minister, Bazargan, and his cabinet resigned under pressure just days after the takeover.

The duration of the hostages' captivity has also been attributed to internal Iranian revolutionary politics. As Ayatollah Khomeini told Iran's president:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theocratic [[Islamism|Islamists]], as well as leftist political groups like the socialist [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand (1989), ''The Iranian Mojahedin'' (1989), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; supported the taking of hostages as a counterattack against "[[American imperialism]]". According to scholar [[Daniel Pipes]], writing in 1980, the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-leaning leftists and the Islamists shared a common antipathy toward market-based reforms under the late Shah, and both subsumed individualism, including the unique identity of women, under conservative, though contrasting, visions of collectivism. Accordingly, both groups favored the Soviet Union over the United States in the early months of the Iranian Revolution.&lt;ref name="PipesNYT1980"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pipes|first1=Daniel|authorlink1=Daniel Pipes|title=Khomeini, the Soviets and U.S.: why the Ayatollah fears America|work=[[New York Times]]|date=May 27, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets, and possibly their allies [[Cuba]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Libya]], and East Germany, were suspected of providing indirect assistance to the participants in the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] under [[Yasser Arafat]] provided personnel, intelligence liaisons, funding, and training for Khomeini's forces before and after the Revolution, and was suspected of playing a role in the embassy crisis.&lt;ref name="Bergman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Ronan|title=The Secret War with Iran: the 30-Year Clandestine Struggle against the World's Most Dangerous Terrorist Power|date=2008|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=9781416577003|pages=30–31|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fidel Castro]] reportedly praised Khomeini as a revolutionary anti-imperialist who could find common cause between revolutionary socialists and anti-American Islamists. Both expressed disdain for modern [[capitalism]] and a preference for authoritarian collectivism.&lt;ref name="Geyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geyer|first1=Georgie Anne|authorlink1=Georgie Anne Geyer|title=Guerrilla Prince: the Untold Story of Fidel Castro|date=2001|publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Universal]]|location=[[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]|isbn=0740720643|page=348|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba and its socialist ally Venezuela, under [[Hugo Chávez]], would later form [[ALBA]] in alliance with the Islamic Republic as a counter to [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] American influence.

Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after [[paper shredder|shredding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/publications/iran/irdoc.html |title=Iran, 1977–1980/Document |website=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to buttress their claim that "the Great Satan" (the U.S.) was trying to destabilize the new regime and that Iranian moderates were in league with the U.S. The documents – including telegrams, correspondence, and reports from the U.S. [[State Department]] and CIA – were published in a series of books called ''Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den'' ({{lang-fa|اسناد لانه جاسوسی امریكا}}). According to a 1997 [[Federation of American Scientists]] bulletin, by 1995, 77 volumes of ''Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den'' had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/bulletin/sec70.html |title=Secrecy &amp; Government Bulletin, Issue 70 |website=Fas.org |date=1997-05-29 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these volumes are now available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/DocumentsFromTheU.s.EspionageDen |title=Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By embracing the hostage-taking under the slogan "America can't do a thing", Khomeini rallied support and deflected criticism of his controversial [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|theocratic constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, Said Amir, ''Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran'' by Said Amir Arjomand, Oxford University Press, 1988 p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; which was scheduled for a referendum vote in less than one month.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was successful, and after the vote, both leftists and theocrats continued to use allegations of pro-Americanism to suppress their opponents: relatively moderate political forces that included the Iranian Freedom Movement, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]], Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]],&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 229, 231; Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), pp. 115–16&lt;/ref&gt; and later President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]]. In particular, carefully selected diplomatic dispatches and reports discovered at the embassy and released by the hostage-takers led to the disempowerment and resignation of moderate figures&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; such as Bazargan. The failed rescue attempt and the political danger of any move seen as accommodating America delayed a negotiated release of the hostages. After the crisis ended, leftists and theocrats turned on each other, with the stronger theocratic group annihilating the left.

===Hostage conditions===
The hostage-takers, declaring their solidarity with other "oppressed minorities" and "the special place of women in Islam", released one woman and two [[African Americans]] on November 19.&lt;ref name="If"&gt;Efty, Alex; 'If Shah Not Returned, Khomeini Sets Trial for Other Hostages'; ''[[Kentucky New Era]]'', November 20, 1979, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Before release, these hostages were required by their captors to hold a press conference in which Kathy Gross and William Quarles praised the revolution's aims,&lt;ref&gt;Farber, ''Taken Hostage'' (2005), pp. 156–57&lt;/ref&gt; but four further women and six African-Americans were released the following day.&lt;ref name="If"/&gt; The only African-American hostage not released that month was Charles A. Jones, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/27/us/no-headline-240600.html|title = Black Hostage Reports Abuse|last = |first = |date = January 27, 1981|work = |access-date = January 4, 2016|via = |publisher = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One more hostage, a white man named [[Richard Queen]], was released in July 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as [[multiple sclerosis]]. The remaining 52 hostages were held until January 1981, up to 444 days of captivity.

The hostages were initially held at the embassy, but after the failed rescue mission, they were scattered around Iran to make a single rescue impossible. Three high-level officials – [[Bruce Laingen]], [[Victor L. Tomseth]], and Mike Howland – were at the Foreign Ministry at the time of the takeover. They stayed there for some months, sleeping in the ministry's formal dining room and washing their socks and underwear in the bathroom. At first, they were treated as diplomats, but after the provisional government fell, their treatment deteriorated. By March, the doors to their living space were kept "chained and padlocked."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 151, 219, 372&lt;/ref&gt;

By midsummer 1980, the Iranians had moved the hostages to prisons in Tehran&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent escapes or rescue attempts and to improve the logistics of guard shifts and food delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 514–15&lt;/ref&gt; The final holding area, from November 1980 until their release, was the [[Teymur Bakhtiar]] mansion in Tehran, where the hostages were finally given tubs, showers, and hot and cold running water.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; Several foreign diplomats and ambassadors – including former Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]] – visited the hostages over the course of the crisis and relayed information back to the U.S. government, including dispatches from Laingen.

[[File:Revolutionary occupation of U.S. embassy Title of Islamic Republican newspaper in November 5, 1979.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|A headline in an [[Islamic Republican newspaper]] on November 5, 1979, read "Revolutionary occupation of U.S. embassy".]]

Iranian propaganda stated that the hostages were "guests" and were treated with respect. Asgharzadeh, the student leader, described the original plan as a nonviolent and symbolic action in which the "gentle and respectful treatment" of the hostages would dramatize to the world the offended sovereignty and dignity of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In America, an Iranian [[chargé d'affaires]], Ali Agha, stormed out of a meeting with an American official, exclaiming: "We are not mistreating the hostages. They are being very well taken care of in Tehran. They are our guests."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual treatment was far different. The hostages described beatings,&lt;ref&gt;Rick Kupke in Bowden 2006, p. 81, Charles Jones, Colonel Dave Roeder, Metrinko, Tom Ahern (in Bowden 2006, p. 295)&lt;/ref&gt; theft,&lt;ref&gt;Hall in Bowden 2006, p. 257, Limbert in Bowden 2006, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt; and fear of bodily harm. Two of them, William Belk and Kathryn Koob, recalled being paraded blindfolded before an angry, chanting crowd outside the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;in Bowden 2006, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Others reported having their hands bound "day and night" for days&lt;ref&gt;Bill Belk in Bowden 2006, pp. 65, 144, Malcolm Kalp in Bowden 2006, pp. 507–11&lt;/ref&gt; or even weeks;&lt;ref&gt;Queen, in Bowden 2006, p. 258, Metrinko, in Bowden 2006, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; long periods of solitary confinement;&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 307, 344, 405, 540&lt;/ref&gt; and months of being forbidden to speak to one another&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 149, 351–52&lt;/ref&gt; or to stand, walk, or leave their space unless they were going to the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; All of the hostages "were threatened repeatedly with execution, and took it seriously".&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The hostage-takers played [[Russian roulette]] with their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hfhkAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6225,19155|title=Russian roulette played with hostages|place=New York|agency=Associated Press|work=Edmonton Journal|date=January 21, 1981|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most terrifying night for the hostages came on February 5, 1980, when guards in black ski masks roused them from their sleep and led them blindfolded to other rooms. They were searched after being ordered to strip naked and keep their hands up. They were then told to kneel down, still wearing blindfolds. "This was the greatest moment," one hostage said. Another later recalled, "It was an embarrassing moment. However, we were too scared to realize it." The guards cocked their weapons and readied them to fire, but finally ejected their rounds and told the prisoners to get dressed. The hostages were later told that the exercise had been "just a joke," something the guards "had wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 346–50&lt;/ref&gt;

One, Michael Metrinko, was kept in solitary confinement for months. On two occasions, when he expressed his opinion of Ayatollah Khomeini, he was punished severely. The first time, he was kept in handcuffs for two weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and the second time, he was beaten and kept alone in a freezing cell for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hostage, U.S. Army medic Donald Hohman, went on a [[hunger strike]] for several weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; and two hostages attempted suicide. Steve Lauterbach broke a water glass and slashed his wrists after being locked in a dark basement room with his hands tightly bound. He was found by guards and rushed to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Miele, a CIA communication technician, smashed his head into the corner of a door, knocking himself unconscious and cutting a deep gash. "Naturally withdrawn" and looking "ill, old, tired, and vulnerable," Miele had become the butt of his guards' jokes, and they had rigged up a mock electric chair to emphasize the fate that awaited him. His fellow hostages applied first aid and raised the alarm, and he was taken to a hospital after a long delay created by the guards.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 516–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hostages described threats to boil their feet in oil (Alan B. Golacinski),&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; cut their eyes out (Rick Kupke),&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; or kidnap and kill a disabled son in America and "start sending pieces of him to your wife" (David Roeder).&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

Four hostages tried to escape,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Kalp in Bowden 2006, pp. 507–11, Joe Subic, Kevin Hemening, and Steve Lauterbach, in Bowden 2006, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; and all were punished with stretches of solitary confinement when their attempts were discovered.

[[File:DF-SN-82-06759.jpg|thumb|A group photograph of the fifty-two hostages in a Wiesbaden hospital where they spent a few days after their release.]]
Queen, the hostage sent home because of his multiple sclerosis, first developed dizziness and numbness in his left arm six months before his release.&lt;ref&gt;December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; His symptoms were misdiagnosed by the Iranians at first as a reaction to drafts of cold air. When warmer confinement did not help, he was told that it was "nothing" and that the symptoms would soon disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Over the months, the numbness spread to his right side, and the dizziness worsened until he "was literally flat on his back, unable to move without growing dizzy and throwing up."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;

The cruelty of the Iranian prison guards became "a form of slow torture."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; The guards often withheld mail – telling one hostage, Charles W. Scott, "I don't see anything for you, Mr. Scott. Are you sure your wife has not found another man?"&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; – and the hostages' possessions went missing.&lt;ref&gt;'Hall's apartment ransacked' in Bowden 2006, p. 257, Roeder's in Bowden 2006, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;

As the hostages were taken to the aircraft that would fly them out of Tehran, they were led through a gauntlet of students forming parallel lines and shouting, "Marg bar Amrika" ("[[death to America]]").&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; When the pilot announced that they were out of Iran, the "freed hostages went wild with happiness. Shouting, cheering, crying, clapping, falling into one another's arms."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact in the United States===
[[File:Heckler2.jpg|thumb|A heckler in Washington, D.C., leans across a police line toward a demonstration of Iranians in August 1980.]]
In the United States, the hostage crisis created "a surge of patriotism" and left "the American people more united than they have been on any issue in two decades".&lt;ref name="TIMEkhomeini"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man of the Year: The Mystic Who Lit The Fires of Hatred |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923854,00.html |newspaper=Time |date=January 7, 1980 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostage-taking was seen "not just as a diplomatic affront", but as a "declaration of war on diplomacy itself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Doing Satan's Work in Iran", ''New York Times'', November 6, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news gave daily updates.&lt;ref&gt;The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night program ''America Held Hostage'', anchored by [[Ted Koppel]], later became a stalwart news magazine under the title ''[[Nightline]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1980, the ''CBS Evening News'' anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] began ending each show by saying how many days the hostages had been captive.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, Julian E. ''Jimmy Carter: the 39th President, 1977–81.'' New York: Times, 2010.
Print.&lt;/ref&gt; President Carter applied economic and diplomatic pressure: Oil imports from Iran were ended on November 12, 1979, and with [[Executive Order 12170]], around US$8 billion of Iranian assets in the United States were frozen by the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] on November 14.

During the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1979, high school students made cards that were delivered to the hostages.&lt;ref name="TIME_1981-01-26"/&gt; Community groups across the country did the same, resulting in bales of Christmas cards. The [[National Christmas Tree (United States)|National Christmas Tree]] was left dark except for the top star.

The two Trenton, N.J., newspapers at the time, ''The Trenton Times'' and ''the Trentonian'' and perhaps others around the country, printed full-page color American flags in their newspapers for readers to cut out and place in the front windows of their homes as support for the hostages to be left in their windows until the hostages were brought home safely.

A severe backlash against Iranians in the United States developed. One [[Iranian Americans|Iranian American]] later complained, "I had to hide my Iranian identity not to get beaten up, even at university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahari |first=Maziar |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/iran-ahmadinejad-government |title=Inside Iran |website=Newstatesman.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bowden, a pattern emerged in President Carter's attempts to negotiate the hostages' release: "Carter would latch on to a deal proffered by a top Iranian official and grant minor but humiliating concessions, only to have it scotched at the last minute by Khomeini."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian rescue of hostages===
{{main|Canadian Caper}}
[[Image:ThanksCanada.JPG|{{largethumb}}|[[United States|Americans]] expressed gratitude for Canadian efforts to rescue American diplomats during the hostage crisis.]]
On the day the hostages were seized, six American diplomats evaded capture and remained in hiding at the home of the Canadian diplomat John Sheardown, under the protection of the Canadian ambassador, [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. In late 1979, the government of Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] secretly issued an [[Order in council|Order in Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/MarleauMontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?DocId=1001&amp;Sec=Ch09&amp;Seq=5&amp;Language=E |title=Sittings of the House – Special or Unusual Sittings |website=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Canadian passports to be issued to some American citizens so that they could escape. In cooperation with the CIA, which used the cover story of a film project, two CIA agents and the six American diplomats boarded a [[Swissair]] flight to [[Zurich]], Switzerland, on January 28, 1980. Their rescue from Iran, known as the Canadian caper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art1.html |title=CIA Goes Hollywood: A Classic Case of Deception |last=Mendez |first=Antonio J. |authorlink=Tony Mendez |publisher=''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'' |date=Winter 1999–2000 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9k6tEwOfnyEC&amp;pg=PA304 |title=The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA |last=Mendez |first=Antonio J. |authorlink=Tony Mendez |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2000 |isbn=0060957913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Talk of the Town |work=The New Yorker |page=87 |date=May 12, 1980 |volume=56 |number=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was fictionalized in the 2012 film [[Argo (2012 film)|''Argo'']].

===Negotiations for release===
{{main|Iran hostage crisis negotiations}}

===Rescue attempts===
{{further|Operation Eagle Claw}}
{{Refimprove section |date=March 2009}}

====First rescue attempt====
[[Cyrus Vance]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], had argued against [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]'s, the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], push for a military solution to the crisis.&lt;ref name=NYTmag&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Douglas Brinkley]]|title=The Lives They Lived; Out of the Loop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-out-of-the-loop.html|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=29 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vance, struggling with [[gout]], went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt; On Friday Brzezinski held a newly scheduled meeting of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] where the president authorized [[Operation Eagle Claw]], a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Deputy Secretary [[Warren Christopher]], who attended the meeting in Vance's place, did not inform Vance.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Furious, Vance handed in his resignation on principle, calling Brzezinski "evil".&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;

Late in the afternoon of April 24, 1980, eight [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|RH‑53D]] helicopters flew from the aircraft carrier [[USS Nimitz|USS ''Nimitz'']] to a remote road serving as an airstrip in the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Great Salt Desert]] of Eastern Iran, near [[Tabas]]. They encountered severe dust storms that disabled two of the helicopters, which were traveling in complete [[radio silence]]. Early the next morning, the remaining six helicopters met up with several waiting [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft at a landing site and refueling area designated "Desert One".

At this point, a third helicopter was found to be unserviceable, bringing the total below the six deemed vital for the mission. The commander of the operation, Col. [[Charles Alvin Beckwith]], recommended that the mission be aborted, and his recommendation was approved by President Carter. As the helicopters repositioned themselves for refueling, one ran into a C‑130 tanker aircraft and crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen and injuring several more.{{sfn|Holloway|1980|pp=9–10}}

In May 1980 the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] commissioned a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Operations]] review group of six senior military officers, led by Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]], to thoroughly examine all aspects of the rescue attempt. The group identified 23 issues that were significant in the failure of the mission, 11 of which it deemed major. The overriding issue was [[operational security]]—that is, keeping the mission secret so that the arrival of the rescue team at the embassy would be a complete surprise. This severed the usual relationship between pilots and weather forecasters; the pilots were not informed about the local dust storms. Another security requirement was that the helicopter pilots come from the same unit. The unit picked for the mission was a U.S. Navy mine-laying unit flying [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|CH-53D Sea Stallions]]; these helicopters were considered the best suited for the mission because of their long range, large capacity, and compatibility with shipboard operations.

Two hours into the flight, the crew of helicopter No. 6 saw a warning light indicating that a main rotor might be cracked. They landed in the desert, confirmed visually that a crack had started to develop, and stopped flying in accordance with normal operating procedure. Helicopter No. 8 landed to pick up the crew of No. 6, and abandoned No. 6 in the desert without destroying it. The report by Holloway's group pointed out that a cracked helicopter blade could have been used to continue the mission and that its likelihood of catastrophic failure would have been low for many hours, especially at lower flying speeds.{{sfn|Holloway|1980|p=44}} The report found that the pilot of No. 6 would have continued the mission if instructed to do so.

When the helicopters encountered two [[dust storm]]s along the way to the refueling point, the second more severe than the first, the pilot of No. 5 turned back because the mine-laying helicopters were not equipped with [[terrain-following radar]]. The report found that the pilot could have continued to the refueling point if he had been told that better weather awaited him there, but because of the command for radio silence, he did not ask about the conditions ahead. The report also concluded that "there were ways to pass the information" between the refueling station and the helicopter force "that would have small likelihood of compromising the mission"—in other words, that the ban on communication had not been necessary at this stage.{{sfn|Holloway|1980|p=45}}

Helicopter No. 2 experienced a partial [[Hydraulics|hydraulic system]] failure but was able to fly on for four hours to the refueling location. There, an inspection showed that a hydraulic fluid leak had damaged a pump and that the helicopter could not be flown safely, nor repaired in time to continue the mission. Six helicopters was thought to be the absolute minimum required for the rescue mission, so with the force reduced to five, the local commander radioed his intention to abort. This request was passed through military channels to President Carter, who agreed.&lt;ref name="Holloway1980"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/hollowayrpt.htm#issue10 |year=1980 |last=Holloway |first=J.

After the mission and its failure were made known publicly, Khomeini credited divine intervention on behalf of Islam, and his prestige skyrocketed in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, ''Iranians'', (2000), p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian officials who favored release of the hostages, such as President [[Bani Sadr]], were weakened. In America, President Carter's political popularity and prospects for being re-elected in 1980 were further damaged after a television address on April 25 in which he explained the rescue operation and accepted responsibility for its failure.

====Planned second attempt====
A second rescue attempt, planned but never carried out, would have used highly modified YMC-130H Hercules aircraft. Three aircraft, outfitted with rocket thrusters to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium|Shahid Shiroudi football stadium]] near the embassy, were modified under a rushed, super-secret program known as [[Operation Credible Sport]]. One crashed during a demonstration at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] on October 29, 1980, when its braking rockets were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire, but all on board survived. After Carter lost the [[United States presidential election, 1980|presidential election]] in November, the project was abandoned.

The failed rescue attempt led to the creation of the [[160th SOAR]], a helicopter aviation Special Operations group.

With the completion of [[Iran hostage crisis negotiations|negotiations]], the hostages were released on January 20, 1981. That day, at the moment President Reagan completed his 20‑minute inaugural address after being [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|sworn in]], the 52 American hostages were released to U.S. personnel.&lt;ref name="Weisman A1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan Takes Oath as 40th President; Promises an "Era of National Renewal'—Minutes Later, 52 U.S. Hostages in Iran Fly to Freedom After 444-Day Ordeal|first=Steven R.|last=Weisman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1981|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1981/Iranian-Hostages-Released/12311754163167-2/ |title=Iranian Hostages Released – 1981 Year in Review – Audio |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are theories and conspiracy theories regarding why Iran postponed the release until that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/25/10826056/reagan-iran-hostage-negotiation |title=The Republican myth of Ronald Reagan and the Iran hostages, debunked |publisher=Vox |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.org/1987-october/did-iran-delay-hostages-release-to-ensure-reagan-s-election.html |title=Did Iran Delay Hostages Release To Ensure Reagan's Election? |publisher=WRMEA |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Neil A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/world/new-reports-say-1980-reagan-campaign-tried-to-delay-hostage-release.html |title=New Reports Say 1980 Reagan Campaign Tried to Delay Hostage Release |location=IRAN |website=NYTimes.com |date=1991-04-15 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also: [[October Surprise conspiracy theory]])''  They were flown from Iran to Algeria as a symbolic gesture of appreciation for the Algerian government's help in resolving the crisis. The flight continued to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] in West Germany and on to an Air Force hospital in [[Wiesbaden]], where former President Carter, acting as emissary, received them. After medical check-ups and debriefings, the hostages made a second flight to a refueling stop in [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon, Ireland]], where they were greeted by a large crowd. The ex-hostages were then flown  to [[Stewart Air National Guard Base]] in [[Newburgh (town), New York|Newburgh, New York]]. From Newburgh, they traveled by bus to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point and stayed at the [[Thayer Hotel]] for three days, receiving a heroes' welcome all along the route. Ten days after their release, they were given a [[ticker tape parade]] through the [[Canyon of Heroes]] in New York City.

==Aftermath==
===Iran–Iraq War===
The [[Iran–Iraq War|Iraqi invasion of Iran]] occurred less than a year after the embassy employees were taken hostage. The journalist [[Stephen Kinzer]] argues that the dramatic change in American–Iranian relations, from allies to enemies, helped embolden the Iraqi leader, [[Saddam Hussein]], and that the United States' anger with Iran led it to [[United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war|aid the Iraqis]] after the war turned against them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Inside Iran's Fury|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html|archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130419175811/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = April 19, 2013|website = Smithsonian|accessdate = 2016-01-05|last = Kinzer|first = Stephen|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States supplied Iraq with, among other things, "helicopters and satellite intelligence that was used in selecting bombing targets." This assistance "deepened and widened anti-American feeling in Iran."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Consequences for Iran===

[[File:13 Aban (3).jpg|thumb|A protest in Tehran on November 4, 2015, against the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.]]
[[File:13 Aban (4).jpg|thumb|The November 2015 protest in Tehran.]]
The hostage-taking was unsuccessful for Iran in some respects. It lost international support for its war against Iraq, and the negotiated settlement was considered almost wholly favorable to the United States because it did not meet any of Iran's original demands.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution'', Keddie, Nikki, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the crisis strengthened Iranians who had supported the hostage-taking. Anti-Americanism became even more intense.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians such as Khoeiniha and [[Behzad Nabavi]]&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, Daniel ''Reinventing Khomeini'', University of Chicago Press (2001), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; were left in a stronger position, while those associated with&amp;nbsp;– or accused of association with&amp;nbsp;– America were removed from the political picture. A Khomeini biographer, [[Baqer Moin]], described the crisis as "a watershed in Khomeini's life" that transformed him from "a cautious, pragmatic politician" into "a modern revolutionary single-mindedly pursuing a dogma". In Khomeini's statements, ''imperialism'' and ''liberalism'' were "negative words", while ''revolution'' "became a sacred word, sometimes more important than ''Islam''".&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Khomeini, (2000) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=January 2016}} have suggested that the greatest benefit of the takeover of the American Embassy was the acquisition of intelligence contained within the embassy, including the identity of informants to the U.S. government, which the new Islamist government could use to remove potential dissenters and consolidate its gains.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Iranian government commemorates the event every year with a demonstration at the embassy and the [[Flag desecration|burning of an American&amp;nbsp;flag]]. However, on November 4, 2009, prodemocracy protesters and reformists demonstrated in the streets of Tehran. When the authorities encouraged them to chant "death to America," the protesters instead chanted "death to the dictator" (referring to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Iran's Supreme Leader]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]]) and other antigovernment slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/11/irans-prodemocracy-protesters-to-obama-with-us-or-against-us-what-a-difference-30-years-makes.html|title=Iran's pro-democracy protesters to Obama: With us or against us?

In 2000 the hostages and their families tried unsuccessfully to sue Iran under the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|Antiterrorism Act]] of 1996.

The former U.S. Embassy building is now used by Iran's government and affiliated groups. Since 2001 it has served as a museum to the revolution. Outside the door, there is a bronze model based on the [[Statue of Liberty]] on one side and a statue portraying one of the hostages on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = BBC NEWS {{!}} In pictures: Iran hostage crisis|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/04/middle_east_iran_hostage_crisis/html/12.stm|website = news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in 2006 that a group called the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign had used the embassy to recruit "martyrdom seekers": volunteers to carry out operations against Western and [[Iran Israel relations|Israeli]] targets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian group seeks British suicide bombers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/19/iran.israel |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2008-05-10 | location=London | first=Robert | last=Tait}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad Samadi, a spokesman for the group, signed up several hundred volunteers in a few days.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Diplomatic relations===

The United States and Iran broke off formal diplomatic relations over the hostage crisis. Iran selected Algeria as its [[protecting power]] in the United States, transferring the mandate to Pakistan in 1992. The United States selected Switzerland as its protecting power in Iran. Relations are maintained through the [[Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States|Iranian Interests Section]] of the Pakistan Embassy and the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. Interests Section]] of the Swiss Embassy.

A small number of hostages were not connected to diplomatic staff. All were released by late 1981.
* Jerry Plotkin—American Businessman released January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/08/us/jerry-plotkin-62-who-spent-444-days-as-a-hostage-in-iran.html|title=Jerry Plotkin, 62, Who Spent 444 Days as a Hostage in Iran|first=|last=Ap|date=June 8, 1996|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostages honored===
All State Department and CIA employees taken hostage received the [[State Department Award for Valor]]. Political Officer Michael J. Metrinko received two: one for his time as a hostage and another for his daring rescue of Americans who had been jailed in [[Tabriz]] months before the embassy takeover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Bowden]] ''[[Guests of the Ayatollah: The First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam|Guests of the Ayatollah]]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military later awarded the 20 servicemen among the hostages the [[Defense Meritorious Service Medal]]. The only hostage serviceman not issued the medal was Staff Sgt Joseph Subic, Jr., who "did not behave under stress the way noncommissioned officers are expected to act"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E1D61138F932A35754C0A967948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Around the World; Former Iranian Hostage To Get Early Discharge | date=July 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, he cooperated with the hostage-takers, according to other hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Grove Press, 2006, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humanitarian Service Medal]] was awarded to the servicemen of Joint Task Force 1–79, the planning authority for Operation Rice Bowl/Eagle Claw, who participated in the rescue attempt.

The Air Force Special Operations component of the mission was given the Air Force Outstanding Unit award for performing their part of the mission flawlessly, including evacuating the Desert One refueling site under extreme conditions.

===Notable hostage-takers, guards, and interrogators===
* [[Abbas Abdi]]—reformist, journalist, self-taught sociologist, and social activist.
* [[Hamid Aboutalebi]]—former Iranian ambassador to the United Nations.
* [[Ebrahim Asgharzadeh]]—then a student; later an Iranian political activist and politician, member of [[Parliament of Iran|Parliament]] (1989–1993), and chairman of [[City Council of Tehran]] (1999–2003).
* [[Mohsen Mirdamadi]]—member of Parliament (2000–2004), head of [[Islamic Iran Participation Front]].
* [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]]—interpreter and spokeswoman for the student group that occupied the embassy; later a scientist, journalist, first female [[Vice President of Iran]], and head of Environment Protection Organization of Iran.
* [[Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha]]—spiritual leader of the hostage-takers.
* [[Hussein Sheikholeslam]]—then a student; later a member of Parliament and Iranian ambassador to Syria.

==October Surprise conspiracy theory==
{{further|October Surprise conspiracy theory|October surprise}}
Allegations that the Reagan administration negotiated a delay in the release of the hostages until after the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]] have been numerous but unproven. [[Gary Sick]], principal White House aide for Iran and the Persian Gulf on the Carter administration's [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], claimed in his book ''October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sick |first1=Gary |year=1991 |title=October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. |publisher=Random House |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; that CIA Director [[William J. Casey|William Casey]] and possibly Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] went to Paris to negotiate such a delay. Many others have made the same allegations.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

* The [[Academy Award]]–winning movie ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' was based on the taking of hostages by Iranian revolutionaries. The movie was criticized for changing the story considerably, including by former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American CIA. And with that exception, the movie is very good. But Ben Affleck's character in the film was ... only in Tehran a day and a half. And the main hero, in my opinion, was [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]], who was the Canadian ambassador who orchestrated the entire process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=McDevitt| first=Caitlin| title=Jimmy Carter: 'Argo' great but inaccurate| url= http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2013/02/jimmy-carter-argo-great-but-inaccurate-157592.html| accessdate=February 22, 2013| newspaper=Politico| date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jean-Claude Romand''' (born 11 February 1954) is a [[France|French]] [[murder]]er and [[impostor]] who pretended to be a medical doctor for 18 years before killing his wife, children, and his parents when he was about to be exposed.

== Early life ==

Jean-Claude Romand was born in [[Lons-le-Saunier]] and grew up in the village [[Clairvaux-les-Lacs]] in the ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' of [[Jura (department)|Jura]]. He studied at the ''[[lycée]]'' of Lons-le-Saunier until his ''[[baccalauréat]]''. In 1971, he registered at the ''[[Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles|classes préparatoires]]'' of [[Lycée du Parc]] in [[Lyon]], but dropped out after one term. Afterwards he enrolled as a medical student.

== Deception ==
The deception began with a simple lie: Romand claimed that he had passed a second-year medical examination that he did not take.  He therefore never qualified as a doctor, a fact unknown to his parents.

Romand fooled his family and friends for 18 years; they thought he was a successful medical professional and researcher in the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). He managed to give an impression that he had researched [[arteriosclerosis]] and that he had contacts with political figures.

In reality, he spent his days wandering and used the free information services of the local WHO building. He lived close by in [[Prévessin-Moëns]], France. Periodically he left for a supposed work trip but only traveled to [[Geneva International Airport]] and spent a couple of days in a hotel room there, studying medical journals and a travel guide about the various countries he lied about visiting. Romand lived off the money his wife and he had made by selling an apartment, from his wife's salary, and from sums of money which were given to him by various relatives, who relied on his assurances that he was investing the money in various imaginary [[hedge fund]]s and foreign ventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Roman d'un menteur'', [[France 2]] documentary, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actions on the night of the murders ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
On 9 January 1993 Romand withdrew 2000 francs and borrowed a .22 Long Rifle carbine from his father for which he purchased a [[suppressor]], and gas canisters, and asked for them to be gift wrapped. That night, he beat his wife to death on the couple's double bed with a rolling pin. He left her body until the morning, sleeping as normal. The next morning, he woke his children, had breakfast, and watched cartoons. He put them to bed that night, and once they had fallen asleep, shot them both in the head. After these killings, the only people who could expose him were his parents and his ex-mistress, who wanted back 900,000 francs that she had given him as a favour.

The next morning, Romand travelled to his parents' house, where he joined them for a meal.  Immediately after the meal he repeatedly shot them both and the family dog.

That night he picked up his ex-mistress, telling her they were invited to a dinner with the then health minister, Bernard Kouchner. Pretending that they were lost, he made her exit the car, and as she did so he attempted to strangle her with a cord and sprayed [[tear gas]] into her face. After she fought back, he apologized and drove her back to her home, after making her promise to never tell anyone about his attempt to murder her.  He then returned to his family home, which still contained the bodies of his dead wife and children.

He sat and watched television before he poured [[petrol]] around the house, set it on fire, and took an overdose of sleeping pills to create the appearance of an intended suicide. Whether this attempt was genuine is doubtful, since the pills he took were long expired, and he had access to more effective [[barbiturate]]s; additionally, the manner in which the fire was set and the timing of his taking the pills made his rescue inevitable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''L'Adversaire (The Adversary)'', [[Emmanuel Carrère]] book, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He was rescued by local firefighters who were alerted by the road cleaners at 4:00 the next morning.

He survived the blaze, but refused to talk to police during subsequent questioning; it was initially believed that he was too traumatized to speak.

==Aftermath==
Romand's trial began on 25 June 1996. On 6 July 1996 Romand was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with no possibility of parole for 22 years; he has been eligible for parole since 2015.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Romand is reputed to suffer from [[narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enhancetv.com.au/shop/product.php?productid=103474&amp;cat=330&amp;page=12|title=Warning :: EnhanceTV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary and fiction ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
French author [[Emmanuel Carrère]] entered into correspondence with imprisoned Romand to write a book, published in 2000, ''L'Adversaire'' (''[[The Adversary (Carrère book)|The Adversary]]''), based on the case. [[Nicole Garcia]] directed a movie, ''[[L'Adversaire]]'' (2002), based on the book; actor [[Daniel Auteuil]] played the part of Romand (renamed Jean-Marc Faure in the film). Two other movies were loosely based on Romand's life: the French ''[[L'Emploi du temps]]'' (2001) (English title: ''Time Out'') and the Spanish ''{{Interlanguage link multi|La vida de nadie|es}}'' (English title: ''Nobody's Life''). Romand's deception also formed the basis of the "Subterraneans" episode of the [[BBC]] crime drama [[Waking the Dead (TV series)|''Waking The Dead'']] (third episode of the fifth season in 2005). The episode 16 (season 1) [[Phantom (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|"Phantom"]] of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' is also constructed around this story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9092">This articles lists times that items were renamed due to political motivations. Such renamings have generally occurred during conflicts; for example, [[World War I]] gave rise to anti-German sentiment among [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] nations, leading to disassociation with German names.[[File:Liberty Steak Cartoon.JPG|thumb|250px|An early political cartoon lampooning the name change of hamburger meat during World War I.]]

*[[France]]:
**[[French Revolution]]: the Committee of Public Safety went so far as to banish all words associated with royalty. A major example of their work was taking ''[[King (playing card)|Kings]]'' and ''[[Queen (playing card)|Queens]]'' out of playing cards and replacing them with Committee members. It lasted less than a year. It is commonly believed that this was also the time when Aces earnt their status as being both the highest card and the lowest card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishherault.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/playing-cards-france-politics/|work=[[irishherault.wordpress.com]]|title=French playing cards and card stuff|date=2010-01-31|accessdate=2010-11-22|first=Irish|last=Hérault}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**World War I: coffee with whipped cream, previously known as ''Café Viennois'' (Vienna coffee), was renamed ''Café Liégeois'' (Coffee from [[Liège]]) due to the state of war with Austria-Hungary.

*[[Russia]]: 
**During World War I, [[Saint Petersburg]] was renamed 'Petrograd', amounting effectively to a translation of the name from German to Russian.
**At a meeting on November 16, 2016 with the prime ministers of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, Russia’s prime minister Dmitry Medvedev suggested that [[Caffè_Americano|Americano coffee]] should be renamed “Rusiano coffee". Also, in 2014, following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, several cafes on the peninsula changed their menus to read “Russiano” and “Crimean,” in place of Americano coffee.&lt;ref&gt;https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russias-prime-minister-says-eurasia-should-call-it-rusiano-coffee-not-americano-56180&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Spain]]: After the triumph of [[Francisco Franco]], ''filete imperial'' ("imperial beef") became a [[euphemism]] for ''filete ruso'' ("Russian beef"), "ensaladilla nacional" ("national salad") for "ensaladilla rusa" ([[Russian salad]]) and ''Caperucita Encarnada'' ("[[Little Red Riding Hood]]") for ''Caperucita Roja'' (which has the same meaning but loses its hypothetical connotations).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
*[[United Kingdom]]: 
**World War I:
***The [[German Shepherd]] was renamed the "Alsatian," and German biscuits were renamed [[Empire biscuit]]s due to strong anti-German sentiment.
***The members of the British royal house, a branch of the German [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], severed ties with their German cousins following several bombing raids on England by the first long-range bomber, the [[Gotha G.IV]] starting in March, 1917.  On July 17, 1917, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] changed the family's name to the [[House of Windsor]].

**[[Great Depression]]:  In 1928, during the last months of the [[Calvin Coolidge]] administration, Congress approved the construction of a [[dam]] on the [[Colorado River]] southeast of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  The press referred to it as "Boulder Dam" as a reference to the construction site, Boulder Canyon.  While in Nevada in 1930, [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Ray Lyman Wilbur]] referred to the project as "[[Hoover Dam]]", a reference to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]].  Following Hoover's defeat by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Wilbur's successor, [[Harold L. Ickes]], declared in 1933 that the dam should be called "Boulder Dam".  In 1947, the Republican-controlled Congress changed the name back to "Hoover Dam".
**[[War on Terror]]:  During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], [[freedom fries]] was a short-lived political euphemism for [[French fries]], used by some to express their disapproval of the French opposition to the invasion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=531 | title = Over Here: World War I on the Home Front | work = Digital History | accessdate = 2006-07-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060813211700/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=531 | archivedate = 2006-08-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the French government's opposition to the prospective invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Republican Chairman on the Committee of House Administration renamed French fries "Freedom Fries," and the change was originally supported and followed by some restaurants. The term has since reverted to the original.

A '''steam fair''' or (steam rally) is a regular organised gathering of historic [[steam engine|steam-powered]] vehicles and machinery, open to the public. Typical exhibits include: [[traction engine]]s, [[steam roller]]s, [[steam wagon]]s, and [[steam car]]s. Often, the scope is widened to include other historic exhibits such as [[stationary engine]]s, internal-combustion -powered road transport, agricultural and construction vehicles, working horses, woodcraft and the like.

A typical steam fair consists of: 
* A parade ring or track in which vehicles may be demonstrated
* Trade and craft stalls related to the exhibits
* Areas where vehicles may be examined more closely and the public may talk to owners and operators
* Entertainment areas (often, a beer tent) with food, drink, and evening music
* A fairground area may also be included in the event

The following is a geographic list of these gatherings, some of which are referred to as ''rallies'' or as ''festivals''. The list does not include static steam museums unless they host a particular event that falls into the classification.

In addition there are some travelling shows powered by steam.  Where these are referred to as ''steam fairs'' they are included in the list.

&lt;!-- In due course it is likely that each region or nation may have its own list.  In the meantime please add carefully in alphabetical order creating new headings for new nations or regions, and ideally including a reference to the individual event. --&gt;

Many Middle Schools were closed in Mengshan in 1968 and remained closed until 1974.

==Transportation==
Mengshan does not have an airport or railway. The closest airports to Mengshan are [[Guilin Liangjiang International Airport]] and [[Wuzhou|Wuzhou Airport]]. The main road which runs North-South through Mengshan is the G321 [[China National Highway|National Highway]] ({{zh|s=国道G321|t=國道G321|p=Guódào G sān èr yāo}}). Mengshan town is 145&amp;nbsp;km by road south of Guilin, 82&amp;nbsp;km by road south of [[Yangshuo]], and 187&amp;nbsp;km by road north of Wuzhou. The G321 is a single carriageway with 2 lanes.

There are direct bus services from Mengshan town to Guilin, Wuzhou and many cities in the Guangdong Pearl River Delta including Guangzhou and Zhongshan.

==Economy==
Although similar to Guilin and Yangshuo with attractive karst scenery, potential for outdoor activities, such as caving, rafting, climbing and mountain biking, Mengshan does not have any significant tourist industry or infrastructure.

Agriculture and Forestry are the main Industries in Mengshan. Rice is grown primarily for domestic consumption. Crops and fruit such as butter tea, citrus fruit, apple, chestnut, pear, persimmon, passion fruit, star anise, sugar cane  and ginger are grown for sale. Silkworms are also an important source of income for many villages.  Vanilla is grown in Changping [[Yao people|Yao]] Minority Village ({{zh|s=长坪瑶族乡 |t=長坪瑤族鄉|p=Cháng Píng Yáo Zú Xiāng}}) and in other parts of Mengshan.

Tea is grown in most villages for domestic use, as well as for sale. Mengshan's climate is ideal for growing tea. Coffee mainly of the [[Coffea arabica|Arabica]] variety grows well in Mengshan county in frost free areas but planting is on small scale.

Mengshan has productive vinyards, and further vinyards are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gxny.gov.cn/web/2008-10/223029.htm|title=Grape Planting to Increase|author=Agricultural Information Center of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region|publisher=Guangxi Agricultural Information Web|date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2009-02-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707034034/http://www.gxny.gov.cn/web/2008-10/223029.htm|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suzanne Marie Collins''' was a [[United States Marine Corps|U. S. Marine Corps]] Lance Corporal who was tortured, raped and murdered by '''Sedley Alley''' in 1985. At the time of her murder she was stationed at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]] in [[Millington, Tennessee]]. Collins was a student undergoing training at the base, and was scheduled to graduate from avionics training on the day of her murder. She is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Suzanne Collins was the daughter of Jack and Trudy Collins. She graduated from [[Robert E. Lee High School (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Robert E. Lee High School]] in [[Springfield, Virginia]].

==Abduction and murder==
Sedley Alley (August 16, 1955 - June 28, 2006), a civilian married to an enlisted member of the military, abducted Collins late in the evening of July 11, 1985 while she was jogging on the base. He took her to nearby Edmund Orgill Park. Once there he beat her multiple times, fracturing her skull, before repeatedly shoving a tree limb up her vagina with enough force to penetrate her abdomen and tear one of her lungs. The autopsy would state that Collins died from blunt force trauma to the head and internal hemorrhaging from the tree limb.&lt;ref name="Douglas1997" /&gt; He then ditched the body and fled the scene.

Two Marines jogging near where Collins was abducted heard her scream and ran toward the sound. However, as they reached the scene, they saw Alley's car leaving the area. They reported to base security and accompanied officers on a tour of the base, looking for the car. Unsuccessful, they returned to their [[barracks]], but soon the Marines were called back to the security office. There they identified Alley's car, which had been stopped by officers. Alley and his wife gave statements to the base security personnel accounting for their whereabouts. The security personnel were satisfied with Alley's story, and Alley and his wife returned to their on-base housing.  The two Marine witnesses returned to the security office shortly after Alley and his wife departed. The Marines disputed the couple's version of events, citing that the loud, distinct sounds made by the [[muffler]] on Alley's car matched those sounds they had heard prior to and during Collins' abduction. The security personnel indicated that since no one had yet been reported missing, there was nothing more that could be done. The Marines were thanked for their assistance and told to return to their barracks.&lt;ref name="Douglas1997"&gt;Douglas, John E. (1997). Journey Into Darkness. New York: Lisa Drew Book/Schribner. {{ISBN|0684833042}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins' body was discovered the next morning by sheriff's deputies, after her roommate reported her missing. When word got to the base of the murder, Alley was immediately arrested by [[military police]]. He voluntarily gave a statement to the police, admitting to having killed Collins but giving a substantially false account of the circumstances of the killing. He claimed that his wife Lynne went to a [[Tupperware party]] which had angered him. He drank two six-packs of beer and a bottle of wine. He told authorities that he had gone out for more liquor when his car accidentally hit Collins as she jogged near the air base. He also claimed he accidentally killed the young woman when she fell on a [[screwdriver]] he was holding as he was trying to help her. However, an [[autopsy]] revealed that her skull had been fractured with repeated beatings, there were no screwdriver wounds, and no wounds consistent with being hit by a car.&lt;ref name="Douglas1997" /&gt;

==Trial and execution of Alley==
In spite of his attempt to convince a jury that he had [[multiple personality disorder]], Alley was convicted on March 18, 1987 of murder in the first degree and on May 17, 1987, was sentenced to death. He was also convicted of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated rape, for which he received consecutive forty-year sentences.&lt;ref name="Douglas1997" /&gt; He was scheduled to die by electrocution May 2, 1990, but was reprieved indefinitely by the state Court of Criminal Appeals.

A Shelby County judge denied Alley's initial request for state-funded DNA testing of 11 samples of physical evidence, saying he hadn't shown "reasonable probability" that he wouldn't have been prosecuted or convicted if the tests were in his favor.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee, State of. "RESPONSE OF THE STATE TO PETITIONER'S PETITION FOR DNA TESTING PURSUANT TO T.C.A. §40-30-301 ET SEQ.". Tennessee Administrative Office of the Courts. Tennessee State Courts. Retrieved 07/05/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous appeals, Alley was executed by [[lethal injection]] at the [[Riverbend Maximum Security Institution]] in Nashville, Tennessee, on the morning of June 28, 2006; he was pronounced dead at 2:12&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, E. Thomas. "Sedley Alley put to death at Riverbend Prison". Nashville Post. SouthComm Inc. Retrieved 07/05/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of Alley's appeals process caused Collins' family to successfully work for limitations on groundless [[habeas corpus]] appeals. The amount of time between the murder and Alley's execution (20 years, 11 months, 14 days) was actually longer than Suzanne Collins had been alive (19 years, one month, four days old) when she was killed.

The books ''Journey Into Darkness '' and ''Law &amp; Disorder'' by [[John E. Douglas]] dedicate three chapters to the life and murder of Suzanne Collins and to the advocacy work of her parents following the murder.&lt;ref name="Douglas1997" /&gt;

==Advocacy of Jack and Trudy Collins==
After the murder, the Collinses dealt with their [[grief]] in part by joining a Fairfax County support group for surviving members of homicide victims led by Carroll Ellis and Sandra Witt.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, John E. (1997). Journey Into Darkness. New York: Lisa Drew Book/Schribner. pp. 261–262. {{ISBN|0684833042}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to involvement with the group, the Collinses got more involved in attending the hearings and criminal proceedings of the killers of their loved ones. With the appeals of Alley stretching into years,&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt; the Collinses became frustrated with the long [[habeas corpus]] appeals and continuing delay of Alley's sentence. Both Collinses then became deeply involved with activism and reform work.

In March 1991, J. Collins addressed delegates at the Crime Summit in [[Washington, D.C.]], convened by then [[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Richard Thornburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh, Richard. "CLOSING REMARKS of • ATTORNEY GENERAL RICHARD THORNBURGH". United States Department of Justice. United States Dept of Justice. Retrieved 07/06/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins's statement was about the lack of finality with criminal convictions and pressing for reform. In the early 1990s, both Collinses became Eastern Regional Directors of Citizens for Law and Order, based in [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, John E. (1997). Journey Into Darkness. New York: Lisa Drew Book/Schribner. p. 268. {{ISBN|0684833042}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Collins continued with opportunities presented to the couple and worked with Executive Director Lee Chancellor of the Judicial Reform Foundation to create a pamphlet on habeas corpus abuses and history of the [[judicial process]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, John E. (1997). Journey Into Darkness. New York: Lisa Drew Book/Schribner. p. 269. {{ISBN|0684833042}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 1991, J. Collins testified before Congress on habeas corpus reform and the endless appeals that Alley was requesting. T. Collins was in attendance in support of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, John E. (1997). Journey Into Darkness. New York: Lisa Drew Book/Schribner. p. 270. {{ISBN|0684833042}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collinses have also established a scholarship named the Suzanne Marie Collins Perpetual Scholarship, first awarded in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on Donors: Financial Aid". American Foreign Service Association. American Foreign Service Association. Retrieved 07/06/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver Lawrence Spurling Philpot''', MC, DFC (6 March 1913 – 29 April 1993) was a Canadian-born [[World War II|Second World War]] [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) pilot and subsequently a businessman, best known for being one of the three men to successfully escape from [[Stalag Luft III]] in the escape known as ''The Wooden Horse''.

After the war, Philpot resumed his career in management in the food industry. He wrote the book ''Stolen Journey'', in which he recounts daily life as a prisoner in various [[POW camp]]s, ending with his escape via the Wooden Horse and his return to England.

==Early life==
Philpot was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], the son of an expatriate London engineer.  Holding both British and Canadian [[Multiple citizenship|citizenships]] he returned to England as a child. He was educated, first at Aymestrey School near Worcester, then at [[Radley College]] between 1927 and 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Old Radleian 2005 |url=http://www.radley.org.uk/or/OldRadleian/2005/pdfs/OR%202005%20BookCD.pdf |archiveurl= |work= |publisher= The Radleian Society|location= |page=30 |pages= |language= |format= |doi= |date= |month= |year=2005 |archivedate= |accessdate=17 November 2009 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College, Oxford University]].  During his time at Oxford, he joined the [[Oxford University Air Squadron]] and learned to fly.

Upon graduating in 1934, he joined [[Unilever]] as a management trainee and in 1936 was appointed assistant commercial secretary in Unilever's home margarine executive. This proved to be useful in his wartime escape as the post required him to travel extensively in Germany and to learn to speak German.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War service==
[[File:Beaufort b.jpg|thumb|alt=A 42 Squadron Bristol Beaufort|A 42 Squadron Bristol Beaufort]]
Service in the University Air Squadron automatically made Philpot a member of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR)]] on its formation in 1936.  With the approach of the war, Philpot was recalled for service in August 1939 and posted as a [[pilot officer]] on probation to [[No. 42 Squadron RAF|42 Squadron]], an [[No. 18 Group RAF|18 Group]] [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] unit then operating [[Vickers Vildebeest]] torpedo bombers.  The squadron re-equipped with the [[Bristol Beaufort]] in 1940 and took part in the [[Norwegian Campaign]].

Philpot was confirmed in his rank on 15 January 1941&lt;ref name=30Sep41&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35292 |page=5664|date=30 September 1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the same year was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35206 |page=3770|date=1 July 1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Promotion to [[Flying Officer]] soon followed&lt;ref name=30Sep41/&gt; and it was Flying Officer Philpot who took off in Beaufort ''O - Orange''&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; for an attack on a German convoy off Norway on 11 December 1941.  During the mission, the aircraft was shot down by German [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] and ditched in the [[North Sea]].  Philpot and the other three crew evacuated the plane and took to the dinghy.  After two days in the dinghy, they were picked up by a [[Kriegsmarine|German naval]] vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner of war==
Philpot was suffering from the effects of the two days in the dinghy and was at first sent to a German military hospital in [[Oslo]].  After several weeks, he was moved to [[Dulag luft#Oberursel Camp|Dulag Luft I]] near [[Frankfurt]] arriving in January 1942. Only a month later he was transferred to [[Oflag IX-A/H]] at [[Spangenberg]].  This was a brief stay and in April 1942 the RAF prisoners at Spangenberg were all sent to [[Stalag Luft III]] at Sagan.  Escape was always a thought, having first been considered while in the hospital immediately after capture,&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Sagan Philpot was involved in more than one escape attempt. In August, Philpot was promoted to flight lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35819 |supp=y |page=5394 |date=11 December 1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1942, Philpot was among a number of prisoners transferred to [[Oflag XXI-B]] at [[Szubin]] (In his book Philpot uses the German spelling: Schubin) in Poland, the winter of 1942–43 being spent here before the camp closed and all prisoners returned to Stalag Luft III.

On his return to Sagan, Philpot was returned to the east compound, where he had previously been held; in the interim period, most of his friends had been moved to the north compound.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  Escape schemes were not as common as they had been in 1942, but Philpot hit upon the idea of inventing an escape character and papers etc. before involvement with any escape, rather than the opposite way round.  After some thought, he decided that his character would be a Norwegian margarine salesman called Jon Jörgensen.  The profession was based on Philpot's own civilian career and the nationality was common enough to be encountered in Germany, but with a reduced likelihood of meeting someone who spoke Norwegian, as Philpot did not speak any Norwegian.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the assistance of a Norwegian POW the character was fleshed out even to the extent of making him a [[Quisling]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wooden Horse===
''The Wooden Horse'' was the idea of [[First Lieutenant#United Kingdom|Lieutenant]] [[Michael Codner]] [[Royal Artillery|RA]]&lt;ref&gt;Codner's presence in Stalag Luft III was unusual, as he was an army officer in a camp for air force prisoners.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Eric Williams (writer)|Eric Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;In William's book ''The Wooden Horse'' Philpot is renamed as Philip Rowe&lt;/ref&gt;  They approached Philpot in June 1943 to 'register' their escape scheme with the escape committee, Philpot being the escape co-ordinator for the hut in which the three of them lived.

With the scheme approved, Codner and Williams set to work. A [[vaulting horse]] was constructed from stolen timber, plywood with cigarette package wrappings used for the top.  After a period of legitimate use, Codner and Williams started to dig a tunnel from inside the horse. One man was carried out in the horse and the tunnel started by digging a shaft, lined with plywood panels from Red Cross parcel boxes.  After each session, care was taken to secure the top of the shaft and to replace the surface sand on top.  The digger and the sand excavated were carried back into a hut and the sand disposed off. Initially Philpot assisted in disposing of the sand, but later on Codner and Williams asked him to join in the digging and become one of the escapers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Digging was a cramped job and sand was dragged back to the bottom of the shaft by the digger and then placed into bags for lifting and disposal.  Only 12 bags per session were lifted.  After a while, the team swapped to a four-cycle dig-and-lift scheme, where two men went out on the first trip and dug 36 bags of sand.  For the next three trips, one man went out and recovered 12 bags each time.  As the tunnel grew longer, a bowl and string were used for pulling the sand back.  Although this was slightly slower (36 bags per cycle as opposed to 48 under the old system), it meant three shorter sessions and one longer one for the volunteers using the horse for vaulting, an important change as the number of volunteers was small and they were becoming tired.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimentation with a poker showed that the tunnel was about {{convert|30|in|cm|0}} below ground but also running approximately 30° off the intended course.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel had several narrow escapes from detection or accidental destruction due to digging by either the guards or other POWs, but by the beginning of October it was past the wire and the three men started to make their final preparations.  They decided to make the break in the period of no moon at the end of the month and escape on Friday, 29 October 1943.  This was 114 days after the first digging commenced.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;[[#Obituary|Obituary - Daily Telegraph]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 29 October, Philpot and Codner were carried out to the tunnel as normal to collect some sandbags.  Philpot returned with the bags while Codner remained in the tunnel all day to continue the digging.  Codner's absence from the evening roll-call was covered and then the horse was used to carry three men to the tunnel: Philpot and Williams, together with a third man named McKay to seal the three escapers into the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three broke out just after 6&amp;nbsp;p.m.  It had previously been agreed that Philpot would travel alone as Jörgensen, while Codner and Williams would travel together posing as French workmen.  Philpot made his way to Sagan station, where he caught the train to Frankfurt (as did Williams and Codner).  Arriving at Frankfurt,  Philpot intended to catch the night train to [[Küstrin]], but it was cancelled and he had to wait until the next morning for the next train.  After spending the night in some woods, Philpot took the train to Küstrin and then onto [[Danzig]].  After almost giving himself away by falling off his case and swearing in English, his false papers were good enough to survive checking by a police officer.&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] pp. 337–339.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aralizz.jpg|thumb|The Swedish vessel ''Aralizz'' that Philpott smuggled himself onto in Danzig harbour]]
Arriving in Danzig less than 24 hours after escaping from Stalag Luft III, Philpot started to look for a neutral ship to carry him across the Baltic Sea to Sweden.  After an initial reconnaissance and looking for somewhere to sleep, he checked into a hotel even though this required him to share a room with another guest.  The next day (Sunday), Philpot spent the day around the Swedish dock and in the evening managed to smuggle himself onto a Swedish ship called the ''Aralizz''.  The crew of the ''Aralizz'' saw him and the captain asked him to leave as he was placing the crew at risk,&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; but Philpot refused.  Without the knowledge of the captain, the chief engineer and a seaman hid Philpot until Tuesday, when the ship sailed.  Once the ship was at sea, Philpot again made his presence known to the captain, who took a different attitude now the ship was no longer in port.

After the ship arrived in Sweden, Philpot was handed over to the Swedish police and taken to the British [[Legation]] in [[Stockholm]] on Thursday 4 November 1943—less than five days since the breakout.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;  A week later, he was reunited with Codner and Williams, who had used a similar route via Stettin to escape.  Williams, Codner and Philpot were the only three men to escape from the east compound at Stalag Luft III and regain their freedom (the so-called "home run").&lt;ref&gt;The later escape known as [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|The Great Escape]] was from the north compound at Stalag Luft III.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philpot returned to the United Kingdom on a [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] flight just before Christmas to be reunited with his family.  He did not return to operational flying and after debriefing by [[MI9]] he was posted to the [[Air Ministry]] as a senior scientific officer.&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt; He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] on 16 May 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36516|supp=y|page=2242|date=12 May 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar career==
After being [[Demobilization|demobbed]] in 1946, Philpot resumed his career in the food industry, eventually becoming [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] of [[Findus]], the frozen food company.  He later became managing director of [[Remploy]].  He also served as chairman of the [[Royal Air Forces Escaping Society|RAF Escaping Society]].&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;

In 1950 Philpot wrote an autobiography of his experience as a prisoner of war and escapee. He titled the book ''Stolen Journey'', and it was illustrated by [[Ronald Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#SJ|Stolen Journey]] ''Frontispiece''&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver Philpot was an active member of London Rowing Club, Putney, London. He rowed the Boat Race course from Putney to Mortlake until his 70s. His ashes were scattered on the Thames at Putney.

Commentators have discussed the likely effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] on a wide range of political issues.

==Political controversies and electoral consequences==
Political disputes have arisen over several issues:

===Issues relating to the cause of the damage to New Orleans===
{{Main article|Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans}}
*Whether the flood protection designed and built by the federal [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|US Army Corps of Engineers]], was mis-engineered or should have held back the storm surge.  This issue is complicated by a) the design goals given to the Corps of Engineers by state officials decades past did not request a 100-year flood level protection (which is nearly ten times as costly as a 50-year flood protection), and b) that over-topping of earthen levees will destroy them in a short time by their very design (this is not considered a "failure" by definition), but much more costly concrete levees should not fail in such situations without impact damage from debris which is possible, even under the water line.  "Holding back the storm surge" is only possible for well-maintained levees of appropriate height and strength... the taller the levee, the more it can hold back, and the more it costs to build and maintain.  The variation of weather and maintenance budgets makes finding the appropriate "threshold" difficult.  Due to this "cost efficiency / diminishing returns" factor, and the weather forecasting ability the primary protection for any flood situation is the proper evacuation of flood-prone areas in a timely manner.
*Whether loss of coastal wetlands resulted in increased flooding further inland.  This question was also brought up by the Mississippi Flood of 1996 which was blamed not only on excessive rainfall, but the extensive levee building along the river which attempted to reclaim flood plains for fertile farming area.  Channeling flood waters via levees will increase storm surge height, and previous levees built may not be tall enough after surrounding areas develop levees.  This debate plays directly into the fact that the lower 9th ward itself is a reclaimed wetland/swamp raising flood risk for others around Lake Pontchartrain, raising the ethical issue of rebuilding/pumping out the 9th ward after its flooding.
*Whether lax state environmental regulations for the storage of [[toxic]] [[chemical]]s has increased the contamination of flood waters.

===Issues relating to government response===
{{Main article|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}

===Long-term issues===
*Whether the US Army Corps of Engineers needs reform in their design and construction policies
*Whether Congress needs reform in the way flood protection projects are chosen and funded
*Whether policies that affect the poor, such as [[bankruptcy]] legislation, should be changed to make it easier for those in poverty to recover from such a disaster. 
*If [[electoral district]] changes will occur due to large migration of displaced people (e.g., reducing Louisiana's electoral college votes, and how many congressmen they may contribute to the House of Representatives).
*The question of exclusive government assistance / compensation funds should be available to Katrina/Rita survivors similar to the funds set up for 9-11 survivors or whether existing social nets are appropriate.

==Policies affecting hurricane defenses==
{{Main article|Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans}}

===Prevention and evacuation issues===
According to the [[National Response Plan]], the Department of Homeland Security "will assume responsibility on March 1 [2005] for ensuring that emergency response professionals are prepared for any situation. This will entail providing a coordinated, comprehensive federal response to any large-scale crisis and mounting a swift and effective recovery effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/theme_home2.jsp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216082935/https://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/theme_home2.jsp |archivedate=2003-02-16 |title=Emergencies &amp; Disasters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics have noted that while Mayor Nagin gave a mandatory evacuation order on August 28, before the storm hit, they did not make sufficient [[hazard prevention|prevention]] and provisions to evacuate the homeless, the poor, the elderly, the infirm, or the [[car]]-less households. Hospitals, nursing homes, group homes, were supposed to have pre-determined evacuation and/or refuge plans in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf |pages=II-3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905004342/http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf |archivedate=2005-09-05 |title=State of Louisiana Emergency Operations Plan Supplement 1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign nationals without transport claimed that the police refused to evacuate them, giving bus places only to American citizens.

Despite this, 90% of Greater New Orleans was evacuated—the most successful and complete evacuation of a US city since the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1562517,00.html|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Mark|last=Townsend|title=You're on your own, Britain's victims told|date=September 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, on August 27 the White House issued a statement,&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050827-1.html Statement on Federal Emergency Assistance for Louisiana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; effective August 26, authorizing federal emergency assistance for Louisiana. The statement authorized the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief and "... required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the parishes of Allen, Avoyelles, Beauregard, Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Caldwell, Claiborne, Catahoula, Concordia, De Soto, East Baton Rouge, East Carroll, East Feliciana, Evangeline, Franklin, Grant, Jackson, LaSalle, Lincoln, Livingston, Madison, Morehouse, Natchitoches, Pointe Coupee, Ouachita, Rapides, Red River, Richland, Sabine, St. Helena, St. Landry, Tensas, Union, Vernon, Webster, West Carroll, West Feliciana, and Winn." This includes all the parishes in the state of Louisiana except the coastal parishes which are inherently exposed to the most destructive forces of a hurricane. The President had not yet authorized FEMA to enter the coastal areas despite the governor's request including those parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.state.la.us/Press_Release_detail.asp?id=973 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903220735/http://www.gov.state.la.us/Press_Release_detail.asp?id=973 |archivedate=2005-09-03 |title=GOVERNOR BLANCO DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor activated the National Guard with her August 26, State of Emergency Declaration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf, page II-4]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Cross relief in New Orleans remains forbidden by the governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/08/katrina.redcross/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Red Cross: State rebuffed relief efforts|date=September 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Louisiana Evacuation plan, evacuation was mainly left up to individual citizens to find their own way out of the city. It was known that many residents of New Orleans lacked cars. It is also believed that many citizens, having survived previous hurricanes, did not anticipate the impending catastrophe and chose to ride out the storm. Even so, a 2000 census revealed that 27% of New Orleans households, amounting to approximately 120,000&amp;nbsp;people, were without privately owned transportation. Additionally, at 38%, New Orleans has one of the highest [[poverty]] rates in the United States. These factors may have prevented many people from being able to evacuate on their own. Consequently, most of those stranded in the city are the poor, the elderly, and the sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/index.pl?issue=20050902 |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=September 2, 2005 |title=Headlines for September 2, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301112316/http://www.democracynow.org/index.pl?issue=20050902 |archivedate=March 1, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0902-02.htm Amid Stench of Death, Poor Bear the Brunt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222114109/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0902-02.htm |date=2006-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bus yard-rotate.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of flooded New Orleans school buses.]]

State and city evacuation plans (&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905004342/http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf |archivedate=2005-09-05 |title=State of Louisiana Emergency Operations plan Supplement 1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part 1 Section C and part II-2) mention use of school buses for evacuation. With the following language: "The primary means of hurricane evacuation will be personal vehicles. ''School and municipal buses, government-owned vehicles and vehicles provided by volunteer agencies may be used to provide transportation for individuals who lack transportation and require assistance in evacuating."'' Several hundred school buses were left parked on low ground where they would be easily flooded with storm water and then later by the levee flooding making their use impossible in the emergency evacuation. It is not clear whether these buses were owned by the city or by a private contractor to which the city had outsourced school bus services. Mayor Nagin testified in his hearing in Washington that those buses were owned by the school board and that he had no control over them. The precise number of buses available has been cited anywhere from a few hundred&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Education: [http://www.doe.state.la.us/lde/uploads/2253.pdf Total number of buses]. 2003 upload, data for Orleans county shows 324 available buses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Times-Picayune'': [https://archive.is/20050919071715/http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-10/1120800316204660.xml RTA buses would be used for evacuation.] July 08, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; to a likely exaggerated 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Times'': [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/sep/6/20050906-122931-2126r/ Not much traction with the abuse.] September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

During non-emergency times, drivers of [[school bus]]es must own and maintain a class D commercial license or better depending on the exact size and weight of the bus. During an emergency any driver is suitable as long as approved by the governor. In spite of risks and his lack of formal training or license, 20-year-old [[Jabbar Gibson]] commandeered a New Orleans school bus and rescued 70&amp;nbsp;people from the rising floodwaters before making the 13-hour drive to Houston's [[Reliant Astrodome]], arriving on Wednesday evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.chron.com/content/news/photos/05/09/01/katrina_renegadebus.jpg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050904043643/http://images.chron.com/content/news/photos/05/09/01/katrina_renegadebus.jpg |archivedate=2005-09-04 |title=Photo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/news/casey/article/Casey-My-hero-is-a-bus-thief-1943162.php |title=Casey: My hero is a bus thief |author=Rick Casey |date=September 2, 2005 |website=[[Houston Chronicle]] |publisher= |access-date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later a commercially licensed driver's bus filled with evacuees flipped, resulting in one death and many injuries after a passenger fought with the driver.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070706223139/http://www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050903%2FNEWS05%2F509030307 ''The Daily Advertiser'' - www.theadvertiser.com - Lafayette, LA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

In a phone call to WWL radio made after the idle school and RTA buses were flooded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/02/nagin.transcript/|publisher=CNN|title=Mayor to feds: 'Get off your asses'|date=September 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Nagin called for 500 [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound buses]] to be sent from outside the city to help evacuate. Coordination of transportation from outside the Parish is the responsibility of the governor according to the State Evacuation Plan (Part 1 Section D).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Governor [[Kathleen Blanco|Blanco]] had yet to exercise this responsibility.

Some evacuees report that the drive from New Orleans to Baton Rouge took anywhere from five hours to nine hours; this drive usually takes up to an hour. Reports from the Associated Press state that 80% of the near 500,000 had evacuated safely from New Orleans prior to the hurricane's landfall. Even if licensed drivers had been available and the available buses had been used to evacuate the remaining approximately 150,000&amp;nbsp;people, they may not have made it to safety before landfall.

This massive migration is the largest since the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s sent about 300,000&amp;nbsp;people from the Great Plains States to other regions of the U.S., most notably California.

===New Orleans flood defenses===
Early questions arose on why the flood protection system designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers failed catastrophically in 53 different places in metro New Orleans.

In 1965, with passage of the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]], the United States Congress gave the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) the Federal responsibility for the design and construction of the flood protection in Greater New Orleans in the Pontchartrain Hurricane Protection Project, subject to appropriations and local participation, some of which was later waived.  Local municipalities were designated the responsibility for maintenance once the projects were complete (source: GAO testimony summary attached).

When authorized, this Congressional mandate was projected to take 13 years to complete.  When the flood protection system failed in 2005, the project was between 60-90% complete and the projected date of completion was estimated to be 2015, nearly 50 years after it first gained authorization from Congress.

The levees themselves were designed to protect New Orleans from a direct hit by a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane.  This decision was made by the Corps decades ago "based on a cost-benefit analysis", according to Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, USACE's [[Chief of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050901corps,1,7189346.story?coll=chi-news-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Corps officials: Funding levels not to blame for flooding |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910141345/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050901corps%2C1%2C7189346.story?coll=chi-news-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archivedate=2005-09-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Hurricane Katrina passed east of New Orleans, it was a weakening Category&amp;nbsp;4 storm.

Questions have been raised about proper funding for the Corps of Engineers, which is in charge of many hurricane-protection programs across the United States.  [[Sidney Blumenthal]], from the Clinton Administration, appeared as a guest on [[BBC]]'s ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'' on September 1, 2005 stating that the Bush Administration had specifically diverted tens of millions of US dollars in the Corps of Engineers from water and storm protection efforts to be used instead by the Corps in Iraq.  As a result, Blumenthal said, the Corps had performed only last-minute and substandard reinforcement of levees, some of which subsequently failed. 
In February 2005, following in the tradition of past presidents, President Bush proposed cutting the Corps' budget by 7%, and in 2004 proposed a 13% cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050901/ap_on_go_pr_wh/katrina_bush_budget |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910210445/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050901/ap_on_go_pr_wh/katrina_bush_budget |archivedate=2005-09-10 |title=White House Backpedals on Flood Control |first=Andrew |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other questions have been raised about the design of the flood protection system itself.  While the Corps has admitted fault for the failure of the 17th Street, London Avenue and Orleans Avenue outfall Canals, reports by the National Science Foundation/U.C. Berkeley and Team Louisiana cite inadequate design throughout the entire levee system.

New Orleans' emergency operations chief, Terry Ebbert, who worked with Mayor Ray Nagin before the hurricane and was part of the decision team which delayed the evacuation of the city standing thousands in New Orleans was later cited saying, "This is a national disgrace. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans," referring to the US [[Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake#Americas|humanitarian relief]] for the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/katrina/story/0,16441,1561561,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Bush under fire over hurricane aid | date=September 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal wetlands policy===
There has been criticism of the federal policy, since 2003, of again turning [[wetland]]s over to developers.

Louisiana has a long history, under both parties, of approving private developments in [[wetlands]] with consequent destruction of wetlands across coastal Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/special/NewHistoricalland.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; "Wetlands create friction and reduce high winds when hurricanes hit. They also absorb hurricane storm surges. Scientists estimate that every 2.7&amp;nbsp;miles [4.3 km] of wetlands absorbs one foot [30 cm] of storm surge."

The Bush Administration, contrary to campaign promises and a wetland protection policy maintained since 1990, ended federal wetlands protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/katrina/story/0,16441,1561356,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sidney | last=Blumenthal | title=Sidney Blumenthal: Katrina comes home to roost | date=September 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm surge that overcame New Orleans and the surrounding parishes would have been drastically reduced had wetlands been present to reduce said surge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050905/full/050905-11.html] {{Verify source|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political effects of population displacement==

In the days following the evacuation of New Orleans, [[Reuters]] reported that "[i]nterviews with refugees in Houston, which is expecting many thousands of evacuees to remain, suggest that thousands of blacks who lost everything and had no insurance will end up living in [[Texas]] or other U.S. states," and ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine notes that "those left homeless will take part in the biggest internal migration of people since the days of the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/home_asia/2005/09/01/hurricane-katrina-economic-impact-cx_0901katrinaland.html | work=Forbes | title=Storms In The Gulf | date=October 21, 2005 | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515135145/http://www.forbes.com/home_asia/2005/09/01/hurricane-katrina-economic-impact-cx_0901katrinaland.html |archivedate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This and other reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050901migration,1,12681.story?coll=chi-news-hed |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Topic Galleries }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/09/05/black_resettlement20050905.html | work=CBC News | title=Could Katrina damage prompt huge wave of black migration? | date=September 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the hurricane will have demographic consequences, particularly in and around Louisiana. Prior to the hurricane, Louisiana was one of a handful of states projected by the [[U.S. Census]] department to become a [[minority-majority state]] within the next two decades. Because a majority of displaced Louisiana residents are black, this occurrence will likely be delayed in Louisiana, but accelerated in nearby [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Texas]].

It has been noted that the displacement of a significant portion of African Americans from Louisiana is likely to shift the politics of that state in a more conservative direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/11/katrina.politics.ap/index.html | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929143421/http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/11/katrina.politics.ap/index.html |archivedate=2005-09-29 |title=Katrina might affect Louisiana politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Louisiana lost one vote in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] following the [[2010 U.S. Census]].

==Effects on the structure of government==

===FEMA funding and leadership===
Many local emergency managers defended FEMA, pointing out that the Bush Administration has since 9/11 reduced the agency's budget, mission, and status. FEMA, which was elevated to cabinet-level status under [[Bill Clinton]] and later incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security, which placed high priority on counter-terrorism and disaster preparation. Some members of the [[International Association of Emergency Managers]] had predicted that FEMA could not adequately respond to a catastrophe due to the integration and staffing overlaps. President Bush was criticized for appointing [[Michael D. Brown]] as FEMA head. Prior to joining FEMA, Brown had no experience in disaster relief and had even been fired from his previous job as a supervisor of judging at the [[International Arabian Horse Association]]. After closer scrutiny prompted by FEMA's coordination efforts with local officials before Hurricane Katrina, it was found that Brown had "mis-represented" several of his credentials which lower staffers had not discovered when vetting him for Presidential appointment to his position. FEMA funding was affected by Hurricane Katrina by the proposal and passage of the [[Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act]], which requires states seeking FEMA assistance to accommodate pets and service animals in their plans for evacuating residents facing disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/shays/news/2005/september/PETS.pdf |title=Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act |publisher=House of Representatives |date=September 2005 |accessdate=August 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051004175110/http://www.house.gov/shays/news/2005/september/PETS.pdf |archivedate=2005-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.03858: H.R.3858] Library of Congress. Accessed August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy matters arising during the recovery==

===Reports of contract awards===
[[Halliburton]] received reconstruction and damage assessment contracts for naval facilities in Mississippi and New Orleans affected by Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/3335685]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kellogg Brown &amp; Root]], a former subsidiary of [[Halliburton]], is doing major repairs at Navy facilities along the Gulf Coast that were damaged by the hurricane. That work is being done under a $500&amp;nbsp;million contract with the Defense Department.

Other [[no-bid contract]]s were awarded to the [[Fluor Corporation]], a disaster recovery specialist company based in southern California, and [[The Shaw Group]] of Baton Rouge, La.  Shaw is a client of [[Joe Allbaugh|Joe M. Allbaugh]], a consultant with extensive emergency disaster training and was a former FEMA director. Shaw's CEO was chairman of Louisiana's Democratic party at the time. On 2005-09-13, officials vowed investigation of possible fraud and waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/national/nationalspecial/14spend.html | work=The New York Times | first=Philip | last=Shenon | title=Official Vows Investigation of No-Bid Relief Contracts | date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shaw Group disclosed, in its annual report filed on July 5, that it is the subject of what the company describes as an "informal inquiry" by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], and as policy regarding any investigation, the SEC declined to comment. Federal securities class-action cases accused the Shaw Group and its executives of defrauding investors with misleading statements concerning the company's finances and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/2005-09-14-katrina-contracts_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Kevin | last1=McCoy | title=Contracts raise controversy | date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the ''Wall Street Journal'' (9/12/05), other companies that had received no-bid [[cost-plus contract]]s included Bechtel National, the government services arm of [[Bechtel Corporation]] which would provide temporary housing, Denver-based [[CH2M Hill]] Cos. which would provide housing, and Kenyon Worldwide Disaster Management which would collect human remains. FEMA has primary responsibility for spending more than $50&amp;nbsp;billion in aid, 60 times its budget in 2003 in a relatively short time-frame to facilitate quick response to the disaster.

The Shaw Group, Inc., which won two federal rebuilding contracts, each worth $100&amp;nbsp;million, has a history of obtaining no-bid contracts through contacts to Democratic politicians in Louisiana. "Shaw's chief executive officer, Jim Bernhard "is the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Shaw Group Inc., a Fortune 500 company," and chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party. The Shaw group and Jim Bernhard is/was also a major supporter and contributor to Gov. Blanco and other Major Louisiana Democrat politicians.

Bernhard has since resigned as his position as the Louisiana as chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lademo.org/index.php?display=ShowPage&amp;i=329508&amp;pid=329508] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206091557/http://www.lademo.org/index.php?display=ShowPage&amp;i=329508&amp;pid=329508 |date=February 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Shaw executive, Jeff Jenkins, was the governor's campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qI3OPaoR6OIJ:www.wbrz.com/stories/010705/new_blanco001.shtml+blanco+bernhard+shaw+group+helicopter&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a]{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculations for the cause of Hurricane Katrina==
Many commentators immediately began discussing [[global warming]] in the wake of the hurricane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html | work=Time | first=Jeffrey | last=Kluger | title=Is Global Warming Fueling Katrina? | date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increased debate that global warming significantly increases the number and intensity of extreme weather events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=5444&amp;method=full]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/09/01/katrina.warming.ap/ | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912212414/http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/09/01/katrina.warming.ap/ |archivedate=2005-09-12 |title=Katrina reignites debate over global warming}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have even been claims that the United Nations (UN) scientists responsible for the UN Global Warming report have categorically denied Global Warming had any impact on hurricane strength or frequency in the past fifty years, but these reports are usually based on opinion, with no peer-reviewed scientific evidence to back up the reports.

Even more fanciful speculations came from a few who held outspoken fundamentalist religious views, asserting the hurricane was [[Hurricane Katrina as divine retribution|divine retribution]] for any number of provocations, including politically-charged issues such as the [[War in Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/05/front2453615.183333333.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930223634/http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/05/front2453615.183333333.html |archivedate=2005-09-30 |title=Kuwaiti: 'The terrorist Katrina' is a 'soldier of Allah' |date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. pressure for the [[Israel]]i withdrawal from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], and domestic issues such as [[abortion]] and tolerance for [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godhatesfags.com/featured/20050831_thank-god-for-katrina.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001102402/http://www.godhatesfags.com/featured/20050831_thank-god-for-katrina.html |archivedate=2005-10-01 |title=Thank God for Katrina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3338642]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skanderbeg's rebellion''' was an almost 25-years long anti-Ottoman rebellion led by renegade Ottoman sanjakbey [[Skanderbeg]] on the territory which belonged to the Ottoman sanjaks of [[Sanjak of Albania|Albania]], [[Sanjak of Dibra|Dibra]] and [[Sanjak of Ohrid|Ohrid]] (modern-day [[Albania]] and [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]]). This rebellion was result of initial Christian victories in the [[Crusade of Varna]] in 1443. After Ottoman defeat in the [[Battle of Nish (1443)|Battle of Niš]] Skanderbeg, then [[sanjakbey]] of the [[Sanjak of Debar]], mistakenly believed that Christians would succeed in pushing the Ottomans out of Europe. Like many other regional Ottoman officials, he deserted the Ottoman army to raise rebellion in his sanjak of Dibra and the surrounding region. Initially, his plan was successful and soon large parts of the [[Sanjak of Dibra]] and north-east parts of the [[Sanjak of Albania]] were captured by the rebels who also fought against regular Ottoman forces in the [[Sanjak of Ohrid]].&lt;ref name="BalabanovBitoski1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kosta Balabanov|author2=Krste Bitoski|title=Ohrid i Ohridsko niz istorijata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tMwAQAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Opštinsko sobranie na grad Ohrid|page=62|quote=Скендербег ја исползувал настанатата ситуација, дезертирал од фронтот, решен да подигне општенародно востание во својата област.

The rebellion of Skanderbeg was a rare successful instance of resistance by Christians during the 15th century and through his leadership led Albanians in guerrilla warfare against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Sedlar1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean W Sedlar|title=East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3o5lrvuwOVwC&amp;pg=PA393|year=1994|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-97291-6|pages=393–|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=A rare example of successful Christian resistance to the Turks in the 15th century, although in a fairly remote part of Europe , was provided by Skanderbeg, the Albanian mountain chieftain who became the leader of a national revolt. For over a quarter-century until his death in 1468, he led the Albanians in surprisingly effective guerrilla warfare against the Turkish occupiers.|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skanderbeg's rebellion was not however a general Albanian uprising; many Albanians did not join it and some even fought against it for the Sultan, nor were his forces exclusively drawn from Albanians. Rather, his revolt represents a reaction by certain sections of local society and feudal lords against the loss of privilege and the exactions of the Ottoman government which they resented. In addition the rebels fought against members of their own ethnic groups because the Ottoman forces, both commanders and soldiers, were also composed of local people (Albanians, Slavs, Vlachs, Greeks and Turkish timar holders). 

Skanderbeg managed to capture [[Krujë]] using a forged letter of the sultan and, according to some sources, [[Impalement|impaled]] captured Ottoman officials who refused to be [[baptized]] into Christianity. On 2 March 1444 the regional Albanian and Serbian chieftains united against the Ottoman Empire and established an alliance ([[League of Lezhë]]) which was dissolved by 1450.

Because of the frequent conflicts between rival families in Albania during Skanderbeg's rebellion, particularly between Skanderbeg and [[Leke Dukagjini]], this period was more of an Albanian civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Elsie |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Elsie |title=Albanian literature: a short history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Memorandum+on+Albanian+Autonomy%22+%22Pashko+Vasa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0Pw1Tf6CGdGu8QOYwdC2BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Memorandum%20on%20Albanian%20Autonomy%22%20%22Pashko%20Vasa%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 18, 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

== Background ==
In Albania, the rebellion against the Ottomans had already been smouldering for years before Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army.&lt;ref name="BuryWhitney1966"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bury|first1=John Bagnell|authorlink1=John Bagnell Bury|last2=Whitney|first2=James Pounder|authorlink2=James Pounder Whitney|last3=Tanner|first3=Joseph Robson|authorlink3=Joseph Robson Tanner |author4=[[Charles William Previté-Orton]] |author5=[[Zachary Nugent Brooke]]|title=The Cambridge Medieval History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5btAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan|page=383|quote= In Albania, where rebellion had been smouldering for several years, the heroic Skanderbeg (George Castriota) revolted and under ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable earlier revolt was [[Albanian Revolt of 1432–36|revolt of 1432–36]] led principally by [[Gjergj Arianiti]]. Although Skanderbeg was summoned by his relatives during this rebellion, he remained loyal to the sultan and did not fight the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1994, p. 535 {{quote|In 1432 Andrew Thopia revolted against his Ottoman overlords&amp;nbsp;... inspired other Albanian chiefs, in particular George Arianite (Araniti)&amp;nbsp;...

Skanderbeg decided to leave his position of Ottoman sanjakbey and revolt against the Ottomans only after the victorious [[Crusade of Varna]] in 1443.&lt;ref name="SettonHazard1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth M.

Skanderbeg's rebellion was not a general [[uprising]] of Albanians. People from the big cities in Albania on the Ottoman-controlled south and [[Albania Veneta|Venetian]]-controlled north did not support him while his followers beside [[Albanians]] were also [[Slavs]], [[Vlachs]] and [[Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitt|2012|p=55}}{{quote|&lt;!-- Skanderbeg führte keinen allgemeinalbanischen Aufstand an, da der Süden Albaniens, dessen Erhebung die Osmanen 1436 unterdrückt hatten, weitgehend ruhig blieb. Ebenso wenig schlossen sich ihm die osmanischen Städte des Südens und die venezianischen Städte des Nordens an. Skanderbeg erhielt Unterstützung  von den Verlierern der osmanischen Eroberung, großen Familien, die ihr Land wiedergewinnen, Bergbewohnern, die dem Sultan keine Steuern zahlen und keine osmanischen Richter hin— nehmen wollten; --&gt; in seiner Gefolgschaft fanden sich neben Albanern auch Slawen, Griechen und Vlachen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels did not fight against "foreign" invaders but against members of their own ethnic groups because the Ottoman forces, both commanders and soldiers, were also composed of local people (Albanians, Slavs, Vlachs and Turkish [[timar]] holders).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skanderbeg.

== Early battles ==
[[Kenneth Meyer Setton]] claims that majority of accounts on Skanderbeg's activities in the period 1443–1444 "owe far more to fancy than to fact."&lt;ref name="Setton p. 73"&gt;Setton p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Skanderbeg captured [[Krujë]] using the forged letter to take control from Zabel Pasha, his rebels managed to capture many Ottoman fortresses including strategically very important Svetigrad ([[Kodžadžik]]) taken with support of [[Moisi Arianit Golemi]] and 3,000 rebels from [[Debar]].&lt;ref name="Stojanovski1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stojanovski|first=Aleksandar|title=Istorija na makedonskiot narod|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJ0MAAAAIAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Makedonska kniga|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, Skanderbeg impaled captured Ottoman officials who refused to be baptized into Christianity.&lt;ref name="II2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=II|first=Pope Pius|authorlink=Pope Pius II|title=Europe (c.1400-1458)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4lvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|date=1 November 2013|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-2182-3|page=114|quote=George Skanderbeg, a man of noble birth, received his inheritance. ... fortress of Krujë by stratagem and declared himselfa Christian, going so far as to impale the Ottoman officials who refused to accept baptism; see Fine, LMB, 521–22, 556.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(Firm)1872"&gt;{{cite book|last=(Firm)|first=John Murray|title=A Handbook for Travellers in Greece: Describing the Ionian Islands, Continental Greece, Athens, and the Peloponnesus, the Islands of the Ægean Sea, Albania, Thessaly, and Macedonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbkBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA478|year=1872|publisher=J.

The first battle of Skanderbeg's rebels against the Ottomans was fought on 10 October 1445, on mountain Mokra. According to Setton, after Skanderbeg was allegedly victorious in the [[Battle of Torvioll]], the [[Hungarians]] are said to have sung praises about him and urged Skanderbeg to join the alliance of [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungary]], the [[Papacy]] and [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Setton p. 73"/&gt; In the spring of 1446, using help of  [[Dubrovnik|Ragusan]] diplomats, Skanderbeg requested support from the Pope and [[Kingdom of Hungary]] for his struggle against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Radonić1905"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jovan Radonić|title=Zapadna Evropa i balkanski narodi prema Turcima u prvoj polovini XV veka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PD1pAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=1905|publisher=Izd.

=== War against Venice ===
{{Main|Albanian–Venetian War (1447–1448)}}
Marin Span was commander of Skanderbeg's forces which lost fortress [[Baleč]] to Venetian forces in 1448 during [[Albanian–Venetian War (1447–1448)|Skanderbeg's war against Venice]]. Marin and his soldiers retreated toward [[Dagnum]] after being informed by his relative Peter Span about the large Venetian forces heading toward Baleč.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Srpska Akademija Nauka i Umetnosti|1980|loc=p. 39: "...да поруше обновљени Балеч с таквим снагама као да је у питању највећа тврђава.

== Treaty of Gaeta ==
{{Main|Treaty of Gaeta}}
On 26 March 1450 a political treaty was stipulated in [[Gaeta]] between [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V]] for the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Stefan, Bishop of Krujë]], and [[Nikollë de Berguçi]], ambassadors of [[Skanderbeg]]. In the treaty Skanderbeg would recognize himself a vassal of the Kingdom of Naples, and in return he would have the Kingdom's protection from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After Alfonso signed this treaty with Skanderbeg, he signed similar treaties with other chieftains from Albania: [[Gjergj Arianiti]], Gjin Muzaka, George Stresi Balsha, [[Peter Spani (League of Lezhë)|Peter Spani]], [[Dukagjini family|Paul Dukagjini]], Thopia Muzaka, Peter of Himara, Simon Zanebisha and Karlo Toco. By the end of 1450 Skanderbeg also agreed peace Ottomans and obliged himself to pay tribute to the sultan.&lt;ref name="Spremić1968 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spremić|first=Momčilo|authorlink=Momčilo Spremić|title=Zbornik Filozofskog fakulteta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CQkAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 June 2013|year=1968|publisher=Naučno delo|pages=253, 254|quote= Тај мир је склопљен до краја 1450 јер је Скендербег почетком 1451, када је ступао у вазални однос с напуљским краљем Алфонском Арагонским, већ имао уговор са султаном и плаћао му харач.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show'''" is the eighteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on [[April Fools' Day]], 1993. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] plays a series of [[practical joke]]s on [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and to get even, Bart shakes up a can of Homer's beer with a paint shaker. Homer opens the can, resulting in a huge explosion that lands him in the hospital, where he goes into a [[coma]]. At Homer's bedside, the [[Simpson family]] reminisce, mainly about moments relevant to Homer's life.

[[Jon Vitti]] wrote the episode, and [[Carlos Baeza]] directed it. This is ''The Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; first [[clip show]], and it features clips from the [[List of The Simpsons episodes|first three seasons]] of the series. It was created to relieve the long hours put in by all of the show's overworked staff. The episode features cultural references to films such as ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''. The episode received positive reviews from critics. It was called "as good as a clip show ever gets"&lt;ref name="Martyn"/&gt; and acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 14.9.

==Plot==
The story begins on April Fools' Day as [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is playing pranks on [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] throughout the day. Bart, angered by the numerous tricks he has fallen for, attempts to get revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital, paralyzed and placed in a wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown in the form of clips from past episodes.

At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, while trying to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, [[Mr. Burns]] then tries to pull the plug on Homer's [[life support system]] to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies unconscious in the hospital bed, Bart [[cry|tearfully]] confesses that he was the one who put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to [[Hawaii]]. However, Bart, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing.&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-4_episode-18 |title=So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show |accessdate=2011-09-17 |publisher=The Simpsons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, writers and producers felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series.&lt;ref name="Groening"/&gt; The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]'s reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode cost to produce, but they could sell [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] rights at full price.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the nature of the clip show, the episode still contained an act and a half of new animation, including the extra scene from "[[Bart the Daredevil]]" in which Homer falls down Springfield Gorge a second time after the ambulance crashes into a tree.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

The network censors initially refused to let the phrase "beer causes rectal cancer" into the show. The censors eventually relented when they found a medical textbook which stated the link between beer and cancer, but still asked them to "go easy" on beer in the future.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite video |people=Lynch, Jeffrey |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show" finished fourteenth in the ratings for the week of March 28 to April 4, 1993, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 14.9.&lt;ref name=ratings&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen ratings March 28 - April 4 |date=April 7, 1993 |page=C7 |work=[[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.&lt;ref name=ratings/&gt; The episode has received positive reviews, being labeled "as good as a clip show ever gets",&lt;ref name=Martyn/&gt; and containing some memorable gags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24460557-5003422,00.html |title=Spicks and Specks goes behind the scenes for laughs &amp;#124; The Courier-Mail |publisher=News.com.au |author=Dianne Butler |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as one "of the most consistently funny episodes of the series", which "strikes that perfect balance between perfectly selected classic moments and all new story segments..."&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=12852 |title=DVD Times&amp;nbsp;— The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season |publisher=Dvdtimes.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode's reference to ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was named the 43rd greatest film reference in the history of the show by ''[[Total Film]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Nathan Ditum.&lt;ref name="totalfilm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-50-greatest-simpsons-movie-references/page:18 |title=The 50 Greatest Simpsons Movie References |last=Ditum |first=Nathan |date=June 6, 2009 |work=[[Total Film]] |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, executive producer [[Al Jean]] reacted to a hypothesis that Homer is still in a coma and all episodes since this one have been imaginary, hence a perceived surrealism and frequent guest appearances. He said that the hypothesis belongs in the "intriguing but false file".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Bill|title=Major 'Simpsons' Theory Gets Debunked By Executive Producer|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/13/simpsons-theory-shot-down_n_6681278.html|accessdate=2015-02-15|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">'''Special measures''' is a status applied by regulators of public services in Britain to providers who fall short of acceptable standards.

==In education (England and Wales)==
[[Ofsted]], the schools inspection agency for [[England]] and some [[British Overseas Territories]], and [[Estyn]], the schools inspection agency for [[Wales]], apply the term special measures to schools under their jurisdictions when they consider the school has failed to provide an acceptable standard of teaching, has poor facilities, or otherwise fails to meet the minimum standards for education set by the government and other agencies, when they judge the school lacks the leadership capacity amongst its management to ensure improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/sie/glossary/#S DfES glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2005 guidelines" /&gt; A school subject to special measures will have regular short-notice Ofsted or Estyn inspections to monitor its improvement. The senior managers and teaching staff can be dismissed and the school governors replaced by an appointed executive committee. If poor performance continues the school may be closed as in the case of the [[Frank Montgomery School]] in Kent.

===Notice to improve===
The current circumstances under which a school may be placed in special measures, and the procedures to follow, are stipulated by the [[Education Act 2005]]. Prior to 2005 special measures were applied to any school which was failing to supply an acceptable level of education; potential for improvement under current leadership was not taken into account. Under the new rules, schools demonstrating such potential are instead given a '''notice to improve''' and reinspected after a year.&lt;ref name ="2005 guidelines"&gt;[http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/sie/documents/amend2005guide.pdf Schools Causing Concern] (amended guidelines), Department for Education and Skills, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions===
Once an institution has been placed in special measures, they are presented with an action plan by the Local Authority detailing the key areas they need to develop in order to leave the category. Monitoring of this action plan then passes to [[Office_for_Standards_in_Education|HMI]] (Her Majesty’s Inspectors) who visit the school typically once a term for 1-2 days to evaluate progress. Once HMI are satisfied that the action plan has been completed and all points satisfactorily addressed, then they will refer the school back to [[Ofsted]] and ask them to schedule a second Section 5 Inspection. If Ofsted agree with HMI’s judgement, the school is then removed from the special measures category. It is worth noting that during an Inspection an HMI can change the nature of the Inspection to a Section 5, and remove the school from Special Measures upon completion. 

Support for schools that enter special measures comes in a variety of forms, and varies from local authority to local authority. Typically though schools will benefit from significant extra resources – both in terms of extra funds and consultancy from the local authority and external providers.

==In health and social care (England and Wales)==
[[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] is responsible for putting [[NHS foundation trusts]] into special measures, while the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]] is responsible for other NHS trusts. This action is normally triggered by a [[Care Quality Commission]] inspection.  An improvement director will be externally appointed and the failing Trust partnered with another high-performing Trust. An action plan is produced  which is published on the [[NHS Choices]] website.  Monitor may suspend some or all of the freedoms a [[Foundation trust]] has to operate as an autonomous body. Changes of the leadership of the organisation may be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Special measures|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/specialmeasures/pages/about-special-measures.aspx|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=NHS Choices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived effectiveness===
According to [[Dr Foster]] the decision to put 11 trusts into special measures in July 2013 is likely to have saved hundreds of lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS 'special measures' have saved hundreds of lives, say experts|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-special-measures-have-saved-hundreds-of-lives-say-experts-10031482.html|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Independent|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the legal system (Scotland)==
In Scotland the term 'special measures' is defined by the [[Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014]] to describe systems put in place by the judicial system to protect vulnerable witnesses in courts of law. This can include measures taken to protect the identity of witnesses perceived as under threat of intimidation, or witnesses in cases involving alleged sex crimes or crimes against children where the experience of the legal system itself could prove intimidating.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Government Website: http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/New-measures-to-support-victims-and-witnesses-1ca2.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8957">The '''Swaledale Festival''' takes place over two weeks in May and June each year, in churches, chapels, castles, ‘Literary Institutes’, pubs, fields and village halls scattered around [[Swaledale]], [[Arkengarthdale]] and [[Wensleydale]]. The largest venues seat about 400 people; the smallest venues as few as 40. The main focus of the Festival is on small-scale classical chamber music. Choral music, folk music, brass bands and jazz also feature, as do talks, films, exhibitions, poetry readings, workshops and guided walks. The 2014 Festival featured Royal Northern Sinfonia, Natalie Clein, Nicholas Daniel, Don Paterson, Emma Johnson, Martin Taylor, Martin Simpson and the Navarra Quartet, among others.

In 2011, the Festival was described by ''The Guardian'' as one of the 10 best classical music festivals,&lt;ref&gt;The best classical festivals 2011, ''The Guardian'', 21 May 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/21/classical-festival-listings?INTCMP=SRCH], accessed 21 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and by the ''Daily Telegraph'' as one of the 25 opera and classical festivals of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Shirley, Opera and classical festivals of the season, ''Daily Telegraph'', 13 May 2011, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/glyndebourne/8509770/Opera-and-classical-festivals-of-the-season.html], accessed 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' again featured the Festival in its 2012 and 2013 Festival Guides, in a short list which included Aldeburgh, the BBC Proms, Bath, Cheltenham and Glyndebourne. The Festival attracts around 7,000 visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/DocumentList.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1025480&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0&amp;DocType=AccountList 2009-10 Accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key feature of the Swaledale Festival is the commitment to new commissions and recently composed works; commissioned pieces by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, Michael Brough and Heather Fenoughty received their premières in 2012, and the 2013 Festival included premières of works by Sally Beamish, David Blake, Stephen Goss, Tim Garland, Roland Dyens and Graham Coatman.

==Early history==

The early history of the Swaledale Festival is in several strands, which merged in the 1980s.

===The Richmondshire Festival===

The biennial Richmondshire Festival was founded in 1965 by Dr A J Bull, the retired music organiser for the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]. A week of music and drama in and around Richmond, it was initially scheduled for September in order to attract motorists on their way south from the Edinburgh Festival. Musical highlights of the first Richmondshire Festival&lt;ref&gt;Unlisted programme 4–11 September 1965, in North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton, [http://archives.northyorks.gov.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='Swaledale%20Festival')], accessed 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; included a recital at [[Aske Hall]] by the [[Melos Ensemble]], with [[Gervase de Peyer]], [[Cecil Aronowitz]] and [[Emanuel Hurwitz]], and a concert at the County Modern School by the Northern Sinfonia Orchestra, as it was then known. There were also performances by local school, amateur and scratch groups, tea-dances, talent contests, and military bands beating the retreat.

The 1967 Richmondshire Festival programme&lt;ref&gt;Unlisted programme 10–16 September 1967, in North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton, [http://archives.northyorks.gov.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='Swaledale%20Festival')], accessed 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; lists Arthur Bull as the "Hon. Organiser", and the Marquess of Zetland as Patron. There are no known records for the next decade. In 1969 the Richmondshire Festival moved to a May date, and by 1978 Dr Bull had started to look for a successor.

===Two festivals in partnership===

Early records of the Swaledale Festival are patchy, and as recently as 2012 it was still believed that the Festival had been established in 1980. It now appears that the Festival was started by members of the [[Delmé Quartet]] who were then resident in the Upper Swaledale village of [[Muker]], in September 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Photo and caption from [[Darlington and Stockton Times]], 2 September 1972 (personal communication)&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1973 the Festival was essentially a chamber-music event with a summer-school component.&lt;ref&gt;[[Darlington and Stockton Times]], 23 July 1973 1972 (personal communication)&lt;/ref&gt; A surviving Swaledale Festival concert programme from June 1978&lt;ref&gt;Unlisted programme 24 June 1978, in North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton, [http://archives.northyorks.gov.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='Swaledale%20Festival')], accessed 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; makes no mention of the Delmé Quartet, though Delmé cellist Joy Hall was among the performers.

In 1979, the violinist Trevor Woolston moved to Swaledale. In 1980 he ran a fundraiser concert for the Sunday School in Fremington. In 1981 Woolston ran an expanded series (ten events, most in St Andrew's Church, [[Grinton]]) “as part of the Richmondshire Festival”.&lt;ref name="northyorks1980"&gt;Trevor Woolston, from unlisted exhibition notes covering the period 1980 to 1989 in North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton, [http://archives.northyorks.gov.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='Swaledale%20Festival')], accessed 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This included concerts by the [[Lindsay String Quartet]] and the Yorkshire Baroque Soloists, who would become regular visitors.

There is no primary evidence that the concerts of 1980 and 81 took place under the Swaledale banner. However, there being no Richmondshire Festival in 1982, as Trevor Woolston wrote, "a Swaledale Festival was arranged".&lt;ref name="northyorks1980"/&gt;  It now seems clear that over the span of three years Woolston translated his programming across to an already established venture.

In 1983, the Richmondshire and Swaledale Festivals ran in partnership over three full weeks. As far as can be inferred from the available programmes, there was strict demarcation between the two: Richmondshire limited itself to odd years and to the immediate area of Richmond; Swaledale was annual, and went no further down-dale than Marrick.

In 1984 drama and crafts were added to the Swaledale Festival. In 1985 the two Festivals again ran in parallel. In 1986 the Swaledale Festival Friends were formed.

===Swaledale goes it alone===

The Richmondshire Festival folded in 1987, and the Swaledale Festival "took over"&lt;ref name="northyorks1980"/&gt; several Richmondshire Festival artists, including [[Northern Sinfonia]], and expanded down-dale into Richmond. Also in 1987, an international element was added, with performers from Bolivia and Finland.

In 1988 the Swaledale Festival expanded its geographical coverage again, with concerts in Wensleydale. By 1989 the Festival was active from Keld in Upper Swaledale to Bedale in Lower Wensleydale, and Trevor Woolston joked about changing the Festival's name to "The Festival of the Upper Dales, Richmondshire and the Teesside Hinterland".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 2 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1989 the Festival gained an 'Autumn Encore', half a dozen events in October and November. Performers that year included the [[Fitzwilliam Quartet]], which would become a Festival regular. By 1991, part-time staff and volunteers had been recruited to look after administration and publicity, and the Woolstons were preparing to retire. The last Autumn Encore took place in 1992.

In 1993 Elizabeth Carter was appointed Artistic Director, a post she would hold until 2002; Trevor Woolston stepped down, though he would continue to appear at the Festival as a performer. Also in 1993, the Festival became a registered charity with a formalised constitution and a Board. The first recorded Chairman was the composer [[David Blake (composer)|David Blake]], a professor at York University, and resident in Askrigg; and the first Board members included Katherine Carr, the daughter of the late Dr Bull - a nice piece of continuity. The current Artistic Director is Malcolm Creese, and the Chairman is Peter Denison-Edson.

'''TRT International April 23 Children's Festival''' is celebrated on April 23 each year in Turkey. This festival is gathering the children from all over the world under the motto of "Love, Friendship and Peace". The festival is organized by [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]].

==History==
[[File:Children'sDay07.JPG|thumb|275px|[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]n [[folk dance]] on Children's Day 2014 in [[Beykoz]], [[Istanbul]]]]

The 23rd April Children's Festival was dedicated to Turkish children by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Turkey, to mark the opening of the Assembly. 

The festival has been celebrated internationally since 1979. The Children's Festival was first celebrated in Turkey on 23 April 1920, when the Turkish Grand National Assembly was opened. The Festival intends to contribute creation of a world where children can live peacefully by developing sentiments of fraternity, love and friendship.

The greatest aspiration of Atatürk, who saved his country from occupations and introduced reforms in all fields hence changing the viewpoint of the nation it was modernization, in other words, an industrialized country that the industry of the Republic which it was founded on was out of date and poorly equipped, Atatürk endeavored to achieve modernization through educational reform, and thus entrusted Turkey to the children and the youth.  Atatürk knew that modernization could not be achieved in a rapid way; therefore, he presumed that the Turkish children educated at schools resting upon positive sciences could attain his goals. He believed his nation and lived for what he believed. This is the main philosophy of the 23rd April.  As can be seen, the educated children and youth have made great contributions to the creation of modern Turkey.  Present-day Turkey has evolved over the years and has attained a level of a modern state. 

As UNESCO proclaimed 1979 as the International Year of the Child, director of children's programmes of TRT Ankara Television Tekin Özertem and his assistant Canan Arısoy developed a project aimed at embracing all the children in the world. Upon approval of the project by top executives of the TRT Corporation, preparations for the organization commenced. Thus, the first celebration of TRT International 23 April Children's festival took place on 23 April 1979 in Turkey, with participation of five countries, namely the USSR, Iraq, Italy, Romania and Bulgaria. Today, TRT International 23 April Children's festival is celebrated every year with participation of approximately 50 countries. From 1979 to 2000, celebrations were performed in the capital city Ankara. In the following years, celebrations took place in Turkey's various major cities such as İzmir, İstanbul and Antalya. Nane Annan, spouse of the former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, became the honorary guest of the celebrations on 23 April 2000. In her speech at the gala, Mrs Annan expressed her pleasure at participating in the celebrations and passed greetings from her spouse Kofi Annan. Mrs. Annan also called on the entire world to say “Yes” to the aspiration of children. After her speech, “the common declaration of the  children from 40 countries”, which was approved by the children at the International Children's Congress  on 18 April, was read in English and Turkish. The declaration was presented to Mrs. Annan to hand it over to Kofi Annan.

Children aged between 8 and 14 attend the international 23 April children's festival. The program approximately covers a period from 16 to 26 April. The invited groups are made up of nearly 20 children and 6 executive leaders. By 15 April, guests arrive in the city where the celebrations will take place. TRT appoints a guide for each group and the guides enable coordination with group leaders. Through primary schools in the festival city, each group is entertained by families of their Turkish peers in a warm and affectionate environment. In this way, children of the world recount positive traits of the Turkish nation to their own families and friends when they return to home countries. Doubtlessly, this makes Turkish people gratified. Festival Week begins with a Festival Parade. During the parade, guests wear their traditional outfits, perform their traditional music and dance on the largest street of the city. In the following days, guest countries perform outdoor shows in large parks and embrace with Turkish people. Festival week continues with the children's visit to the mausoleum of Atatürk, the great leader who dedicated this festival to Turkish children. Then, the children are welcomed by The President of the Turkish Republic, President of the Turkish National Grand Assembly, and Director General of TRT.

On 22 April, the children gather to rehearse the gala. When the big day comes, the gala of the TRT 23 April Children's Festival takes place.  In the gala, which lasts nearly four hours and is broadcast live, all the groups wear their national costumes and present three-minute performances accompanied with their traditional music.

The gala continues with the children conveying the greetings they have brought from their home countries, and ends with a hand-in-hand dance of all the flowers of the world embraced in sentiments of peace and friendship. Through picnics and excursions on 24 and 25 April, the unison and fraternity of the world and Turkish children reach their peak. These activities contribute to the promotion of Turkey and the hospitable Turkish people. When the last day arrives, 26 April, sad hours for children have come. Bursting into tears, they begin to return to their home countries; they are leaving behind their Turkish brothers and sisters, but taking along peace and friendship with them. In a flood of emotions, the festival week comes to an end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8293">The '''Telecoms crash''' was a stock market crash which occurred in 2001. It is sometimes confused with the [[Dot com crash|Dot Com crash]] which happened at around the same time. Unlike the dot com crash however, the telecoms sector relied on long engineering research and development cycles, and the development companies on the telecom operators buying software maintenance contracts and upgrade paths. The dot com boom was caused by people investing money in ideas that were unrealistic.

== Limited license auctions ==

At the beginning of 2000, [[mobile network operator]]s in [[Europe]] were offered auction of the [[3G phone|3G]] [[radio spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfglobalnet.com/doc.mvc/US-Findings-on-3G-Spectrum-Reallocation-and-I-0001|title=US Findings on 3G Spectrum Reallocation and Industry Comments|website=www.rfglobalnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar auction had been applied in the United States the year before and had to be re-run when the winners defaulted on their bids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/apr/13/mobilephones.victorkeegan|title=Dial-a-fortune|first=Victor|last=Keegan|date=13 April 2000|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown/11249213/Gordon-Brown-failed-us-all.-Will-anyone-miss-him.html|title=Gordon Brown failed us all. Will anyone miss him?|first=Dan|last=Hodges|date=1 December 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the minister responsible
for the auctions (the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), used the same New York based firm that set up the failed/re-run auctions to host the auctions in the UK and paid £750,000 from the public purse for them to do so.

The nature of the [[Spectrum auction|auctions]] was designed to increase competitive pressure on bidders by offering fewer licenses than the number of operators likely to bid and in some cases using [[sealed bid auction]]s. This put the telephone operators in a difficult position, because if they lost the auction they were out of the next technological phase of the business. They therefore took risks and made high bids, incurring large debt. In the UK auctions raised £22.5 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/727831.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - UK mobile phone auction nets billions|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[GBP]]) and around £30 billion ([[GBP]]) in Germany. Some estimate the damage caused by the auctions of telecom spectrum (previously administration fees were charged for spectrum usage --- with public service conditions such as emergency cover bundled with the usage certificates --- with the raison d'être being   public service provision and that profits from the companies providing the service would be taxable) to be as high as 3 trillion dollars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1539298/1633-trillion-cost-of-telecoms-crash.html|title=£3 trillion cost of telecoms crash|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debt and subsequent loss of stockmarket confidence ==

The stock market lost confidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2837764/Telecoms-crash-like-the-South-Sea-Bubble.html|title=Telecoms crash 'like the South Sea Bubble'|first=Dominic|last=White|date=30 December 2002|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly due to the concept that telecoms were similar to dot com (both were categorised as 'high technology' in the listings) and share prices tumbled. As they did so the [[Debt ratio|ratio of debt to assets]] based on share price changed making the telephone operators effective [[credit rating]] look insecure.

The telecom developers were now in a quandary. They had invested heavily over the years in research and development to keep pace with changing technology, and the telecom operators were no longer in a position to pay the maintenance and upgrades on the ordinary landline equipment, let alone buy the new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history|title=Ericsson History|date=18 August 2016|website=Ericsson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year 100,000 jobs were lost in telecoms support and development across Europe with 30,000 coming from the UK.&lt;ref&gt;David Rudd PhD F.I.E.E C.eng, Spectrum Pricing's uncertain future Electronics World, Vol. 108, September pp. 24 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Klemperer]], [[Oxford University]] economics professor and adviser to the UK government in its 3G auction,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} has disputed whether the crash should be blamed on the auction rather than broader economic problems. While agreeing that the licence bidders may have been mistaken in bidding as high as they did, and that the money was a transfer from shareholders to the governments, he argued that the one off and up front [[sunk costs]] of the auction should have had no effect when considering the profitability of future investment and should not have significantly affected the future behaviour of the telecoms companies. He also notes that in the UK it was NTL (which failed in its bid) which ended up in the most trouble financially, and questions whether the $100 billion cost of the auctions could explain the $700 billion drop in two years which was seen in the market capitalisation of the telecoms companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulklemperer.org/PressArticles/FT26Nov2002PDKAuctionsLb.pdf |title=The wrong culprit for the telecom trouble |last=Klemperer |first=Paul |date=26 November 2002 |website= paulklemperer.org|publisher=The Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uncertain future of spectrum pricing ==

Subsequent government auctions of the [[3G]] [[radio spectrum|spectrum]], in Australia and New Zealand, and then further afield, were met with low bids, and strong suspicion of collaboration between operators of bidding low and secretly defining network sharing agreements.
[[Hong Kong]]'s recent approach was to share in the profit from a spectrum allocation rather than issue a potentially damaging upfront payment for licences. Britain's 2013 UK spectrum auction fell £1bn short of the stated target of £3.5bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/25/mwc_keynote_one/|title=Telecom bigwigs: 'We're all friends – really'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reluctance of Telecom companies to over commit; can be argued to still be a factor due to the failed auctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/02/disappointing-4g-auction-sale-is-bad-news-for-osbornes-deficit-plans/|title=Disappointing 4G auction income is bad news for Osborne’s deficit plans - Coffee House|date=20 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent disaster

Developers such as [[Ericsson]], continue to withdraw employment and financial commitments from the UK (which was the second largest development body outside of their native Sweden before the 
2000 spectrum auctions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-39879/UK-job-fears-telecoms-giant-axes-staff.html|title=UK job fears after telecoms giant axes staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mouse That Jack Built''''' is a 1959 [[Warner Bros.]] "[[Merrie Melodie]]" [[cartoon]] short starring [[Jack Benny]] and the regular cast of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' as mice. It was written by [[Tedd Pierce]] and directed by [[Robert McKimson]], with music by [[Milt Franklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animated Short Films: a critical index to theatrical cartoons |last=Borowiec |first=Piotr |year=1998 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-3503-7 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFs5evuicXwC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=The%20Mouse%20that%20Jack%20Built&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Mouse%20that%20Jack%20Built&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-12-24 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Somewhere in [[Beverly Hills]], in the house of [[Jack Benny]] (a sign out front proclaims, "Star of Stage * Screen * Radio * Television...also cartoons"), a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin—off-key—and saying to himself, "Who is this guy [[Isaac Stern]]?" (In real life Benny and Stern were good friends.) Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin.

Jack calls his servant, Rochester (portrayed as a dark brown mouse) to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up (a week for $5.00, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1959|r=2}}}} today) and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good ''cheap'' restaurant.

While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault.  Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet.  As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming "[[We're in the Money]]".  When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a [[razor blade]] hanging above the passageway like a [[guillotine]].  He then comes up to a [[derringer]] and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer.  Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap.  He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a [[foghorn]] and machine gun noises are heard.  Ed, the vault guard, asks "Halt! Who goes there?", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks "We win the war yet?"  When Benny assures Ed that the war has been won, thinking that Benny was referring to [[World War I]], Ed says: "Good. What do you think they'll do with [[Kaiser Wilhelm II|the Kaiser]]?"

Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his best [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program, Don storming off in a huff when Jack refuses to let him do a scene. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old [[cash register]] with a dollar sign ($) and "no sale", they discuss other options (she sarcastically suggests the Monkey House at the [[Griffith Park Zoo]]).  As they discuss their options, the cat writes a message extolling the "Kit Kat Club" ("entertainers admitted ''free''") and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane.  Jack and Mary putter off in his [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell]] with [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Rochester]] behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While en route, Mary asks for [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], while Jack says that he prefers a good "[[muscatel|mousecatel]]".  Unbeknownst to them, the "club" is actually the maw of the cat, and as Jack and Mary enter, the cat's mouth closes on them.

Jack cries: "Help! Help!" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the [[fourth wall]], tells the audience: "Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine: Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat! And I was playing the violin!" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant "[[Rock-a-Bye Baby]]" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation (where the rodent Jack and Mary return to their mousehole), the real Jack Benny does one of his famous "takes" as the cartoon fades out.

==Voice cast==
* [[Jack Benny]] as Jack
* [[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]] as Chubby Don
* [[Mary Livingstone]] as Mary
* [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie "Rochester" Anderson]] as Rochester
* [[Mel Blanc]] as the [[Maxwell (automobile)|Maxwell]] / Ed, the vault guard

==Production==
The cartoon was released on April 4, 1959. Written by [[Tedd Pierce]], it is a parody of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' starring the voices of [[Jack Benny]], [[Mary Livingstone]] (in her final public performance), [[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]] and [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie "Rochester" Anderson]] as rodent caricatures of their respective radio and television characters, with [[Mel Blanc]] reprising his imitation of Benny's [[Maxwell automobile]] (also assuming the voice of "Ed", Jack's underground vault guard, usually portrayed on radio and TV by [[Joseph Kearns]]). The title is a play on the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[This is the House that Jack Built]]". As revealed on the audio commentary for this short, Benny only supplied his voice, but not his violin playing, as evidenced by the "pre-score" music of the violin soloist attempting to play as badly as Benny did on the radio show.

'''''Thurman v. City of Torrington''''', [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|DC]], 595 F.Supp. 1521 (1985) was a court decision concerning Tracey Thurman, a [[Connecticut]] homemaker who sued the city police department in [[Torrington, Connecticut]], claiming a failure of [[Civil and political rights|equal protection under the law]] against her abusive husband Charles "Buck" Thurman, Sr.

==Case==
After Tracey Thurman was attacked, stabbed, and nearly killed by her husband on June 10, 1983, a subsequent civil lawsuit judged that the local police had ignored growing signs of [[domestic violence]] and had casually dismissed [[restraining order]]s and other legal bars to keep Charles "Buck" Thurman, Sr. away from his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CHRIS PARKERRepublican-American |url=http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2008/06/08/news/doc484b2ed8d4eb7320766604.txt |title=No nonsense, no bitterness, better policing The Republican-American |publisher=Rep-am.com |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2011-09-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033306/http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2008/06/08/news/doc484b2ed8d4eb7320766604.txt |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this lawsuit, filed in 1984, Thurman was the first woman in America to sue a town and its police department for violating her civil rights, claiming the police had ignored the violence because she was married to the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic-violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded $2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic-violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Thurman lawsuit brought about sweeping national reform of domestic violence laws, including the "Thurman Law" (aka the Family Violence Prevention and Response Act) instituted in Connecticut in 1986, making domestic violence an automatically arrestable offense, even if the victim does not wish to press charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/thurmanexcerpt.html |title=Thurman v. City of Torrington |publisher=harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracey Thurman's story was later made into a 1989 television movie, entitled ''[[A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story]]'', starring [[Nancy McKeon]] as Tracey, [[Dale Midkiff]] as Buck, [[Bruce Weitz]] as Tracey's lawyer Burton Weinstein, and [[Philip Baker Hall]] as presiding Judge Blumenfeld.

The Lord Veethividangar ([[வீதிவிடங்கர்]]) now called as Thiyagarajaswami ([[Shiva]]) comes out of the massive ancient temple, with his consort Kondi ([[கொண்டி]]) ([[Parvathi]]) to bless the devotees who always come to visit him in his abode, one of the world's biggest chariots. And this chariot was constructed by [[ Vishwakarma ]] community.

==Description==
One of the very old and ancient festivals that are often mentioned in the devotional hymns of saints like ( [[Appar]],
[[Tirugnanasambandar]] and [[Sundarar]]) and many [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature, usually held during the summer between months of March and April every year, lasts more than 25 days. On the day of the chariot festival, the uthsava morthi (the lord who comes out for procession) is beautifully decorated and brought out of the temple along with his consort to the Great Car (in Tamil: ஆழித் தேர்) and go for the procession all day long. This chariot is said to the biggest one of its type in size and height. It is {{convert|96|ft}} tall and weights more than 300 tons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dinamani.com/edition/story.aspx?SectionName=Tamilnadu&amp;artid=85922&amp;SectionID=123&amp;MainSectionID=95&amp;SEO=&amp;Title=%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%82%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D+%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%B4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D+%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8B%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D:+%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A9+%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D+%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D+%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81+%E0%AE%87%E0%AE%B4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this grand chariot there are 4 more cars for the lord's consort, [[Murugan|Subramanya]], [[Ganapathi]] and [[Sandikaswerar]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dinamalar.com/General_detail.asp?news_id=14905&lt;/ref&gt; All the chariots are large, but relatively smaller than the Great Thear of tiruvarur. This grand Chariot is extensively decorated with wooden carvings and finishes. It requires a minimum of ten thousand people to pull the chariot around the four surrounding streets of the temple.

The chariot is a beautiful structure with intricate work and the biggest, which was used as model for the Valluvar Kottam in Chennai. The original chariot was burnt in 1922 in an accident. The new chariot was later built and has replaced the old one in the original grandeur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">'''Yılgayah''' (Turkish: ''Yılgayak'', Azerbaijanese: ''İlqayax''; means "Year-Passing") or '''Ulugh-Kun''' ("Great Day" in [[Old Turkic|Old]] and [[Middle Turkic|Middle]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]) was the spring festival of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[shaman]]ism. It was celebrated on or about March 22, and marked the first day of the Turkic month of [[Oshlaq-ay]]. The holiday was celebrated with feasting and probably with [[sacrificial]] rites. 
The name of the holiday appears in the medieval dictionary ''Divan-i Lughat-it-Turk'' by [[Mahmud Kashgari]], written in the 1070s.

==Sleep of Universe==
'''Yılgayah''' is referred to as '''[[Nowruz]] Bayramı'''. Yılgayah is a traditional Turkish holiday, which celebrates the New Year, and the coming of Spring. That night, at that moment everything sleeps for an instant. Back then wakes up the universe.

Yılgayah is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, contests of national sports.

==In Azerbaijan culture==
Usually preparation for Yılgayah begins a month prior to the festival. In rural areas crop holidays are marked.&lt;ref&gt;Studentsoftheworld, Article - [http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/sites/arts/3559.php Azeri Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of forthcoming 4 weeks is devoted to one of the four elements and called accordingly in Azerbaijan.

'''''Ådalen 31''''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈoːdɑːlɛn}};{{citation needed|reason=accent 2?|date=August 2018}} released in the United States as '''''Adalen Riots''''') is a [[1969 in film|1969]] [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Bo Widerberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?itemid=4822&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Basic|title=Ådalen 31|publisher=Swedish Film Database|language=Swedish|date=1 May 1969|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts the 1931 [[Ådalen shootings]], in which Swedish military forces opened fire against labour demonstrators in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] sawmill district of [[Ådalen]] killing five people, including a young girl.

The film was [[X-rated]] in the [[United States]]. It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prize of the Jury]] at the [[1969 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

==Plot==
In 1931, the working-class family Andersson of [[Ådalen]] are taking part in a massive [[sympathy strike]] for workers in the town [[Marma, Sweden|Marma]]. Harald, the father of the family, catches fish and manages to support his family while maintaining a good mood. Kjell, the oldest son, works at the office of the local sawmill manager, and is taught about classical music, [[impressionism]] and French pronunciation by the manager's wife. He plays in a jazz band with his friend Nisse with whom he also discusses things like girls, [[erogenous zone]]s and [[hypnosis]]. As spring commences, the manager's daughter Anna comes home for school holiday. She and Kjell fall in love, and she becomes pregnant with his child.

When the sawmill is to deliver a big order to America, strikebreakers are called in from other towns. The local strikers become furious and police has to be called in to protect the strikebreakers. Still they are attacked by an angry crowd while working at the Sandviken wharf outside [[Kramfors]]. Some are thrown into the water, while others are beaten bloody. Harald takes care of an injured strikebreaker, but is confronted by a group of angry workers. He tries to argue for them to calm down and rely on discussion instead of violence, but they do not agree with his stance.

Because of the turbulence, military troops arrive to ensure safety. It is also decided by the County Administrative Board that the strikebreakers should be prohibited from working, but this information doesn't reach the upset locals, who decide to march to the locality where the strikebreakers are staying to get rid of them. When the military troops fail in persuading the participants to stop, they open fire.

Five people are killed and five more are injured. Among the dead are Harald Andersson, Nisse and a young girl who had only been a bystander. Around the same time, Anna returns from [[Stockholm]] where she has had an abortion arranged by her mother. When Kjell is told about the abortion by Anna's father, he interprets it as if he isn't accepted within the bourgeois idyll.

A [[general strike]] is proclaimed. While Kjell is occupied as a strike guard, he meets the man who had previously argued with his father. The man claims that the father wasn't innocent, since he had helped to divide the workers. Not until now they were united. Kjell does not agree, instead claiming that education is the key to a better society. Slowly the Andersson family recover from the loss, and eventually the factories open again.

==Critical reception==
"Beautiful yet uninspired" was the assessment of [[Pauline Kael]]. "Lush and lyrical as it is, it’s fundamentally didactic, with stereotyped social-realist characters. And because Widerberg seems to work best in vignettes and to have architectural problems when he’s working on such a large scale, his argument isn’t clear; he makes the little points but not the big ones. So when the violence erupts, we don’t really understand its political significance – we’re left 'appreciating' it, in a rather embarrassed way, for its pictorial values."&lt;ref name="Kael"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kael |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Kael |title=5001 Nights at the Movies |url= |year=2011 |origyear=1991 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=978-1-250-03357-4 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
