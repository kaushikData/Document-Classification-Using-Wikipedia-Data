The '''tenth millennium''' of the [[Gregorian calendar]] will begin on January 1, 9001, and end on December 31, 10000.

==Astronomical events==
All these dates are in a uniform time scale such as [[Terrestrial Time]]. When converted to our ordinary solar time or [[Universal Time]], which is decidedly non-uniform, via [[ΔT]], the dates would be a couple of days earlier. &lt;!--Because of this difference, these dates have no anniversary relation to historical dates and should not be linked to them. --&gt;Furthermore, they are only astronomical dates, so they are given in the astronomical format of Year Month Day, which allows them to be ordered.

* 9106 November 5: [[Venus]] [[occultation|occults]] [[Regulus]].
* 9168 November 21: [[Mean solar time]] and [[atomic time]] will be [[ΔT|two days apart.]]
* 9361 August 4: Simultaneous annular [[solar eclipse]] and [[transit of Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Solar_eclipses_during_transits&gt;[http://transit.savage-garden.org/sedt.html  Solar eclipses during transits; One hundred millennium catalog 50 000 BC - 50 000 AD]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9622 February 4: Simultaneous annular solar eclipse and transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Solar_eclipses_during_transits/&gt;
* 9682 November 16: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] occults Regulus.
* 9847 November 21: [[Mars]] occults Regulus.
* c. 9800: Earth's roughly 26,000 year route of [[axial precession]] returns to [[Deneb]] as the [[Pole star|North star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Deneb | publisher = University of Illinois | year = 2009 | url = http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/deneb.html | accessdate =5 September 2011
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9966 August 11: Simultaneous total solar eclipse and transit of Mercury.&lt;ref name=Solar_eclipses_during_transits/&gt;

==Year 10,000 problem==
{{main|Year 10,000 problem}}
[[Software]] that encodes the [[Common era|CE]] / [[Christian Era|AD]] [[calendar year]] of a date as a four-character [[binary-coded decimal]] will no longer be able to encode the contemporaneous date. This problem will possibly occur from midnight on January 1, 10000.

==Television==
*In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]", the [[Professor Farnsworth|Professor]], [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] travel in the Professor's Time Machine in which they find a five-times over [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Post-Apocalyptic]] future in the year 10,000. There is a ruin of the human [[Statue of Liberty]] in line with four others, one of an ape, bird, cow and a slug-like creature. 
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Replaceable You]]", [[Lisa Simpson]] says her science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on July 15, 9789. To this [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] replies: "Who cares? I'll be President of Hell by then."
*In ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future also refers to 9595 and is from this year.	 

==Music==
*In the song "[[In the Year 2525]]" by [[Zager and Evans]], it is predicted that humankind will have exhausted all planetary resources by the year 9595.

[[File:GrosCaptureOfMadrid.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine-Jean Gros]], ''Surrender of Madrid'', 1808. Napoleon enters Spain's capital during the [[Peninsular War]], 1810.]]
{{Centurybox|19}}
The '''19th''' ('''nineteenth''') '''century''' was a century that began on January 1, 1801, and ended on December 31, 1900. It is often used interchangeably with the '''1800s''', though the start and end dates differ by a year.

The 19th century saw large amounts of social change; [[slavery]] was [[abolitionism|abolished]], and the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] led to massive [[urbanization]] and much higher levels of productivity, profit and prosperity.  European [[imperialism]] brought much of Asia and almost all of Africa under [[colonial rule]].

It was marked by the collapse of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires. This paved the way for the growing influence of the [[British Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[United States]], the [[German Empire]] (essentially replacing the Holy Roman Empire), the [[Second French colonial empire|French colonial empire]] and [[Empire of Japan|Meiji Japan]], with the British boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815. After the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British and Russian empires expanded greatly, becoming the world's leading powers. The Russian Empire expanded in central and far eastern Asia. The British Empire grew rapidly in the first half of the century, especially with the expansion of vast territories in Canada, Australia, South Africa and heavily populated India, and in the last two decades of the century in Africa. By the end of the century, the British Empire controlled a fifth of the world's land and one quarter of the world's population. During the post-Napoleonic era, it enforced what became known as the [[Pax Britannica]], which had ushered in unprecedented [[globalization]] and economic integration on a massive scale.

==Overview==
The first [[electronics]] appeared in the 19th century, with the introduction of the [[electric relay]] in 1835, the [[telegraph]] and its [[Morse code]] protocol in 1837, the first telephone call in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_telephone_1.html|title=The First Telephone Call|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first functional [[light bulb]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/|title=Dec. 18, 1878: Let There Be Light — Electric Light|date=18 December 2009|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century was an era of rapidly accelerating [[scientific discovery]] and [[invention]], with significant developments in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105005042/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html Encyclopædia Britannica's Great Inventions]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Great Britain and spread to continental Europe, North America and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/industrialrev/a/indrevoverview.htm |title=The United States and the Industrial Revolution in the 19th Century |publisher=Americanhistory.about.com |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2012-10-31 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69N2QhLBq?url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/industrialrev/a/indrevoverview.htm |archive-date=2012-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Victorian era]] was notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines, as well as strict [[social norm]]s regarding modesty and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan embarked on a program of rapid modernization following the [[Meiji Restoration]], before defeating China, under the [[Qing Dynasty]], in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. [[History of medicine#19th century: rise of modern medicine|Advances in medicine]] and the understanding of human anatomy and disease prevention took place in the 19th century, and were partly responsible for rapidly accelerating [[population growth]] in the [[western world]]. Europe's population doubled during the 19th century, from approximately 200 million to more than 400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/modernization/12022/Population-change |title= Modernization – Population Change |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406074344/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/modernization/12022/Population-change |archivedate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Rail transport|railroads]] provided the first major advancement in land transportation for centuries, changing the way people lived and obtained goods, and fuelling major [[urbanization]] movements in countries across the globe. Numerous cities worldwide surpassed populations of a million or more during this century. London became the world's [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city]] and capital of the British Empire.  Its population increased from 1 million in 1800 to 6.7 million a century later. The last remaining undiscovered landmasses of Earth, including vast expanses of interior Africa and Asia, were [[List of explorers|explored]] during this century, and with the exception of the extreme zones of the Arctic and Antarctic, accurate and detailed maps of the globe were available by the 1890s. [[Liberalism]] became the pre-eminent [[reform movement]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339173/liberalism/237346/Liberalism-in-the-19th-century Liberalism in the 19th century]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Slaves ruvuma.jpg|thumb|[[Arab slave trade]]rs and their captives along the Ruvuma river (in today's Tanzania and Mozambique), 19th century]]

[[Slavery]] was greatly reduced around the world. Following a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Haiti]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and France stepped up the battle against the [[Barbary pirates]] and succeeded in stopping their enslavement of Europeans. The UK's [[Slavery Abolition Act]] charged the British [[Royal Navy]] with ending the global [[History of slavery|slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Sailing against slavery. By Jo Loosemore]. ''BBC.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first colonial empire in the century to abolish slavery was the British, who did so in 1834. America's [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] following their [[American Civil War|Civil War]] abolished slavery there in 1865, and in [[Lei Áurea|Brazil]] slavery was abolished in 1888 (see [[Abolitionism]]). Similarly, [[serfdom]] was abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]].

The 19th century was remarkable in the widespread formation of new [[settler|settlement]] foundations which were particularly prevalent across North America and Australia, with a significant proportion of the two continents' largest cities being founded at some point in the century. [[Chicago]] in the United States and [[Melbourne]] in Australia were non-existent in the earliest decades but grew to become the 2nd largest cities in the United States and British Empire respectively by the end of the century. In the 19th century approximately 70 million people left Europe, with most migrating to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=1118_0_5_0 The Atlantic: Can the US afford immigration?]. ''Migration News''. December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century also saw the rapid creation, development and codification of many sports, particularly in Britain and the United States. [[Association football]], [[rugby union]], [[baseball]] and many other sports were developed during the 19th century, while the British Empire facilitated the rapid spread of sports such as [[cricket]] to many different parts of the world. Also, ladywear was a very sensitive topic during this time, where women showing their ankles was viewed to be scandalous.

It also marks the fall of the Ottoman rule of the Balkans which led to the creation of [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Romania]] as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|second Russo-Turkish War]], which in itself followed the great [[Crimean War]].

== Wars ==
===Napoleonic Wars===
{{main|Napoleonic Wars}}
{{see also|Timeline of the Napoleonic era}}
[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Napoleon]]'s retreat from Russia in 1812. The war swings decisively against the French Empire]]
The Napoleonic Wars were a series of major conflicts from 1803 to 1815 pitting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]], financed and usually led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]].

In the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France in 1799.  In 1804, he crowned himself [[Emperor of the French]].

In 1805, the French victory over an Austrian-Russian army at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] ended the [[War of the Third Coalition]].  As a result of the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved.

Later efforts were less successful.  In the [[Peninsular War]], France unsuccessfully attempted to establish [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as King of Spain. In 1812, the [[French invasion of Russia]] had massive French casualties, and was a turning point in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In 1814, after defeat in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Napoleon abdicated and was exiled to [[Elba]].  Later that year, he escaped exile and began the [[Hundred Days]] before finally being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and exiled to [[Saint Helena]], an island in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].

After Napoleon's defeat, the [[Congress of Vienna]] was held to determine new national borders.  The [[Concert of Europe]] attempted to preserve this settlement was established to preserve these borders, with limited impact.

===Latin American independence===
{{main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}
[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the Chilean declaration of independence|The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] on 18 February 1818]]
Most countries in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] obtained independence from [[Colonialism|colonial]] overlords during the 19th century.  In 1804, [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]] gained independence from France.  In [[Mexico]], the [[Mexican War of Independence]] was a decade-long conflict that ended in Mexican independence in 1821.

Due to the Napoleonic Wars, the royal family of Portugal [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|relocated to Brazil]] from 1808-1821, leading to Brazil having a separate monarchy from Portugal.

The [[Federal Republic of Central America]] gained independence from Spain in 1821 and from Mexico in 1823.  After several rebellions, by 1841 the federation had dissolved into the independent countries of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perez-Brignoli|first1=Hector|title=A Brief History of Central America|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520909763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, the post-colonial nation of [[Gran Colombia]] dissolved and the nations of [[Colombia]] (including modern-day Panama), [[Ecuador]], and [[Venezuela]] took its place.

===Revolutions of 1848===
[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Liberal and nationalist pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]
The [[Revolutions of 1848]] were a series of [[political upheaval]]s throughout [[Europe]] in 1848.  The revolutions were essentially [[democracy|democratic]] and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old [[Monarchy|monarchical]] structures and creating independent nation states.

The first revolution began in [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|January in Sicily]].{{clarify|date=December 2017}} Revolutions then spread across Europe after a separate revolution began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]]. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries.

According to Evans and von Strandmann (2000), some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.&lt;ref&gt;R.J.W. Evans and Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, eds., ''The Revolutions in Europe 1848–1849'' (2000) pp. v, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition and the American Civil War===
{{main|Abolitionism|American Civil War}}
[[File:Wilberforce john rising.jpg|thumb|[[William Wilberforce]] (1759–1833), politician and philanthropist who was a leader of the movement to [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolish the slave trade]].]]

The [[abolitionism]] movement achieved success in the 19th century.  The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was abolished in 1808, and by the end of the century, almost every government had banned slavery.  The [[Slavery Abolition Act]] of 1833 banned slavery throughout the [[British Empire]], and the [[Lei Áurea]] abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.

The American Civil War took place from 1861-1865.  Eleven [[Southern United States|southern states]] seceded from the [[United States]], largely over concerns related to slavery.  In 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Lincoln issued a preliminary &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation proclamation]&lt;/ref&gt; on September 22, 1862 warning that in all states still in rebellion ([[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]) on January 1, 1863, he would declare their slaves "then, thenceforward, and forever free."&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, J. M. (2014). Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. In E. Foner, &amp; J. A. Garraty (Eds.), ''The Reader's companion to American history''. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. Retrieved from http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/rcah/emancipation_proclamation_and_thirteenth_amendment/0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/13th-amendment 13th Amendment]&lt;/ref&gt; ratified in 1865, officially abolished slavery in the entire country.

Five days after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia]], [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln was assassinated]] by actor and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathiser [[John Wilkes Booth]].

=== Decline of the Ottoman Empire ===
In 1830, [[Greece]] became the first country to break away from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[Greek War of Independence]].  In 1831, the [[Great Bosnian uprising]] against Ottoman rule occurred. In 1817, the [[Principality of Serbia]] became [[suzerain]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and in 1867, it passed a [[Constitution]] which defined its independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].  In 1876, [[Bulgarians]] instigate the [[April Uprising]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.  Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] recognized the formal independence of the [[Principality of Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Romania]]. [[Bulgaria]] becomes autonomous.

===China: Taiping Rebellion ===
[[File:Regaining the Provincial Capital of Ruizhou.jpg|thumb|280px|A scene of the [[Taiping Rebellion]].]]
The [[Taiping Rebellion]] was the bloodiest conflict of the 19th century, leading to the deaths of 20 million people.  Its leader, [[Hong Xiuquan]], declared himself the younger brother of [[Jesus Christ]] and developed a new Chinese religion known as the [[God Worshipping Society]].  After proclaiming the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1851, the Taiping army conquered a large part of China, capturing [[Nanjing]] in 1853.

=== Japan: Meiji Restoration ===
{{main|Meiji Restoration}}
During the [[Edo period]], [[History of Japan|Japan]] largely pursued an [[Sakoku|isolationist foreign policy]].  In 1853, United States Navy Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] threatened the Japanese capital [[Edo]] with gunships, demanding that they agree to open trade.  This led to [[Bakumatsu|the opening of trade relations]] between Japan and foreign countries, with the policy of [[Sakoku]] formally ended in 1854.

By 1872, the Japanese government under [[Emperor Meiji]] had [[Abolition of the han system|eliminated the ''daimyō'' system]] and established a strong central government.  Further reforms included the abolishment of the [[samurai]] class, rapid industrialization and modernization of government, closely following European models.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Beasley, ''The Meiji Restoration'' (1972),&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonialism ===

{{main|Western imperialism in Asia|Scramble for Africa}}

In 1862, French gained its first foothold in [[Southeast Asia]], and in 1863 [[France]] annexes [[Cambodia]].

* [[1803]]: The United States more than doubles in size when it buys out France's territorial claims in North America via the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. This begins the U.S.'s westward expansion to the Pacific referred to as its [[Manifest Destiny]] which involves [[United States territorial acquisitions|annexing and conquering land]] from Mexico, Britain, and Native Americans.
* [[1823]]–[[1887]]: The British Empire annexed [[Burma]] (now also called Myanmar) after three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]].
* [[1867]]: The United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchases Alaska]] from [[Russia]].

==== Africa ====
In Africa, European exploration and technology led to the colonization of almost the entire continent by 1898.  New medicines such as [[quinine]] and more advanced [[firearms]] allowed European nations to conquer native populations.&lt;ref name="KerrAfrica"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Gordon|title=A short history of Africa : from the origins of the human race to the Arab spring|date=2012|publisher=Pocket Essentials|location=Harpenden, Herts [UK]|isbn=9781842434420|pages=85–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivations for the [[Scramble for Africa]] included national pride, desire for raw materials, and Christian missionary activity.  Britain seized control of Egypt to ensure control of the [[Suez Canal]].  France, Belgium, Portugal, and Germany also had substantial colonies.  The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884-1885 attempted to reach agreement on colonial borders in Africa, but disputes continued, both amongst European powers and in resistance by the native population.&lt;ref name="KerrAfrica" /&gt;

In 1867, [[diamonds]] were discovered in the [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] region of South Africa.  In 1886, gold was discovered in [[South African Republic|Transvaal]].  This led to colonization in Southern Africa by the British and business interests, led by [[Cecil Rhodes]].&lt;ref name="KerrAfrica" /&gt;

==Science and technology==
{{Distinguished men of science of Great Britain 1806-7|align=right}}
The 19th century saw the birth of science as a profession; the term '''scientist''' was coined in 1833 by [[William Whewell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| accessdate=2008-03-03
| url=http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/whewell/
| title=William Whewell
| publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; which soon replaced the older term of '''(natural) philosopher'''. Among the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of [[Charles Darwin]] (alongside the independent researches of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]), who in 1859 published the book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', which introduced the idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the [[germ theory of disease]]. Following this, [[Louis Pasteur]] made the first [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]], and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the [[optical isomerism|asymmetry of crystals]]. In chemistry, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], following the [[atomic theory]] of [[John Dalton]], created the first [[periodic table]] of [[Chemical element|elements]]. In physics, the experiments, theories  and discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]], [[André-Marie Ampère]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and their contemporaries led to the creation of [[electromagnetism]] as a new branch of science. [[Thermodynamics]] led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined. Other highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry – and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of [[hypercomplex number]]s. [[Karl Weierstrass]] and others carried out the [[arithmetization of analysis]] for functions of [[Function of a real variable|real]] and [[complex variable]]s. It also saw rise to [[Non-Euclidean geometry|new progress in geometry]] beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about: [[Thomas Alva Edison]] gave the world a practical everyday [[lightbulb]]. [[Nikola Tesla]] pioneered the [[induction motor]], high frequency transmission of electricity, and remote control. Other new inventions were electrical telegraphy and the telephone.

===Literature===
{{main|Romantic poetry|19th century in literature}}

On the literary front the new century opens with [[romanticism]], a movement that spread throughout Europe in reaction to 18th-century rationalism, and it develops more or less along the lines of the Industrial Revolution, with a design to react against the dramatic changes wrought on nature by the steam engine and the railway. [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are considered the initiators of the new school in England, while in the continent the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' spreads its influence as far as Italy and Spain.  French arts had been hampered by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] but subsequently developed rapidly. [[Modernism]] began.&lt;ref&gt;David Damrosch and David L. Pike, eds. ''The Longman Anthology of World Literature, Volume E: The Nineteenth Century'' (2nd ed. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goncourts and [[Émile Zola]] in France and [[Giovanni Verga]] in Italy produce some of the finest naturalist novels. Italian naturalist novels are especially important in that they give a social map of the new unified Italy to a people that until then had been scarcely aware of its ethnic and cultural diversity. There was a huge literary output during the 19th century. Some of the most famous writers included the Russians [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; the English [[Charles Dickens]], [[John Keats]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] and [[Jane Austen]]; the Scottish [[Sir Walter Scott]]; the Irish [[Oscar Wilde]]; the Americans [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Mark Twain]]; and the French [[Victor Hugo]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8856">'''Alan Steele Milward''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|FBA}} (19 January 1935 - 28 September 2010) was a British [[economic historian]].

One of the most influential historians of the second half of the twentieth century, Milward's work was well known in Britain, across Europe and beyond. He derived that reputation not from the writing of popular histories or media appearances but from his abilities as a linguist, economic historian, archival researcher, historical narrator and political scientist. He made an essential contribution to the understanding of modern European history and integration: the elements that went to shape contemporary Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Obituary, 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he is usually seen as an economic historian, he worked in many other fields, including economic theory and policy, economic and political history, contemporary economic and political studies. He was a very rigorous modern political economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruland |first1=Kristine |title=Alan Steele Milward |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/memoirs/13/index.cfm |website=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy III |accessdate=5 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107011828/http://www.britac.ac.uk/memoirs/13/index.cfm |archivedate=7 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Milward was born and raised in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], where his father was an employee of the Post Office, and attended a grammar school there.

He studied medieval and modern history at [[University College London]] from 1953 to 1956, gaining a First Class BA degree and then achieved his PhD at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1960, with a thesis written under supervision of W. Norton Medlicott on the armaments industry in the German economy during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruland |first1=Kristine |title=Alan Steele Milward |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/memoirs/13/index.cfm |website=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy III |accessdate=5 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107011828/http://www.britac.ac.uk/memoirs/13/index.cfm |archivedate=7 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His first academic placement was the teaching of Indian Archaeology at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]. In 1960, he was given the position of  assistant lecturer and subsequently lecturer in Economic History at [[Edinburgh University]]. In 1965, he advanced to become lecturer and later senior lecturer at the School of Social Studies, [[University of East Anglia]]. He then moved to the United States to become an associate professor of economics at [[Stanford University]], returning after three years to become Professor of European Studies at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] between 1971 and 1983. He was then a professor at the European University Institute in Florence for two terms, between 1983 and 1986 and between 1996 and 2002.

From 1986 to 1996, he was Professor of Economic History at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maier|first1=Charles S|title=Alan Milward obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/28/alan-milward-obituary|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was given the position of official historian at the [[Cabinet Office]], and he produced the first volume of the Government Official History of the United Kingdom and the [[European Community]], ''The Rise and Fall of a National Strategy 1945-1963'', published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Routledge|title=Government Official History Series|url= https://www.routledge.com/series/SE0789|website=Routledge Publishers|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1987 and fellow of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Alan Milward|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/8120701/Professor-Alan-Milward.html|website=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He gained a reputation for his ability to articulate and sustain his theses, which differed considerably from the received wisdom, and to refute arguments against his position. His interpretations caused widespread debate and discussion. An example was his minimalist contention that the [[Marshall Plan]] had been less crucial than often supposed in stimulating postwar European reconstruction or persuading former antagonists to work together.

In his book ''The European Rescue of the Nation State'' (1992), he also challenged the eurosceptic doctrine that the [[European Union]] would involve an integration of nation-states that would undermine sovereignty and lead to a federalist superstate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruland |first1=Kristine |title=Alan Steele Milward |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/memoirs/13/index.cfm |website=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy III |accessdate=5 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107011828/http://www.britac.ac.uk/memoirs/13/index.cfm |archivedate=7 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced many historians and political scientists, not least Andrew Moravcsik's Choice for Europe. &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Moravcsik, ''The Choice for Europe. Social Purpose and State Power from Messina to Maastricht'', Cornell UP, 1998, p. 88 &lt;/ref&gt;

He had a gift for languages, becoming fluent in Norwegian, German, Italian and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKittrick|first1=David|title=Alan Milward: Economic historian celebrated for his analyses of the post-war European project|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/alan-milward-economic-historian-celebrated-for-his-analyses-of-the-postwar-european-project-2151989.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1771">The '''Ancient Monuments Act 1900''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that aimed to improve the protection afforded to [[ancient monuments]] in Britain.

==Details==
The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had begun the process of establishing legal protection for Britain's ancient monuments; these had all been prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. By the turn of the century, the scope of the earlier legislation was felt to be insufficient, and the Ancient Monuments Act empowered the government's Commissioners of Work and local [[county council]]s to protect a wider range of properties. The act also allowed these groups to provide public access to ancient monuments, and to financially assist with their conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, pp8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

In 1913, gaps in the legislation between the protection ascribed to monuments under the 1882 and 1900 legislation led to the a royal commission and the passing of the additional [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910]].

[[Image:AC.jpeg|thumb|250px |''Annales Cambriae'': page view from MS. '''A''']]
'''''Annales Cambriae''''' ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]] for '''The Annals of Wales''') is the name given to a complex of [[Welsh culture|Cambro]]-Latin chronicles compiled or derived from diverse sources at [[St David's]] in [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], [[Wales]]. The earliest is a 12th-century presumed copy of a mid-10th century original; later editions were compiled in the 13th century. Despite the name, the ''Annales Cambriae'' record not only events in Wales, but also events in [[Ireland]], [[Cornwall]], [[England]], [[Scotland]] and sometimes further afield, though the focus of the events recorded especially in the later two-thirds of the text is Wales.

==Sources==
The principal versions of ''Annales Cambriae'' appear in four manuscripts:

'''A''': London, British Library, MS. Harleian 3859, folios 190r-193r.&lt;br&gt;
'''B''': London (Kew), [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]], MS. E.164/1 (K.R. Misc. Books, Series I) pp.&amp;nbsp;2–26&lt;br&gt;
'''C''': London, British Library, MS. [[Cotton Domitian]] A.i, folios 138r-155r&lt;br&gt;
'''D''': [[Exeter Cathedral|Exeter, Cathedral]] Library, MS. 3514, pp.&amp;nbsp;523–28, the ''Cronica ante aduentum Domini''.&lt;br&gt;
'''E''': ''ibid.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;507–19, the ''Cronica de Wallia''.

*'''A''' is written in a hand of about 1100x1130 AD, and inserted without title into a manuscript (MS) of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' where it is immediately followed by a pedigree for [[Owain ap Hywel Dda|Owain ap Hywel]] (died 988). Although no explicit chronology is given in the MS, its annals seem to run from about AD 445 to 977 with the last entry at 954, making it likely that the text belongs to the second half of the 10th century.
*'''B''' was written, probably at the [[Cistercian]] abbey of [[Neath]], at the end of the 13th century. It is entitled ''Annales ab orbe condito adusque A. D. mcclxxxvi'' [1286].
*'''C''' is part of a book written at St David's, and is entitled ''Annales ab orbe condito adusque A. D. mcclxxviii'' [1288]{{Fix|text=or 1278?}}; this is also of the late 13th century.

Two of the texts, '''B''' and '''C''', begin with a World Chronicle derived from [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''Origines'' ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Isidore/5*.html#39 Book V, ch. 39]), through the medium of [[Bede]]'s [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Chronica_minora Chronica minora]. '''B''' commences its annals with Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain "sixty years before the incarnation of the Lord." After A.D. 457, '''B''' agrees closely with '''A''' until '''A''' ends. '''C''' commences its annals after the empire of [[Heraclius]] (AD 610-41) at a year corresponding to AD 677. '''C''' mostly agrees with '''A''' until '''A''' ends, although it is clear that '''A''' was not the common source for '''B''' and '''C''' (Dumville 2002, p. xi). '''B''' and '''C''' diverge after 1203, '''C''' having fewer and briefer Welsh entries.

'''D''' and '''E''' are found in a manuscript written at the Cistercian abbey of [[Whitland]] in south-west Wales in the later 13th century; the ''Cronica ante aduentum Domini'' (which takes its title from its opening words) extends from 1132 BC to 1285 AD, while the ''Cronica de Wallia'' extends from 1190 to 1266.

'''A''' alone has benefited from a complete diplomatic edition (Phillimore 1888).&lt;ref&gt;Phillimore, Egerton (ed.), 1888 "The Annales Cambriae and Old Welsh Genealogies from Harleian MS. 3859", ''Y Cymmrodor''; 9 (1888) pp. 141-183. [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Annales_Cambriae Annales Cambriae, the A-text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source for the Arthurian legend==
There are two entries in the ''Annales'' on [[King Arthur]], one on [[Mordred|Medraut]] (Mordred), and one on [[Merlin]]. These entries have been presented in the past as proof of the existence of Arthur and Merlin,&lt;ref&gt;John Morris (1973). ''The Age of Arthur, a history of the British Isles from 350 to 650'', London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson&lt;/ref&gt; although that view is no longer widely held because the Arthurian entries could have been added arbitrarily as late as 970, long after the development of the early Arthurian myth.

The entries on Arthur and Mordred in the '''A''' Text:

:Year 72 (c. AD 516) The [[Battle of Mons Badonicus|Battle of Badon]], in which Arthur carried the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ on his shoulders for three days and three nights and the Britons were victors.
:Year 93 (c. 537) The [[Battle of Camlann|Strife of Camlann]] in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) fell and there was death in Britain and in Ireland.

Concerning Arthur's cross at the Battle of Badon, it is mirrored by a passage in [[Nennius]] where Arthur was said to have borne the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] "on his shoulders" during a battle at a castle called Guinnion.&lt;ref name=TheShield/&gt; The words for "shoulder" and "shield" were, however, easily confused in [[Old Welsh]] {{ndash}} ''*scuit'' "shield" versus *''scuid'' "shoulder" &lt;ref name="TheShield"&gt;Jones, W. Lewis. ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/1202.html Vol. I, XII, §2.] Putnam, 1921. Accessed 30 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; {{ndash}} and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] played upon this dual tradition, describing Arthur bearing "on his shoulders a shield" emblazoned with the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'', IX, §IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merlin (Old Welsh Merdin) is not mentioned in the '''A''' Text, though there is mention of the battle of Arfderydd, associated with him in medieval Welsh literature:

:Year 129 (c. 573) The [[Battle of Arfderydd|Battle of Armterid]]

Texts '''B''' and '''C''' omit the second half of the year 93 entry. '''B''' calls Arfderydd "Erderit"; '''C''', "Arderit". In the '''B''' Text, the year 129 entry continues: "between the sons of Elifer and [[Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio|Guendoleu son of Keidau]] in which battle Guendoleu fell and Merlin went mad". Both the '''B''' and '''C''' texts display the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'',&lt;ref&gt;Gough-Cooper, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and this is reflected in the Arfderydd entry by the choice of the Latinized form ''Merlinus'', first found in Geoffrey's ''Historia'', as opposed to the expected Old Welsh form ''Merdin''.

'''Antun Miletić''' (born 30 June 1931) is a [[Croatia]]n and [[Serbia]]n historian.

== Biography ==
Miletić has been living in [[Belgrade]] since 28 November 1946. He spent five years as a student of the Military Academy and served as officer of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] till 31 December 1990, when he retired in the rank of [[colonel]], as Head Officer of the Military Archives of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the title of Senior Researcher in Military History. In the fall of 1959 he started studying history at the University.

After having written his research work :"The development of the National Liberation Movement in [[Slavonia]] 1941-1943" on September 1, 1964 he was transferred to the Military Historical Institute and was promoted to Senior Researcher in [[Military History]]. The [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] promoted him to [[Master of Arts]] on the ground of his research work in the history of [[Second World War]] in [[Yugoslavia]], and particularly on the ground of his books on the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] and his title of Senior Researcher and approved his application to defend his doctor's [[thesis]] entitled : "wehrmacht and the partisan War". He was one of the most active members of the committee of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] for the collection of documents on the [[genocide]] against [[Serb]]s and other peoples in Yugoslavia, in the 20th century, from 1986 to 1994, when the committee ceased its work. He was a member of the Historical committee of the Russell's Tribunal for Yugoslavia. He is a founding member and Chairman of the Association for Research into Genocide and the [[war crime]]s, founded in Belgrade. For many years he was a collaborator and friend of [[Vladimir Dedijer]], President of the Russell's Tribunal. Dedijer dedicated to Miletić his book :" The [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Jasenovac, Sisak-Moslavina County|Jasenovac]]" and expressed him his "deepest gratitude" for his work on the history of the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]  1941-1945. So far, Antun Miletić has published 24 books, over 60 papers and dozens of [[Article (publishing)|articles]] and [[serial (literature)|serial]]s in daily and weekly press. He has also participated in numerous other projects as collaborator, editor, reviewer and member of editorial boards, Presently, he is Chairman of the Advisory Board Jasenovac, Research Institute, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jasenovac.org/news_read.php?nID=46&lt;/ref&gt; His historical work on World War II is today regarded with some skepticism, as his calculated death toll for the main Croatian concentration camp was more than 10 times the maximum range currently accepted by the US Holocaust memorial museum and almost all other modern sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang%3Den%26ModuleId%3D10005449 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916030858/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 |archivedate=2009-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Rumani Coast''' ({{lang-he|קרב רומני}}) was a naval engagement that took place on the night of July 11, 1967 between Israeli and Egyptian naval forces, near the vicinity of Rumani. Two Egyptian [[motor torpedo boat]]s were sunk in the action for no Israeli losses.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/navywar.html The Israel Navy Throughout Israel's Wars], ''Jewish Virtual Library''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following Israel's victory in the [[Six-Day War]], Israel's coastline was significantly enlarged and now included the [[Sinai Peninsula]] coast.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; The [[Israeli Navy]] now sought to enforce Israeli sovereignty over this large area and began regular patrols of the Sinai coastline up to the approaches of [[Port Said]].&lt;ref name=MBT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010141041/http://www.btinternet.com/~david.manley/naval/Bulldogs/israeli.html Israeli MTB Action off Port Said, July 1967], Aryeh Wetherhorn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
On July 9 {{INS|Eilat|1955|6}}, an ex-British [[Royal Navy]] [[W and Z-class destroyer|Z-class]] [[destroyer]] commanded by Yitzhak Shushan, set sail due west toward the Sinai coast. INS ''Eilat'' subsequently rendezvoused with ex-French [[motor torpedo boat]]s [[Meulan motor torpedo boat|''Aya'']] and [[Meulan motor torpedo boat|''Daya'']]. The flotilla patrolled northwest of the Sinai coast, under orders to stop vessels crossing the demarkation line toward the Sinai coast.&lt;ref name=MBT/&gt;

On July 11 at approximately 21:45, the signals intelligence intercept operator in ''Eilat'' reported two Egyptian missile boats were about to sortie. The Israeli torpedo boats picked up a target on radar shortly thereafter. The Egyptians were about 15 miles{{Clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--nm or sm?--&gt; from the MTBs and 12 miles{{Clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--nm or sm?--&gt; from ''Eilat'', moving east at {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The Israelis marked a course to intercept. ''Eilat'' closed from the north, ''Aya'' and ''Daya'' from the east.  The Egyptian vessels, later identified as [[P 4-class torpedo boat#P 6-class torpedo boat|P 6-class]] torpedo boats, discovered the Israeli MTBs approaching at full speed and commenced fire.&lt;ref name=MBT/&gt; The Israelis returned fire with [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikons]]. The initial run scored no hits but the Egyptian MTBs dispersed. The separation enabled ''Eilat'' to close one and the two MTBs the other. Twenty minutes later, both P 6s were ablaze. The fire caused their torpedoes to explode. There were no Israeli losses and no known Egyptian survivors.&lt;ref name=MBT/&gt;

{{Campaignbox Spanish Civil War}}
The '''Bombing of Durango''' took place on 31 March 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. On 31 March 1937 the Nationalists started their offensive against the Republican held province of Biscay. As part of the offensive the ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' and the ''[[Legion Condor]]'' bombed Durango: A town of 10.000 that was also a key road and railway junction behind the frontline. Around 250 people is believed to have died in the bombing.

==Background==
On 31 March 1937, the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist forces]], led by [[Emilio Mola]], started the [[Biscay Campaign|offensive]] against the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] held, [[Biscay|Vizcaya]] Province. Mola said that: "I have decided to terminate rapidly the war in the north:  those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender their arms will have their lives and property spared. But, if submission is not immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war".{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=598}} The same day the Nationalist bombed the towns of Durango{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=71}} and Elorrio.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=228}}

==The bombing==
[[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] a town of 10,000 inhabitants was a road and railway junction between Bilbao and the front. By bombing the road and infrastructure in the town, the Republican forces would be prevented from sending reinforcements from Bilbao. It would also ensure that the Basque and Republican troops couldn't retreat in an orderly fashion in order to fight another day.

Despite the importance of Durango as a transportation junction, the town had no air defences, and the were only a few Republican fighterplanes to be found in the Basque region.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=228}} 

On 31 March, German and Italian transport planes modified to carry bombs (German [[Ju 52]] and Italian [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]]) from the ''[[Condor Legion]]''{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=598}} and the ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' bombed the town in relays. Two churches were bombed during the celebration of mass, killing 14 nuns and the officiated priest.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=228}} Furthermore, [[Heinkel He 51]] fighters strafed fleeing civilians. Altogether, around 250 civilians (Thomas: 248;{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=598}} Beevor: 250{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=228}} and Preston: 258{{sfn|Preston|1995|p=239}}) died in the attack.

==Aftermath==
On 28 April, Durango fell to Nationalist side. While the local roadjunction meant that Durango was a legitimate target for an air attack and the bombing didn't contravene the laws of war as they were at the time, foreign observers were shocked at the carnage. 

The Nationalists denied responsibility for the bombing, claiming that the priest and the nuns thay died in the bombing were killed and burned by the ''reds''. [[Queipo de llano]] said that: "our planes bombed military objectives in Durango, and later communists and socialists locked up the priests and nuns, shooting without pity and burning the churches". {{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=228}}

The bombing of Durango was to a certain extent overlooked historically. 
Instead, it was the bombing of Guernica, a similar air attack that took place only a few weeks later, that got to symbolize the horrors of modern aerial warfare in the public consciousness.

'''Classical demography''' refers to the study of human [[demography]] in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]]. It often focuses on the absolute number of people who were alive in civilizations around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], but in recent decades historians have been more interested in trying to analyse demographic processes such as the birth and death rates or the sex ratio of ancient populations. The period was characterized by an explosion in population with the rise of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] civilizations followed by a steep decline caused by economic and social disruption, [[Migrations Period|migrations]], and a return to primarily [[subsistence agriculture]]. Demographic questions play an important role in determining the size and structure of the [[economy of Ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman economy]].

==Ancient Greece and Greek colonies==
Beginning in the 8th century BC, Greek city-states began colonizing the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]] coasts. Whether this sudden phenomenon was due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], severe [[drought]]s, or an escape for vanquished people (or a combination) is still in question.

The population of the entire Greek civilization (Greece, the Greek-speaking populations of Sicily, the coast of western Asia Minor, and the Black Sea) in the 4th century BC was recently estimated to be 500,000 to 600,000.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Greece proper===
The geographical definition of Greece has fluctuated over time.  While today the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient kingdom of Macedonia]] is always considered part of the Greek world, in the Classical Period it was a distinct entity and even though [[Ancient Macedonian language|Macedonians spoke Greek]], they were not considered as a part of Greece by some [[Ancient Macedonians#Identity|Athenian writers]]. Similarly, almost all modern residents of historical [[Ionia]], now part of [[Turkey]], speak the [[Turkish language]], although from the 1st millennium BC Ionia was densely populated by Greek-speaking people and an important part of [[Greek culture]].

Estimates of the population of Greek speakers in the coast and islands of the [[Aegean Sea]] during the 5th century BC vary from 800,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian D |last=Joseph  |title=GREEK, Ancient |date= |work= |publisher=Ohio State University Department of Linguistics |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~bjoseph/articles/gancient.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 3,000,000. In [[Athens]] and Attica in the 5th century BC, there were at least 150,000 Athenians, around 50,000 aliens, and more than 100,000 slaves or perhaps higher in the range of 350,000 to 500,000 people, of which 160,000 normally resided inside the city and port.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These are not accurate statistics.

===Other Greek colonization===
The ancient Roman province of [[Cyrenaica]] in the eastern region of present-day [[Libya]] was home to many several hundred thousand Greek, Latin and native communities. Originally settled by Greek colonists, five important settlements ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]], [[Euesperides]], [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]], and [[Tauchira]]) formed a pentapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jona |last=Lendering |title=Cyrene and the Cyrenaica |archivedate=2008-12-31 |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrenaica/cyrenaica.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231121921/http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrenaica/cyrenaica.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fertility of the land, the exportation of [[silphium]], and its location between [[Carthage]] and [[Alexandria]] made it a magnet for settlement.

==Ancient Phoenicia and Phoenician colonies==
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}

Phoenicia also established colonies along the Mediterranean, including [[Carthage]].

==Demography of the Hellenistic kingdoms==
When urbanization began to take place, it was [[Pella]] which became the largest city. [[Kingdom of Macedonia]] had 4 million people after the [[Wars of the Diadochi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Grant (author) |date=1990 |title=The Hellenistic Greeks: From Alexander to Cleopatra |series=History of Civilisation |location=London |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |page=21-24 |isbn=0-297-82057-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant_page_48"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Grant (author) |date=1990 |title=The Hellenistic Greeks: From Alexander to Cleopatra |series=History of Civilisation |location=London |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |page=48 |isbn=0-297-82057-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ptolemaic Egypt===
Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] estimated that 7,000,000 inhabitants resided in [[Egypt]] during his lifetime before its annexation by the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Delia|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, he states that 300,000 citizens lived within the city of Alexandria.

===Seleucid Empire===
The population of the vast [[Seleucid Empire]] has been estimated to have been higher than 30 million.&lt;ref name="Grant_page_48"/&gt;

==Demography of the Roman Empire==
{{main|Demography of the Roman Empire}}
There are many estimates of the population for the [[Roman Empire]], that range from 45 million to 120 million with 55-65 million as the most accepted range.

===Roman Italy===
The total population of Roman [[Italy]] (south of the [[Po Valley]]) was estimated{{by whom|date=August 2012}} to be around 4 million before the [[Second Punic War]]. The figure is approximate: the Romans carried out a regular census of citizens eligible for military service (Polybius 2.23), but for the population of the rest of Italy at this time we have to rely on a single report of the military strength of Rome's allies in 227 BC - and guess the numbers of those who were opposed to Rome at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brunt|1971|pp=44-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizen count in the second century B.C. hovered between 250-325,000 presumably males over the age of 13.

The census of 70/69 B.C. records 910,000 presumably due to the extension of citizenship to the allies after the Social War of 91-88. Still, even if only males this seems like an undercount. For the 1st and 2nd centuries BC, historians have developed two radically different accounts, resting on different interpretations of the figures of 4,036,000 recorded for the census carried out by Augustus in 28 BC, 4,233,000 in 8 BC, and 4,937,000 in 14 AD. and almost 6 million during the reign of Claudius, not all of whom lived in Italy. Many lived in Spain, Gaul and other parts of the Empire.  If this only represents adult male citizens (or some subset of adult male citizens those over age 13 as the census traditionally did not count children until they were formally enrolled as citizens early in puberty),{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} then the population of Italy must have been around 10 million, not including slaves and foreigners, which was a striking, sustained increase despite the Romans' losses in the almost constant wars over the previous two centuries. Others find this entirely incredible, and argue that the census must now be counting all citizens, male and female over the age of 13 - in which case the population had declined slightly, something which can readily be attributed to war casualties and to the crisis of the Italian peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brunt|1971|pp=121–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of historians favour the latter interpretation as being more demographically plausible, but the issue remains contentious.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{harvp|Morley|2001}} and {{harvp|Scheidel|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates for the population of mainland Italia, including Gallia Cisalpina, at the beginning of the 1st Century AD range from 6,000,000 according to [[Beloch]] in 1886, 6,830,000 according to Russell in 1958, less than 10,000,000 according to Hin in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14,000,000 according to Lo Cascio in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lo Cascio|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the population of Rome itself or of the other cities of Roman Italy is equally scarce. For the capital, estimates have been based on the number of houses listed in 4th-century AD guidebooks, on the size of the built-up area, and on the volume of the water supply, all of which are problematic; the best guess is based on the number of recipients of the grain dole under Augustus, 200,000, implying a population of around 800,000-1,200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morley|1996|pp=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy had numerous urban centres - over 400 are listed by [[Pliny the Elder]] - but the majority were small, with populations of just a few thousand. As much as 40% of the population might have lived in towns (25% if the city of Rome is excluded), on the face of it an astonishingly high level of urbanisation for a pre-industrial society. However, studies of later periods would not count the smallest centres as 'urban'; if only cities of 10,000+ are counted, Italy's level of urbanisation was a more realistic (but still impressive) 25% (11% excluding Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morley|1996|pp=174–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Revolution''', also known as the '''Third Industrial Revolution''', is the shift from [[machine|mechanical]] and [[Analogue electronics|analogue electronic]] [[technology]] to [[digital electronics]] which began anywhere from the late 1950s to the late 1970s with the adoption and proliferation of digital computers and digital record keeping that continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/digital.html|title=The Digital Revolution|last=E.

Analogous to the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], the Digital Revolution marked the beginning of the [[Information Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/Information-Age | title=Information Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution and Digital Revolution are now taking place concurrently in [[China]] and [[India]] as people leave the rural areas for industrial and high tech cities like [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Mumbai]].

== History ==
[[File:Rings of time Information Age (Digital Revolution).jpg|thumb|Rings of time showing some important dates in Digital Revolution from 1968 to 2017]]

=== Brief history ===

The underlying technology was invented in the later half of the 19th century, including [[Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]] and the [[telegraph]]. Digital communication became economical for widespread adoption after the invention of the [[personal computer]]. [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]], a Bell Labs mathematician, is credited for having laid out the foundations of digitalization in his pioneering 1948 article, ''A Mathematical Theory of Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The mathematical theory of communication|last=Shannon|first=Claude E.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1963|isbn=0252725484|edition=4. print.|location=Urbana|pages=144|author2=Weaver, Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital revolution converted technology that had been analog into a digital format. By doing this, it became possible to make   copies that were identical to the original. In digital communications, for example, repeating hardware was able to amplify the digital signal and pass it on with no loss of information in the signal. Of equal importance to the revolution was the ability to easily move the digital information between media, and to access or distribute it remotely.

The turning point of the revolution was the change from analogue to digitally recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://maas.museum/about/|title=Museum Of Applied Arts And Sciences - About|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Museum Of Applied Arts And Sciences]]|access-date=22 August 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s the digital format of optical [[compact disc]]s gradually replaced [[analog electronics|analog]] formats, such as [[vinyl records]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]], as the popular medium of choice.&lt;ref&gt;"The Digital Revolution Ahead for the Audio Industry," Business Week. New York, 16 March 1981, p. 40D.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins (1947–1969) ===

In 1947, the [[transistor]] was invented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/transistor.htm|title=Transistor History - Invention of the Transistor|date=17 April 2015|publisher=|author=Phil Ament|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the way to more advanced digital computers. From the late 1940s, Universities, the Military, and Business developed computer systems, to digitally replicate and automate previously  manually performed mathematical calculations, with the [[LEO (computer)]] being the first commercially available general purpose computer.

A key step toward mass commercialization was the advent of the [[planar process]] in 1959 by [[Jean Hoerni]], an employee of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. This enabled [[integrated circuit]]s to be mass produced using the techniques of [[photolithography]]. 

From 1969 to 1971, [[Intel]] developed the [[Intel 4004]], an early [[microprocessor]] that laid the foundations for the [[microcomputer revolution]] that began in the 1970s.

The public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the [[Internet]] when a message was sent over the [[ARPANET]] in 1969.  [[Packet switching|Packet switched]] networks such as ARPANET, [[Donald Davies|Mark I]], [[CYCLADES]], [[Merit Network]], [[Tymnet]], and [[Telenet]], were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of [[Communications protocol|protocols]]. The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for [[internetworking]], in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.

The [[Stewart Brand|Whole Earth]] movement of the 1960s advocated the use of new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/history-whole-earth-catalog.php|title=History of Whole Earth Catalog|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===

In the 1970s, the [[home computer]] was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blinkenlights.com/pc.shtml|title=Personal Computer Milestones|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time-sharing|time-sharing computers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ictergezocht.nl/|title=2,076 IT jobs from 492 companies|last1=Criss|first1=Fillur|date=14 August 2014|work=ICTerGezocht.nl|accessdate=19 August 2017|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[video game console]], the first coin-op video games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atari.com/history/arcadecoin-op|title=Atari - Arcade/Coin-op|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/forgotten-arcade-games-let-you-shoot-space-men-and-catc-513560652|title=Forgotten arcade games let you shoot space men and catch live lobsters|author=Vincze Miklós|work=io9|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[golden age of arcade video games]] began with [[Space Invaders]].  As digital technology proliferated, and the switch from analog to digital record keeping became the new standard in business, a relatively new job description was popularized, the [[data entry clerk]].  Culled from the ranks of secretaries and typists from earlier decades, the data entry clerk's job was to convert analog data (customer records, invoices, etc.) into digital data.

=== 1980s ===

In developed nations, computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools, homes, business, and industry.  [[Automated teller machines]], [[industrial robots]], [[CGI animation|CGI]] in film and television, [[electronic music]], [[bulletin board systems]], and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s.  Millions of people purchased home computers, making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such as Apple, Commodore, and Tandy.  To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time, having sold 17 million units (by some accounts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=547|title=How many Commodore 64 computers were really sold?|work=pagetable.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1982 and 1994.

In 1984, the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting data on computer and Internet use in the United States; their first survey showed that 8.2% of all U.S. households owned a personal computer in 1984, and that households with children under the age of 18 were nearly twice as likely to own one at 15.3% (middle and upper middle class households were the most likely to own one, at 22.9%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/files/1984/p23-155.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, 15% of all U.S. households owned a computer, and nearly 30% of households with children under the age of 18 owned one.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/files/1989/p23-171.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1980s, many businesses were dependent on computers and digital technology.

Motorola created the first mobile phone, [[Motorola DynaTac]], in 1983.  However, this device used analog communication -  digital cell phones were not sold commercially until 1991 when the [[2G]] network started to be opened in [[Finland]] to accommodate the unexpected demand for cell phones that was becoming apparent in the late 1980s.

[[Compute!]] magazine predicted that [[CD-ROM]] would be the centerpiece of the revolution, with multiple household devices reading the discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true [[digital camera]] was created in 1988, and the first were marketed in December 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digicamhistory.com/1988.html|title=1988|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-2000s, they would eclipse traditional film in popularity.

[[Digital ink and paint|Digital ink]] was also invented in the late 1980s. Disney's CAPS system (created 1988) was used for a scene in 1989's [[The Little Mermaid]] and for all their animation films between 1990's [[The Rescuers Down Under]] and 2004's Home On The Range.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[World Wide Web]] in 1989.

=== 1990s ===

The first public digital [[HDTV]] broadcast was of the [[1990 World Cup]] that June; it was played in 10 theaters in Spain and Italy. However HDTV did not become a standard until the mid-2000s outside Japan.

The [[World Wide Web]] became publicly accessible in 1991, which had been available only to government and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/08/06/20-years-ago-today-the-world-wide-web-opened-to-the-public/|title=20 years ago today, the World Wide Web was born - TNW Insider|date=6 August 2011|author=Martin Bryant|work=The Next Web|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]] introduced [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], the first web browser capable of displaying inline images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/background1/events/www.html|title=The World Wide Web|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the basis for later browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer.  The [[Internet]] expanded quickly, and by 1996, it was part of [[mass culture]] and many businesses listed websites in their ads. By 1999 almost every country had a connection, and nearly half of [[United States|Americans]] and people in several other countries used the [[Internet]] on a regular basis. However throughout the 1990s, "getting online" entailed complicated configuration, and [[dial-up]] was the only connection type affordable by individual users; the present day mass [[Internet culture]] was not possible.

In 1989 about 15% of all households in the [[United States]] owned a personal computer, by 2000, this was up to 51%;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p23-208.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for households with children nearly 30% owned a computer in 1989, and in 2000 65% owned one.

=== 2000s ===

[[Cell phones]] became as ubiquitous as computers by the early 2000s, with movie theaters beginning to show ads telling people to silence their phones. They also became [[smartphones|much more advanced]] than phones of the 1990s, most of which only took calls or at most allowed for the playing of simple games.

[[Text messaging]] existed in the 1990s but was not widely used until the early 2000s, when it became a cultural phenomenon.

The digital revolution became truly global in this time as well - after revolutionizing society in the [[developed world]] in the 1990s, the digital revolution spread to the masses in the [[developing world]] in the 2000s.

In late 2005 the population of the [[Internet]] reached 1 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1003975|title=One Billion People Online!|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022105426/http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1003975|archive-date=22 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3 billion people worldwide used cell phones by the end of the decade. [[HDTV]] became the standard television broadcasting format in many countries by the end of the decade.

=== 2010s ===

By 2012, over 2 billion people used the Internet, twice the number using it in 2007. [[Cloud computing]] had entered the mainstream by the early 2010s. By 2015, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphones]] were expected to exceed personal computers in Internet usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/239870/tablets_phones_to_surpass_pcs_for_internet_use_in_four_years.html Tablets, Phones to Surpass PCs for Internet Use in Four Years.] PCWorld.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, half of the world's population was connected.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet Users Statistics and 2014 World Population Stats|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Analog to digital transition.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Analog to digital transition 1986 - 2014]]

In the late 1980s, less than 1% of the world's technologically stored information was in digital format, while it was 94% in 2007, with more than 99% by 2014.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], especially [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/02/08/science.1200970.DC1/Hilbert-SOM.pdf Supporting online material], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: http://www.martinhilbert.net/worldinfocapacity-html/&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2002 is estimated to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital, than in analog format (the "beginning of the [[digital age]]").&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo|title=World_info_capacity_animation|first=|last=Martin Hilbert|date=11 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the world's capacity to store information has increased from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, to some 5,000 [[exabytes]] in 2014 (5 [[zettabytes]]).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/38f4b791 Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds], {{doi|10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013}}, Gillings, M.

* Analog weighing scale to digital [[weighing scale]]

== Technological basis ==

Underlying the digital revolution was the [[History of computing hardware|development of the digital electronic computer]], the [[personal computer]], and particularly the [[microprocessor]] with its steadily increasing performance (as described by [[Moore's law]]), which enabled computer technology to be [[Embedded system|embedded]] into a huge range of objects from [[Digital photography|cameras]] to [[Digital audio player|personal music players]]. Equally important was the development of transmission technologies including [[computer network]]ing, the [[Internet]] and [[Digital audio broadcasting|digital broadcasting]]. [[3G phones]], whose social penetration grew exponentially in the 2000s, also played a very large role in the digital revolution as they simultaneously provide ubiquitous entertainment, communications, and online connectivity.

== Socio-economic impact ==

Positive aspects include greater interconnectedness, easier communication, and the exposure of information that in the past could have more easily been suppressed by [[totalitarian]] regimes. [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his books [[Physics of the Future]] that the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Soviet coup of 1991]] was due largely to the existence of technology such as the [[fax machine]] and computers that exposed classified information.

The [[Revolutions of 2011]] were enabled by social networking and smartphone technology; however these revolutions in hindsight largely failed to reach their goals as hardcore Islamist governments and in Syria a [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]] have formed in the absence of the dictatorships that were toppled.

The economic impact of the digital revolution has been large. Without the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), for example, [[globalization]] and [[outsourcing]] would not be nearly as feasible as they are today. The digital revolution radically changed the way individuals and companies interact. Small regional companies were suddenly given access to much larger markets. Concepts such as [[Software as a service|On-demand]] services and manufacturing and rapidly dropping technology costs made possible innovations in all aspects of industry and everyday life.

After initial concerns of an IT [[productivity paradox]], evidence is mounting that digital technologies have significantly increased the productivity and performance of businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=290325|title=Computing Productivity: Firm-Level Evidence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative effects include [[information overload]], Internet predators, forms of social isolation, and media saturation. In a poll of prominent members of the national news media, 65 percent said the Internet is hurting journalism more than it is helping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/04/media-insiders-say-internet-hurts-journalism/307410/|title=Media Insiders Say Internet Hurts Journalism|author=Cyra Master|date=10 April 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by allowing anyone no matter how amateur and unskilled to become a journalist; causing information to be muddier and the rise of [[conspiracy theory]] in a way it didn't exist in the past.

In some cases, company employees' pervasive use of portable digital devices and work related computers for personal use—email, instant messaging, computer games—were often found to, or perceived to, reduce those companies' productivity. Personal computing and other non-work related digital activities in the workplace thus helped lead to stronger forms of privacy invasion, such as keystroke recording and information filtering applications ([[spyware]] and [[content-control software]]).

=== Information sharing and privacy ===

[[Privacy]] in general became a concern during the digital revolution. The ability to store and utilize such large amounts of diverse information opened possibilities for tracking of individual activities and interests. [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] and privacy rights advocates feared the possibility of an [[Orwellian]] future where centralized power structures control the populace via automatic surveillance and monitoring of personal information in such programs as the CIA's [[Information Awareness Office]].&lt;ref&gt;John Markoff (22 November 2002). "Pentagon Plans a Computer System That Would Peek at Personal Data of Americans". ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer and labor advocates opposed the ability to direct market to individuals, discriminate in hiring and lending decisions, invasively monitor employee behavior and communications and generally profit from involuntarily shared personal information.

The [[Internet]], especially the [[WWW]] in the 1990s, opened whole new avenues for communication and information sharing. The ability to easily and rapidly share information on a global scale brought with it a whole new level of [[freedom of speech]]. Individuals and organizations were suddenly given the ability to publish on any topic, to a global audience, at a negligible cost, particularly in comparison to any previous communication technology.

Large cooperative projects could be endeavored (e.g. [[Open-source software]] projects, [[SETI@home]]). Communities of like-minded individuals were formed (e.g. [[MySpace]], [[Tribe.net]]). Small regional companies were suddenly given access to a larger marketplace.

In other cases, special interest groups as well as social and religious institutions found much of the content objectionable, even dangerous. Many parents and religious organizations, especially in the United States, became alarmed by [[pornography]] being more readily available to minors. In other circumstances the proliferation of information on such topics as child pornography, building bombs, committing acts of terrorism, and other violent activities were alarming to many different groups of people. Such concerns contributed to arguments for censorship and regulation on the WWW.

=== Copyright and trademark issues ===
{{main|File sharing and the law}}

[[Copyright]] and [[trademark]] issues also found new life in the digital revolution. The widespread ability of consumers to produce and distribute exact reproductions of protected works dramatically changed the intellectual property landscape, especially in the music, film, and television industries.

The digital revolution, especially regarding privacy, copyright, censorship and information sharing, remains a controversial topic. As the digital revolution progresses it remains unclear to what extent society has been impacted and will be altered in the future.

== Concerns ==

While there have been huge benefits to society from the digital revolution, especially in terms of the accessibility of information, there are a number of concerns. Expanded powers of communication and information sharing, increased capabilities for existing technologies,  and the advent of new technology brought with it many potential opportunities for exploitation. The digital revolution helped usher in a new age of [[mass surveillance]], generating a range of new [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] issues. Reliability of data became an issue as information could easily be replicated, but not easily verified. The digital revolution made it possible to store and track facts, articles, statistics, as well as minutiae hitherto unfeasible.

From the perspective of the [[historian]], a large part of human history is known through physical objects from the past that have been found or preserved, particularly in written documents. Digital records are easy to create but also easy to delete and modify. Changes in [[File format|storage formats]] can make recovery of data difficult or near impossible, as can the storage of information on obsolete media for which reproduction equipment is unavailable, and even identifying what such data is and whether it is of interest can be near impossible if it is no longer easily readable, or if there is a large number of such files to identify. Information passed off as authentic research or study must be scrutinized and verified.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

These problems are further compounded by the use of [[digital rights management]] and other [[copy prevention]] technologies which, being designed to only allow the data to be read on specific machines, may well make future [[data recovery]] impossible. The [[Voyager Golden Record]], which is intended to be read by an intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] (perhaps a suitable parallel to a human from the distant future), is recorded in [[analog (signal)|analog]] rather than digital format specifically for easy interpretation and analysis.

{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=Language}}
'''Esperanto etymology''', including [[vocabulary]] and grammatical forms, derives primarily from the [[Romance languages]], with lesser contributions from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. The language occupies a middle ground between "naturalistic" [[constructed language]]s such as [[Interlingua]], which borrow words ''en masse'' from their source languages with little internal derivation, and ''a priori'' conlangs such as [[Solresol]], in which the words have no historical connection to other languages. In Esperanto, [[root word]]s are borrowed and retain much of the form of their source language, whether the phonetic form ''(eks-'' from international ''ex-,'' ''vualo'' from French ''voile)'' or orthographic form ''(teamo'' and ''boato'' from English ''team'' and ''boat,'' ''soifo'' from French ''soif).'' However, each root can then form dozens of derivations which may bear little resemblance to equivalent words in the source languages, such as ''registaro'' (government), which is derived from the Latinate root ''reg'' (to rule) but has a morphology closer to German or Russian.

==Source languages==
Zamenhof took most of his Esperanto root words from languages of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] families, principally Italian, French, German, Yiddish, and English. A large number are what might be called common European international vocabulary, or generic [[Romance languages|Romance]]: Roots common to several languages, such as ''vir-'' "man", found in English words such as ''virile,'' and ''okul-'' "eye", found in ''oculist.'' Some appear to be compromises between the primary languages, such as ''tondri'' (to thunder), per French ''tonner,'' Italian ''tuonare,'' German ''donnern,'' and English ''thunder.''

===Romance and Germanic===
The main languages contributing to Zamenhof's original vocabulary were 
[[French language|French]], [[English language|English]],
and [[German language|German]], the modern languages most widely learned in schools around the world at the time Esperanto was devised. The result was that about two-thirds of this original vocabulary is Romance, and about one-third Germanic, including a pair of roots from Swedish:
:[[Swedish language|Swedish]]: [[Esperanto grammar#Comparisons|Comparative ''the'']] (as in "''the'' more ''the'' merrier") ''ju ... des''. 
A couple of words, ''strato'' (street) and ''gisto'' (yeast), are closer to Dutch ''(straat, gist)'' than German ''(Straße ''[ŝtrasə], ''Gest),'' but this may be a compromise between German and English the way ''ŝtono'' (stone) is a compromise between German ''Stein'' [ŝtajn] and English.  ''Fajro'' (fire) matches the pronunciation of English ''fire,'' but is also spelled and pronounced as Yiddish פֿײַר ''fajr''.  Indeed, much of the supposedly German vocabulary actually appears to be [[Yiddish]], specifically Zamenhof's native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, which had formed the basis of his abortive attempt to standardize that language.  Words with the digraph ''ei'' in German may in Esperanto have either ''ej'' (corresponding to the spelling) or ''aj'' (corresponding to the pronunciation).  This pattern is not random, but reflects ''ei'' and ''ī'' in [[Old High German]], a distinction preserved in Yiddish:  ''hejmo'' 'home' (German ''Heim'', Yiddish הײם ''hejm''),&lt;!-- ref&gt;This is .&lt;/ref --&gt; ''fajfi'' 'whistle' (German ''pfeifen'', Yiddish פֿײַפֿן ''fajfn'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/pau2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Zamenhof never admitted to a Yiddish influence in Esperanto, presumably to avoid arousing antisemitic prejudice.

Many of the Latinate roots were given an [[Italian language|Italianesque]] appearance, corresponding to the use of Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation, but in form are closer to French, such as ''ĉemizo'' 'shirt' (French ''chemise'' [ŝəmiz], Italian ''camicia'' [kamiĉa]) and ''ĉevalo'' 'horse' (French ''cheval'' , Italian ''cavallo'').
A couple of apparently Spanish or Portuguese roots, ''ronki'' (to snore) and ''iri'' (to go), may have come directly from Latin. Since Zamenhof's day, a large amount of Latinate vocabulary has been added to the language. In 1987, Mattos calculated that 84% of basic vocabulary was Latinate, 14% Germanic, and 2% Slavic and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Mattos, Geraldo, "La deveno de Esperanto", ''Fonto'' 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin and Greek===
Only a few roots were taken directly from the classical languages:

:[[Latin]]: ''sed'' (but), ''tamen'' (however), ''post'' (after), ''kvankam'' (although), ''kvazaŭ'' (as though), ''dum'' (during), ''nek'' (nor), ''aŭ'' (or), ''hodiaŭ'' (today), ''abio'' (fir), ''ardeo'' (heron), ''iri'' (to go—though this form survives in the French future), ''ronki'' (to snore), ''prujno'' (frost), the [[adverb]]ial suffix ''-e,'' and perhaps the [[infinitive]] suffix ''-i.'' Many lexical affixes are common to several languages and thus may not have clear sources, but some such as ''-inda'' (worthy of), ''-ulo'' (a person), ''-um-'' (undefined), and ''-op-'' (a number together) may be Latin.

:[[Greek language|Classical Greek]]: ''kaj'' (and, from ''και kai), pri'' (about, from ''περι peri),'' the [[plural]] suffix ''-j,'' the [[accusative case]] suffix ''-n,'' the [[inceptive]] prefix ''ek-'', the suffix ''-ido'' (offspring), and perhaps the [[Esperanto grammar#Verbs|jussive mood]] suffix ''-u'' (if not [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).

As in the examples of ''ardeo'' 'heron' and ''abio'' 'fir', the names of most plants and animals are based on their [[binomial nomenclature]], and so many are Latin or Greek as well.

===Slavic and Lithuanian===
Surprisingly few roots appear to have come from other modern European languages, even those Zamenhof was most familiar with. What follows is a fairly comprehensive list of such roots that do not also occur in principal languages:

:[[Russian language|Russian]]: ''barakti'' (to flounder, from ''барахтаться barahtat'sja), gladi'' (to iron, from ''гладить gladit'), kartavi'' (to pronounce a [[guttural R]], from ''кapтaвить kartavit'), deĵori'' (to be on duty, from ''дежурить dezhyrit'), kolbaso'' (a sausage, from ''колбаса kolbasa), krom'' (except, from ''кроме krome), kruta'' (steep, from ''крутой krutoj), nepre'' (without fail, from ''непременно nepremenno), vosto'' (a tail, from ''хвост hvost),'' the [[nickname|pet-name]] suffixes ''-ĉjo'' and ''-njo'' (from ''-чка -čka'' and ''-нька -n'ka)'', the augmentative suffix ''-eg-'' (from ''-яга -jaga)'', and perhaps the collective suffix ''-aro,'' if this is not from Latin.

:[[Polish language|Polish]]: ''barĉo'' ([[borscht]], from ''barszcz), ĉu'' (whether, from ''czy,'' perhaps also Yiddish ''tsu), eĉ'' (even, from ''jeszcze), krado'' (a grating, from ''krata), luti'' (to solder, from ''lutować), [via] moŝto'' ([your] highness, from ''mość), ol'' (than, possibly from ''od), pilko'' (a ball, from ''piłka), ŝelko'' (suspenders, from ''szelki)''

:Russian or Polish: ''bulko'' (a bread roll, from ''bułka / булка bulka), celo'' (an aim, goal, from ''cel / цель tsel'), kaĉo'' (porridge, from ''kasza / каша kaša), klopodi'' (to undertake, from ''kłopot / хлопотать khlopotat'), po'' (per, from ''po / по po), pra-'' (proto-, from ''pra- / пра- pra-), prava'' (right [in opinion], from ''prawy / правый pravyj), svati'' (to matchmake, from ''swat / сват svat)''

:[[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: ''tuj'' (immediately, from ''tuoj);'' possibly also the suffix ''-ope'' (a number together), ''du'' (two, from ''du,'' if not from Latin ''duo),'' and ''ĝi'' (it, from ''ji, jis)''

However, although few roots come directly from these languages, Russian exerted a considerable [[substratum]] influence on the [[semantics]] of Esperanto. An oft-cited example is ''plena'' "full, complete", which is Latinate in form (French ''plein(e),'' Latin ''plen-'' "full"), but has the semantic range of Russian ''полный polnyi'' "full, complete", as can be seen in the phrase ''plena vortaro'' "a complete dictionary", a usage not possible with the French or Latin words.

=== Other languages ===
Other languages were only represented in the original vocabulary in so far as they were cognate with, or as their words had become widespread in, Esperanto's source languages. However, since that time many languages have contributed words for specialized or regional concepts, such as ''haŝio'' ([[chopsticks]]) from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and ''boaco'' ([[reindeer]]) from [[Saami language|Saami]].

=== Obscure roots ===
A few roots are obscure:

:''ĝi'' (it, [[Wiktionary:s/he|s/he]]), ''-ujo'' (suffix for containers), ''edzo'' (husband)

''Ĝi'' may possibly derive from the Lithuanian ''ji'' (she, it) and ''jis'' (he, it),&lt;ref&gt;Vilborg&lt;/ref&gt; and ''-ujo'' from the French ''étui'' (case).&lt;ref&gt;Floriano Pessoa, 2005, ''Etimologio: Skizo pri la deveno de la vortoj de Esperanto''[http://www.npoint.com.br/sementeira/prelego15.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like another indirect German borrowing, ''fraŭlo'' (bachelor), which derives from ''fraŭlino'' ([[Miss]], from "fräulein") less the feminine suffix ''-in-'', ''edzo'' appears to be a [[back-formation]] of ''edzino'' (wife). Zamenhof said the latter derives from ''kronprincedzino'' (crown princess), borrowed from the German ''Kronprinzessin,'' and then internally analyzed as ''kron-'' (crown) ''princ-'' (prince) ''edzino'' (wife).[http://www.esperanto.org/Ondo/L-lr.htm#06etimologio]  However, Vilborg's ''Etimologia Vortaro'' argues that ''edzino'' is more likely to have come from [[Yiddish]] רביצין ''[[rebbetzin]]'' (rabbi's wife, Mrs.), reanalysed as ''rebb-etzin,'' and that Zamenhof made up the German etymology after the fact to avoid anti-Semitic prejudice against Esperanto. That would mean that ''edz-'' ultimately derives from the Slavic feminine suffix ''-its(a).'' Regardless, few words have histories this convoluted.

The [[Esperanto vocabulary#Correlatives|correlatives]], although clearly cognate with European languages (for example, ''kiel, tiel'' with French ''quel'' (which), ''tel'' (such); ''ĉiu'' with Italian ''ciascun'' (each), and ''-es'' with the German genitive ''-es,'' etc.), have been [[Analogy#Linguistics|analogically leveled]] to the point that they are often given as examples of Esperanto innovations. This is especially true for the indefinite forms like ''io'' (something), which were devised by [[iconicity|iconically]] removing the consonant of the ''ki-'' and ''ti-'' forms. Likewise, the restriction of the Italian and Greek masculine noun and adjective ending ''-o'' to nouns, and the feminine noun and adjective ending ''-a'' to adjectives and the article ''la,'' is an Esperanto innovation using existing forms.&lt;ref&gt;For speakers of Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese, it may at first be jarring that Esperanto has the endings ''-o'' and ''-a'' of those languages, but assigns them to differentiate nouns from adjectives rather than masculine from feminine. However, there are parallels within Romance.  In [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], for example, feminine nouns end in ''-o'' but take the article ''la'': Provençal ''la fenestro'' (the window), Esperanto ''la fenestro;'' Provençal ''la vido'' (life), Esperanto ''la vivo;'' Provençal ''la roso'' [la rozo] (the rose), Esperanto ''la rozo;'' Provençal ''la voio'' (the road), Esperanto ''la vojo;'' Provençal ''la amigo'' (the girlfriend), Esperanto ''la amikino;'' etc.  Even in Spanish and Italian, there are words with this pattern:  ''la mano'' (the hand), ''la foto'' (the photo), ''la radio'' (the radio), ''la dinamo'' (the generator), etc., are common to Esperanto, Spanish, and Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some smaller words have been modified to the extent that they're difficult to recognize. For example, Italian ''a, ad'' (to) became ''al'' (to) under the influence of the contraction ''al'' (to the), to better fit the phonotactics of the language, and in a parallel change, Latin ''ex'' (out of) and Slavic ''od'' (by, than) may have become ''el'' (out of) and ''ol'' (than), though the latter also has the German parallel ''als''.

==Inflections ==
The Greek origin of the nominal inflections can be seen in the Greek ''a''-[[declension]] nouns such as the word for "[[muse]]": ''musa,'' plural ''musa'''i''','' accusative ''musa'''n''','' which in Esperanto is ''muzo, muzo'''j''', muzo'''n'''.'' Greek ''o''-declension words such as ''logos, logo'''i''', logo'''n''''' (word) are similar, as are adjectival declensions such as ''aksia, aksia'''i''', aksia'''n''''' (worthy). Greek was perhaps also the model of stressed ''i'' in Esperanto words like ''familío'' (family), which follows the common Greek pattern of ''aksía'' (worthy) and ''oikíai'' (houses).

Esperanto has ''a/i/o'' [[ablaut]] for present/past/future tense, which has partial parallels in Latin present ''am'''a'''t,'' perfect ''amav'''i'''t,'' and the corresponding infinitives ''am'''a'''re, amav'''i'''sse.'' [[Otto Jespersen]] said of the ablaut,

:This play of vowels is not an original idea of Zamenhof's: ''-as, -is, -os'' are found for the three tenses of the infinitive in [[Langue nouvelle|Faiguet's system of 1765]]; ''-a, -i, -o'' without a consonant are used like Z's ''-as, -is, -os'' by Rudelle (1858); Courtonne in 1885 had ''-am, -im, -om'' in the same values, and the similarity with Esperanto is here even more perfect than in the other projects, as ''-um'' corresponds to Z's ''-us.'' —[http://www.oocities.org/athens/Forum/5037/AILverb.html An International Language (1928)]

There may have been a Volapük influence as well, or the two languages may have shared a common influence from earlier languages.  In Volapük, the vowels are present ''a-'', future ''o-'', past perfect ''i-'', as well as imperfect ''ä-'' {{IPA|[ɛ]}}; Esperanto retained a distinction between preterite ''-is'' and imperfect ''-es'' until 1887, the year the modern form of the language was published.&lt;ref&gt;Christer Kiselman, 2010. 'Variantoj de esperanto iniciatitaj de Zamenhof'. In [http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/havanouea.pdf ''Esperanto: komenco, aktualo kaj estonteco''], UEA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jespersen didn't parse all of the morphology.&lt;ref&gt;The infinitive ''-s'' in Faiguet drops in the indicative, leaving a simple vowel, and the ''-m'' in Courtonne is the first-person-singular suffix.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ablaut for the five languages is as follows:

The infinitive suffix ''-i'' may derive from Latin [[deponent verb]]s, such as ''loqui'' (to speak). With elements like these that are only one or two letters long, it is difficult to know whether resemblances are due to the forms being related, or just coincidence. For example, it is speculated that the jussive ''-u'' is from the Hebrew imperative ''-û,'' but it could also be from the Greek [u] imperative of deponent verbs such as ''dekhou'' (receive!); or perhaps it was inspired by [u] being found in both Hebrew and Greek. Similarly, adverbial ''-e'' is found in Latin and Italian ''(bene)'' as well as in Russian (after a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonant); the participle bases ''-t-'' and ''-nt-'' are found in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German; and the pronominal base ''-i'' is found in Italian (''-mi, -ti, -vi, -si, -gli'' for Esperanto ''mi, ci, vi, si, li'') and English (''me, we, he, she'').

==Technical vocabulary==

Modern international vocabulary, much of it Latin or Greek in origin, is of course used as well, but frequently for a family of related words only the root will be borrowed directly, and the rest will be derived from it using [[#Word formation|Esperanto means of word formation]]. For example, the computer term 'bit' was borrowed directly as ''bito'', but 'byte' was then derived by compounding ''bito'' with the numeral ''ok'' (eight), for the uniquely Esperanto word ''bitoko'' ('an octet of bits'). Although not a familiar form to speakers of European languages, the transparency of its formation is helpful to those who do not have this advantage. Moreover, even ''bito'' has the synonym ''duumo'', based on ''du'' (two) and ''-um-'' (the affix with undefined meaning).

With the exception of perhaps a hundred common or generic plant and animal names, Esperanto adopts the international [[binomial nomenclature]] of living organisms, using suitable orthography, and changing the nominal and adjectival grammatical endings to ''-o'' and ''-a''. For example, the binomial for the [[Helmeted Guineafowl|guineafowl]] is ''Numida meleagris''. In Esperanto, therefore, a ''numido'' would be any bird of the genus ''Numida'', and a ''meleagra numido'' the helmeted guineafowl specifically. Likewise, a ''numidedo'' is any bird in the guineafowl family [[Guineafowl|Numididæ]].

==Competing root forms==

There is some question over which [[inflection]] to use when assimilating Latin and Greek words. Zamenhof generally preferred the oblique stem over the nominative singular form, as in ''reĝo'' (king), which follows the Latin oblique forms with ''reg–'' (compare English ''regicide''), or ''floro'' (flower) as in ''floral,'' rather than nominative singular ''rex'' and ''flos.'' However, European national standards differ in this regard, resulting in debate over the form of later "international" borrowings, such as whether the [[asteroid]] [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] should be ''Palaso'' in Esperanto, parallel to French and English names ''Pallas,'' or ''Palado,'' as in Italian ''Pallade,'' Russian ''Паллада'' (''Palláda''), and the English adjective ''Palladian.'' In some cases there are three possibilities, as can be seen in the English noun ''helix'' (''x'' = [ks]), its plural ''helices'' (''c'' = [s]), and its adjective ''helical'' (''c'' = [k]). Although the resulting potential for conflict is frequently criticized, it does present an opportunity to disambiguate what would otherwise be [[homonym]]s based on culturally specific and often fossilized [[metaphor]]s. For example, all three of the forms of Latin ''helix'' are found as Esperanto roots, one with the original meaning, and the other two representing old metaphors: ''helico'' (a spiral), ''heliko'' (a snail), ''helikso'' (the incurved rim of the ear).

Normally the Latin or Greek inflectional ending is replaced with the Esperanto inflectional ending ''−o.'' However, the original inflection will occasionally be retained, as if it were part of the root, in order to disambiguate from a more common word. For example, a virus (from Latin ''vir-us)'' is ''virus-o'' instead of the expected ''*vir-o'' in order to avoid confusion with ''vir-o'' (a man), and the Latin root ''corp-us'' is the source of both ''korp-o'' (a living body) and ''korpus-o'' (a military corps). Similarly, when the sound ''ĥ'' is replaced with ''k,'' as it commonly is (see [[Esperanto phonology]]), the word ''ĥoro'' (a chorus) is replaced with ''koruso'' to avoid creating a homonym with ''koro'' (a heart). The redundant inflection may have been inspired by Lithuanian, which otherwise contributed relatively little to Esperanto: compare ''fokuso'' (focus), ''kokoso'' (coconut), ''lotuso'' (lotus), ''patoso'' (pathos), ''radiuso'' (radius), ''sinuso'' (sine), and ''viruso'' (virus), with Lithuanian ''fokusas, kokosas, lotosas, patosas, radiusas, sinusas,'' and ''virusas'' (virus) vs. ''vyras'' (man).

==Traces of Proto-Esperanto==
[[Proto-Esperanto]] had voicing ablaut, traces of which remain in a few pairs of words such as ''pezi'' 'to weigh' (to have weight) and ''pesi'' 'to weigh' (to measure the weight).  Because little of Proto-Esperanto has survived, it is not clear which other aspects of Esperanto etymology might date to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Kiselman (2010:64–65)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugène Lefèvre-Pontalis''' ({{date|1862-02-12}} – {{date|1923-10-31}}) was a French [[medievalist]] and [[archeologist]].

Following his studies at the ''[[Lycée Condorcet]]'', in 1881 he entered the [[École Nationale des Chartes]], where he wrote a thesis on religious architecture in the former Diocese of [[Soissons]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. During his studies, he worked at the Mazarine Library and apprenticed with Alphonse Simil, an architect in the Commission des Monuments historiques.

In 1894, he became assistant in medieval archaeology at the ''École Nationale des Chartes''. In 1911 he became the professor.

In 1911, he became president of the ''Société française d’archéologie'' and, in 1916, of the ''Société nationale des antiquaires''. He founded the ''Société des amis de la cathédrale de Reims'' to help restore the [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]] after World War I.

At his death, he gave his {{formatnum:14000}} photographs to the ''Société française d’archéologie''.

The '''European Association of Historic Towns and Regions''' ('''EAHTR'''), founded by the [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] in October 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc01/eDOC9025.htm "Europe a common heritage", Document 9025 of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606233538/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc01/eDOC9025.htm |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-governing organisation which groups together twelve associations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptuj.si/API/download.php?fid=854 PowerPoint presentation by Brian Smith on the Ptuj City website, presented in Ptuj, September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Historic Towns Forum of Great Britain, from eleven states, namely the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Malta]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United Kingdom]], which claims to represent over 1,000 of Europe's historic towns. 

It has the status of a [[company under English law]]. According to its constitution (available on the website): "The European Association of Historic Towns and Regions was incorporated on 8th April 2002 under the law of England and Wales as a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital. The company registration number is 4411400."

It defines its principal objective as 'the identification and sharing of experience and good practice in the sustainable urban conservation and management of historic areas through international collaboration and co-operation between towns and cities and other involved organisations'. 

EAHTR is based in [[Norwich]], [[England]]. The President, since 1999, is [[Louis Roppe]] (Belgium) and the Secretary-General, since 1999, is Brian Smith (UK). According to its website, the last annual report was issued in 2006 and the last newsletter in 2003. It has participated in several Council of Europe conferences. The website exists in English only.

'''''Euzko Gudarostea''''' (modern spelling: '''''Eusko Gudarostea''''', "Basque army") was the name of the army commanded by the [[Basque Government]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. It was formed by [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]], socialists, communists and anarchists under the direction of ''[[list of Lehendakaris|lehendakari]]'' [[José Antonio Aguirre (politician)|José Antonio Aguirre]] and coordinating with the [[Spanish Republican Army|army]] of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. It fought the troops of [[Francisco Franco]] during 1936 and 1937.
It surrendered to the Italian [[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]] at [[Santoña]] ([[Cantabria|province of Cantabria]]), while the rest of the Republican army kept fighting until 1939. This event is called the Santoña Agreement, Pact of Santoña, or [[Santoña Agreement|Treason of Santoña]] by some Spanish leftists.

==Gudari==
The [[Basques|Basque]] word for a soldier, ''gudari'' (plural ''gudariak''), is a neologism (from ''guda'', "war", thus meaning "warrior" literally). The Standard Basque word is the Romance-derived ''soldadu''.&lt;ref name="Hiztegia 3000"&gt;[http://www1.euskadi.net/hizt_3000/ Hiztegia 3000].&lt;/ref&gt;
Like other [[Basque nationalist]] neologisms (''[[ikurriña]]'', ''[[lendakari]]''&lt;!-- sic! Those are the spellings of that time. --&gt;), the meaning of ''gudari'' has been restricted to Basque concepts.
The Basque word for an army is the Romance-derived ''armada''.

[[File:ArmaTiroPumEtaMilikiliklik26 8.jpg|thumb|Members of ETA shoot salvoes in the ''Gudari Eguna''.]]
The members of the Basque militant [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] consider themselves ''gudariak'' continuing the struggle of the Civil War Basque soldiers.
This is contested by those war veterans that support the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV), [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] or [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party]].

The ''Gudari Eguna'' ("warrior day") is thus celebrated separately:

[[File:Hatchment.JPG|thumb|right|Funerary hatchment at [[Grendon, Northamptonshire|Grendon]] parish church, showing in the dexter half the arms of Compton, [[Marquess of Northampton]]]]
A '''funerary hatchment''' is a depiction within a black [[lozenge]]-shaped frame, generally on a black (''[[Tincture (heraldry)|sable]]'') background, of a deceased's [[Achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]], that is to say  the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] showing the [[Heraldry|arms]], together with the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[supporter]]s of his  family or person. Regimental Colours and other military or naval emblems are sometimes placed behind the arms of military or naval officers.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hatchment |volume=13 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such funerary hatchments, generally therefore restricted in use to members of the nobility or armigerous gentry, used to be hung on the wall of a deceased person's house,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and were later transferred to the parish church, often within the family chapel therein which appertained to the [[manor house]], the family occupying which, generally being [[lord of the manor]], generally held the [[advowson]] of the church. In Germany, the approximate equivalent is a [[:Category:Totenschilden|Totenschild]], literally "death shield".

==Etymology==
"Hatchment" is a corruption (through such historic forms as ''atcheament, achement, hathement'', etc.)&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; of the French ''achevèment'',&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb ''achever'', a contraction of ''a chef venir'' ("to come to a head"), ultimately from Latin ''ad caput venire'', "to come to a head",&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise, Paris, 1979: lat. pop. ''capum'', class. ''caput''&lt;/ref&gt; thus to reach a conclusion, accomplish, achieve.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word in its historical usage is thus identical in meaning and origin to the English heraldic term [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]. However in recent years the word "hatchment" has come to be used almost exclusively to denote "funerary hatchment", whilst "achievement" is now used in place of "hatchment" in a non-funereal context. An example of the historic use of "hatchment" in a non-funerary context is in the statute of the [[Order of the Garter]] laid down by King Henry VIII (1509-1547) concerning the regulation of [[Garter stall plate]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Horace Round|Round, J. Horace]], Family Origins and Other Studies, Page, William, (ed.), London, 1930, pp.174-189, The Garter Plates and Peerage Styles, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is agreed that every knyght within the yere of his stallation shall cause to be made a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|scauchon]] of his armes and [[Achievement (heraldry)|hachementis]] in a plate of metall suche as shall please him and that it shall be surely sett upon the back of his stall".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The word appears in [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1599/1602): Laertes laments that his dead father Polonius has "No trophy, sword or hatchment o'er his bones" (Act IV, Scene 5).

==Usage==

===England===
[[File:Coat-of-arms of Sir Thomas Spring, 3rd Baronet.jpg|thumb|right|The funerary hatchment of [[Spring baronets|Sir Thomas Spring, 3rd Baronet]] (1672-1704), displayed in [[Lavenham]] Guildhall]]
[[File:Hatchment 7.jpg|thumb|Hatchment in [[Wymondham Abbey]] bell chamber]]
[[File:Bruxelles Saint-Jacques sur Coudenberg 904.jpg|thumb|Royal hatchments in Brussels]]
The funerary hatchment was usually placed over the entrance door of the deceased's residence at the level of the second floor, and remained ''in situ'' for six to twelve months, after which it was removed to the parish church.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The practice developed in the early 17th century from the custom of carrying an heraldic shield before the coffin of the deceased, then leaving it for display in the church. Funerary hatchments also survive displayed in homes or local museums. In medieval times and later, helmets and shields were sometimes deposited in churches, and helmets (made for the purpose) survive for example in the churches of [[Iron Acton]] in Gloucestershire and [[King's Nympton]] in Devon.

At the universities of [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]] it was usual to hang the funerary hatchment of a deceased head of house over the entrance to his lodge or residence.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the 21st century the display of funerary hatchments has  largely been discontinued, except in the case of royalty and occasionally by the higher nobility, but many ancient funerary hatchments survive displayed in parish churches throughout [[England]].

====Male and female usages====
For a bachelor the hatchment bears his heraldic achievement (shield, crest, supporters and other appendages) on a black lozenge. For a [[spinster]], her arms are represented upon a lozenge, bordered with knotted ribbons, also on a black lozenge.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In the case of a married man  with a surviving wife, within his funerary hatchment is an escutcheon displaying his arms [[Impalement (heraldry)|impale]] the paternal arms of his wife. If she should be an [[heraldic heiress]] her paternal arms are placed upon an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]], and crest and other appendages are added.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] half of the background is black (the husband being dead), whilst the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] half of the background is white&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (his wife still being alive).

For a deceased woman whose husband is alive the same arrangement is used, but the sinister background is black (for the wife) and the dexter background is white (for the surviving husband). For a widower the same is used as for a married man, but the whole ground is black (both spouses being dead). For a widow the husband's arms are given with her own, but upon a lozenge in place of an escutcheon, with ribbons, without crest or appendages, with the whole of the ground black. When there have been two wives or two husbands the ground may be divided in a number of different ways.  Sometimes the shield is divided into three parts ''per pale'' (vertical divisions), with the husband's arms in the middle section and the arms of each of his wives to each side of his.  Sometimes the husband's arms remain in the dexter half and the two wives have their arms in the sinister half, divided ''per fess'' (horizontal divisions), each wife having one quarter of the whole shield, that is one half of the sinister half.

===Scotland===
In Scottish funerary hatchments it was not unusual to place the arms of the father and mother of the deceased in the two lateral angles of the lozenge, and sometimes there are 4, 8 or 16 [[genealogy|genealogical]] escutcheons ranged along the margin.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Belgium and Netherlands===
In the Netherlands hatchments (in Dutch, ''rouwbord'', literally meaning "mourning shield") with the word "OBIIT" (Latin:"deceased") and the date of death were hung over the door of the deceased's house and later on the wall of the church where he was buried. In the 17th century the hatchments were sober black lozenge-shaped frames with the coat of arms. In the 18th century both the frames and the heraldry got more and more elaborate. Symbols of death like batwings, skulls, hour-glasses and crying angels with torches were added and the names of the 8, 16 or even 32 armigerous forebearers (sometimes an invention, there were a lot of "nouveaux riches") and their genealogical escutcheons were displayed. The British tradition of differentiating between the hatchments of bachelors, widowers and others is unknown in the Low Countries. The arms of a widow are sometimes surrounded by a cordelière (knotted cord) and the arms of women are often, but not always, shaped like a lozenge. There were no Kings of Arms to rule and regulate these traditions.

In 1795 the Dutch republic, recently conquered by revolutionary France, issued a decree that banned all heraldic shields. Thousands of hatchments were chopped to pieces and burned. In the 19th century the hatchments were almost forgotten and only a few noble families kept the tradition alive.

In Flanders, the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church have kept the tradition of putting up hatchments alive to this day. Noble families have continued to put up hatchments in churches.

Unlike the British hatchments the Dutch and Belgian examples are often inscribed with dates of birth and death, often the [[Latin]] words "obit", "nascent" and "svea" are used to give the dates of death and birth and the age of the deceased. The name and titles are sometimes added along with the arms of various ancestors.

Sometimes the coats of arms of man and woman are shown on a hatchment.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Scotland==

Only about fifty hatchments still exist in Scotland, unlike the many to be found in England and the [[Netherlands]], where there may well be more Scots hatchments surviving than in Scotland. Part of this is undoubtedly due to the [[Church of Scotland]] in the mid 17th century. In 1643 the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] passed an Act in 1643 which prohibited 'Honours of Arms or any such like monuments' to be displayed in any church. A surviving document of [[Huntly|Strathbogie]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] records that: "Att Grange, 19th December, 1649... the presbytry finding some pinselis in memorie of the dead hinging in the kirk, presentlie caused them to be pulled doun in face of presbytry, and the minister rebuiked for suffering to hing ther so long."

Scots hatchments do not follow in the sparse pattern that modern writers prescribe for hatchments and funeral heraldry, being sometimes quite highly decorated with the coats of antecedents and with tears, skulls (mort heads) and mantles.

Hatchments, and funeral heraldry in general, are discussed in a 1986 article by [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles J Burnett]], [[Dingwall Pursuivant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Burnett, C. J.]], "Funeral heraldry in Scotland with particular reference to hatchments" in ''The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'' 116 (1986), pp 473–559 [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/library/psas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
There are eight hatchments in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, which are located in [[St. Paul's Church (Halifax)]]. They include:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==South Africa==
[[File:Grootekerk.jpg|thumb|Some of the rouwborden in the Groote Kerk can be seen on the walls below the gallery to the right of this photo.]]

Twenty-nine 18th- and early 19th-century Dutch-style rouwborden are known to survive in the province of the [[Western Cape]], which was a Dutch colony from 1652 to 1806.  Twenty-five are in the [[Groote Kerk, Cape Town|Groote Kerk]] in Cape Town, one is in the Western Cape Archives, and the other three are in museums.

During the period of Dutch rule, the display of rouwborden was evidently restricted to senior officials and military officers, and a few high-ranking foreign dignitaries who died at the Cape.  When the main part of the church building was demolished in 1836, because it had become structurally unsound, the rouwborden were stored in the tower.  They were left there after the rebuilt church was completed in 1841, and reportedly deteriorated with the passage of time.  Some forty years later, the newly-established Colonial Archives rescued twenty-five of them,&lt;ref name=hcvl&gt;Leibbrandt, H.C.V., ''Rambles through the Archives of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope'' (1886).&lt;/ref&gt; and they were displayed in the Archives until the church reclaimed them in 1910.&lt;ref name=hch&gt;Hopkins, H.C.,  ''Die Moeder van Ons Almal'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  They were then hung in the vestry, and it was not until the 1960s that they were hung in the church itself.

'''Glastonbury''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|t|ən|b|ər|i}}) is a town and [[civil parish]] in [[Somerset]], England, situated at a [[dry point]] on the low-lying [[Somerset Levels]], {{convert|23|mi|km|0}} south of [[Bristol]]. The town, which is in the [[Mendip District|Mendip]] district, had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="popn"&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=1170218013|title=Glastonbury Parish|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glastonbury is less than {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} across the [[River Brue]] from [[Street, Somerset|Street]], which is now larger than Glastonbury.

Evidence from timber trackways such as the [[Sweet Track]] show that the town has been inhabited since [[Neolithic]] times. [[Glastonbury Lake Village]] was an [[Iron Age]] village, close to the old course of the River Brue and [[Sharpham|Sharpham Park]] approximately {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} west of Glastonbury, that dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Centwine of Wessex|Centwine]] was the first Saxon patron of [[Glastonbury Abbey]], which dominated the town for the next 700 years. One of the most important [[abbey]]s in England, it was the site of [[Edmund Ironside]]'s coronation as King of England in 1016. Many of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, including the [[The Tribunal, Glastonbury|Tribunal]], [[George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn, Glastonbury|George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn]] and the [[Somerset Rural Life Museum]], which is based in an old [[tithe barn]], are associated with the abbey. The [[Church of St John the Baptist, Glastonbury|Church of St John the Baptist]] dates from the 15th century.

The town became a centre for commerce, which led to the construction of the [[Glastonbury Market Cross|market cross]], [[Glastonbury Canal]] and the [[Glastonbury and Street railway station]], the largest station on the original [[Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway]]. The [[Brue Valley Living Landscape]] is a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] project managed by the [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]] and nearby is the [[Ham Wall]] [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|National Nature Reserve]].

Glastonbury has been described as a [[New Age communities|New Age community]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prince|first1=Ruth|last2=Riches|first2=David|title=The New Age in Glastonbury: The Construction of Religious Movements|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571817921}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attracts people with [[New Age]] and [[Neopagan]] beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to [[Glastonbury Tor]], concerning [[Joseph of Arimathea]], the [[Holy Grail]] and [[King Arthur]]. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the [[Glastonbury Thorn]]. The presence of a [[landscape zodiac]] around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The [[Glastonbury Festival]], held in the nearby village of [[Pilton, Somerset|Pilton]], takes its name from the town.

==History==
===Prehistory===
During the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys and low-lying ground surrounding Glastonbury so the [[Mesolithic]] people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints.&lt;ref name="somhist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/esaspdfs/stage1/SOMHIST.pdf |title=Historical Monitoring in the Somerset Levels and Moors ESA 1987–1994 |accessdate=10 June 2007 |format=PDF |work=DEFRA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223213/http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/esaspdfs/stage1/SOMHIST.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neolithic]] people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the [[Sweet Track]], west of Glastonbury, which is one of the oldest engineered roads known and was the oldest [[timber trackway]] discovered in Northern Europe, until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in [[Belmarsh (HM Prison)|Belmarsh Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news169297178.html|title=London's earliest timber structure found during Belmarsh prison dig|last=Anon|date=12 August 2009|work=physorg.com News|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=10 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715214221/http://www.physorg.com/news169297178.html|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tree-ring dating ([[dendrochronology]]) of the timbers has enabled very precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The day the Sweet Track was built | work = New Scientist, 16 June 1990 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12617212.800.html | accessdate = 26 October 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709025123/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12617212.800.html | archivedate = 9 July 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world.&lt;ref name="Current_Archaeology_172"&gt;{{cite web | title = Special issue on Wetlands / The Somerset Levels | work=Current Archaeology 172 | publisher=Current Archaeology|date=5 April 2007 | url = http://www.archaeology.co.uk/ca/issues/ca172/ca172.htm | accessdate =26 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070405210503/http://archaeology.co.uk/ca/issues/ca172/ca172.htm |archivedate = 5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was discovered in the course of peat digging in 1970, and is named after its discoverer, Ray Sweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Robin |author2=Williams, Romey |title=The Somerset Levels |year=1992|pages=35–36 |publisher=Ex Libris Press |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0-948578-38-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It extended across the [[marsh]] between what was then an island at [[Westhay]], and a ridge of high ground at [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]], a distance close to {{convert|2000|m|mi}}. The track is one of a network of tracks that once crossed the [[Somerset Levels]].

Since the discovery of the Sweet Track, it has been determined that it was built along the route of an even earlier track, the ''Post Track'', dating from 3838 BC and so 30&amp;nbsp;years older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hill-Cottingham |first1=Pat |last2=Briggs|first2= D.|last3= Brunning|first3= R.|last4= King, |first4=A.|last5= Rix|first5= G |title=The Somerset Wetlands |year=2006 |publisher=Somerset Books |isbn=0-86183-432-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village was built in about 300&amp;nbsp;BC and occupied into the early Roman period (around 100&amp;nbsp;AD) when it was abandoned, possibly due to a rise in the water level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins |first=Lesley |author2=Roy Adkins |title=A field guide to Somerset archeology |year=1992 |publisher=Dovecote Press |location=Wimborne |isbn=0-946159-94-7 |pages=69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |title=Iron Age Communities in Britain (4th Ed) | page=266 |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-34779-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:St Mary Magdalenes Almshouses (geograph 3257133).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hospital of St Mary Magdalene, Glastonbury|Hospital of St Mary Magdalene]]]]
The origin of the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the settlement is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called ''Glestingaburg''.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2848235|last=Gray|first=Louis H.|title=The origin of the name of Glastonbury |journal=Speculum |date=January 1935 |volume=10|issue=1|pages=46–53 |jstor=2848235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''burg'' element is [[Anglo-Saxon]] and could refer either to a fortified place such as a [[burh]] or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the ''[[Glestinga]]'' element is obscure, and may derive from an [[Old English]] word or from a [[Anglo-Saxon language|Saxon]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] personal name.&lt;ref name="gathercole"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/Somerset_EUS_Glastonbury.pdf |title=Glastonbury |last=Gathercole |first=Clare |work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey |publisher=Somerset County Council |accessdate=14 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202307/http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/Somerset_EUS_Glastonbury.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LHG&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Louis H. |title=Speculum, Vol. 10, No. 1: The Origin of the Name of Glastonbury |pages=46–53 |year=1935 |publisher=Medieval Academy of America |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may derive from a person or [[kinship|kindred]] group named Glast.&lt;ref name=LHG/&gt;
The name however is likely related to an Irish individual named Glas mac Caise 'Glas son of Cas'. Glas is an ancient Irish personal name meaning 'green, grey/green'. It is stated in the Life of St Patrick that he resurrected a swineherder by that name and he went to Glastonbury, to an area of the village known as Glastonbury of the Irish. This was known to the Irish as Glastimbir na n-Gaoidhil 'Glastonbury of the Gaels'. (The Archaeology and History of Glastonbury Abbey - Courteney Arthur Ralegh Radford). This is the earliest source for the name Glastonbury. The modern Irish form for Glastonbury is Glaistimbir.

Hugh Ross Williamson cites a tale about St. Collen, one of the earliest hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is ''made of glass'' so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Ross Williamson ''The Flowering Hawthorn'', Neumann Press 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharpham Park was granted by [[Eadwig of England|King Eadwig]] to the then abbot [[Æthelwold of Wessex|Æthelwold]] in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was gifted by the soon-to-be [[John of England|King John I]] to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the [[Duke of Somerset]], Sir [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], brother of [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane]]; the [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Thynne]] family of [[Longleat]], and the family of Sir Henry Gould.

===Early modern===
In 1693 [[Glastenbury, Connecticut]] was founded and named after the English town from which some of the settlers had emigrated. It is rumored to have originally been called "Glistening Town" until the mid-19th century, when the name was changed to match the spelling of Glastonbury, England, but in fact, residents of the Connecticut town believe this to be a myth, based on the Glastonbury Historical Society's records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsgct.org/Glastonbury_timeline.pdf|title=Glastonbury Timeline|publisher=The Historical Society of Glastonbury|accessdate=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823120940/http://www.hsgct.org/Glastonbury_timeline.pdf|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representation of the Glastonbury thorn is incorporated onto the town seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Town|url=http://town.glasct.org/hissoc/Glastonbury/town.html|publisher=The Historical Society of Glastonbury|accessdate=6 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726105919/http://town.glasct.org/hissoc/Glastonbury/town.html|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Somerset town's charter of incorporation was received in 1705.&lt;ref name="gathercole"/&gt; Growth in the trade and economy largely depended on the drainage of the surrounding moors.

===Modern history===

By the middle of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal drainage problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed.&lt;ref name="gathercole"/&gt; The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.&lt;ref name="body"&gt;G. Body and R.

The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in.&lt;ref name=body/&gt; The Central Somerset Railway merged with the [[Somerset and Dorset Railway#History|Dorset Central Railway]] to become the [[Somerset and Dorset Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Handley, Chris, (2001).

==Mythology and legends==
[[File:Glastonbury Thorn.jpg|thumb|right|Holy Thorn, summer 1984. Died in 1991.]]
Glastonbury is notable for myths and legends concerning [[Joseph of Arimathea]], the [[Holy Grail]] and [[King Arthur]] as recorded by ancient historians [[William of Malmesbury]]''', '''[[Bede|Venerable Bede]], [[Gerald of Wales]] and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].&lt;ref name="britannia.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/arthur/abbey.html|title=Glastonbury Abbey and the Legends of King Arthur and Joseph of Arimathea|website=www.britannia.com|access-date=2017-12-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516221315/http://www.britannia.com/history/arthur/abbey.html|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many long-standing and cherished legends were examined in a four-year study by archaeologists, led by Professor Roberta Gilchrist, at the [[University of Reading]], who, amongst other findings, speculated that the connection with King Arthur and his Queen, Guinivere, was created deliberately by the monks in 1184  to meet a financial crisis caused by a devastating fire.&lt;ref name=guardianmyths&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/23/glastonbury-myths-made-up-by-12th-century-monks |title=Glastonbury myths 'made up by 12th-century monks' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 November 2015 |author=Maev Kennedy |accessdate=26 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123160852/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/23/glastonbury-myths-made-up-by-12th-century-monks |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/arch-rg-glastonbury.aspx|title=Glastonbury Abbey: the archaeological story - University of Reading|last=Reading|first=The University of|website=www.reading.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811070757/http://www.reading.ac.uk/archaeology/research/Projects/arch-RG-Glastonbury.aspx|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other myths examined include the visit by Jesus, the building of the oldest church in England, and the flowering of the walking stick.

A thousand years of beliefs and legends are part of the intangible history of this remarkable place".&lt;ref name=guardianmyths/&gt; Gilchrist went on to say, “archaeology can help us to understand how legends evolve and what people in the past believed.” She noted that the project has actually uncovered the first definitive proof of occupation at the Glastonbury Abbey site during the fifth century—when Arthur allegedly lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archaeology.org/issues/208-1603/trenches/4172-trenches-england-glastonbury-abbey|title=Legends of Glastonbury Abbey - Archaeology Magazine|last=URBANUS|first=JASON|website=www.archaeology.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706122910/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/208-1603/trenches/4172-trenches-england-glastonbury-abbey|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend that Joseph of Arimathea retrieved certain holy relics was introduced by the French poet [[Robert de Boron]] in his 13th-century version of the grail story, thought to have been a trilogy though only fragments of the later books survive today. The work became the inspiration for the later Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Boron|first=Robert|title=Romanz De L'estoire Dou Graal. Published in the 13th century|year=2012|publisher=Project Gutenburg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4936|isbn=1-153-68487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Boron's account relates how Joseph captured Jesus' blood in a cup (the "Holy Grail") which was subsequently brought to Britain. The [[Vulgate Cycle]] reworked Boron's original tale. Joseph of Arimathea was no longer the chief character in the Grail origin: Joseph's son, Josephus, took over his role of the Grail keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vulgate history of the grail|url=http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/keeper.html#Vulgate|publisher=Timeless Myths|accessdate=5 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623093301/http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/keeper.html#Vulgate|archivedate=23 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest versions of the grail romance, however, do not call the grail "holy" or mention anything about blood, Joseph or Glastonbury.

[[File:Summit of glastonbury tor.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Remains of St. Michael's Church at the summit of Glastonbury Tor]]
Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On disembarking he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the [[Glastonbury Thorn]] (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid [[Crataegus monogyna]] (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheeler|first=David|title=Branch lines: the Glastonbury thorn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/3296455/Branch-lines-the-Glastonbury-thorn.html|accessdate=5 July 2010|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 January 2002|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114155151/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/3296455/Branch-lines-the-Glastonbury-thorn.html|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glastonbury zodiac===
{{main|Temple of the Stars}}

In 1934 artist [[Katherine Maltwood]] suggested a [[landscape zodiac]], a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape such as roads, streams and field boundaries, could be found situated around Glastonbury.&lt;ref&gt;Maltwood, K. E. ''A Guide to Glastonbury’s Temple of the Stars: Their Giant Effigies Described From Air Views, Maps, and From "The High History of the Holy Grail"'' (London, The Women’s Printing Society, Ltd., 1934). Her next book on the subject matter, ''Air View Supplement To A Guide To Glastonbury’s Temple of The Stars'' was published in 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; She held that the "temple" was created by [[Sumer]]ians about 2700&amp;nbsp;BC. The idea of a prehistoric landscape zodiac fell into disrepute when two independent studies examined the Glastonbury Zodiac, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 &lt;ref&gt;Ian Burrow, Somerset’s Planning Department staff archeologist, concluded that "while the outlines of the effigies may be plotted today, their antiquity is illusory" {{cite web |url=http://sites.google.com/site/alisonsinc/maltwood'szodiac |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328230039/http://sites.google.com/site/alisonsinc/maltwood'szodiac |archivedate=28 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Williamson, Liz Bellamy, ''Ley Lines In Question'', pages 162-168. (Tadworth, UK: World's Work, 1983). {{ISBN|0-437-19205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These both used standard methods of landscape historical research. Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea of an ancient zodiac. The eye of [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as in conventional western astrology) consists of a network of 18th-century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the "temple" in any form, from conventional archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Tom|title=Ley Lines in Question|year=1983|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|isbn=978-0-437-19205-9|author2=Liz Bellamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glastonbury is also said to be the centre of several [[ley line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburytor.org.uk/leymap.html|title=The ancient landscape around Glastonbury|last=Jenkins|first=Palden|publisher=Glasonbury Tor|accessdate=28 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408093651/http://www.glastonburytor.org.uk/leymap.html|archivedate=8 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Street and Glastonbury Tor.jpg|thumb|Street and Glastonbury Tor viewed from Walton Hill]]
The walk up the [[Glastonbury Tor|Tor]] to the distinctive tower at the summit (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by vistas of the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland.

It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with [[willow]] trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by [[Drovers' road|"droves"]], i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} below peak tides and have large areas of [[peat]]. The low-lying areas are underlain by much older [[Triassic]] age formations of Upper [[Early Jurassic|Lias]] sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include [[Glastonbury Tor]].&lt;ref name="natengsomerset"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/area_ID30.asp |title=Somerset |accessdate=10 June 2007 |work=Natural England |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610043102/http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/geological/sites/area_ID30.asp |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile85.pdf |title=Somerset Levels and Moors Natural Area&amp;nbsp;– A nature conservation profile July 1997 |accessdate=10 June 2007 |format=PDF |work=English Nature |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184747/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile85.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000&amp;nbsp;years, following the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardy |first=Peter |title=The Geology of Somerset |year=1999 |publisher=Ex Libris Press |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0-948578-42-4 | pages=185–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low-lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]].

Glastonbury is less than {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} across the [[River Brue]] from the village of [[Street, Somerset|Street]]. At the time of [[King Arthur]] the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by [[Arthurian legend]] as the home of the [[Lady of the Lake]]. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] threw [[Excalibur]] into the waters after King Arthur fell at the [[Battle of Camlann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pomparles Bridge |work=ArthurianAdventure.com |url=http://www.arthurianadventure.com/pomparles_bridge.htm |accessdate=11 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017095426/http://www.arthurianadventure.com/pomparles_bridge.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pomparles Bridge, Northover, Glastonbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23577|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=4 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003122059/http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23577|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This route made it difficult for the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the abbey, and when the valley of the River Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself.

Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Glastonbury has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.&lt;ref name="weather"&gt;{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}}. [[Temperateness|Seasonal temperature variation]] is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|21|°C|°F|1}}. In winter mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|or|2|°C|°F|1}} are common.&lt;ref name="weather"/&gt; In the summer the [[Azores]] high pressure affects the south-west of England, however [[convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="weather"/&gt; In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]]. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}. About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.&lt;ref name="weather"/&gt;

[[File:Chalice Well Cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of the Chalice Well]]
The [[Chalice Well]] is a holy [[Water well|well]] at the foot of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron decoration made in 1919. The natural spring has been in almost constant use for at least two thousand years. Water issues from the spring at a rate of {{convert|25000|impgal}} per day and has never failed, even during drought. [[Iron oxide]] deposits give the water a reddish hue, as dissolved [[ferrous oxide]] becomes oxygenated at the surface and is precipitated, providing [[chalybeate]] waters. As with the hot springs in nearby [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], the water is believed to possess healing qualities. The well is about {{convert|9|ft|m}} deep, with two underground chambers at its bottom.&lt;ref name=IOEChaliceWell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265891 |title=The Chalice Well |work=Images of England |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=20 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012063432/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265891 |archivedate=12 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often portrayed as a symbol of the female aspect of [[deity]], with the male symbolised by [[Glastonbury Tor]]. As such, it is a popular destination for [[pilgrim]]s in search of the divine feminine, including modern [[Neopaganism|Pagans]]. The well is however popular with all faiths and in 2001 became a World Peace Garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.worldpeacegardensnet.org/members.htm|publisher=World Peace Gardens Network|accessdate=5 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323105737/http://www.worldpeacegardensnet.org/members.htm|archivedate=23 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a short distance from the Chalice Well site, across a road known as Well House Lane, can be found the "White Spring", where a temple has been created in the 21st century. Whilst the waters of the Chalice Well are touched red with iron, the water of the latter is white with [[calcite]]. Both springs rise from caverns underneath the Tor and it is claimed that both have healing in their flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The White Spring|url=http://www.whitespring.org.uk/|publisher=The White Spring|accessdate=4 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923104433/http://www.whitespring.org.uk/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building now used as the White Spring Temple was originally a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-built]] well house, erected by the local water board in 1872. Around that time, an outbreak of [[cholera]] in the area caused great concern and the natural caves were dug out, and a stone collection chamber was constructed to ensure the flow of a quality water supply. Study of the flow of water into the collection chamber has shown that the builders also tapped into other springs, besides the White Spring and judging from the high iron content of one of these springs, it appears that a small offshoot of Chalice Well finds its way under Well House Lane to emerge beside the White Spring.&lt;ref name=receptioncentre&gt;{{cite web|title=The White Spring|url=http://www.unitythroughdiversity.org/the-white-spring.html|publisher=Glastonbury Reception Centre and Sanctuary|accessdate=4 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005024229/http://www.unitythroughdiversity.org/the-white-spring.html|archivedate=5 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after building the reservoir, the water board soon discovered that the high calciferous content of the water caused pipes to block and by the end of the 19th century water was piped into Glastonbury from out of town. After lying derelict for many years, the water board sold off the well house, which is now maintained by a group of volunteers as a "water temple".&lt;ref name=receptioncentre/&gt; On the outside of the building is a tap where visitors and locals can collect the water of the White Spring.

Glastonbury may have been a site of religious importance in pre-Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]], ''From Caesar to Arthur'', University of Michigan, 1960. Page 87&lt;/ref&gt; The abbey was founded by [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], and dates to at least the early 7th century, although later medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] in the 1st century. This legend is intimately tied to [[Robert de Boron]]'s version of the [[Holy Grail]] story and to Glastonbury's connection to [[King Arthur]], which dates at least to the early 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]], ''From Caesar to Arthur'', University of Michigan, 1960. pages 83–90&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Malmesbury]] called this structure "the oldest church in England," and, henceforth, it was known simply as the Old Church, it had existed, for many years prior to the 7th century as a Celitc religious center.&lt;ref name="britannia.com"/&gt; In his "History of the English Church and People," written in the early eighth century, the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] provides details regarding its construction to early missionaries.&lt;ref name="britannia.com"/&gt; Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the [[Battle of Peonnum]] in 658. King [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] of [[Wessex]] enriched the endowment of the community of [[monk]]s already established at Glastonbury. He is said to have directed that a stone church be built in 712. The Abbey Church was enlarged in the 10th century by the Abbot of Glastonbury, Saint [[Dunstan]], the central figure in the 10th-century revival of English monastic life. He instituted the [[Benedictine Rule]] at Glastonbury and built new cloisters. Dunstan became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 960. In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the [[Lady Chapel (Glastonbury)|Lady Chapel]], which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathedralsplus.org.uk/index.php/front_end/member/47/about.html|title=Glastonbury Abbey|work=Cathedrals Plus|publisher=The Pilgrims Association|accessdate=19 August 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106074407/http://www.cathedralsplus.org.uk/index.php/front_end/member/47/about.html|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centuries that followed the [[Reformation]], many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched by the fact that several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol9/pp16-43|title=Glastonbury: Town|publisher=Victoria County History|accessdate=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901212623/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol9/pp16-43|archivedate=1 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grace Aguilar''' (2 June 1816 – 16 September 1847) was an English novelist, poet and writer on Jewish history and religion. Although she had been writing since childhood, much of her work was published posthumously. Among those are her best known works, the novels ''Home Influence'' and ''A Mother's Recompense''.

Aguilar was the eldest child of [[History of the Jews in Portugal#Post-Inquisition|Sephardic Jewish refugees from Portugal]] who settled in the [[London Borough of Hackney]]. An early illness resulted in her being educated by her parents, especially her mother, who taught her the tenets of [[Judaism]]. Later, her father taught the history of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] during his own bout with [[tuberculosis]] which had led the family to move to the English coast. After surviving the [[measles]] at the age of 19, she began to embark on a serious writing career, even though her physical health never completely recovered.

Aguilar's debut was an anonymous collection of poems, ''The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers''. Three years later she translated [[Isaac Orobio de Castro]]'s ''Israel Defended'' into English at her father's behest. Later her ''The Spirit of Judaism'' drew interest and sales in both Britain and the United States after being published in [[Philadelphia]] by [[Isaac Leeser]]. He added a preface to the work elucidating his differences with her, the first of many clashes her work would have with mainstream Jewish thought.

In the 1840s her novels began to attract regular readers, and Aguilar moved back to London with her parents. Despite her success, she and her mother still had to operate a boys' [[Hebrew school]] to stay solvent, which she resented for the time and energy it took from her writing. In 1847, she became ill again with a spinal paralysis which she did not let prevent her from visiting her brother in [[Frankfurt]]. Her health worsened and she died there that September.

==Life==
Born in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, in 1816, Grace Aguilar was the oldest child of parents descended from Portuguese [[Marrano]]s who had sought asylum in England in the 18th century following the [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. Emanuel, her father, was the lay leader of London's Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, and her mother Sarah was active in the city's Jewish community as well. Her religious background and illnesses, both hers and her parents', were major factors in her life and influential on her work.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 17"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 17].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlando page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown |first1=Susan |title=Grace Aguilar |url=http://orlando.cambridge.org/protected/svPeople?crumbtrail=on&amp;formname=r&amp;people_tab=3&amp;person_id=aguigr&amp;heading=c |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150310000008/http://orlando.cambridge.org/protected/svPeople?crumbtrail=on&amp;formname=r&amp;people_tab=3&amp;person_id=aguigr&amp;heading=c |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 March 2015 |website=Orlando Project |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=8 March 2015 }},&lt;/ref&gt;

For her first eight years, Aguilar was an only child. During this time, Aguilar suffered from a chronic long-term illness that led her parents to educate her at home. Her mother, in keeping with post-Inquisition practice among [[Sephardic Jew]]s from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], educated the young Aguilar in her religion and its tenets. Her condition did not stop her from learning to dance and play the harp and piano, common pursuits for middle-class English girls of that era, or traveling—when her brother Emanuel was born in 1823, the family went on an extended tour of [[Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 18"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 18].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Aguilar was twelve, her father contracted [[tuberculosis]]. For his health, the family relocated to the coast in [[Devon]]. While Grace was taking care of him, her father taught her the [[oral history]] of the Jews of Spain and Portugal, complementing her mother's earlier instruction in Judaism. He may also have taught her [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], which was extremely unusual for a Jewish woman to know at that time. Both her religious and literary interests date to that time of her life; she began indulging them both by making her first efforts at poetry and fiction and attending some [[Protestant]] services. A collection of [[conch]] shells she found on a [[Teignmouth]] beach spurred her to attempt a scientific paper on the subject.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JWA page"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galchinsky|first=Michael|title=Grace Aguilar|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/aguilar-grace|publisher=[[Jewish Women's Archive]]|date=1998–2015|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Aguilar's health took a turn for the worse during this period, as she recovered from surgical treatment for an illness that has not yet been identified from the records available, and Grace spent time taking care of her as she had her father.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 20"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 20].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, at the age of 19, Grace was again taken ill herself, with [[measles]]. She never completely recovered.&lt;ref name="Jewish Press article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bitton-Jackson|first=Livia|title=Grace Aguilar: The Spirit of Judaism|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/jewess-press/impact-women-history/grace-aguilar-the-spirit-of-judaism/2012/09/07/|newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[Brighton]] afterwards, perhaps to be closer to London's Jewish community. The two Aguilar boys had been sent to [[boarding school]], but with her parents' health declining, Grace began to think about her responsibilities to not only them but her brothers as well. She decided to try making a living as a writer, and that year was able to get her first book of poems published. It was successful enough that a second run was printed in 1839, and she began writing in earnest.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 20" /&gt;

Much of this work was published posthumously, with one exception. In 1838 Aguilar's father prevailed upon her to translate [[Isaac Orobio de Castro]]'s ''Israel Defended'', an [[apologia]] for Judaism, from the original [[French language|French]] for private distribution among Brighton's Jewish community. She added a preface that, albeit with some ambivalence, explained that she had softened Orobio's castigations of Christians as a result of the tolerance she felt Victorian England had shown to its Jewish population compared with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Spain and Portugal. Two years later the family returned to London.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 21"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 21].&lt;/ref&gt;

There, Aguilar befriended the young [[Benjamin Disraeli]], whose father [[Isaac D'Israeli|Isaac]] was a well-known author. The older man was able to help her find a publisher. He declined, but on her own she was able to persuade [[Isaac Leeser]], editor of ''The Occident'', an [[Jewish American|American Jewish]] magazine, to publish her [[theology|theological]] tract ''The Spirit of Judaism'' as the initial volume of a new series of books he was bringing out. The original manuscript was lost at sea, but Aguilar was able to recreate it from her notes, and it was published in 1842. When she received her copy, Aguilar was angry that Leeser had added a preface detailing his differences of opinion with Aguilar.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 22"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 22].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was nevertheless well-received, and Aguilar began publishing poems in small English journals. Isaac D'Israeli now chose to help her, possibly introducing her to [[Edward Moxon]], his own publisher. Moxon in turn introduced her to R. Groombridge &amp; Sons, the large publisher that would eventually bring out most of her work in Britain.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 23"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23 23].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her anger over the preface he added to ''The Spirit of Judaism'', Aguilar continued to publish her poetry in Leeser's journals. She befriended Solomon Cohen, the first Jewish [[Georgia State Senate|state senator]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and his wife Miriam, which contributed to the success of her work in the [[Southern United States|South]] as they distributed her books widely there. In England, her domestic fiction drew readers and acclaim. However, she still needed to run a boys' [[Hebrew school]] with her mother to make enough money to live on, an obligation she complained about bitterly and repeatedly in her letters to Miriam Cohen, since she felt it took away from the time she had to write. She also anguished over the fate of her brother Henry, who had chosen a career as a sailor.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 24"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 24].&lt;/ref&gt;

The last three years of her life were busy. Aguilar turned to nonfiction, producing ''Women of Israel'', an account of the lives of Jewish women that was recognized as her masterpiece. In 1845, the family was able to move again, to a house on Hackney's [[Clapton Square]], where she tended to her father until his death the following year.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 27"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 27].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847 Aguilar came down with a spinal paralysis; in spite of the illness she went ahead with a planned trip to Europe. Before her departure some Jewish women of London presented her with a gift and an address recounting her achievements in behalf of Judaism and Jewish women. She later visited Emanuel at [[Frankfurt]], where he had become a successful musician. At first she seemed to benefit by the change of scene and climate, but after a few weeks she went to the [[spa|baths]] of [[Bad Schwalbach|Schwalbach]] for treatment. More symptoms led her return to Frankfurt, where she died on 16 September 1847. Her remains were buried in the Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name="Galchinsky 28"&gt;Galchinsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==

Aguilar's literary career began with the diary she started at seven and continued, uninterrupted, until her death. Before she was twelve she had written a drama, ''Gustavus Vasa'', which has since been lost.&lt;ref name="JWA page" /&gt; Her first verses were evoked two years later by the scenery about Tavistock in Devonshire.&lt;ref name="Selected Writings"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aguilar|first1=Grace|editor1-last=Galchinsky|editor1-first=Michael|title=Grace Aguilar: Selected Writings|date=2003|publisher=Broadview Press|location=[[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough, ON]]|isbn=9781770484245|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evM4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early collected poems, under the title ''The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers'', were published anonymously in 1835; each is a riddle with clues to the name of a particular flower.&lt;ref name="JWA page" /&gt;

Aguilar's productions are chiefly stories and religious works dealing with Jewish subjects. The former embrace domestic tales, tales founded on Marano history, and a romance of Scottish history, ''The Days of Bruce'' (1852). The most popular of the Jewish tales is ''The Vale of Cedars, or the Martyr: A Story of Spain in the Fifteenth Century'', written before 1835, published in 1850, and twice translated into German and twice into Hebrew. Her other stories founded on Jewish episodes are included in a collection of nineteen tales, ''Home Scenes and Heart Studies'' (published posthumously 1852);&lt;ref name="Aguilar 1902 vi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aguilar|first=Grace|title=The Vale of Cedars &amp; Other Tales|year=1902|publisher=J.M. Dent &amp; Co.|location=London|page=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Perez Family'' (1843) and ''The Edict'' together with ''The Escape'', had appeared as two separate volumes; the others were reprinted from magazines. Her domestic tales are ''Home Influence'' (1847) and its sequel, ''The Mother's Recompense'' (1850), both of them written early in 1836, ''Woman's Friendship'' (1851), and ''Helon: A Fragment from Jewish History'' (1852).&lt;ref name="Aguilar 1902 vi"/&gt;

The first of Aguilar's religious works was a translation of the French version of ''Israel Defended,'' by the Marrano [[Orobio de Castro]], printed for private circulation. It was closely followed by "The Spirit of Judaism," the publication of which was for a time prevented by the loss of the original manuscript. Sermons by Rabbi [[Isaac Leeser]], of [[Philadelphia]], had fallen into her hands and, like all other accessible Jewish works, had been eagerly read. She requested him to revise the manuscript of the ''Spirit of Judaism'', which was forwarded to him, but was lost. The author rewrote it; and in 1842 it was published in Philadelphia, with notes by Leeser. A second edition was issued in 1849 by the first American Jewish Publication Society; and a third (Cincinnati, 1864) has an appendix containing thirty-two poems (bearing date 1838-1847), all but two reprinted from "The Occident". The editor's notes serve mainly to mark dissent from Aguilar's depreciation of Jewish tradition — due probably to her Marrano ancestry and to her country life, cut off from association with Jews. In 1845 ''The Women of Israel'' appeared—a series of portraits delineated according to the Scriptures and [[Josephus]]. This was soon followed by "The Jewish Faith: Its Spiritual Consolation, Moral Guidance, and Immortal Hope," in thirty-one letters, the last dated September, 1846. Of this work—addressed to a Jewess under the spell of Christian influence, to demonstrate to her the spirituality of Judaism—the larger part is devoted to immortality in the Old Testament. Aguilar's other religious writings —some of them written as early as 1836—were collected in a volume of ''Essays and Miscellanies'' (1851–52). The first part consists of ''Sabbath Thoughts'' on Scriptural passages and prophecies; the second, of "Communings" for the family circle.

In her religious writings Aguilar's attitude was defensive. Despite her almost exclusive intercourse with Christians and her utter lack of prejudice, her purpose, apparently, was to equip English Jewish women with arguments against conversionists. She inveighed against formalism, and laid stress upon knowledge of Jewish history and the Hebrew language. In view of the neglect of the latter by women (to whom she modestly confined her expostulations), she constantly pleaded for the reading of the Scriptures in the English version. Her interest in the reform movement was deep; yet, despite her attitude toward tradition, she observed ritual ordinances punctiliously. Her last work was a sketch of the "History of the Jews in England", written for "Chambers's Miscellany." In point of style it is the most finished of her productions, free from the exuberances and redundancies that disfigure the tales—published, for the most part, posthumously by her mother. The defects of her style are mainly chargeable to youth. With her extraordinary industry—she rose early and employed the day systematically—and her growing ability of concentration she gave promise of noteworthy productions.

'''Graeme Donald Snooks''' (born 1944 in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]) is a systems theorist and stratologist who has developed a general dynamic theory to explain complex [[living systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/]&lt;/ref&gt; His resulting "dynamic-strategy theory" has been employed to analyse the fluctuating fortunes of life over the past 4,000 million years (myrs) and of human society over the past 2 myrs; to analyse contemporary economic problems (inflation,&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; financial crises,&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; climate change&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;); to explore socio-political issues (population expansion, the emergence of democracy, the "clash of civilizations"); to analyse the emergence, operation, and malfunction of the mind; and to make scientific predictions about the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New discoveries emerging from Snooks' publications include: '''existential schizophrenia''', '''strategic frustration''', '''strategic selection''', the '''growth-inflation curve''', the '''strategy function''', the '''logological constant''' (akin to the cosmological constant), the '''Snooks–Panov Vertical''', '''technological paradigm shifts''', the '''Solar Revolution''', and, most importantly, the '''strategic ''logos'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''. His body of work challenges the existing paradigms of orthodox (neo-classical) [[economics]], climate-mitigation economics, [[Marxism]], neo-[[Darwinism]], [[evolutionary psychology]], self-organisation theory, and all other supply-side systems.''

For twenty-one years, from 1989 to 2010, Graeme Snooks was the foundation Coghlan Research Professor of Economics in the [[Institute of Advanced Studies]] at the [[Australian National University]]. Currently he is the Executive Director of both the '''Institute of Global Dynamic Systems''' and '''IGDS Books'''&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/GDSCpapers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in Canberra. He was educated at [[Mount Lawley Senior High School]] (1957–1961), the [[University of Western Australia]] (BEc,1966; MEc, 1968), and the [[Australian National University]] (PhD, 1972). Professor Snooks has been elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences (1991), Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (UK) (1990), and Fellow of the Russian Academy of Humanities (2006).

==Books and articles==
[[File: Graeme Donald Snooks, Canberra, May 2013.jpg|thumb|'''Graeme Donald Snooks''', May 2013]]
Professor Snooks has published 30 books, including: ''Depression and Recovery'' (1974), ''Domesday Economy'' (with J. McDonald) (1986), ''Economics Without Time'' (1993), ''Historical Analysis in Economics'' (1993), ''Portrait of the Family within the Total Economy'' (1994), ''Was the Industrial Revolution Necessary?'', (1994), ''The Dynamic Society'' (1996), ''The Ephemeral Civilization'' (1997), ''The Laws of History'' (1998), ''Longrun Dynamics'' (1998), ''Global Transition'' (1999), ''The Global Crisis Makers'' (2000), ''The Collapse of Darwinism'' (2003), ''The Selfcreating Mind'' (2006), ''The Coming Eclipse, or The Triumph of Climate Mitigation Over Solar Revolution'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/home/books/the-coming-eclipse]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead God Rising. Religion and Science in the Universal Life-System'' (2010).,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/home/books/dead-god-rising-1]&lt;/ref&gt; , ''The Death of Zarathustra. Notes on Truth for the Risk-Taker'' (2011), ''Ark of the Sun: the improbable voyage of life'' (November 2015), ''Ultimate Reality &amp; its Dissidents'' (March 2016), and ''Time's Gateway: a personal quest for ultimate reality'' (August 2017). 

Graeme Snooks' recent book, '''Ark of the Sun''' provides an overview of his thinking over five decades on the dynamics of life and human society and reveals the underlying reality of life - the strategic '''''logos''''' - which is the ultimate complex living system. '''Ultimate Reality &amp; its Dissidents''' provides a unique philosophy of life based on his realist general dynamic theory. And '''Time's Gateway''' shows how these ideas emerged over the past fifty years. He is currently exploring two major issues. First, the existential dangers of metaphysical systems of thought to the survival of humanity, together with the corrective contribution of realist thinking. And second, the contribution of DNA testing to the exploration of societal dynamics over the past 60,000 years. 

Articles on the theory of complex living systems have been published by Snooks in ''Advances in Space Research'' (2005), ''Complexity'' (the journal of the [[Santa Fe Institute]]) (2008), and [[Social Evolution &amp; History]] (2002, 2005, 2007). In a recent (11 November 2016) article - '''The Triumph of Trump and the failure of the intellectuals''' - he applies the dynamic-strategy theory to the recent US Presidential election (see Graeme Snooks, Researchgate) and provides suggestions for the type of dynamic strategy that the USA would need to pursue in order to "make America great again" and to position itself at the forefront of the forthcoming technological paradigm shift.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9788">'''Ilona Duczynska''' ({{lang-pl|Ilona Duczyńska}}; {{lang-hu|Duczynska Ilona, Ducsinszka Ilona}})(11 March 1897, [[Vienna]] – 24 April 1978, [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]]), was a Polish-Hungarian-Canadian [[revolutionary]], journalist, translator, engineer, and historian. Her husband was [[Karl Polanyi]] and her daughter is [[Kari Polanyi Levitt]].

==Life==
In 1897, Ilona Duczynska was born near Vienna to a Hungarian mother and a Polish-Austrian father. In 1915, during the First World War, she became acquainted with [[anarcho-syndicalist]] revolutionary [[Ervin Szabó]], who connected her with the work of the [[Galileo Circle]]. She became a revolutionary socialist. For her anti-war activities, she was expelled from school in 1915. She studied engineering at the [[ETH Zurich|Technical University of Zurich]]. There she was befriended by a community of representatives of the Russian Social Democratic Party opposed to the war, including [[Lenin]], his wife Krupskaya, and [[Angelica Balabanoff]]. Together with delegations from Germany, France, and Britain, as well as other European Labour and Socialist parties, they met to draft a program of action against the war, known as the Zimmerwald Declaration (see [[Zimmerwald Conference]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polanyi Levitt|first1=Kari|title=ROSA LUXEMBOURG FOUNDATION LECTURE|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18-year-old Duczynska was entrusted to smuggle this call to action into Hungary.

In Hungary, she took part in the early 1918 strikes that called successfully for workers' councils. During the Galilei trial, she was imprisoned. In the [[Aster Revolution]], she and other revolutionaries were freed. On November 17, 1918, she married Tivadar Sugar and soon after joined the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]. During the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], she worked in the propaganda department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and she was a member of the [[Budapest Central Revolutionary Worker and Soldier Council]].

She fled to Vienna to escape the counter-revolution in Hungary. With an excellent education and knowledge of several languages, she was called to Moscow to serve as translator to [[Karl Radek]] in the preparations for the historic Second International Congress of Communist Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polanyi Levitt|first1=Kari|title=ROSA LUXEMBOURG FOUNDATION LECTURE|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilona returned to Vienna in 1920, and subsequently was expelled from the party for "Luxembourgist deviations" and a publication in a journal edited by [[Paul Levi]], who also fell into disfavor with the party. In 1922, she divorced Tivadar Sugar. The next year she married Karl Polanyi and their only child Kari was born. From 1927, she edited the ''Der linke Sozialdemokrat'' and organized the left opposition in the Vienna branch of the Austrian Socialist Party. Her underground name in Vienna was ''Anna Novotny.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McRobbie|first1=Kenneth|title=Ilona Duczynska (1897-1978) From "Early Morning": Memories of a  Hungarian Childhood|url=http://regi.oszk.hu/kiadvany/hsr/1999/duczynska.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, she returned to university, the Technical University of Vienna, studying technology, mechanics, mechanical drawing, electronics, and electric number theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalos|first1=Gyorgy|title=The Fidelity of Equals: Ilona Duczynska and Karl Polanyi," in The Life and Work of Karl Polanyi|date=1990|publisher=Black Rose Books|location=Montreal|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Karl emigrated to England followed by Kari in 1934 and Ilona in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kari Polanyi Levitt|url=http://www.karipolanyilevitt.com/biography/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duczynska participated in the [[Austrian Civil War|1934 workers' uprising in Vienna]]. Following the destruction of the Austrian working class movement in February 1934, Duczynska rejoined the Communist Party in order to continue the struggle of the now-illegal [[Schutzbund]], the military arm of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, until 1936 when she joined her family in [[London]]. Subsequently, she was expelled from the Austrian Communist Party in London on orders from Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polanyi Levitt|first1=Kari|title=ROSA LUXEMBOURG FOUNDATION LECTURE|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she returned to England from Bennington, Vermont in 1942/3, she worked in the Political Intelligence department of Foreign Affairs. During World War II she also worked for the Royal Aircraft Establishment testing model aircraft in wind tunnels for a year or perhaps two.

After World War II, the family moved to Canada. Due to her background as a former communist, Duczynska could not gain an entrance visa to the United States. Karl Polanyi began his teaching position at Columbia University. He commuted to New York City from Canada. In 1964, Karl Polanyi died.

In the 1970s, Duczynska joined the widowed Countess Katalin ("Katus") Károlyi and Júlia Rajk, the widow of [[László Rajk]], in the front row of the trial of the dissident poet and philosopher [[Miklós Haraszti]]. Their presence was probably responsible for his receiving a suspended sentence. By this time Duczynska was associated with many leading Hungarian writers and poets.

{{Campaignbox Kurdish separatism in Iran}}
The '''Iran crisis of 1946''', also known as the '''[[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] Crisis''' ({{Lang-fa|غائله آذربایجان}} [[transliteration|translit.]]: ''Qaʾilih Âzarbâyjân''), was one of the first crises of the [[Cold War]], sparked by the refusal of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] to relinquish occupied [[Iran]]ian territory, despite repeated assurances. The end of [[World War II]] should have resulted in the end of the Allied joint occupation of Iran. Instead, Pro-Soviet Iranians proclaimed the separatist [[Azerbaijan People's Government]]&lt;ref&gt;''All the Shah's Men'', Kinzer, p.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|Kurdish separatist]] [[Republic of Mahabad]]. The [[United States]] pressured Soviet withdrawal in the earliest success of the new [[containment]] strategy.

As of August 1941, the United States was a neutral nation and had not yet entered as a belligerent in World War II. Therefore, the bloc known as 'The Allies' were principally (with Poland and France occupied by Germany in 1939 and 1940, respectively) the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, recently forming their alliance after the German invasion of territories of the Western Soviet Union in June 1941. In August–September 1941, Pahlavi Iran had been jointly [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|invaded]] and occupied by the Allied powers of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in the north and by the British in the centre and south.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=1946: The Making of the Modern World|last=Sebestyen|first=Victor|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=0230758002|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran was used by the Americans and the British as a transportation route to provide vital supplies to the Soviet Union's war efforts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the aftermath of the occupation of Iran, those Allied forces agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, when this deadline came in early 1946, the Soviets, under [[Joseph Stalin]], remained in Iran. Soon, the alliance of the Kurdish and People's Azerbaijani forces, supported in arms and training by the Soviet Union, engaged in fighting with Iranian forces,&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; resulting in a total of 2,000 casualties. Negotiation by Iranian premier [[Ahmad Qavam]] and diplomatic pressure on the Soviets by the United States eventually led to Soviet withdrawal and dissolution of the separatist Azeri and Kurdish states.

==Iran Crisis of 1946==

===Background===
After Germany broke its pact with the Soviets and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|invaded the USSR in June 1941]], the [[United Kingdom]]  and the [[Soviet Union]] jointly occupied Iran as a preventative measure, starting on August 25, 1941, and justified their invasion by the need to use Iran as a gateway for delivery of [[Lend-Lease]] supplies to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt; As a result, [[Rezā Shāh]] was forced to abdicate on September 16, 1941&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and exiled to [[Mauritius]]; his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the crown prince, became the new monarch. Their joint 'Tripartite Treaty' of January 1942 declared that their military presence was not an occupation, proclaimed Iran to be their ally, and pledged to withdraw their troops within six months of the end of the war.&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt;

Throughout the rest of the war, the United Kingdom and the United States used Iran as an important supply line to the Soviet war effort against [[Nazi Germany]]. Thirty thousand non-combatant US troops arrived to move these supplies, and transit through Iran was later termed a "bridge to victory". At the [[Teheran Conference]] in 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Big Three]] gave additional assurances concerning Iran's future sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as a promise to assist in its post-war reconstruction and development.&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"&gt;[[George Lenczowski]], [https://books.google.com/books?ei=mjJTS9LlApGEkwSX_MmVCg&amp;cd=1&amp;id=o9y6AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=George+Lenczowski%2C+%281990%29%2C+American+Presidents+and+the+Middle+East%2C+p.+27&amp;q=%22Iran-Azerbaijan+Crisis%22#search_anchor ''American Presidents and the Middle East''], (1990), p. 7-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the occupation of Iran was scheduled to end after the war at the [[Potsdam Conference]] following Germany's surrender, Stalin objected to Churchill's proposal for an early allied withdrawal from Iran ahead of the agreed-upon schedule set at the [[Teheran Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry S. Truman]], Memoirs, Vol. 1: ''Years of Decision'' (1955), p.380, cited in Lenczowski, ''American Presidents'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  Following [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ Day]] in September 1945, first the US and then the UK withdrew their forces within the treaty-stipulated period. The Soviets not only violated the March 2 withdrawal deadline; in that time they had expanded their military presence southward. By mid-December 1945, with the use of troops and secret police, they had set up two pro-Soviet "People's Democratic Republics" within Iranian territory,&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt; the [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan People's Republic]] headed by [[Sayyid Jafar Pishevari]] and the Kurdish [[Republic of Mahabad]] under President Pesheva [[Qazi Muhammad]].

===''People's Republic of Azerbaijan''===
{{main|People's Republic of Azerbaijan}}
The [[Azerbaijani Democratic Party]] (ADP) was formed in September 1945 and headed by Jafar Pishevari, a long-time leader of the revolutionary movement in [[Gilan]]. The ADP expanded throughout [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], and initiated a local coup d'état with help from the Soviet army, who prevented the Iranian army from intervening.&lt;ref&gt;Ervand Abrahamian. "Communism and Communalism in Iran: The Tudah and the Firqah-I Dimukrat", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 4. (October 1970), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; During the first week of September 1945, the Azerbaijani Democratic Party declared itself to be in control of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], promised liberal democratic reforms, and disbanded the local branch of [[Tudeh]], the Iranian communist party.&lt;ref&gt;Sepehr Zabih. ''The Communist Movement in Iran'', Berkeley, 1966, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abrahamian217"&gt;Ervand Abrahamian. ''Iran between Two Revolutions'', Princeton, 1982, pp. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in September 1945, at its first congress, the Azerbaijani Democratic Party authorized the formation of a peasant's militia, which by mid-November 1945 captured all remaining government posts in the province, and Iranian Azerbaijan "became an autonomous republic under the direction of a 39-member national and no
executive committee".&lt;ref name="lawson316"&gt;Fred H. Lawson. "The Iranian Crisis of 1945-1946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 21, No. 3. (August 1989), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;  The only Prime Minister of this short-lived republic was [[Ahmad Kordary]] (variously spelled Kordari or Kodari).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Though the Soviets initially supported the new autonomous entity and prevented the Iranian army from restoring governmental control over the area, it did not last for long. After the Soviet withdrawal, Iranian troops entered the region in December 1946 and Pishevari and his cabinet fled to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/azerbaijan.htm Azerbaijan Crisis (1947-1948)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/ww2Timeline/iran.html Iran in World War II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016033236/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/ww2Timeline/iran.html |date=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdish ''Republic of Mahabad''===
{{main|Republic of Mahabad}}
The Mahabad Republic was proclaimed in December 1945.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior&gt;Michael G. Lortz. (Chapter 1, Introduction). ''The Kurdish Warrior Tradition and the Importance of the Peshmerga''. pp.27-29. {{cite web|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11142005-144616/unrestricted/003Manuscript.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191132/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11142005-144616/unrestricted/003Manuscript.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the nascent [[Kurds|Kurdish]] republic and fully endorsed by the Soviets, was [[Qazi Muhammad]], the religious and titular leader of Mahabad.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; Despite Soviet opposition, Mullah [[Mustafa Barzani]] came to play an important role in the newly created military force of the Mahabad Republic - the [[Peshmerga]].&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; With Barzani's support secured, along with some 60 tribal Kurdish leaders, the KDP-I party platform had been established and Qazi Muhammad was elected the first president on 22 January 1946.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

The Kurdish forces were advised and organized by Soviet military officer Captain Salahuddin Kazimov.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; The Soviets extended their influence by sending at least 60 Kurds to Soviet Azerbaijan for additional military training. In total, the Mahabad army consisted of 70 active duty officers, 40 non-commissioned officers, and 1,200 lower-enlisted privates.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

On 29 April 1946, only five days after the Mahabad Republic signed a military cooperation accord with neighboring Azerbaijan, the First Kurdish Regiment, located in the southeast corner of the republic in Qahrawa, faced 600 Iranian soldiers reinforced with artillery and cavalry.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; In this engagement, the [[peshmerga]] under Barzani were successful against Iranian forces, ambushing the first Iranian units to reach Qahrawa, killing 21, wounding 17 and capturing 40, making it the first victory for the Mahabad Republic.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

The Mahabad peshmerga also engaged Iranian reconnaissance teams in the region throughout early May 1946.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; Kurdish offensives were limited to minor skirmishes due to the removal of Soviet influence in the region that month, possibly due to a Soviet-Iranian oil agreement.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; A ceasefire agreement, signed on 3 May 1946 between Kurdish forces and Iranian General Ali Razmara, discouraged major attacks, promoted withdrawals, and allowed each side to further equip their forces in the region.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

On 15 June 1946, this period of preparation ended, as the fighting positions of the Second Kurdish Regiment at Mamashah (Mil Qarani) were [[Battle of Mamashah|attacked]] by two Iranian battalions supported by artillery, tanks, and aircraft.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; The resulting Kurdish defeat enabled the Iranian military to seize the highlands, erect military watchtowers, and maintain a military presence in the area.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; Lack of tribal unity promoted deterioration of the Mahabad Republic following the Battle of Mamashah.
[[File:Azerbeidsjan capituleert, Bestanddeelnr 901-9710 crop.jpg|thumb|Military parade in Tehran&lt;br&gt;in celebration of Azerbaijan capitulation, 15th December 1946]]
As tribal support for Qazi Muhammad's government waned, the Barzani Peshmerga were left as Mahabad's lone fighting force.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; As a result, the Mahabad position became hopeless by late 1946, as even promised Soviet aid failed to arrive.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; The Mahabad Republic faced its most difficult challenge as Iranian forces planned to reclaim Mahabad, following the seizure of Iranian Azerbaijan in December 1946.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; Though some opposition remained, eventually the sides turned to negotiations. The Barzanis, including the Peshmerga and their families, withdrew to Naqada on 15 December 1946 and the Iranian military entered Mahabad, officially ending the one-year life of the Kurdish Republic.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

Despite the attempts to disarm Mahabad forces, the Peshmerga succeeded in smuggling out much of their weaponry. In March 1947, they faced their Iranian foes once again. In various battles throughout mid-March, the Peshmerga defended themselves against numerous offensives as Iranian forces continued their attacks, often recruiting rival Kurdish tribes to oust the Barzanis.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; The Peshmerga even achieved several victories, among which was the [[Battle of Nalos]], where Peshmerga forces effectively used their artillery to kill many Iranian soldiers, including Colonel Kalashi, the Iranian regiment commander, and took many prisoners of war. The ambush of an Iranian military column also resulted in the deaths of fifty Iranian soldiers and the capture of Iranian Lieutenant Jahanbani, son of [[General Jahanbani]].&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; However, with his forces withering under the continuous attack, [[Mustafa Barzani]] realized the need to flee Iran and cross the border into Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

The Peshmerga and Barzani leadership crossed into Iraq in two waves, and though successful in overcoming the Iraqi police and ''jash'' forces, whom they met on their way to Barzan, Sheikh Ahmed Barzani was arrested by the Iraqi government and Mustafa Barzani was requested to surrender.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; When the Iraqis began to mobilize troops to seek Mustafa's defeat and surrender, he decided on evacuation towards the Soviet Union. The journey began on May 1947, with the forces of Barzani engaging in skirmishes with the Iranian military on their way.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

On 9 June 1947, the Peshmerga attacked the flank of an army column.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; During the two-pronged attack, led by both Mustafa Barzani and As'ad Khoshavi, the Peshmerga killed hundreds of Iranian soldiers, destroyed several tanks, knocked out an artillery battery and downed an Iranian aircraft.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt; After evading or engaging the Iranian army throughout their trip, the Barzanis, along with over 500 Peshmerga and their families, crossed the [[Araxes River]] into the Soviet Union on 18 June 1947.&lt;ref name=kurdishwarrior/&gt;

==Diplomatic pressure and support==
The United States exerted intense pressure on the Soviet Union in stages to force the withdrawal of the Red Army from Iran and reduce Soviet influence. Following an official US protest, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2|Resolution 2]], on January 30, 1946; the Soviets replied on March 24, 1946 and pledged immediate withdrawal, but in fact remained for a few more weeks.

In a second stage through the spring, the US supported the Iranian complaint against Soviet actions lodged with the Security Council in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 3|Resolution 3]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 5|Resolution 5]].

In a third stage in mid December 1946, the US supported the shah's government in sending the Iranian army to re-occupy Mahabad and Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt; The leaders of the Azerbaijan enclave in Iran fled to the [[Azerbaijan SSR]], and the leaders of the Kurdish Republic were tried and sentenced to death. They were hanged in [[Chwarchira Square]] in the center of Mahabad in 1947.

A fourth stage was initiated in 1947 and centered on the issue of Soviet designs on Iran's northern oil resources. Following the election that year of a new [[Majlis]], the newly elected deputies were reluctant to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement, which had been concluded under duress in March 1946 and had granted the Soviets 51% ownership and ''de facto'' control. On September 11, 1947, US ambassador [[George V. Allen]] publicly decried intimidation and coercion used by foreign governments to secure commercial concessions in Iran, and promised full US support for Iran to freely decide about its own natural resources. With this unequivocal encouragement, the Majlis refused to ratify the Soviet oil agreement on October 22, 1947; the vote was 102 to 2.&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt;

==Cold War==
This conflict was one of the first episodes of the [[Cold War]] outside Europe, and was a factor in the evolving and increasingly contentious [[international relations|political relationship]] between the United States and the Soviet Union, which followed their joint victory in World War II. According to [[George Lenczowski|Lenczowski]], U.S. President Truman's actions laid the foundations of US relations with Iran, and were based on his understanding of the nature of the Soviet system and its expansionist proclivities, as well as on his conviction that Soviet threats and aggression should be [[Containment|contained]], [[Rollback|with force]] if necessary.&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt;

Soviet influence and expansion occurred elsewhere in Southwest Asia also and led to the [[Truman Doctrine]] of the Cold War. Taking Truman's cue, successive US presidents enlarged and refined their policies toward Iran by extending economic and technical assistance, strengthening its military potential, establishing closer cultural ties, and integrating Iran into the regional security system encompassing the other countries of the '[[Central Treaty Organization|Northern Tier]]' of the Middle East and the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="LenczAmPres"/&gt;

'''Jacques Bernard''' (1 September 1658 – 27 April 1718), [[France|French]] [[theologian]] and publicist, who lived his entire academic career in the [[Dutch Republic]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Nyons]] in [[Dauphiné]].
Having studied at [[Geneva]], he returned to France in 1679, and was chosen minister of [[Venterol, Drôme|Venterol]] in Dauphiné. He moved to the church of [[Vinsobres]]. As he continued to preach the reformed doctrines (in opposition to the royal ordinance) he was obliged to leave the country and retired to Holland, where he was appointed one of the pensionary ministers of [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. In July 1686 he began publishing the ''Histoire abregée de l'Europe'' which he continued, monthly, till December 1688. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1692 he began his ''Lettres historiques'', containing an account of the most important events in Europe. He carried on this work till the end of 1688. When [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Le Clerc]] discontinued his ''Bibliothèque universelle'' in 1691, Bernard wrote the greater part of the twentieth volume and the five following volumes. In 1698 he collected and published ''Actes et mémoires des négociations de la paix Ryswick'', in four volumes 12mo.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1699 he began a continuation of [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]]'s ''[[Nouvelles de la republique des lettres]]'', which continued till December 1710. In 1705 he was unanimously elected one of the ministers of the Walloon church at [[Leiden]]; and about the same time he succeeded [[Burchard de Volder|de Volder]] in the chair of philosophy and mathematics at [[university of Leiden|Leiden]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} From 1712 until 1718 he was a [[full professor]] at the University of Leiden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hoogleraren.leidenuniv.nl/id/164 |title=Jacques Bernard |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=Universitaire Bibliotheken Leiden |access-date=15 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1716 he published a supplement to [[Louis Moréri|Moréri]]'s dictionary, in two volumes folio. The same year he resumed his ''Nouvelles de la république des lettres'', and continued it till his death. Besides the works above mentioned, he was the author of two practical treatises, one on late [[repentance]] (1712), the other on the excellence of religion (1714).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''James Ian Craig Boyd''' (31 March 1921 – 20 February 2009) was an English [[author]] and [[narrow-gauge railway]] [[historian]].

Boyd spent a lifetime researching and writing on narrow-gauge railways. His books on narrow-gauge railways in [[North Wales|North]] and [[Mid Wales]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Ireland]] are considered to be standard works on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} His books, published by [[The Oakwood Press]] since 1949, are rarely out of print, reflecting their importance to, and popularity with, railway historians and enthusiasts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Biography==
Boyd was born in 1921 into a family long connected with the [[Scotland|Scottish]] textile machinery industry. His lifelong work was considerably helped by an inheritance from his family, without which much of his work could not have been done.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In his formative years he had [[W. H. Auden]] as an English teacher and was taught mathematics and science by Geoffrey Hoyland, a qualified railway engineer, at [[The Downs School (Colwall)|The Downs School]] in Colwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Boyd-FR1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd was an early volunteer on the [[Talyllyn Railway]] - the first volunteer-run [[heritage railway]] in the world. He organized the first regional working group of volunteers on the Talyllyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Railway Preservation Revolution |page=26 |first=Jonathan |last=Brown |publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Transport Press |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retiring from the textiles industry in the late 1960s, Boyd moved to [[Colwall]] and became a Master at the Downs School. At the same time, he was appointed to look after the [[Downs Light Railway]] and started a twenty-year restoration that would ultimately result in his efforts being recognised with a miniature steam locomotive bearing his name. Boyd later retired from the school, but continued to fight to preserve the railway amidst Headmasters who failed to see the historical and educational importance, and led the formation of the Downs Light Railway Trust in 1983. Boyd continued to oversee the railway up to the millennium, despite suffering a stroke in the 1990s.

==The ''Kangi'' Famine (1229-1232)==
''"Between 1229 and 1232, the Kangi famine struck. Possibly the worst famine in Japanese history, it was caused by unusually cold, damp weather related to world-wide volcanic activity. The weather was so severe that snow fell in central Japan in the summer of 1230, while aristocrats noted days when the sun did not shine and complained because they had to wear heavy clothing even in the spring and summer. The death toll was high—in 1231, in one estate in central Japan about twenty percent of cultivators died in less than a month.''

''Both governments attempted to ameliorate the harsh conditions but to little avail. Law and order broke down; countermeasures against nocturnal marauders and “evil monks” were largely ineffectual. Outlawry even affected relations with the Korean kingdom of Koryō when hungry residents of Kyushu raided the neigh boring peninsula for food. The famine also led to numerous quarrels between on-site warrior landlords and urban proprietors, with many estates unable to pay taxes or organize labor gangs. When harvests were inadequate, warriors also pressured and abused hapless cultivators, driving them from their fields. Both Kyoto and Kamakura took steps to make more grain available to commoners, but the results of their actions were only modest.''

''The most important countermeasure taken to try to reduce the impact of the lengthy crop failure was the legalization of the sale of human beings. When a family was faced with starvation, members might choose to sell children or other kin in return for grain, at the same time ensuring enough to eat for the sellers and the person to be sold. This behavior had been going on illegally for centuries, but its official authorization from 1231 to 1239 showed just how severe the Kangi famine was. The policy helped to spread starving victims around to people who could take care of them, but it also ripped more families asunder.''

''ln addition, all those sold became members of a servile class, dwelling in small lean-tos or perhaps even in a room of their master’s house. These conditions did not encourage large. stable families. The new policy may have saved some lives, but the creation of so many dependent, broken, and poor families helped lower fertility, making recovery from the famine even more difficult. After the famine in 1239, the bakufu tried to abrogate the more lenient laws, without success. The famine expanded the size of the servile class considerably; it was to remain a significant proportion of Japanese society for the next four hundred years[ ... ]"''

This is a '''list of [[circumnavigation]]s''' of the [[planet]] [[Earth]]. Sections are ordered by ascending date of completion of voyage.

==Global circumnavigations==

===Seacraft===
&lt;!-- NOTE: Not all of these may be "ships"--&gt;

====16th century====
* The 18 survivors, led by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|Castilian ('Spanish') expedition]] (which began with 5 ships and 270 men); 1519–1522; westward from Spain; in ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''. After Magellan was killed by people of the [[Philippines]] Lapu-Lapu on 27 April 1521, the circumnavigation was completed under the command of the Basque Spanish seafarer [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] who returned to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, on 6 September 1522, after a journey of 3 years and 1 month.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, Mark. 1999. ''The Basque History of the World''. Walker &amp; Company, New York. {{ISBN|0-8027-1349-1}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; These men were the '''first to circumnavigate the globe in a single expedition'''.
* The survivors of [[García Jofre de Loaísa]]'s Spanish expedition 1525–1536 including [[Andrés de Urdaneta]]; westward from Spain. None of Loaísa's seven ships completed the voyage, but ''Santa María de la Victoria'' reached the [[Moluccas]] before being wrecked in a Portuguese attack. Successive chiefs of the expedition (Loaísa, Elcano, Salazar, Iñiguez, De la Torre) died during the voyages. [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] and other fellow men survived, reaching the [[Spice Islands]] in 1526, to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta and a few of his men returned to Spain in 1536 aboard Portuguese ships via [[Portuguese India|India]], the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and Portugal, and completed the second world circumnavigation in history.
* [[Francis Drake]]; 1577–1580; westward from England; in ''[[Golden Hind]]''; discovered the [[Drake Passage]] but entered the Pacific via the [[Strait of Magellan]]; '''first English circumnavigation''' and the second carried out in a single expedition.

* [[João da Gama]]; 1584 (or 1585)–1590; eastward from Portugal; from Lisbon to India, Malacca, Macau (China) and Japan. Gama crossed the Pacific at a higher northern latitude; was taken prisoner in Mexico and carried in Spanish ships to the Iberian Peninsula. One of the first to do eastwards, mostly by sea.

* [[Francesco Carletti]]; Florentine merchant; 1594–1602; westward from Italy; travelled across the American continent overland, through Panama. All Carletti's other travel was by sea until he ended in the Netherlands; he travelled from there overland back to Italy. Carletti was perhaps the first to travel all legs as a passenger, not as a ship's officer or a crew member. Carletti described his journey in his autobiography, "My Voyage Around the World", translated into various languages.
* [[Joris van Spilbergen]]; 1614–1617; westward from Holland.

'''Ljutovid''' was an independent [[Serbs|Serbian]] ruler of [[Zachlumia|Zahumlje]], in present-day western [[Herzegovina]] and southern [[Croatia]], who flourished in the middle of the 11th century in alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He held the supreme authority of Serbs at that time.&lt;ref name=Stephenson2003&gt;Stephenson 2003, pp. 42-43: "if the idea of developing a ''thema'' of Serbia existed briefly, it was swiftly abandoned and the title ''strategos'' passed to the local aristocracy. In a charter issued July 1039 the Slavic ruler of Zahumlje styled himself "Ljutovit, ''[[protospatharios]] epi tou Chrysotriklinou, [[hypatos]], [[strategos]]'' of [[Rascia|Serbia]] and [[Zahumlje]]." Ljutovid's claim to be strategos not only of Zahumlje, but all Serbia suggests that he had been courted by the emperor, and awarded nominal rights neighbouring lands, including Duklja, which was at the time at war with the empire. Moreover, if we can trust the ''Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja'', our only narrative source, we must conclude that none of the Serbian lands was under direct Byzantine control in 1042. In that year, we are told, the ''ban'' of Bosnia, ''župan'' of Raška, and Slavic ''princeps'' of Zahumlje (Chelmana), Ljutovid, received Byzantine ambassadors offering piles of imperial silver and gold to support imperial efforts against the ruler of neighbouring Duklja, Stefan Vojislav. The use of Latin ''princeps'', rather than ''iupanus'' or ''banus'', to describe Ljutovid, supports the notion that he held the supreme authority among the Serbs at the time."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Hudson''' (born March 14, 1939) is an American economist, Professor of Economics at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] and a researcher at the [[Levy Economics Institute]] at [[Bard College]], former [[Wall Street]] analyst, political consultant, commentator and journalist. He is a contributor to ''The Hudson Report'', a weekly economic and financial news podcast produced by Left Out. [[Paul Craig Roberts]] argues that he is the best contemporary economist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Craig Roberts|Craig Roberts, Paul]] (February 3, 2006). [https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/03/why-michael-hudson-is-the-worlds-best-economist/ "Why Michael Hudson is the World's Best Economist"]. ''[[CounterPunch]]''. Retrieved October 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] (B.A., 1959) and [[New York University]] (MA, 1965, PhD, 1968) and worked as a balance of payment economist in [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] (1964–1968). He was assistant professor of economics at the [[New School for Social Research]] (1969–1972) and worked for various governmental and non-governmental organizations as an economic consultant (1980s–1990s).

Hudson has extensively studied economic theories of many schools, including [[Physiocracy]], [[classical political economy]] ([[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Karl Marx]], among others), [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]], [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]], [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]], [[Modern Monetary Theory]] and many others. He identifies himself as a [[Marxian economics|Marxist economist]], though his interpretation of Marx is almost unique to him and differs from other major Marxists.

Hudson devoted his entire scientific career to the study of [[debt]], both [[Domestic debt|domestic]] ([[loan]]s, [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] and [[Interest|interest payments]]) and [[External debt|external]]. In his works, he consistently advocates the idea that loans and exponentially growing debts that outstrip [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from the [[economy]] of the real sphere are disastrous for both the government and the people of the borrowing state as they wash money (going to payments to [[Usury|usurers]] and [[Economic rent|rentiers]]) from turnover, not leaving them to buy goods and services and thus lead to [[debt deflation]] of the economy. Hudson notes that the existing economic theory (the [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] in particular) is in the service of rentiers and financiers and has developed a special language designed to create the impression that the current ''status quo'' has no alternative. In a false theory, the parasitic encumbrances of a real economy, instead of being deducted in accounting, add up as an addition to GDP ([[gross domestic product]]) and are presented as productive. Hudson sees consumer protection, state support of infrastructure projects and taxation of parasitic rentier sectors of the economy instead of taxing workers as a continuation of the line of classical economists today.

== Biography ==
=== Youth and career choice ===
Hudson was born on March 14, 1939 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Michael (1973). ''Contemporary Authors: A Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Current Authors and Their Works''. Edited by Clare D. Kinsman. Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research. Vol. 33—36. P. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson is a fifth generation American as on the maternal line he has the blood of the [[Ojibwe Indians]]. His father Nathaniel Carlos Hudson (1908–2003) received an economics education at [[Minnesota University]]. After completing his studies in 1929, the year of the [[Great Depression]], his father actively joined the [[trade union]] struggle, became an active [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[trade union]]ist, editor of the ''Northwest Organizer'' and ''The Industrial Organizer'' and wrote articles for other trade union publications. When he was 3 years old, his father was arrested and was subject to the [[Smith Act]], which was aimed at fighting the Trotskyists in the United States.

Hudson received primary and secondary education in a private school at the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]]. After his graduation, he entered the [[University of Chicago]] into two specialties—the main was Germanic philology as an additional history was chosen. In 1959, Hudson graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's degree. After graduation, he worked as an assistant to Jeremy Kaplan at Free Press in Chicago. He managed to obtain the rights to the English-language editions of the works of [[György Lukács]] as well as the rights to the archives and works of [[Leon Trotsky]] after the death of his widow [[Natalia Sedova]].

However, the work on the publishing house was neither interesting nor profitable. As a result, Hudson, who had studied music from his childhood, moved to New York in 1960 in the hope of becoming a pupil of the world-famous conductor [[Dimitris Mitropoulos]], but these plans were not to be realized. In New York, his friend Gavin McFadyen introduced him to the father of his girlfriend, economist Terence McCarthy. At the first meeting, McCarthy took Hudson with his vivid description of the internal interconnection of natural and financial cycles, the nature of money and public debt. Accidental acquaintance became shipborne for Hudson as he refused to study music in favor of studying economics and McCarthy became his spiritual mentor and teacher. Hudson recalled: "And he described it and it was such a beautiful, aesthetic flow of funds that, believe it or not, I got into economics, because it was beautiful and aesthetic. [...] And Terence, I must have talked to him every day for an hour a day for 30 years".

=== Studying the economy and working for banks ===
In 1961, Hudson enrolled in the Economics Department of [[New York University]]. His master's thesis was devoted to the development philosophy of the [[World Bank]] and special attention was paid to credit policy in the agricultural sector. Many years later, Hudson recognized: "The topics that most interested me – and the focus of this book – were not taught at New York University where I took my graduate economics degrees. In fact, they are not taught in any university departments: the dynamics of debt, and how the pattern of bank lending inflates land prices, or national income accounting and the rising share absorbed by rent extraction in the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. There was only one way to learn how to analyze these topics: to work for banks".

To find out how finance works in reality, Hudson in parallel with training at the Faculty of Economics began to work in a bank: "My first job was as mundane as could be imagined: an economist for the Savings Banks Trust Company. No longer existing, it had been created by New York’s then-127 savings banks (now also extinct, having been grabbed, privatized and emptied out by commercial bankers). I was hired to write up how savings accrued interest and were recycled into new mortgage loans. My graphs of this savings upsweep looked like Hokusai’s "Wave," but with a pulse spiking like a cardiogram every three months on the day quarterly dividends were credited".

In 1964, Hudson, who had just received his master's degree in economics, joined [[Chase Manhattan Bank]]'s research economics department as a balance-of-payments specialist. His task was to establish the payment capacity of Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Based on data on their export earnings and other international payments, Hudson had to find out what kind of income the bank could get from the debt payments that these countries had accumulated. He recalled as such: "I soon found that the Latin American countries I analyzed were fully "loaned up." There were no more hard-currency inflows available to extract as interest on new loans or bond issues. In fact, there was capital flight". Among other important tasks that Hudson performed in Chase Manhattan were an analysis of the [[balance of payments]] of the [[Petroleum in the United States|American oil industry]] and the tracking of dirty money that settled in the banks of Switzerland. According to Hudson, this work has given him invaluable experience in understanding how banks and the financial sector work as well as understanding how banking accounting and real life correlate. It was during the study of oil companies' flows (the study was funded by Chase Manhattan and Socony Oil Company) that Hudson met with [[Alan Greenspan]] (future [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]) who acted as an observer for Socony Oil. Hudson recalled that Greenspan had already successfully lobbied the interests of his clients in those years and in the framework of the research tried to provide rough estimates of the American market based on global trends: "Mr. Rockefeller, Chase President, told me to inform Mr. Greenspan that unless he could provide specifically US figures, and/or be forthright about his assumptions, we would have to leave his contribution out of the study".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

Hudson left his job at the bank to complete his doctoral dissertation. His thesis was devoted to American economic and technological thought in the 19th century. It was successfully defended in 1968 and in 1975 it was published under the title "Economics and Technology in the 19th Century American Thought: The Neglected American Economists". In 1968, Hudson joined the major audit company [[Arthur Andersen]], for which he expanded his analysis of payment flows for all areas of American production. He found out that the [[United States deficit]] was manifested only in the military sphere: "My charts revealed that the U.S. payments deficit was entirely military in character throughout the 1960s. The private sector – foreign trade and investment – was exactly in balance, year after year, and "foreign aid" actually produced a dollar surplus (and was required to do so under U.S. law)". However, the accounting system, which was used in the United States after the war, mixed the balance of individuals and state payments-flow into a single balance which successfully concealed the budget deficit. Hudson supposed to divide United States balance of payments into government and private sectors.

In 1968, Hudson published a 100-page brochure titled ''A financial payments-flow analysis of U.S. international transactions, 1960-1968'' in which he pointed out the problems in the modern accounting system and the need to distinguish between state deficits and private payments. After the appearance of the brochure, Hudson was invited to speak to the graduate economics faculty of [[The New School]] in 1969, where it turned out that faculty needed someone to teach [[international trade]] and [[finance]], therefore he was offered the job immediately after the lecture. According to Hudson, he was surprised to find that the university program almost did not address the issues of [[debt]], [[Cash flow|financial flows]], [[money laundering]] and the like. Particular attention that Hudson paid to these issues in his lectures aroused criticism from Economics Department Chairman [[Robert Heilbroner]], who noted that even the teachers do not make such an accent on such issues.

=== Independent analyst ===
In 1972, Hudson published his first major book titled ''Super Imperialism'' in which he showed how the after [[Nixon shock|abandoning the dollar-gold line]] the United States created a unique situation when [[United States Department of the Treasury]] bonds became the sole basis for global reserves and foreign governments had no choice but to finance the budget deficit in the United States and hence their military expenditures. After the publication of the book, Hudson left the institute and moved to work in the think tank [[Hudson Institute]] headed by [[Herman Kahn]]. In 1979, he became an advisor to the [[United Nations Institute for Training and Research]] (UNITAR). He wrote reports for the Ministry of Defense and also acted as a consultant to the Canadian government. His second big book titled ''Global Fracture: The New International Economic Order'' was published in 1977. In it, Hudson argued that the military superiority of the United States led to the division of the world along financial lines.

After the meeting in Mexico where his warning of the [[debt bondage]] that the Latin American countries are getting into caused a storm of protests, he left his job at UNITAR and left the field of modern economy as a whole. Instead, Hudson decided to study the historical roots of debt, how debts were formed in ancient Rome, Greece and Sumer. The painstaking reconstruction of the scattered material led him to a striking conclusion, namely that loans in the ancient Sumer were issued not only by individuals, but initially mainly by temples and palaces. State creditors were interested in the fact that the balance of the economy was not violated, therefore the state did not allow citizens to get into debt bondage in relation to other citizens. Hudson soon became a scientific researcher at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]]. With the help of Harvard scholars, Hudson founded the Institute for the Study of the Establishment of Long-Term Economic Trends and later became the founder of the International Scholars Conference on Ancient Near Eastern Economies which organized a series of innovative symposiums. At the same time, he continues to work as a financial consultant. In 1989, he joined the government bond fund Scudder Stevens and Clark.

In the mid-1990s, Hudson became a Professor of Economics at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] and a fellow at the [[Levy Economics Institute]] at [[Bard College]]. In the early 2000s, he issued a warning that the growing [[inflation]] and the strengthening of [[Mortgage loan|debt mortgage]] bondage will lead to a crisis. Much earlier in the 1980s, Hudson asked several publishers to publish a book in which he would show that the growth of a [[mortgage bubble]] is inevitably leading to a crisis, but publishers refused to print such a work: "They told me that this was like telling people that good sex would stop at an early age". In 2004, Hudson wrote several popular articles for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in which he outlined his vision of the problem. When the [[Great Recession|crisis erupted in 2008]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' named him one of eight economists who foresaw the crisis. Hudson himself argued that the approach of the crisis was seen by everyone except economists from [[Wall Street]].

Currently the director of the Institute for the Study of Long-Term Economic Trends and the Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, actively writes books and makes comments in the press. He is a contributor to ''The Hudson Report'', a weekly economic and financial news podcast produced by Left Out.

== Scientific contributions ==
=== American imperialism and the problem of external loans ===
Hudson devoted his first works to the problem of the gold and foreign exchange reserves and the foreign economic debt of the United States, a subject that his mentor Terence McCarthy had previously dealt with in detail. In his first article titled "Sieve of gold", Hudson turned to an analysis of the disastrous economic consequences that the [[Vietnam War]] entailed. At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that even without war the [[United States economy]] very soon came to a critical point as the welfare of the United States in the postwar years was in many cases provided with a "golden pillow", which was accumulated for interwar and war years. Since 1934 when frightened by [[Adolf Hitler]], Europeans began to buy up United States government securities, thereby shifting their gold and foreign exchange reserves to United States banks. Since 1934, the United States gold and foreign exchange reserves also increased from $7.4 billion to $20.1 billion in 1945. After the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]], an [[International Monetary Fund]] was created within the framework as well as a gold pool that guaranteed that the dollar was as good as gold, capital began to leave the country and move to Europe. Military expenditures accounted for a huge share of the United States budget deficit, which tried in vain ways to prevent further growth in the deficit, on the one hand in every way limiting the flow of gold and on the other hand not allowing foreign central banks to receive gold for the given dollars. Such a policy appealed to European bankers who found such a policy hypocritical, but could not do anything because they were afraid to bring down the dollar and thereby deprive their producers of competitiveness in American markets.

In ''A Financial Payments-Flow Analysis of U.S. International Transactions, 1960-1968'', Hudson showed that United States export statistics erroneously include a class of goods whose transfer abroad does not involve payment at any time from residents of one nation to those of another and which are for this reason not really international transactions at all. Primary among this class of goods are the transfers of aircraft parts and components by the United States. international airlines to their overseas air terminals and installation on their aircraft. These transfers were brought into the host country under bond and therefore were excluded from their import statistics. At the same time, their value was included in the United States export statistics as a credit, therefore the government sector has been in sizable deficit on a payments-flow basis during 1960–1968, resulting mainly from its military operations, but existing account system that mixed government and private flows did not show the existing problem and the source of deficit as well. In his monograph, Hudson made an attempt to divide the United States balance of payments into government and private sectors.

In 1972, Hudson published ''Superimperialism'', which traced the history of the formation of [[American imperialism]] after the end of [[World War I]]. In Hudson's interpretation, [[super-imperialism]] is a stage of [[imperialism]] in which the state does not realize the interests of any group, but it is itself wholly and entirely aimed at imperializing the seizure of other states. Continuing the position outlined in ''A Financial Payments-Flow Analysis of U.S. International Transactions, 1960-1968'', Hudson stressed the aid system formed after the end of [[World War II]] was called upon to solve the problem of the economy. All American foreign politics (including tied aid and debts) were aimed at restraining the [[economic development]] of [[Third World]] countries in those sectors of the economy where the United States was afraid of the emergence of competition. At the same time, the United States actively imposed [[free trade]] policies on [[developing countries]], a policy that was the reverse of the one that led their country to prosperity.

After the cancellation of the conversion of dollars into gold, the United States forced foreign central banks to buy United States treasuries that are used to finance the federal deficit and large military. In exchange for providing a net surplus of assets, commodities, debt financing, goods and services, foreign countries are forced to hold an equal amount of United States treasuries. It drives United States interest rates down, which drives down the dollar's foreign exchange rate.

Hudson views foreign central banks buying treasuries as a legitimate effort to stabilize [[exchange rates]] rather than a [[currency manipulation]]. Foreign central banks could sell the excess dollars on the exchange market which would appreciate their currency, but he calls this a dilemma because it decreases their ability to continue a trade surplus even though it would also increase their purchasing power. He believes keyboard credit and treasury outflows in exchange for foreign assets without a future means for the United States to repay the treasuries and a decreasing value of the dollar is akin to military conquest. He believes balance of payments surplus countries have the right to stabilize exchange rates and expect repayment of the resulting loans even as industry shifts from the United States to creditor nations. He states the [[Washington Consensus]] has encouraged the International Monetary Fund and [[World Bank]] to impose [[austerity]] that the United States itself is not exposed to thanks to dollar dominance, which leads to subjecting other countries to unfair trade that depletes natural resources and privatizing infrastructure that is sold at distressed prices that uses parasitic finance techniques (including Western-style tax breaks) to extract the maximum amount of the country's surplus rather than providing a price-competitive service.

=== Debt in the ancient Near East ===
At the end of the 1980s, Hudson left the field of modern economy and started exploration of history of debt. He found that the first and by far the earliest major creditors were the temples and palaces of [[Bronze Age]] Mesopotamia, not private individuals acting on their own. The rate of interest in each region was not based on productivity, but was set purely for simplicity of calculation in the local system of fractional arithmetic, i.e. 1/60th per month in Mesopotamia and later 1/10th per year for Greece and 1/12th for Rome.

The stability of the state strongly depended on the number of free and dependent people, so the existing restrictions prevented the emergence of personal debt dependence. The proclamations of Clean States had a purpose to improve the economy, saying: "In the early 1990s I had tried to write my own summary, but was unable to convince publishers that the Near Eastern tradition of Biblical debt cancellations was firmly grounded. Two decades ago economic historians and even many Biblical scholars thought that the Jubilee Year was merely a literary creation, a utopian escape from practical reality. I encountered a wall of cognitive dissonance at the thought that the practice was attested to in increasingly detailed Clean Slate proclamations".

According to Hudson, instead of a sanctity of debt what was sacred was the regular cancellation of agrarian debts and freeing of bondservants in order to preserve social balance. Such amnesties were not destabilizing, but they were essential to preserving social and economic stability.

=== Domestic debts and debt deflation of economy ===
From the beginning of 2000s, Hudson pays special attention to the issues of inflating [[fictitious capital]], which entails the withdrawal of funds from the real economy and leads to [[debt deflation]]. He states finance has been key to guiding politics into reducing the productive capacity of the United States and Europe even as theey benefit from finance methods using similar and expanded techniques to harm Chile, Russia, Latvia and Hungary. Hudson states parasitic finance looks at industry and labor to determine how much wealth it can extract by fees, interest and tax breaks, rather than providing needed capital to increase production and efficiency. He states the magic of compounding interest results in increasing debt that eventually extracts more wealth than production and labor are able to pay. Rather than extracting taxes from the rentiers to reduce the cost of labor and assets and use the tax revenue to improve infrastructure to increase production efficiency, he states the [[Taxation in the United States|United States tax system]], [[Bailout|bank bailouts]] and [[quantitative easing]] sacrifice labor and industry for the benefit of the finance sector. According to Hudson, bankers and rentiers as early as 1880s started to search ways to rationalize untaxing and deregulating finance, real estate and monopolies. They succeed in the 1980s with establishing a [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Washington consensus that states "everyone is worth what they get" so there is no "unearned increment" to be untaxed.

Hudson stresses that world victory of neoliberal politics is closely connected with its educational support in all big universities. It is telling that one of the first acts of the [[Chicago Boys]] in Chile after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military junta overthrew the Allende government in 1973]] was to close down every economics department in the nation outside of the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|Catholic University]], which was a [[University of Chicago]] [[Monetarism|monetarist]] stronghold. The junta then closed down every social science department and fired, exiled or murdered critics of its ideology in the terrorist [[Operation Condor|Project Condor]] program waged throughout Latin America and spread to political assassination in the United States itself. What the Chicago Boys recognized is that [[free market]] ideology requires totalitarian control of the school and university system, totalitarian control of the press and control of the police where intellectual resistance survives against the idea that economic planning should become much more centralized, but moved out of the hands of government into those of the bankers and other financial institutions, stating: "Free market ideology ends up as political Doublethink in countering any freedom of thought. Its remarkable success in the United States and elsewhere thus has been achieved largely by excluding the history of economic thought – and of economic history – from the economics curriculum".

=== Position on Karl Marx and Marxian economics ===
Hudson identifies himself as a [[Marxist economist]], but his interpretation of [[Karl Marx]] is different from most other Marxists. Whilst other Marxists emphasise upon the contradiction of [[wage labour]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] as the core issue of today [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist world]], Hudson rejects that idea and believes parasitic forms of finance have warped the [[political economy]] of the modern [[capitalism]]. Hudson points to Marx' view of capitalism as the historic force that tends to eliminate all forms of pre-capitalist [[rent seeking]], i.e. [[land rent]], [[monopoly rent]] and [[Usury|financial rent]] (usury). The original meaning of a free market as discussed by [[Classical economics|classical political economists]] was a [[Market (economics)|market]] free from all forms of [[Economic rent|rent]]. The gist of classical political economy was to distinguish earned and unearned income (also known as rent or [[free lunch]]). He then reminds us that unlike Marx' optimistic expectation, history did not go in that direction and today modern capitalism is dominated by rentier classes. The concept of the [[proletariat]] as a class for itself presupposes a rent-free society, saying that "wages have been going no where recently, I hope you've been making a killing on your house price!". The other form of rent is imperialist rent, flowing from underdeveloped countries to developed ones. All of these forces distort the political economy of the modern capitalism, pushing labour-capital contradiction to the background and bringing other issues to the foreground. This is as if instead of progress, history has regressed back to a [[Neo-feudalism|neo-feudal]] system.

Although Hudson's views are unpopular amongst other Marxists and sometimes vehemently rejected by them, his views converge with later writings of Marx himself. Hudson quibbles that most Marxists never go beyond ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', where Marx assumes there is a rent-free market where all [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]] are sold at their values. That is how Marx deduces the [[Marx's theory of exploitation|exploitative nature of capitalism]] and labour-capital dichotomy as its underlying contradiction, but in ''[[Capital, Volume II]]'' and ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'' he relaxes his assumptions and discovers other contradictions that are much closer to what can be observed in today's economic system. In ''Capital, Volume III'', Marx discusses the tendency of productivity and supply to increase at a faster pace than the consumption power and demand. Marx also revised his earlier ideas as he studied and learned more about the asymmetric development of capitalism. This ultimately led him to soften his [[revolution]]ary tone as he realized how dominance of an [[Developed country|industrially advanced nations]] over [[underdeveloped nation]]s and blocks revolutionary tendencies amongst working classes of dominating nations. On the other side, Marx clashed with [[Karl Schapper]], suggesting that the idea of workers taking over the state power ends up in disaster because they are not ready to practice that power.

Obliging foreign central banks to keep their monetary reserves in Treasury bonds forced them to finance military spending abroad, which was responsible for the balance-of-payments deficit at that time.

== ISCANEE ==
In 1984, Hudson joined Harvard's [[archaeology]] faculty at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] as a research fellow in [[Babylon]]ian economics. A decade later, he was a founding member of ISCANEE (International Scholars Conference on Ancient Near Eastern Economies), an international group of Assyriologists and archaeologists that has published a series of colloquia analyzing the economic origins of civilization. This group has become the successor to [[Karl Polanyi]]’s anthropological and historical group of a half-century ago. Four volumes co-edited by Hudson have appeared so far, dealing with privatization, urbanization and land use, the origins of money, accounting, debt and clean slates in the ancient Near East (a fifth volume on the evolution of free labor is in progress). This new direction in research is now known as the [[New Economic Archaeology]].

'''Mididi''' ({{lang-xpu|𐤌𐤃𐤃𐤌}}, {{smallcaps|mddm}}, or {{lang|xpu|𐤌𐤃𐤃𐤉𐤌}}, {{sc|mddym}}){{sfnp|Ghaki|2015|p=67}} was a [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement during [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], located at what is now [[Henchir-Medded]], [[Tunisia]].

==History==
Mididi was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Byzacena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d3m16.html Entry] at www.catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diocese==
There are two [[bishop]]s attributable to Mididi. The Catholic bishop Serenian attended the [[Council of Carthage (411)|411 Council of Carthage]] between the Catholic  and [[Donatist]] bishops of [[Roman North Africa]]. On that occasion, the [[cathedra|seat]] had no Donatist bishops. Eubodio took part in the [[Council of Carthage (484)|484 Synod of Carthage]] convened by the [[Arianism|Arian]] king [[Huneric]], after which Eubodio was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1157.htm entry] at  www.gcatholic.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], ([[Leipzig]], 1931), p.&amp;nbsp;467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Antonio Morcelli, [https://books.google.it/books?id=dO4-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA227 ''Africa christiana''], Volume I, Brescia 1816, p.&amp;nbsp;227&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fulgentius of Ruspe]] also founded a [[monastery]] near Mididi at the beginning of the [[6th century]].

Today Mididi survives as a [[titular bishop]]ric:

* Luís Gonzaga Fernandes (1965–1981)
*[[César Bosco Vivas Robelo]] (1981–1991)
*[[Luis Gleisner Wobbe]] (1991–), auxiliary bishop of La Serena.

After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottomans and the following trends of Greek migration to the [[Greek diaspora|diaspora]], Greek architecture was concentrated mainly on the Greek Orthodox churches of Diaspora. These churches, such as other intellectual centres built by Greeks (foundations, schools, etc.), was used also as a meeting-place. The architectural style of these buildings was heavily influenced by the western European architecture.

After the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the creation of the modern Greek state, the modern Greek architecture tried to combine the traditional Greek architecture and Greek elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. 

The 19th-century architecture of [[Athens]] and other cities of the [[Greek Kingdom]] is mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]], with architects such as  [[Theophil Hansen]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Panagis Kalkos]] and [[Stamatios Kleanthis]].

==History==
[[File:Ακαδημία Αθηνών 5242-1.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Interior of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens.]]]]
The architecture of the modern Greek cities, especially the old centres ("old towns") is mostly influenced either by the [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] or the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] architecture, two forces that dominated the Greek space from the [[early modern period]].

After the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.

Two special genres can be considered the [[Cycladic architecture]], featuring white-colour houses, in the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Epirotic architecture]] in the region of [[Epirus]].

After the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], the [[architecture]] of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]]. For Athens, the first [[King of Greece]], [[Otto of Greece]], commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In 1917 most of [[Thessaloniki]]'s old center of the city was destroyed by the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]]. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton [[Thomas Mawson]], and headed by French architect [[Ernest Hébrard]].

In 1933 was signed the [[Athens Charter]], a manifesto of the modernist movement which published later by [[Le Corbusier]]. Architects of this movement were among others the [[Bauhaus]]-architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, [[Dimitris Pikionis]], [[Patroklos Karantinos]] and Takis Zenetos.

In 1929, two important laws concerning apartment buildings took effect. The law about "horizontal property" made it possible that many different owners own one apartment building, each by owning one or more apartment units. Theoretically, each apartment corresponds to a percentage of the original plot. The most important effect of this law was the practice of "αντιπαροχή" (''[[antiparochì]]'', literally "a supply in exchange"). With ''antiparochi'', the owner of a plot, who can't afford to build an apartment building by himself, makes a contract with a construction company so that the latter will build the apartment building but keep the ownership of as many apartments as the contract states. Although during the interwar period the practice of ''antiparochi'' was limited, as the construction of most apartment buildings was financed solely by the original owners of the plot, ''antiparochi'' became the most common method for financing the construction of condominiums (polykatoikìes) from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt; However this practice had the negative effect of the destruction of many old-era buildings and houses in the major Greek cities, just to be replaced by common appartment buildings.

After [[World War II]] and the [[Greek civil war]], the massive construction of [[condominium]]s in the major Greek city-centres was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first scycrapers were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the [[OTE Tower]] and the [[Athens Tower 1|Athens Tower Complex]].

[[File:Acropolis Museum - Night.jpg|thumb|24ppx|The [[Acropolis Museum]]]]

During the 1960s and 1970s, ''[[Xenia (Hotel)|Xenia]]'' was a nationwide hotel construction program initiated by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation (Ελληνικός Οργανισμός Τουρισμού, EOT) to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. It constitutes one of the largest infrastructure projects in modern Greek history. The first manager of the project was the architect Charalambos Sfaellos (from 1950 to 1958) and from 1957 the buildings were designed by a team under [[Aris Konstantinidis]].
Famous foreign architects who have also designed buildings in Greece during the 20th and 21st century, include [[Walter Gropius]], [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Mario Botta]]. Several new buildings were also constructed by [[Santiago Calatrava]] for the 2004 [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]], while [[Bernard Tschumi]]  designed the [[New Acropolis Museum]]. Recently in 2012 [[Renzo Piano]] designed the [[Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center]] (completed in 2016).

'''Málaga''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|ə|g|ə}}, {{IPA-es|ˈmalaɣa|lang}}) is a [[municipality]], capital of the [[Province of Málaga]], in the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]] of [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. With a population of 569,130 in 2015,&lt;ref name="BOE"/&gt; it is the second-most populous city of Andalusia and the [[List of municipalities of Spain|sixth-largest in Spain]]. The southernmost large city in Europe, it lies on the [[Costa del Sol]] (''Coast of the Sun'') of the [[Mediterranean]], about {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=off|lk=out}} east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and about {{convert|130|km|2|abbr=on}} north of Africa.

Málaga's history spans about 2,800 years, making it one of the [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|oldest cities in the world]]. It was founded by the [[Phoenicians]] as ''Malaka'' about 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC was under the [[hegemony]] of [[Ancient Carthage]]. Then, from 218 BC, it was ruled by the [[Roman Republic]] and later the [[Roman Empire]] as ''Malaca'' ([[Latin]]). After the fall of the empire and the end of Visigothic rule, it was under Islamic rule as ''Mālaqah'' ('''مالقة''') for 800 years, but in 1487, the Crown of Castille gained control after the [[Reconquista]]. The archaeological remains and monuments from the Phoenician, Roman, Arabic and Christian eras make the historic center of the city an "open museum", displaying its history of nearly 3,000 years.

This important cultural infrastructure and the artistic heritage have culminated in the nomination of Málaga as a candidate for the 2016 [[European Capital of Culture]].

The painter and sculptor [[Pablo Picasso]], Hebrew poet and Jewish philosopher [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol]] and the actor [[Antonio Banderas]] were born in Málaga. The magnum opus of Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona, "[[Malagueña (song)|Malagueña]]", is named after the music of this region of Spain.

The most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and [[logistics]] are beginning to expand. The [[Andalusia Technology Park|Andalusia Technology Park (PTA)]], located in Málaga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992. Málaga is the main economic and financial centre of southern Spain, home of the [[Andalusia|region]]'s largest bank, [[Unicaja]], and the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in [[Economy of Spain|Spain]] behind [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].&lt;ref name="anuarieco.lacaixa.comunicacions.com"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
{{Main|History of Málaga|Timeline of Málaga}}
[[File:La malagueña by Julio Romero de Torres.jpg|150px|thumb|left|''La malagueña'' (1919) by [[Julio Romero de Torres]]]]
The [[Phoenicians]] from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] founded the city as '''Malaka''' about 770 BC. The name ''Malaḥa'' or ''mlḥ'' is probably derived from the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word for "salt" because [[saltfish|fish was salted]] near the harbour. (Cf. "[[salt]]" in other [[Semitic language]]s, e.g. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מלח ''mélaḥ'' or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ملح ''malaḥ'').

After a period of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] rule, Malaka became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. In its Roman stage, the city (Latin name, Malaca) showed a remarkable degree of development. Transformed into a confederated city, it was under a special law, the ''[[Lex Flavia Malacitana]]''. A Roman theatre was built at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Leucona, Emilio. «Jornadas de estudio por el 150 aniversario del hallazgo de la Lex Flavia Malacitana». Consulted on 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was ruled first by the [[Visigoths]] and then by the [[Spania|Byzantine Empire]] (550–621). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}. It was regained by the Visigoths in 621 and ruled by them until the [[Umayyad]] Muslim conquest in 711.

In the 8th century, during the [[Muslim]] [[Arabic]] rule over Spain, the city became an important trade center. Málaga was first a possession of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]]. After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] dynasty, it became the capital of a distinct kingdom ruled by the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]]. During this time, the city was called '''Mālaqah''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''مالقة'''). From 1025 it was the capital of the autonomous [[Taifa of Málaga]], until its conquest by the [[Emirate of Granada]] in 1239.

The traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], who passed through around 1325, characterised it as "one of the largest and most beautiful towns of Andalusia [uniting] the conveniences of both sea and land, and is abundantly supplied with foodstuffs and fruits". He praised its grapes, figs, and almonds; "its ruby-coloured Murcian [[pomegranate]]s have no equal in the world." Another exported product was its "excellent gilded pottery". The town's mosque was large and beautiful, with "exceptionally tall orange trees" in its courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1354-ibnbattuta.html |title=Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa |publisher=Fordham.edu |date=21 February 2001 |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Braun Malaga UBHD.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Málaga in 1572: Castle of [[Gibralfaro]] (center)]]
Málaga was one of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] cities where Muslim rule persisted the longest, having been part of the Emirate of Granada. While most other parts of the peninsula had already been won back during the [[reconquista]], the Moors still occupied Málaga. Málaga was retaken by Christian forces on 18 August 1487,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= de Madariaga |first= Salvador |title= La vida del muy magnífico señor Don Cristóbal Colón |language= Spanish|page=222 |edition= 5th |location= Mexico |publisher= Editorial Hermes |year= 1952 |authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga |quote= Málaga, ciudad que acabara de tomar a los moros (18 de agosto)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim inhabitants resisted assaults and artillery bombardments before hunger forced them to surrender, virtually the entire population was sold into slavery or given as "gifts" to other Christian rulers,&lt;ref&gt;Blood and Faith: The Purging of Muslim Spain, Matthew Carr, page 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; five years before the fall of [[Granada]].

On 24 August 1704 the indecisive [[Battle of Málaga (1704)|Battle of Málaga]], the largest naval battle in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], took place in the sea south of Málaga.

After the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup of July 1936]] the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] retained control of Málaga. Its harbour was a base of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] at the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. It suffered heavy bombing by Italian warships which took part in breaking the Republican navy's [[blockade]] of Nationalist-held [[Spanish Morocco]] and took part in naval bombardment of Republican-held Málaga.&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Sebastian; Preston, Paul (2009). ''Spain and the great powers in the twentieth century.'' London, UK; New York, USA: Routledge. p. 172. {{ISBN|978-0-415-18078-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Battle of Málaga and the [[Francoist]] takeover in February 1937, over seven thousand people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Beevor]], ''The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. 2006, {{ISBN|0-297-84832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also suffered shelling later by Spanish Republican naval units. The well-known British journalist and writer [[Arthur Koestler]] was captured by the Nationalist forces on their entry into Málaga, which formed the material for his book ''[[Spanish Testament]]''. The first chapters of ''[[Spanish Testament]]'' include an eye-witness account of the 1937 fall of Málaga to [[Francisco Franco]]'s armies during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

After the war, Málaga and Koestler's old haunts of [[Torremolinos]] and the rest of the Costa del Sol enjoyed the highest growth of the tourism sector in Spain.

==Geography==
===Location===
[[File:Roman Malaga.jpg|thumb|The Roman theatre of Málaga]]
Málaga is located in southern Spain, on the Costa del Sol (''Coast of the Sun'') on the northern side of the Mediterranean Sea. It lies at the feet of the [[Montes de Málaga]], about {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and about {{convert|130|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Tarifa]] (the southernmost point of continental Europe) and about {{convert|130|km|0|abbr=in}} to the north of Africa.

===Metropolitan area===
The urban area, stretching mostly along a narrow strip of coastline, has a population of 1,066,532 on {{convert|827.33|km²|2|abbr=out}} (density 1,289 hab / km² – 2012 data). It is formed by Málaga proper together with the following adjacent towns and municipalities: [[Rincón de la Victoria]], [[Torremolinos]], [[Benalmádena]], [[Fuengirola]], [[Alhaurín de la Torre]], [[Mijas]], [[Marbella]] and [[San Pedro de Alcántara|San Pedro Alcántara]]. The Málaga metropolitan area includes additional municipalities located mostly in the mountains area north of the coast and also some on the coast: [[Cártama]], [[Pizarra]], [[Coín]], [[Monda]], [[Ojén]], [[Alhaurín el Grande]] and [[Estepona]] on west; [[Casabermeja]] on north; [[Totalán]], [[Algarrobo, Spain|Algarrobo]], [[Torrox]] and [[Vélez-Málaga]] eastward from Málaga.[[File:Malaga densidad poblacion.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of [[Province of Málaga|Málaga province]], centered Málaga urban area (Málaga, [[Rincón de la Victoria]], [[Torremolinos]], [[Benalmádena]], [[Fuengirola]], [[Marbella]] – density &gt;1000/km² and [[Mijas]], [[Alhaurín de la Torre]])]] Municipalities of the metropolitan area are connected by the road network (including motorways) with the urban area and Málaga city (the urban area can be reached by car from the farthest reaches in 20 minutes and Málaga city in 45 minutes). In some usages the metropolitan area includes other municipalities to which Málaga's public transport network extends, at least since the establishment of the [[:es:Consorcio de Transporte Metropolitano del Área de Málaga|Consorcio de Transporte Metropolitano del Área de Málaga]] (en: ''Consortium of Transportation of Málaga Metropolitan Area''). Together about 1.3 million (max. 1.6 million&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&amp;lang=en "''Population by sex and age groups''"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822103143/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&amp;lang=en |date=22 August 2016 }} – [[Eurostat]], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;) people live in the Málaga metropolitan area and the number grows every year as all the municipalities and cities of the area record an annual increase in population.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with very mild winters and hot summers. Málaga enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of about 300 days of sunshine and only about 40-45 with precipitation annually. Its coastal location with winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea make the heat manageable during the summer.&lt;ref name="malaga.com/geo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaga.com/v/geography/ |title=Málaga City – Local Travel Information and City Guide |publisher=Malaga.com |date= |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Málaga experiences the warmest winters of any European city with a population over 500,000. The average temperature during the day in the period December through February is {{convert|17|-|18|C|F}}. During the winter, the [[Montes de Málaga|Málaga Mountains (''Montes de Málaga'')]] block out the cold weather from the north.&lt;ref name="malaga.com/geo"/&gt; Generally, the summer season lasts about eight months, from April to November, although in the remaining four months temperatures sometimes surpass {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Its average annual temperature is {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day  and {{convert|13.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. In the coldest month, January, the temperature ranges from {{convert|13|to|20|C|F}} during the day, {{convert|5|to|13|C|F}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|16|-|17|C|F}}. In the warmest month, August, the temperature ranges from {{convert|26|to|34|C|F}} during the day, above {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded at the airport is {{convert|44.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on 18 July 1978. In the month of August 1881, the average reported daytime maximum temperature was a record {{convert|34.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

==Main sights==

The old historic centre of Málaga reaches the harbour to the south. In the north it is surrounded by mountains, the [[Montes de Málaga]] (part of the [[Baetic Cordillera]]) lying in the southern base of the Axarquía hills, and two rivers, the [[Guadalmedina]] – the historic center is located on its left bank – and the [[Guadalhorce]], which flows west of the city into the Mediterranean, in the Churriana district.

The oldest architectural remains in the city are the walls of the Phoenician city, which are visible in the cellar of the [[Museo Picasso Málaga]].

The Roman theatre of Málaga, which dates from the 1st century BC, was rediscovered in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/spain/34979/Malaga-attractions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623203834/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/spain/34979/Malaga-attractions.html |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malaga Alcazaba 25-9-2007a.JPG|thumb|View of the old [[Alcazaba (Málaga)|Alcazaba]]]]

The Moors left posterity the dominating presence of the [[Gibralfaro|Castle of Gibralfaro]], which is connected to the [[Alcazaba of Málaga|Alcazaba]], the lower fortress and royal residence. Both were built during the [[Taifa of Málaga|Taifa]] period (11th century) and extended during the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] period (13th and 14th centuries). The Alcazaba stands on a hill within the city. Originally, it defended the city from the incursions of pirates. Later, in the 11th century, it was completely rebuilt by the [[Hammudid dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3938885 Dialnet.es, Fanny de Carranza Sell, ''La alcazaba de Málaga. Historia a través de su imagen'', 2011.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410164512/http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3938885 |date=10 April 2016 }} (''In Spanish'')&lt;/ref&gt; Occupying the eastern hillside that rises from the sea and overlooks the city, the Alcazaba was surrounded by palms and pine trees.

Like many of the military fortifications that were constructed in Islamic Spain, the Alcazaba of Málaga featured a quadrangular plan. It was protected by an outer and inner wall, both supported by rectangular towers, between which a covered walkway led up the slope to the Gibralfaro (this was the only exchange between the two sites). Due to its rough and awkward hillside topography, corridors throughout the site provided a means of communications for administrative and defensive operations, also affording privacy to the palatial residential quarters.

The entrance of the complex featured a grand tower that led into a sophisticated double bent entrance. After passing through several gates, open yards with beautiful gardens of pine and eucalyptus trees, and the inner wall through the Puerta de Granada, one finds the 11th- and 14th-century Governor's palace. It was organised around a central rectangular courtyard with a triple-arched gateway and some of the rooms have been preserved to this day. An open 11th-century mirador (belvedere) to the south of this area affords views of the gardens and sea below. Measuring {{convert|2.5|m2|abbr=off}}, this small structure highlighted scalloped, five-lobed arches. To the north of this area were a waterwheel and a Cyclopean well (penetrating {{convert|40|m|ft|disp=or|spell=in|abbr=off}} below ground), a hammam, workshops and the monumental ''Puerta de la Torre del Homenaje'', the northernmost point of the inner walls. Directly beyond was the passage to the Gibralfaro above.

The [[:es:Iglesia de Santiago Apóstol (Málaga)|Church of Santiago]] ([[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]]) is an example of Gothic vernacular [[Mudéjar]], the hybrid style that evolved after the [[Reconquista]] incorporating elements from both Christian and Islamic tradition. Also from the period is the ''Iglesia del Sagrario'', which was built on the site of the old mosque immediately after the city fell to Christian troops. It boasts a richly ornamented portal in the Isabeline-Gothic style, unique in the city.

[[File:Spain Andalusia Malaga BW 2015-10-24 14-17-02.jpg|thumb|The [[Málaga Cathedral|Cathedral]] of the Incarnation]]

The [[Málaga Cathedral|Cathedral]] and the [[:es:Palacio Episcopal de Málaga|Episcopal Palace]] were planned with Renaissance architectural ideals but there was a shortfall of building funds and they were finished in Baroque style.

The ''[[:es:Santuario de la Victoria (Málaga)|Basílica y Real Santuario de Santa María de la Victoria]]'', built in the late 17th century, has a chapel in which the vertical volume is filled with elaborate Baroque plasterwork.

[[File:Palacio de Ferias y Congresos de Málaga.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Trade Fair and Congress in Málaga (''Palacio de Ferias y Congresos de Málaga'')]]
Málaga is the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in [[Economy of Spain|Spain]] behind [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].&lt;ref name="anuarieco.lacaixa.comunicacions.com"/&gt;

The most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and [[logistics]] are beginning to expand. The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA) (In Spanish, "''Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía''"), located in Málaga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992 by the [[King of Spain]]. In 2018, this high-tech, science and industrial park employs over 16,774 workers, according to its own numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pta.es/en/the_pta_in_numbers.cfm#.W2n-KtgzYWo |title=The PTA in numbers |publisher=www.pta.es |date= |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the city's strategic plan, the campaign "Málaga: Open for Business" is directed towards the international promotion of the city on all levels but fundamentally on a business level. The campaign places a special emphasis on new technologies as well as innovation and research in order to promote the city as a reference and focal point for many global business initiatives and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malaga/2009/09/22/malaga-llama-puerta-mundo-empresarial-anglosajon/290690.html |title=Málaga calls on the doors of the Anglo-saxon business world |publisher=Laopiniondemalaga.es |date= |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Málaga is a city of commerce and tourism has been a growing source of revenue, driven by the presence of a major airport, the improvement of communications, and new infrastructure such as the AVE and the maritime station, and new cultural facilities such as the Picasso Museum, the Contemporary Art Centre and Trade Fair and Congress, which have drawn more tourists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malagahorizonte2012.es/proyectos/home.asp?tema=25 Málaga Horizonte 2012]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city hosts the International Association of Science and Technology Parks (IASP) (''Asociación Internacional de Parques Tecnológicos''), and a group of IT company executives and business leaders has launched an information sector initiative, Málaga Valley e-27, which seeks to make Málaga the Silicon Valley of Europe. Málaga has had strong growth in new technology industries, mainly located in the Technological Park of Andalusia, and in the construction sector. The city is home to the largest bank in Andalusia, [[Unicaja]], and such local companies as ''Mayoral'', ''Charanga'', ''Sando'', ''Vera'', ''Ubago'', ''Isofoton'', ''Tedial'', ''Novasoft'', ''Grupo Vértice'' and ''Almeida viajes'', and other multinationals such as [[Fujitsu]] Spain, [[Pernod Ricard]] Spain, [[Accenture]], [[Epcos]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Huawei]] and [[Mahou-San Miguel Group|San Miguel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pta.es/publico/jsp/herramientas/lstHerramientaEmpresas.jsp?ch=106&amp;cp=1 Empresas en el PTA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072324/http://www.pta.es/publico/jsp/herramientas/lstHerramientaEmpresas.jsp?ch=106&amp;cp=1 |date=4 March 2016 }} – Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel prize-winner [[Bruce Beutler]] is planning to set up the biggest [[mutagenesis]] research laboratory in the world in Malaga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/esandalucia/malaga/noticia-malaga-compite-dallas-shanghai-acoger-laboratorio-investigacion-genetica-20160923140946.html |title=Málaga compite con Dallas y Shanghai en acoger un laboratorio de investigación genética |language=Spanish |date=23 September 2016 |access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Annual cultural events===
[[File:Bailaordeverdiales.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Verdiales]] dancer in [[Feria de Agosto|August Málaga Fair]]]]
[[File:CristodelaRedenciónoriginal.jpg|thumb|185px|[[Holy week in Málaga]]]]
The [[Holy Week in Málaga|Holy Week]] celebration, the [[Feria de Agosto|August Málaga Fair]] (''Feria de Málaga'') and the [[Málaga Film Festival]] are the three major events held in the city.

Holy Week has been observed for five centuries in Málaga. Processions start on Palm Sunday and continue until Easter Sunday. Images depicting scenes from the Passion are displayed on huge ornate ''tronos'' (floats or thrones), some weighing more than {{convert|50,00|kg|abbr=off}}. Famous is the royal [[Confraternity|archbrotherhood]] of Our-Lady of Hope ''Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza''. They have more than 5,000 members and 600 [[nazarenos]]. 
These ''tronos'' highlight the processions that go through the streets led by penitents dressed in long robes, with [[capirote]], followed by women in black carrying candles. Drums and trumpets play music and occasionally someone spontaneously sings a mournful saeta dedicated to the floats as they make their way slowly round the streets.
Some Holy Week ''tronos'' are so huge that they must be housed in places outside the churches, as they are taller than the entrance doors. Famous is the military procession of "[[La Legion|la legion]]" (Royal congregation of Mena) playing marches and singing their anthem (El Novio de la Muerte) during procession.

During the celebration of the ''Feria de Málaga'' in August, the streets are transformed into traditional symbols of Spanish culture and history, with sweet wine, tapas, and live flamenco shows. The day events consist of dancing, live music (like [[Flamenco]] or ''Verdiales'', traditional music from Málaga) and bullfights at ''La Malagueta'', while the night fair is moved to the Recinto Ferial, consisting of restaurants, clubs, and an entire fair ground with rides and games.

The [[Málaga Film Festival]] (''Festival de Málaga Cine Español (FMCE)''), dedicated exclusively to films produced in Spain, is one of the most important festivals in the country. It is held annually during a week in March or April.

===Religion===
Most of the population of Málaga professes [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Roman Catholicism]] as its religion, although not many are practising Catholics. [[Protestantism in Spain|Protestants]] also have a presence in Málaga: one of seven congregations of the [[Reformed Churches in Spain]] is based in the city and is the only one that permits [[paedocommunion]], while [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is growing.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Islam]] is represented by a growing number of [[immigrants]] and a mosque, while the [[Judaism in Spain|Jewish community]] (primarily [[Sephardi]]) is represented by its synagogue and the Jewish Association.

===Sports===

===Tourism===
[[File:CalleMarinGarciaMalaga.jpg|185px|thumb|Strachan Street in downtown]]
The city is an important tourist destination, known as "the capital of the Costa del Sol". An estimated 6 million tourists visit the city each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaga.com/v/city_info/ |title=Málaga City Information |publisher=Malaga.com |date= |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists usually visit the birthplace of [[Pablo Picasso]] and the [[Museo Picasso Málaga]], the Carmen Thyssen Museum, the old town or the beaches. The Málaga harbour is also the second busiest cruise port of the Iberian Peninsula.

A popular walk leads up the hill to the [[Gibralfaro]] castle (a [[Parador]]), offering panoramic views over the city. The castle is next to the [[Alcazaba]], the old Muslim palace, which in turn is next to the inner city of Málaga. Other nearby attractions are the Roman Theatre, the old Jewish quarter, the Cathedral, and the Church of Santiago in [[mudéjar style]]. A popular walk follows the ''Paseo del Parque'' (a promenade that runs alongside a grand park with many palm trees and statues) to the harbour, ending in ''Calle Larios'', the main commercial street of the city. There is also a curious museum, the Museum of the Holy Week, which includes an impressive display of Baroque ecclesiastical items.

===Other events===
The ''Fiesta Mayor de Verdiales'' takes place every year on 28 December during which Spain's April Fool Day is celebrated.&lt;ref name="Málaga Festivals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaga.com/v/festivals/ |title=Málaga Festivals |publisher=Malaga.com |date= |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Fiestas de Carnaval'', in which people dress in all types of costumes, takes place prior to the holy 40 days of Lent every February. A contest is held in the ''Teatro Cervantes'' between groups of singers, quartets and choirs who compete in the singing of ironic songs about social and political issues. The Carnival takes to the streets of Málaga on the week before Ash Wednesday, ending on Malagueta beach with the burial of the anchovy (''entierro de la sardina'').&lt;ref name="Málaga Festivals"/&gt;

==Education==

===Bilingual education in schools===
Since the launch of the ‘Plan de Fomento del Plurilingüismo’ in 2005, 169 schools in Malaga have included bilingual education in their programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/educacion-00651/noticia-cuatro-nuevos-colegios-incorporaran-red-centros-bilingues-provincia-malaga-proximo-curso-20180413142023.html |title=Cuatro nuevos colegios se incorporarán a la Red de centros bilingües de Málaga |publisher=europapress.es |date= |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although English is the most usual second language, many other primary and secondary schools in Malaga offer the choice of French, German, Arab, Portuguese or Chinese.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2014">'''Nathan ben Isaac ha-[[Kohen]] ha-Babli''' was a [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonian Jewish]] historian of the 10th century. He was the author of a history of the exilarchate that gives many interesting details in regard to the [[exilarch]]s, particularly his contemporary [[Mar Ukba]]. Extracts from this history were published by [[Samuel Shullam]] in his edition of [[Zacuto]]'s ''Yuḥasin'' ([[Constantinople]], 1546), as well as by [[A. Neubauer]] (''M. J. C.'' ii. 83 et seq.). Shullam's work is the only surviving source for Nathan's history other than an Arabic fragment published by [[Israel Friedlander]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Quarterly Review]] vol 17 pp. 747-761.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Nathan ben Jehiel]] of Rome, the author of the ''Arukh,'' is quoted in Zacuto's ''Yuḥasin'' (ed. Filipowski, p.&amp;nbsp;174, London, 1856) as "Nathan ha-Babli of Narbonne," [[Heinrich Graetz|H. Grätz]] (''Gesch.'' 3d ed., v. 288, 469-471) mistook the latter for Nathan ben Isaac ha-Kohen ha-Babli and ascribed to him an ''Arukh'' similar to that written by Nathan b. Jehiel. Grätz even went so far as to identify Nathan ben Isaac with the fourth of the four prisoners captured by [[Ibn Rumaḥis]] (see [[Ḥushiel ben Elhanan]]), assuming that he settled afterward at [[Narbonne]].

'''Ram Khamhaeng''' ({{lang-th|รามคำแหง}}) or '''Pho Khun Ram Khamhaeng''' ({{lang-th|พ่อขุนรามคำแหง}}) or '''Ram Khamhaeng the Great''' ({{lang-th|รามคำแหงมหาราช}}) was the third king of the [[List of monarchs of Thailand#Phra Ruang Dynasty (1238–1368,1368–1438)|Phra Ruang dynasty]], ruling the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] (early kingdom of [[Thailand|Siam]]) from 1279–1298, during its most prosperous era. 

He is credited for the creation of the [[Thai alphabet]] and the firm establishment of [[Theravada]] Buddhism as the state religion of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref name=prince&gt;Chakrabongse, C., 1960, ''Lords of Life'', London: Alvin Redman Limited&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==Birth and name==
'''Ram Khamhaeng''' was a son of Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao, who ruled as King [[Si Inthrathit]], and his Queen, Sueang,&lt;ref name="prasert1"&gt;Prasert Na Nagara and Alexander B. Griswold (1992). "The Inscription of King Rāma Gāṃhèṅ of Sukhodaya (1292 CE)", p. 265, in ''Epigraphic and Historical Studies''. Journal of the Siam Society. The Historical Society Under the Royal Patronage of H.R.H. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn: Bangkok. {{ISBN|974-88735-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though folk legend claims his real parents were an [[ogre]]ss named Kangli and a fisherman.&lt;ref name=Wyatt1995&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyatt|first1=David K.|title=The Chiang Mai Chronicle|date=1995|publisher=Silkworm Books|location=Bangkok|isbn=978-974-7047-67-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ5uAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|23}} He had two brothers and two sisters. The eldest brother died while very young. The second, [[Ban Mueang]], became king following their father's death, and was succeeded by Ram Khamhaeng on his own death.&lt;ref name="prasert2"&gt;Prasert and Griswold (1992), p. 265-267&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 19, Prince Ram Khamhaeng participated in his father's successful invasion of the city of [[Sukhothai (city)|Sukhothai]], formerly a vassal of the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]], establishing the independent Sukhothai Kingdom. Due to his courage in the war, he allegedly was given the title "[[Phra]] Rama Khamhaeng" or Rama the Strong,&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|196}} though he is recorded in the Ayyutthaya Chronicles as King "Ramaraj".  After his father's death, his brother Ban Muang ruled the kingdom, assigning Prince Ram Khamhaeng control of the city of [[Amphoe Si Satchanalai|Si Sat Chanalai]].

The Royal Institute of Thailand speculates that Prince Ram Khamhaeng's birth name was "Ram" (derived from the name of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]]'s hero Rama), for his name following his coronation was "Pho Khun Ramarat" ({{lang-th|พ่อขุนรามราช}}). Furthermore, the tradition at the time was to give the name of a grandfather to a grandson; according to the 11th Stone Inscription and Luang Prasoet Aksoranit's Ayutthaya Chronicles, Ram Khamhaeng had a grandson named "Phraya Ram", and two grandsons of Phraya Ram were named "Phraya Ban Muang" and "Phraya Ram".

==Accession==

Tri Amattayakun ({{lang-th|ตรี อมาตยกุล}}), The Thai historian suggests that Ram Khamhaeng should have acceded to the throne in 1279, the year he planted a [[sugar palm (disambiguation)|sugar palm]] tree in Sukhothai City. [[Prasert na Nagara]] of the Royal Institute speculates that this was in a tradition of [[Tai peoples|Thai-Ahom]]'s monarchs, who planted [[banyan]] or sugar palm trees on their [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation day]] in the hope that their reign would achieve the same stature as the tree. The most significant event at the beginning of his reign, however, was the elopement of one of his daughters with the captain of the palace guards, a commoner who founded the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Ramanya Kingdom]] and commissioned compilation of the Code of [[Wareru]], which provided a basis for the [[law of Thailand]] used in Siam until 1908,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=  T.

==Reign==
Ram Khamhaeng sent embassies to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan China]] from 1282 to 1323 and imported the techniques to make the [[ceramic]]s now known as [[Sangkhalok ceramic ware]]. He had close relationships with the rulers of nearby city-states, especially Ngam Muang, the ruler of neighboring [[Phayao]] (whose wife, according to legend, he seduced), and King [[Mangrai]] of [[Chiang Mai]].&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|206}} According to current Thai national history, Ram Khamhaeng expanded his kingdom as far as [[Lampang]], [[Phrae]], and [[Nan, Thailand|Nan]] in the north, and [[Phitsanulok]] and [[Vientiane]] in the east, the [[Mon kingdoms]] of what is now [[Myanmar]] in the west, the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the northwest, and the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]] in the south. 

However, in the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala political model]], as historian Thongchai Winichakul notes, kingdoms such as Sukhothai lacked distinct borders, instead being centered on the strength of the capital itself.&lt;ref name="Siam Mapped 1994. p 163"&gt;Siam Mapped: A history of the geo-body of a nation, by Thongchai Winichakul, University of Hawaii Press. 1994. p 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of Ram Khamhaeng's large kingdom were, according to Thongchai, intended to assert Siamese dominance over mainland Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Siam Mapped 1994. p 163"/&gt;  His campaign against Cambodia left the Khmer country "utterly devastated."&lt;ref name=Maspero&gt;Maspero, G., 2002, ''The Champa Kingdom'', Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9747534991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|90}} 

According to Thai history, Ram Khamhaeng developed the [[Thai alphabet]] (''Lai Sue Thai'') from [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], and the [[Grantha alphabet]].

==Death==
According to the Chinese ''[[History of Yuan]]'', King Ram Khamhaeng died by 1299 and was succeeded by his son, [[Loe Thai]], though [[George Cœdès]] thinks it "more probable" it was "shortly before 1318". Legend states he disappeared in the rapids of the rivers of Sawankhalok.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|218–219}}

==Legacy==
===The Ram Khamhaeng Inscription===
{{main|Ram Khamhaeng Inscription}}
Much of the traditional biographical information comes from the inscription on the Ram Khamhaeng stele, composed in 1292,&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Cœdès |first= George|authorlink= George Cœdès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans. Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196–198}} and now in the [[Bangkok National Museum]]. The formal name of the stele is the "King Ram Khamhaeng Inscription". It was added to the Memory of the World Register in 2003 by [[UNESCO]].

===Sangkhalok ceramic ware===
{{main|Sangkhalok ceramic ware}}
King Ram Khamhaeng is credited with bringing the skills of ceramic making from China and laying the foundation of a strong ceramic ware industry in the Sukhothai Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|206–207}} Sukhothai for centuries was the major exporter of the ceramics known as "Sangkhalok ware ({{lang-th|เครื่องสังคโลก}})" to countries such as Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and even to China. The industry was one of the main revenue generators during his reign and long afterwards.

===Banknote===
The reverse of 20 [[Baht]] note(series 16), issued in 2013, depicts images of the royal statue of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great seated on the Manangkhasila Asana Throne, as well as the invention of the Thai script to commemorate King Ramhamhaeng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bot.or.th/English/Banknotes/HistoryAndSeriesOfBanknotes/Pages/20_16.aspx|website=Bank of Thailand|publisher=Bank of Thailand|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honour===
[[Ramkhamhaeng University]], the first open university in Thailand with campuses throughout the country, was named after King Ram Khamhaeng the Great.

'''Silvio D'Amico''' (February 3, 1887 in [[Rome]] - April 1, 1955 in Rome) was an Italian theatre critic, journalist, and theorist of Italian theater.  Not a [[Fascism|Fascist]] himself,&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; D'Amico was the major theater critic during the ''ventennio'',&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witt|first=Mary Ann Frese |title=The search for modern tragedy: aesthetic fascism in Italy and France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7AMFccO-IcC&amp;pg=PA27|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty years  (1922-1945) of Fascist rule in Italy. He was the first editor of the nine volume ''Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo'' (''[[Encyclopedia of Performing Arts]]''),&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrell|first1=Joseph |last2=Puppa|first2=Paolo |title=A history of Italian theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_KjnpGCmn8C&amp;pg=PA269|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80265-2|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; published between 1954 and 1965, that covered theater, music, cinema, and dance.  Most notably, he held an eminent position in theatrical study in Italy, giving his name to the [[Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico|Silvio D'Amico National Academy of Dramatic Art]] in Rome, Italy's most prestigious drama school.

A Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;Witt, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; D'Amico was educated by Jesuits at Rome's [[Massimiliano Massimo Institute]]. After graduating in law in 1911, he was appointed to the Ministry of Education to the Directorate General for Antiquities and Fine Arts.  In 1923, he became professor of theater history in the Royal School of Acting "Eleonora Duse." He met Duse when he was young and ambitious, a time when D'Amico wanted to create an Italian national theatre that produced works of young Italian playwrights.&lt;ref name="Sheehy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheehy|first=Helen |title=Eleonora Duse: a biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkZykQDUsgC&amp;pg=PT428|year=2003|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=0-375-40017-6|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1925 and 1940, he directed dramatic criticism in the ''[[La Tribune]]'' newspaper. With [[Nicola De Pirro]], he founded the magazine ''[[Scenario]]'' in 1932 and they directed it together for three years, after which De Pirro continued alone.&lt;ref name="Berghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berghaus|first=Günter |title=Fascism and theatre: comparative studies on the aesthetics and politics of performance in Europe, 1925-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfVGdA8b1okC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1996|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-877-4|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, he was appointed Special Commissioner for the reform of the drama school in Rome, and the following year, he became the head of the [[Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico]]&lt;ref&gt;Witt, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; which, since the 1940s, has taught many of Italy's most successful actors. In the years after [[World War II]], he devoted most of his time at the academy.

From 1937 to 1943, he directed the ''[[Rivista italiana del Dramma]]'', published by the [[Italian Society of Authors and Publishers|Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori]]. From 1945 to 1955, he was the critic of ''[[Il Tempo]]''. He was a major contributor to the ''[[Teatro del Novecento]]'' encyclopedia, contributing to 11 of its volumes.

D'Amico championed the works of the Italian [[drama]]tist, [[novelist]], and short story writer [[Luigi Pirandello]].&lt;ref name="Sheehy" /&gt; In turn, Pirandello spoke of D'Amico as "the priest".&lt;ref name="Frassica"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frassica|first=Pietro Frassica|title=Her Maestro's Echo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4moNKlvlHMC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2010|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=1-84876-352-2|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He had at least two children.  A son, Fedele D'Amico (nickname: Lele), who was a musicologist, married the Italian screenwriter, [[Suso Cecchi d'Amico]], in 1938.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/01/suso-cecchi-damico-obituary|title=Suso Cecchi d'Amico obituary|last=Lane|first=John Francis|date=1 August 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Alessandro d'Amico, married Pirandello's granddaughter, Maria Luisa Aguirre.&lt;ref name="Frassica" /&gt;

D'Amico's brother, Mario, worked on the ''Enciclopedia'' with him.&lt;ref name="unile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siba3.unile.it/ctle/damico/conversazione.htm|title=Conversazione sull'Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo con Alessandro D'Amico e Luigi Squarzina|work=unile.it|language=Italian|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Rome in April 1955. At the news of his death, the theaters of the capital remained closed for mourning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13470">'''Suffrage drama''' (also known as '''Suffrage Plays''' or '''Suffrage theatre''') is a form of dramatic literature that emerged during the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|British women’s suffrage]] movement in the early twentieth century. Suffrage performances lasted approximately from 1907-1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thesuffragettes.org/resources/chronology-of-suffrage-plays/ |title=Chronology of Suffrage Plays &amp;#124; The Suffragettes |first= |last= |work=thesuffragettes.org |year=2012 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many suffrage plays called for a predominant or all female cast.  Suffrage plays served to reveal issues behind the suffrage movement. These plays also revealed many of the double standards that women faced on a daily basis. Suffrage theatre was a form of realist theatre, which was influenced by the plays of [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/realism.htm |title=Introduction to Theatre -- Realism |first= |last= |work=novaonline.nvcc.edu |year=2009 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suffrage theatre combined familiar everyday situations with relatable characters on the stage in the style of realist theatre.

==Pro-suffrage plays==
Suffrage dramas in favor of women's suffrage often portray strong female characters who illustrate the qualities of a rational, informed voters. They are meant to imply the obsolescence and inaccuracy of gender stereotypes that justified denying women the vote, such as [[separate spheres]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="SpenderDale"&gt;Spender, Dale, and Carole Hayman, ed. How The Vote Was Won and Other Suffragette Plays. Methuen, 1986. 34-87. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such characters often convince male or female anti-suffragists to revise their beliefs and support women's suffrage. Other plays satirize anti-suffragists as buffoons or narrow-minded individuals opposing progress. Many of these plays deliberately required few props and no sets. This was to allow amateur acting companies to perform the dramas at minimal cost, allowing them to be more widely performed and spread pro-suffrage sentiment. Due to the low cost of organizing a performance, suffrage plays were often performed in the drawing rooms of private residences and in small professional theaters.&lt;ref name="FinneganMargaret"&gt;Finnegan, Margaret Mary. Selling suffrage: consumer culture &amp; votes for women. Columbia University Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
During the suffrage movement in the United Kingdom, eighteen short plays were published that have been coined women’s suffrage drama&lt;ref name="MaroulaJoannou"&gt;Maroula Joannou &amp; [[June Purvis]], The Women’s Suffrage Movement: New Feminist Perspectives (Manchester University Press, 1998), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; but these represent only a few of the numerous plays with suffrage themes, the majority written in support of the Cause, that have been identified. Susan Croft's 'Chronology of Plays addressing or supporting Suffrage Issues 1907-1914' lists 170 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Votes for Women and Other Plays|last=Croft|first=Susan|publisher=Aurora Metro|year=2009|isbn=978-1-906582-01-2|location=London|pages=216-243}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a figure further supplemented by additional plays, discovered since publication, listed online&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=www.thesuffragettes.org|title=Further Chronology of Suffrage Performances 1907-1914|last=Susan|first=Croft|date=2010|website=Suffragettes: How the Vote Was Won|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Elizabeth Robins|Elizabeth Robins’s]] ''Votes for Women'' and [[Cicely Hamilton]] and Christopher St. John’s ''How the Vote Was Won'' are two predominant examples of suffrage plays.&lt;ref name="MaroulaJoannou" /&gt; Elizabeth Robins’s ''Votes for Women'' was one of the first published women’s suffrage plays. It was performed in 1907 at the Court Theatre in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Carole &amp; Spender, Dale, How the Vote Was Won and Other Suffragette Plays, (London: Methuen, 1985), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Julie Holledge, British actor and director, wrote that ''Votes for Women'' “heralded the beginning of a suffrage theatre” and assisted in organizing actresses and “their involvement with the women’s rights movement and their dissatisfaction with a male dominated theatre, these women had begun to develop a drama that could express the reality of women’s lives...With the emergence of the mass suffrage movement in the Edwardian era, over a thousand actresses were thrust into the fight for votes for women. Out of their struggle the first ‘women’s theatre movement of the twentieth century was born.” &lt;ref&gt;Julie Holledge (as cited in How the Vote Was Won and Other Suffragette Plays, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters in these plays were realistic, middle class characters fighting for or against women’s suffrage. These plays often featured female characters talking with each other about the suffrage movement and often broke the boundaries between class. Suffrage plays led to the 1908 formation of the [[Actresses' Franchise League]] that “provided the infrastructure to promote women’s endeavors on a large scale.” &lt;ref name="JoannouMaroula"&gt;Joannou, Maroula &amp; Purvis, June, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffragists used plays to create changes in social attitudes. Attending a play was a social and community event, therefore their message reached a large audience in a short period of time. Some suffragists would say, “a change in legislation was attributed to the production of one play.”&lt;ref name="JoannouMaroula" /&gt; Suffrage plays were a source of optimism for the female suffrage movement. Suffrage theatre gave prominence to women’s roles and issues for the first time and greatly influenced the women’s suffrage movement.

Theatre played a crucial role in the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom women's suffrage movement]]. Pro-suffrage acting organizations such as The [[Actresses' Franchise League]] and [[Edith Craig]]'s [[Pioneer Players]] formed alongside more political entities like the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]] to campaign for the vote using drama and lectures. Only actresses were permitted to join the Actresses Franchise League. However, the AFL vowed to "assist all other [women's suffrage] Leagues wherever possible" by creating and performing "propaganda plays" and hosting informative lectures on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuffragettes.org/campaigning-performance/afl-pioneer-plays-key-individuals|title=Actresses Franchise League|work=How the vote was won.|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom was home to many of the premiere suffragist playwrights, including [[Cicely Hamilton]] (author of ''[[Diana of Dobson's]]''&lt;ref&gt;Cockin, Katharine. Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players 1911-25, Palgrave (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (''[[Press Cuttings]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THvKxFMgf7oC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=press+cuttings+george+bernard+shaw&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bC08_gv6yG&amp;sig=ka7bNuJe-iYJ9vtgzidGlXA7rmc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-nhuT_zVBKnm0QGTi7HNBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Press Cuttings|author=George Bernard Shaw|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|date=30 June 2004|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Beatrice Harraden]] (''Lady Geraldine's Speech''&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;Crawford, E.

Contemporary plays concerning the women's suffrage movement continue to be written and performed in Britain, such as Ian Flint's ''Woman'' (2003), [[Rebecca Lenkiewicz]]'s ''Her Naked Skin'' (2008) and Sally Sheringham's ''The Sound of Breaking Glass'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuffragettes.org/campaigning-performance/contemporary-performance/plays-about-movement|title=Plays about the Women’s Movement in today’s theatre|work=How the vote was won|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

British suffrage organizations and magazines also showed an interest in the position of women in [[India]] and  suffrage performance in Britain included tableaux by Indian women, performed in Sloane Square, while ''Votes for Women'' reviewed plays like Tagore's ''Chitra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuffragettes.org/resources/chronology-of-suffrage-plays|title=Chronology of Suffrage Plays|work=How the vote was won.|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art, Theatre and Women's Suffrage|last=Cockroft, Irene and|first=Susan Croft|publisher=Aurora Metro|year=2010|isbn=978-1-906-58208-1|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===America===
Although many suffrage dramas were written by British authors and playwrights, a number of American writers contributed to the overall body of pro-suffrage plays. Many of these authors were well known in their own right: [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] authored the recently re-published ''Three Women''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands of Noras: Short Plays by Women 1874-1920|last=Engle, Sherry and|first=Susan Croft|publisher=i-Universe|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4917-6804-4|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Something to Vote For''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On to Victory: Propaganda Plays of the Women's Suffrage Movement|last=Friedl|first=Bettina|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, T''he Ceaseless Struggle of Sex'': ''A Dramatic View'', and the suffragist/[[World War I]] correspondent [[Inez Milholland]] composed ''If Women Voted''.&lt;ref name="tsl.state"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/suffrage/comesofage/suffrage-plays-4.html|title=Suffrage Plays|work=The Movement Comes of Age|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|date = 24 August 2011|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] viewed theatre as an effective way to spread pro-suffrage sentiment and provided suffrage dramas to professional and amateur theatres.&lt;ref name="SpenderDale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/suffrage/comesofage/suffrage-plays-4.html|title=Suffrage Plays|work=The Movement Comes of Age|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|date = 24 August 2011|accessdate=25 March 2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other American dramatists who contributed to the genre include Miriam Nicholson, Elizabeth Gerberding, Salina Solomon and Mrs. Charles Caffin.&lt;ref name="tsl.state" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/suffrage/comesofage/suffrage-plays-4.html|title=Suffrage Plays|work=The Movement Comes of Age|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|date = 24 August 2011|accessdate=25 March 2012|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately many of the suffrage dramas circulated by the NAWSA have been lost, and the only evidence of their existence has been found in surviving order pamphlets for the plays.&lt;ref name="FinneganMargaret" /&gt;

==Anti-suffrage plays==
Some of the earliest plays to address the question of women's suffrage were written in opposition to extending the vote. These plays satirized the notion of revised (and more equal) gender roles by portraying women as incapable of influence afforded to men or characterizing suffragists as "unwomanly" grotesques. Little research has been done into the prevalence or popularity of these anti-suffrage plays.&lt;ref name="FriedlBettina"&gt;Friedl, Bettina. On To Victory: Propaganda Plays of the Woman Suffrage Movement. Northeastern, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example that transitioned from small parlor performances (like the pro-suffrage plays performed by amateur actors) to widespread popularity in the United States is ''The Spirit of Seventy-Six; or, The Coming Woman, A Prophetic Drama'' (1868) by Ariana Randolph Wormeley Curtis and Daniel Sargent Curtis&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The play was written following the Civil War, as many abolitionists were beginning to shift their focus to different social issues, such as women's suffrage. The play is meant to be an absurdest fantasy depicting what life would be like if women and men traded gender roles. For example, women in the play wear men's clothing, smoke cigars, and hold all political offices while men struggle to tend to children in the home. The play implies that by enfranchising women they will all become horribly masculine, and suggests that radical suffrage activists campaign to "cover their own undesirability or incompetence".&lt;ref name="FriedlBettina" /&gt;

'''The Tomkins incident''' on 30 November 2004 was an attack by two white farmers on two Aboriginal boys found trespassing on their property near [[Goondiwindi]], a town on the border of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] in Australia. 

David and Clint Tomkins, a father and son managing the farm, allegedly beat Alan Boland and Bevan Bartman and dragged Boland around the property with a noose around his neck. The incident occurred just four days after riots in the Aboriginal community of [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]], off the north Queensland coast, over the suspicious death of an Aboriginal man in police custody.

The local Aboriginal community was outraged when the Tomkins were handed down a A$500 fine each for their treatment of the four boys, who themselves were charged with break, enter and steal. The event made headlines in countries around the world, including the UK.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news |last=Squires |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/05/19/wabor19.xml |title=Whites fined £200 for noose attack on Aborigine boy |work=The Telegraph |date=19 May 2004 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The assault==

On November 2004, four Indigenous boys from the [[Toomelah Aboriginal Mission]] swam across the [[Macintyre River]] to a nearby Queensland property managed by David Hilary Tomkins (then 44 years old) and his son Clint Williams Tomkins (then 23 years old). The four boys, Alan Boland (16), Bevan "BJ" Bartman (19), Reg McGrady (23) and Jade, had said that they had previously bought [[marijuana]] from the Tomkins but had recently begun stealing it from the property instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Stephen |url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/age3dec04.html |title=Two charged on noose claims |work=The Age |date=3 December 2004 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four boys broke into a building with the intention of stealing from a [[hydroponics|hydroponic]] crop inside, but were discovered by the Tomkins. McGrady and Jade escaped to the other side of the river, but the other two, Bartman and Boland, were caught by the Tomkins. 

Bartman and Boland allege that the Tomkins pulled Boland back through the river, stripped him naked, bound his wrists and then dragged him up an embankment by a rope tied around his neck. They also allege the Tomkins tied Bartman to a tree and forced him to watch as they threatened to cut off Boland's toes with a pair of pliers and beat them both with sticks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/age3dec04.html Two charged on noose claims]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartman has said he managed to escape after he faked an [[asthma]] attack while he was being untied from the tree. He then ran back through the bush and swam across the river. Boland said the two Tomkins then walked into the farmhouse and returned with a double-barrelled shotgun and 0.22-calibre rifle, loaded both in front of Boland and pressed the guns to either side of his temples, yelled racist taunts and hammered the boy's face with their gun butts. The Tomkins called the police and allegedly removed the noose from Boland's neck before they arrived. The police took Boland to Goondiwindi police station and charged him with break and enter.

==Police behaviour==

Boland's family have said the police questioned Boland for three hours until legal representation from [[Legal Aid]] arrived. The representative allegedly said that Boland was in no condition to give a statement, and ordered the boy be taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries, which he considered were extremely severe. 

Boland's family have said Boland's face was bruised and swollen, he had suffered several cuts on his body from being dragged around and had rope burns around his neck. Boland's family have said Boland was still in shock and vomited repeatedly on the way to the hospital. 

At the local Goondiwindi hospital a nurse attended Boland, but the doctor on duty refused to see him, despite the gravity of his injuries, according to Boland's family. At one stage Boland and one of the Tomkins, who had broken his arm in the fracas, were sitting together in the same treatment room. Boland was then taken by the police to a holding cell in [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]].

==The prosecution==

The court case was held on 18 May 2005. At 9.30&amp;nbsp;am, two hours before the case, the police prosecutor told Boland's mother Rosalyn, Toomelah elder Ada Jarrett and a Toowoomba [[Legal Aid#Legal aid in Australia|Legal Aid]] representative that the Tomkins would only get a fine or a [[good behaviour bond]], according to Mrs Boland and Jarrett.&lt;ref name="outrage"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nit.com.au/News/story.aspx?id=5036 |title=Outrage over $500 fine for Qld noose attack |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=26 May 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jarrett and Mrs Boland, a police sergeant and the prosecutor then repeatedly pressured them for another two hours to sign statements dropping the more serious charge of assault occasioning bodily harm in company, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years' jail.&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Criminal Code, 1899, Section 339 (3).&lt;/ref&gt; The sergeant and prosecutor claimed the Tomkins would walk free if Boland didn't arrive at the courthouse on time, said Jarrett and Mrs Boland.&lt;ref name="outrage"/&gt;

==The verdict==

A large number of indigenous relatives and residents from [[Toomelah Aboriginal Mission|Toomelah]], [[Boggabilla, New South Wales|Boggabilla]] and [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]] had turned up to witness the court's proceedings, as had "Sugar" [[Ray Robinson (ATSIC Deputy Chairperson)|Ray Robinson]], former deputy chairman of the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]]. Local Aboriginal leader Bert Button said the charge of assault causing bodily harm in company was an outrage. He demanded the two men be given murder charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.worldnewsaustralia.com.au/region.php?id=111914&amp;region=7 |title=Protesters outside Qld court |publisher=SBS News |date=19 May 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the hearing, held before magistrate Dennis Beutel, the Tomkins pleaded guilty to common assault. The prosecutor representing the four Toomelah boys did not produce photographs of the boys' injuries nor use their testimonies, according to Jarrett. The prosecutor also failed to mention the drugs on the Tomkins' property.

The UK's [[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] reported that the Tomkins' defence lawyer, Robbie Davis, had said his clients had become fed up with frequent break-ins on the farm and that they had used "reasonable force" to restrain Boland. Davis said the Tomkins were wrong to tie a noose around Boland's neck. "It's a pity they didn't have the hindsight [sic] to put a rope around his waist and not his neck," he told the court. "This is not a racial event. It would have been the same if it had been a white youth."&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; The Tomkins were fined A$500 each, and ordered to pay A$300 each to the victim. For a common assault charge, up to three years imprisonment is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Criminal Code, 1899, Section 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the court house, the victims' relatives were outraged and began yelling abuse at the police and the Tomkins, who were led out under heavy police guard. Protesters waved placards declaring "One law for whites and one law for blacks – still" and "This is KKK land".&lt;ref name="outrage"/&gt; The police had already called in a number of extra squad cars and reinforcements, including a [[SWAT]] team that was stationed around the courthouse.

ATSIC's Robinson called on Queensland Premier [[Peter Beattie]] to investigate the case and the actions of the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Outcry-as-noose-assault-pair-fined-500/2005/05/18/1116361608324.html |title=Outcry as noose assault pair fined $500 |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local leader Bert Button said, "The justice system stinks. It's saying it's all right for non-Indigenous people to go and put a rope around someone's neck and drag them up and down a river and give them a flogging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.worldnewsaustralia.com.au/region.php?id=111947&amp;region=7 |title=Anger over noose assault fine |publisher=SBS News |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tomkins spent the night under police protection.

==Aftermath==

There was no appeal brought against the criminal case decision by the victims. 

After the guilty verdict David Tomkins told the [[Seven Network]] that he would do it again if confronted with the same situation. He said it was the third time in two years that his home had been broken into, and that he only wanted to detain Boland, according to an AAP report.&lt;ref name="outrage"/&gt; "My proud home keeps getting broken into and robbed," said Tomkins. "All I did was detain one of the criminals for the police."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10532">'''Traditional trades''' (known also as '''traditional building trades''' and '''preservation trades''') is a loosely defined categorization of building trades who actively practice their craft in respect of [[historic preservation]], heritage conservation, or the conserving and maintenance of the existing [[built environment]]. Though traditional trade practitioners may at times be involved in new construction, the emphasis of the categorization is toward work on existing structures, regardless of their age or their historic value, with a specific interest in replication or conservation of the original results and craft techniques.

== Trade technologies ==
[[File:Timber Framing Circular Saw.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Modern timber framers incorporate new technologies, like the circular saw shown here, to increase productivity and reduce labor costs and time.]]Traditional building trades commonly include [[masonry]], [[timber framing]], log building, traditional [[Roofer|roofing]], [[carpentry]] and [[joiner]]y, [[plasterwork]], [[painting]], [[blacksmithing]], and ornamental metal working. In addition to "hands-on" skills and knowledge of building processes, traditional trade practitioners incorporate knowledge of historic preservation, materials science, historic architecture, and procuring replacement materials. Contemporary practitioners of traditional trades must also avail themselves of modern technologies, current materials science, and 21st century construction project management.

The work performed by these practitioners is not only essential to the maintenance of the historic built environment, but also to the preservation of the traditional trade skills and knowledge themselves. In many cases, traditional trade skills and techniques date back centuries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Traditional trades such as carpenters and timber framers; masons, plasterers, lime burners, and brick makers; painters; blacksmiths; and slate, metal, shingle, tile, and thatch roofers, are anecdotally said to be “dying” arts. While it is true that some techniques of the past are not well enough understood, it is also true that these crafts have been practiced continuously all over the world without dying at all.

Traditional trades not only restore and help to maintain buildings, but also stabilize priceless archaeological sites, and in doing so, help us understand the techniques used at places like [[Cuzco]], [[Stonehenge]], and [[Angkor Wat]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Such trades are not solely practiced for the conservation of monumental heritage sites and can be applied to conserve vernacular sites such as barns.

== Materials technologies ==
The traditional trades focus on preservation of the knowledge of craft work specific to historic building technologies and traditional/non-traditional building materials. Traditional building materials and traditional trade technologies are commonly associated with a host of materials, but not limited to, stone, brick, [[terra cotta]], [[adobe]], cork, leather, timber and log, bamboo, thatch, [[slate]] and metal roofing, fine and vernacular carpentry, ornamental [[plaster]] ([[scagliola]]), [[stained glass]], window and door restoration, wood refinishing, painting, [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]]. In what may at times be considered non-traditional materials are found trades such as chandelier and lighting restoration where you have to be somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades with an understanding of electricity, and knowledgeable with properties and finishes of metals, glass, and optics. As an example of the mix of new and old materials, the art of restoration of mobile residential trailers requires a number of traditional trade skills associated with traditional and contemporary materials in a manner not dissimilar to those hand-work skills and preservation approaches required to restore an historic automobile, a biplane, rocket ship or steam locomotive.

== Green trades ==
Traditional building technologies tend towards a closer relationship of the built environment to an in-practice understanding, interaction and use of [[natural resources]] and recycled or salvaged building materials than is common in the practice of modern and contemporary building technologies.

For example: a traditional timber framer in search of difficult-to-acquire materials with which to rebuild heritage structures will tend to seek out an understanding of forest management, tree harvest, conversion process and building design and technique. These integrated skills and their supportive knowledge base both in scale and localization are readily adaptable to strategies of sustainable new-build economies.

Old buildings and structures were built once, energy and natural resources previously expended, and to adaptively re-use or recycle them often requires an understanding and appreciation of not only how the older materials with which they were built work together in a structure, but a need to understand the techniques by which these materials were originally worked, and an understanding of how they can most optimally be worked now.

== Knowledge of process ==
As opposed to an emphasis on [[materials science]] (as with an [[architectural conservator]]) the primary orientation of a traditional trade practitioner tends toward the in-process work activity and physical interaction and intervention with the building materials and the coordination, education and [[project management]] of in-field work teams.

== Team members ==
Traditional trades are quite often team members with architectural conservators, preservation architects and structural engineers in both the design phase investigation of heritage sites as well as involved directly in the undertaking of the hands-on restoration process. Traditional trades as a resource to the historic preservation industry provide a physical grounding in feasibility, construction logic, field and site logistics, reference to skilled traditional trades practitioners, estimate and budget considerations.

== Availability ==

Skilled traditional trades practitioners are generally available to preservationists and property stewards who give themselves a chance to find them. Besides the Internet and verbal networking, information about traditional trades can be found through trade associations and training programs, both private and governmental. If a particular job is limited to union workers, the union should provide workers with the appropriate skills or else allow an exception for a particular task.

A traditional trades practitioner may also be able to recommend experts in related skills, as well as promote good communications among the different disciplines at work on any given project.

== Education ==
Basic levels of training in contemporary building and craft skills are a prerequisite to specialization in traditional trades work. Individuals with an interest in learning a traditional trade can seek out learning opportunities either through formal vocational programs or through informal mentorship in at-work field practice under the tutelage of a traditional trade practitioner.

Family businesses, trade unions, historic preservation businesses, government programs ([http://www.nps.gov/training/HPTC/ National Park Service Historic Preservation Training Center]), college programs, religious and non-profit organizations are areas where an interest to provide education of traditional trade practice can often be found. As the individual increases in skill, learning will come from study, from workshops, from travel and personal contacts, and from clues found in the work itself.

Some individual tradespeople provide training opportunities for their fellow tradespeople without a close association with the larger educational institutions.

'''Whiteness studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] arena of inquiry that has developed beginning in the United States, particularly since the late 20th century, and is focused on what proponents describe as the cultural, historical and sociological aspects of [[white people|people identified as white]], and the [[social construction]] of "whiteness" as an ideology tied to social status. Pioneers in the field include [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] ("Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization", 1890; ''[[Darkwater]]'', 1920), [[James Baldwin]] (''[[The Fire Next Time]]'', 1963), [[Theodore W. Allen]] (''The Invention of the White Race,'' 1976, expanded in 1995), [[Ruth Frankenberg]] (''White Women, Race Matters: The Social Construction of Whiteness'', 1993), author and literary critic [[Toni Morrison]] (''Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination'', 1992) and historian [[David Roediger]] (''The Wages of Whiteness'', 1991). By the mid-1990s, numerous works across many disciplines analyzed whiteness, and it has since become a topic for academic courses, research and anthologies.

A central tenet of whiteness studies is a reading of history and its effects on the present that is inspired by [[postmodernism]] and [[historicism]], in which the very concept of [[Racism|racial superiority]] is said to have been socially constructed in order to justify discrimination against non-whites. Since the 19th century, some writers have argued that the [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] significances attributed to specific races are without biological association, and that race is therefore not a valid biological concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/race.htm|title=What is Race?|last=Randall|first=Vernellia R.|website=academic.udayton.edu|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientists have demonstrated that racial theories are based upon an arbitrary clustering of phenotypical categories and [[customs]], and can overlook the problem of gradations between categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obasogie|first1=Osagie|title=Return of the race myth?|journal=New Scientist|date=1 July 2009|volume=203|issue=2715|pages=22–23|accessdate=|bibcode=2009NewSc.203...22O|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(09)61767-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas K. Nakayama and Robert L. Krizek write about whiteness as a "strategic rhetoric," asserting, in the essay "Whiteness: A Strategic Rhetoric", that whiteness is a product of "discursive formation" and a "rhetorical construction". Nakayama and Krizek write, "there is no 'true essence' to 'whiteness': there are only historically contingent constructions of that social location."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Nakayama | first1 = Thomas K. | last2 = Krizek | first2 = Ro L.bert | title = Readings in Rhetorical Criticism | chapter = Whiteness: A Strategic Rhetoric | edition = 3 | editors = Carl Burgchardt | isbn = 978-1-891136-12-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nakayama and Krizek also suggest that by naming whiteness, one calls out its centrality and reveals its invisible, central position. Whiteness is considered normal and neutral, therefore, to name whiteness means that one identifies whiteness as a rhetorical construction which can be dissected to unearth its values and beliefs.

Major areas of research in whiteness studies include the nature of [[white privilege]] and white identity, the historical process by which a white racial identity was created, the relation of culture to white identity, and possible processes of social change as they affect white identity.

==Development of the field==
Studies of whiteness as a unique identity could be said to begin among [[black people]], who needed to understand whiteness to survive, particularly in slave societies such as the American colonies and United States.&lt;ref name=hooksRepresentations&gt;[[bell hooks]], "Representations of Whiteness in the Black Imagination", ''Black Looks'' (1992); republished in Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ganley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ganley | first = Toby | title = What's all this talk about whiteness? | journal = Dialogue | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 12&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[University of Queensland]] | date = 2003 | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130428181555/http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au//dialogue/vol-1-2-4.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}} ([https://dialoguejournal.org.au/archives/ Link to journal.])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roediger | first = David | title = Critical studies of whiteness, USA: origins and arguments | journal = [[Theoria (sociology journal)|Theoria]] | volume = 48 | issue = 98 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;98 | publisher = [[Berghahn Books|Berghahn]] | doi = 10.3167/004058101782485511 | date = 1 December 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.3167/004058101782485511 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important theme in this literature is, beyond the general "invisibility" of blacks to whites, the unwillingness of white people to consider that black people study them anthropologically.&lt;ref name=hooksRepresentations/&gt; American author [[James Weldon Johnson]] wrote in his 1912 novel ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]]'' that "colored people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Weldon Johnson]], ''[http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/64/the-autobiography-of-an-ex-colored-man/ The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]'', Boston: Sherman, French, and Co., 2012; Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[James Baldwin]] wrote and spoke extensively about whiteness, defining it as a central social problem and insisting that it was choice, not a biological identity.&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), pp. 20–21. "No thinker so fully brought together the many dimensions of African-American studies of whiteness as James Baldwin. [...] Adopting and treasuring a white identity is, he wrote, 'absolutely a moral choice' since 'there are no white people.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Baldwin, "On being 'white' and other lies", ''Essence'', 1984; republished in Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Fire Next Time]]'' (1963), a non-fiction book on race relations in the United States, Baldwin suggests that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this—which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never—the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Baldwin]], ''The Fire Next Time'', New York: Dial Press, 1963; republished in New York by Vintage International, 1993; p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A major black theory of whiteness connects this identity group with acts of [[terrorism]]—i.e., slavery, rape, torture, and lynching—against black people, who were treated as sub-human.&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), pp. 15–16. "Equally compelling African–American studies treat whiteness as a species of terror. [...] [[Paul Gilroy]]'s recent ''The Black Atlantic'' uncompromisingly calls upon the tradition of connecting the terrors of the trade in black bodies, the bloodiness of slave control, and the soul-killing violence of racial exploitation with the total experience of whiteness by people of colors. [[bell hooks]] makes much the same points regarding the circumstances under which African Americans encounter and represent whiteness. Other black thinkers have carried this insight still further. They contend that whiteness is also experienced through terror by whites, who find and reproduce unity by committing and more often by witnessing acts of violence. Slave tales and autobiographies, for example, at times insisted upon the centrality of stealing humans, breaking up families, 'patrolling' plantations, and committing rape to the growth of a white identity."&lt;/ref&gt;

White academics in the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) began to study whiteness as early as 1983, creating the idea of a discipline called "whiteness studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Albert | title = Omni-Americans: Some Alternatives to the Folklore of White Supremacy | publisher = Vintage | year = 1983 | oclc = 1020212158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[canon wars]]" of the late 1980s and 1990s, a political controversy over the centrality of white authors and perspectives in United States culture, led the scholar [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]] to ask "how the imaginative construction of 'whiteness' had shaped American literature and American history".&lt;ref name="Fishkin_interrogate"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fishkin | first = Shelley Fisher | author-link = Shelley Fisher Fishkin | title = Interrogating "Whiteness," Complicating "Blackness": Remapping American Culture | journal = [[American Quarterly]] | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 428&amp;ndash;466 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/2713296 | date = September 1995 | url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713296 | quote = ''In this essay I will provide a brief overview of over a hundred books and articles from fields including literary criticism, history, cultural studies, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore, all published between 1990 and 1995 or forthcoming shortly. Taken together, I believe, they mark the early 1990s as a defining moment in the study of American culture.'' | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|430}} The field developed a large body of work during the early 1990s, Fishkin describes it extending across the disciplines of "literary criticism, history, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore".&lt;ref name="Fishkin_interrogate" /&gt;

As of 2004, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', at least 30 institutions in the United States including [[Princeton University]], the [[University of California at Los Angeles]], the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] offer, or have offered, courses in whiteness studies. Teaching and research around whiteness often overlap with research on [[post-colonial theory]] and [[orientalism]] taking place in the Arts and Humanities, Sociology, Literature, Communications, and Cultural and Media Studies faculties and departments, among others (e.g. Kent, Leeds). Also heavily engaged in whiteness studies are practitioners of [[anti-racism|anti-racist education]], such as [[Betita Martinez]] and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop.

One contribution to White Studies is [[Rich Benjamin]]'s ''[[Searching for Whitopia|Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America]]''. The book examines white social beliefs and white anxiety in the contemporary United States—in the context of enormous demographic, cultural, and social change.  The book is often taught as a primer in White Studies on white racial identity in a "post-racial" US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Benjamin | first = Rich | title = Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America | publisher = Hyperion | location = New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781401322687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major contribution to whiteness studies is the analysis of whiteness as a phenomenon, not just localized to the US and Western Hemisphere, but also in the context of other post-colonial metropoles such as the Netherlands.  [[Gloria Wekker]]’s White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race excavates the immutability and fluidity of white identity and its relationship to innocence in the context of post-colonial Netherlands in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Wekker identifies white innocence as a contemporary construction and denial [aggressive national forgetting] of the Netherlands role and proximity to European imperialism, racial stratification and hierarchy, and its contributions to the making of contemporary constructions of national belonging and cultural normativity (autochtoon vs. allochtonen).

In Wekker’s analysis, although a majority of the residents of the Netherlands are migrants, the process of stratifying Dutch from “Other” is facilitated through skin tone and non-Christian religious practices (“deviant”, non-White religions). In Wekker’s account, the process of racialization is reserved for mid-to-late twentieth century migrant groups [i.e. Muslims, Black Surinamese, Black Antilleans], interchangeably as a means of delineating groups outside the constructed immutable “norms” of Dutch society. Ultimately, Wekker is illuminating the cultural and rhetorical maneuvering that occurs within Dutch popular culture, educational spaces, and national discourses that facilitate a normalizing, non-identity to whiteness and how this very concept is intricately connected to a longer historical nineteenth-century racial grammar that accompanied imperial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wekker | first = Gloria | title = White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780822360759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of whiteness===
Whiteness studies draws on research into the definition of race, originating with the United States but applying to racial stratification worldwide. This research emphasizes the historically recent [[social construction]] of white identity. As stated by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] in 1920: "The discovery of a personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing,—a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed."&lt;ref&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Darkwater'' (1920); republished in Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline examines how white, Native, and African/black identities emerged in interaction with the institutions of slavery, colonial settlement, citizenship, and industrial labor. Scholars such as [[Winthrop Jordan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = Winthrop D. | author-link = Winthrop Jordan | title = White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812 | publisher = Omohundro Institute of Early Armerian History and Culture, Wiliamsburg, Virginia | location = Chapel Hill | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781469600765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have traced the evolution of the legally defined line between "blacks" and "whites" to colonial government efforts to prevent cross-racial revolts among unpaid laborers.

Academic Joseph Pugliese is among writers who have applied whiteness studies to an [[Australia|Australian]] context, discussing the ways that [[Indigenous Australians]] were marginalized in the wake of British colonization of Australia, as whiteness came to be defined as central to Australian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = White Law of the Biopolitical | journal = Journal of the European Association of Studies on Australia | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 87&amp;ndash;100 | publisher = European Association of Studies on Australia | date = 2012 | url = http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/node/295 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/files/jeasa4spererajpugliese16.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = Death in a dry river: black life, white property, parched justice | journal = Somatechnics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 65&amp;ndash;86 | publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]] | doi = 10.3366/soma.2011.0007 | date = 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.3366/soma.2011.0007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} &lt;/ref&gt; Pugliese discusses the 20th-century [[White Australia policy]] as a conscious attempt to preserve the "purity" of whiteness in Australian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugliese | first = Joseph | title = Race as Category Crisis: Whiteness and the Topical Assignation of Race | journal = Social Semiotics | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 149&amp;ndash;168 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/103503302760212078 | date = 2002 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/103503302760212078  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Willard | first = Myra | title = History of the White Australia policy to 1920  |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=chuDflqWzlEC | publisher = Frank Cass and Company | location = Carlton, Victoria  |origyear=1923 | year = 1967 | isbn = 9780714610368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Stefanie Affeldt considers whiteness "a concept not yet fully developed at the time the first convicts and settlers arrived down under" &lt;ref&gt;Affeldt, Stefanie. ''Consuming Whiteness'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; which, as a social relation, had to be negotiated and was driven forward in particular by the labour movement. Eventually, with the Federation of Australia, "[o]verlaying social differences, the shared membership in the 'white race' was the catalyst for the consolidation of the Australian colonies as the Commonwealth of Australia" &lt;ref&gt;Affeldt, Stefanie. ''Consuming Whiteness'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White privilege==
{{main|White privilege}}
In 1965, drawing from insights from W.E.B. Du Bois and inspired by the Civil Rights movement, [[Theodore W. Allen]] began a forty-year analysis of "white skin privilege", "white race" privilege, and "white" privilege. In a piece he drafted for a "John Brown Commemoration Committee", he urged that "White Americans who want government of the people" and "by the people" to "begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =John Brown Memorial Pilgrimage | publisher = John Brown Commemoration Committee, | date =  December 4, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | last2 = et al | title = July 2010 edition | journal = Cultural Logic: Marxist Theory and Practice, special issue: Culture and Crisis | publisher = Theodore W.

By June 15, 1969, the ''New York Times'' was reporting that the National Office of SDS was calling "for an all-out fight against 'white skin privileges'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ignatin (Ignatiev) | first1 = Noel | last2 = Allen | first2 = Ted | chapter = White Blindspot | chapter-url = http://www.sds-1960s.org/WhiteBlindspot.pdf | editor-last = Davidson | editor-first = Carl | title = Revolutionary Youth &amp; the New Working Class: the Praxis Papers, the Port Authority Statement, the RYM Documents and Other Lost Writings of SDS | pages = 148&amp;ndash;181 | publisher = Changemaker Publications | location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781257999477 }}

For almost forty years, Allen offered a detailed historical analysis of the origin, maintenance, and functioning of "white-skin privilege" and "white privilege" in such writings as: "White Supremacy in U.S. History" (1973);&lt;ref&gt;Ted (Theodore W.) Allen, [http://www.sojournertruth.net/uafws.pdf "White Supremacy in U.S. History"], A Speech Delivered at a Guardian Forum on the National Question, 28 April 1973, rpt. in "White Supremacy a Collection" (Chicago: Sojourner Truth Organization, 1976;&lt;/ref&gt; "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race" (1975);&lt;ref name="Struggle" /&gt; "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 1: "Racial Oppression and Social Control" (1994, 2012);&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_I" /&gt; "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 2: "The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America" (1997, 2012);&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_II" /&gt; "Summary of the Argument of 'The Invention of the White Race'" Parts 1&lt;ref name="Summary_pt1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = Summary of the Argument of 'The Invention of the White Race,'" Part 1 | journal = Cultural Logic: Marxist Theory and Practice | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages =  | publisher = Theodore W.

In his historical work, Allen asserted that: 
*the "white race" was invented as a ruling class social control formation in the late 17th-/early-18th century Anglo-American [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] colonies (principally Virginia and Maryland); 
*central to this process was the ruling-class plantation bourgeoisie conferring "white race" privileges on European-American working people; 
*these privileges were not only against the interests of African Americans, they were also "poison", "ruinous", a baited hook, to the class interests of working people; 
*[[white supremacy]], reinforced by "white skin privilege", has been the main retardant of working-class consciousness in the US; and
*struggle for radical social change should direct principal efforts at challenging white supremacy and "white skin privileges".&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Perry | first = Jeffrey B. | title = The Developing Conjuncture and Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W.

He also raised important questions about developments in those areas, and he avoided using the term "whiteness", using quotation marks when he did.&lt;ref name="Summary_pt1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 8, 78 n. 187, 80–89}}

Laura Pulido writes about the relation of white privilege to racism. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"White privilege [is] a highly structural and spatial form of racism&amp;nbsp;... I suggest that historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege and have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism."&lt;ref name="pulido"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pulido defines environmental racism as "the idea that nonwhites are disproportionately exposed to pollution".&lt;ref name="pulido"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pulido | first = Laura | title = Rethinking Environmental Racism: Whiteness Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California | journal = [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]] | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–40 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182 | date = 2000 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/0004-5608.00182 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Peggy McIntosh]] say that social, political, and cultural advantages are accorded to whites in global society. She argues that these advantages seem invisible to white people, but obvious to non-whites. McIntosh argues that whites utilize their whiteness, consciously or unconsciously, as a framework to classify people and understand their social locations. In addition, even though many white people understand that whiteness is associated with privilege, they do not acknowledge their privilege because they view themselves as average and non-racist. Essentially, whiteness is invisible to white people.&lt;ref name="mcintosh"&gt;{{cite book | last = McIntosh | first = Peggy | author-link = Peggy McIntosh | chapter = White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack | editor-last = Rothenberg | editor-first = Paula S. | title = Race, Class, and Gender in the United States: An Integrated Study | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Worth Publishers/Macmillan Learning | location = New York | year = 2016 | edition = 10th | isbn = 9781464178665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize [[male privilege]]. So I have begun in an untouched way to ask what it is like to have white privilege. I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was 'meant' to remain oblivious" (188).&lt;ref name="mcintosh"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;McIntosh calls for Americans to acknowledge white privilege so that they can more effectively attain [[Social equality|equality]] in American society. She argues, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To redesign social systems we need first to acknowledge their colossal unseen dimensions. The silences and denials surrounding privilege are the key political tool here. They keep the thinking about equality or equity incomplete, protecting unearned advantage and conferred dominance by making these [[taboo]] subjects" (192).&lt;ref name="mcintosh"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White privilege is also related to "white guilt". As Jackson writes in the article, "''White Noises: On Performing White, On Writing Performance''" (1998), "The rhetorics of white guilt are tiresome, cliche, disingenuous, and everywhere. And now that the stereotype of 'the guilty white' is almost entrenched in its negativity as 'the racist white', people actively try to dis-identify from both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jackson | first = Shannon | title = White Noises: On Performing White, On Writing Performance | journal = [[The Drama Review]] | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–65 | doi=10.1162/105420498760308670 | date = 1998 | url = https://doi.org/10.1162/105420498760308670 | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical whiteness studies===
An offshoot of [[critical race theory]], theorists of '''critical whiteness studies''' seek to examine the construction and moral implications of whiteness. There is a great deal of overlap between critical whiteness studies and critical race theory, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives (whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction) as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.&lt;ref&gt;''See, for example'':

==Whiteness and architecture==
In the early 21st century, architectural historians have published studies related to the construction of whiteness in the built environment. Studies have grappled with the exclusionary nature of the architectural profession, which erected barriers for nonwhite practitioners, the ways in which architects and designers have employed motifs, art programs, and color schemes that reflected the aspirations of European-Americans and, most recently, with the racialization of space.&lt;ref&gt;''For studies of whiteness and architecture, see'':

==Criticisms==
Writer [[David Horowitz]] draws a distinction between whiteness studies and other analogous disciplines. "[[Black Studies|Black studies]] celebrates blackness, [[Chicano Studies|Chicano studies]] celebrates Chicanos, [[women's studies]] celebrates women, and white studies attacks white people as evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Fears | first = Darryl | title = Hue and Cry on 'Whiteness Studies' | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14386-2003Jun19 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 20 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagmar R. Myslinska, an Adjunct Associate Professor of Law at [[Fordham University]], argues that whiteness studies overlooks the heterogeneity of whites' experience, be it due to class, immigrant status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myslinska|first1=Dagmar|title=Contemporary First-Generation European-Americans: The Unbearable ‘Whiteness’ of Being|journal=Tulane Law Review|date=2014|volume=88|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2222267|page=559|ssrn=2222267}}&lt;/ref&gt; or geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Myslinska | first = Dagmar | title = Racist Racism: Complicating Whiteness Through the Privilege &amp; Discrimination of Westerners in Japan | journal = Law Review |date=2014|volume=83|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2399984|page=1|ssrn=2399984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a columnist for the ''[[National Post]]'', has sharply criticized whiteness studies, writing that it "points to a new low in moral vacuity and civilizational [[Self-hatred|self-loathing]]" and is an example of "academic pusillanimity." According to Kay, whiteness studies "cuts to the chase: It is all, and only, about white self-hate."&lt;ref name=Kay1&gt;{{cite news | last = Kay | first = Barbara | title = Blaming whitey | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090520052049/http://www.barbarakay.ca/archive/20060913whitey.html | url = http://www.barbarakay.ca/archive/20060913whitey.html | archive-date = 20 May 2009 | work = National Post | date = 13 September 2006 | access-date = 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding whiteness studies (WS) more broadly, Kay wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;WS teaches that if you are white, you are branded, literally in the flesh, with evidence of a kind of original sin. You can try to mitigate your evilness, but you can't eradicate it. The goal of WS is to entrench permanent race consciousness in everyone&amp;nbsp;— eternal victimhood for nonwhites, eternal guilt for whites&amp;nbsp;— and was most famously framed by WS chief guru, [[Noel Ignatiev]], former professor at [[Harvard University]] [''sic'', Ignatiev was a Ph.D. student and then a tutor at Harvard, but never a professor], now teaching at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]: "The key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race&amp;nbsp;— in other words, to abolish the privileges of the white skin."&lt;ref name=Kay1/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to such criticism in the mass media, whiteness studies has earned a mixed reception from academics in other fields. In 2001, historian Eric Arnesen wrote that "whiteness has become a blank screen onto which those who claim to analyze it can project their own meanings" and that the field "suffers from a number of potentially fatal methodological and conceptual flaws."&lt;ref name="arnesen"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Arnesen | first = Eric | title = Whiteness and the Historian's Imagination | journal = International Labor and Working-Class History | volume = 60 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;32 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | jstor = 27672732 | date = October 2001 | url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-labor-and-working-class-history/article/whiteness-and-the-historians-imagination/0C13EEC2BC7AE498B2A869DC6B112DA2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, Arnesen writes that the core theses of whiteness studies—that racial categories are arbitrary social constructs without definite biological basis, and that some white Americans benefit from racist discrimination of non-whites—have been common wisdom in academia for many decades and are hardly as novel or controversial as whiteness studies scholars seem to believe. Additionally, Arnesen accuses whiteness studies scholars of sloppy thinking; of making claims not supported by their sources; of overstating supporting evidence and [[cherry picking]] to neglect contrary information.

He notes that a particular datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played a prominent role in conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of "keyword literalism" persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is "nothing less than a moving target."&lt;ref name="arnesen"/&gt; Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the [[Far-left politics|far left]] of the [[political spectrum]], and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans is due in part to white workers not fulfilling the predictions of [[Marxist theory]] that the [[proletariat]] would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow [[capitalism]]. He cites, as an example, [[David Roediger]]’s afterword to the seminal ''Wages of Whiteness'', which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to "the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for [[Reaganism]] in the 1980s."&lt;ref name="arnesen"/&gt; Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish [[Freudian]] speculation about the motives of white people: "The [[psychoanalysis]] of whiteness here differs from the 'talking cure' of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study." Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that "it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools."&lt;ref name="arnesen"/&gt;

In 2002 historian [[Peter Kolchin]] offered a more positive assessment and declared that, at its best, whiteness studies has "unfulfilled potential" and offers a novel and valuable means of studying history.&lt;ref name="kolchin"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kolchin | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Kolchin | title = Whiteness Studies: The New History of Race in America | journal = [[Journal of American History]] | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 154&amp;ndash;173 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | jstor = 270078 | doi = 10.2307/2700788 | date = June 2002 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/2700788 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.cwu.edu/diversity/sites/cts.cwu.edu.diversity/files/documents/whiteness.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Particularly, he praises scholarship into the development of the ''concept'' of whiteness in the United States, and notes that the definition and implications of a white racial identity have shifted over the decades. Yet Kolchin describes a "persistent sense of unease " with certain aspects of whiteness studies. There is no consensus definition of whiteness, and thus the word is used in vague and contradictory ways, with some scholars even leaving the term undefined in their articles or essays."&lt;ref name="kolchin"/&gt; Kolchin also objects to "a persistent dualism evident in the work of the best whiteness studies authors," who often claim that whiteness is a social construct while also arguing, paradoxically, that whiteness is an "omnipresent and unchanging" reality existing independent of socialization.&lt;ref name="kolchin"/&gt; Kolchin agrees that entering a post-racial paradigm might be beneficial for humanity, but he challenges the didactic tone of whiteness studies scholars who single out a white racial identification as negative, while praising a black or Asian self-identification. Scholars in whiteness studies sometimes seriously undermine their arguments by interpreting historical evidence independent of its broader context (e.g., Karen Brodkin’s examination of American anti-semitism largely neglects its roots in European anti-semitism). Finally, Kolchin categorically rejects the argument—common amongst many whiteness scholars—that racism and whiteness are intrinsically and uniquely American, and he expresses concern at the "belief in the moral emptiness of whiteness [...] there is a thin line between saying that whiteness is evil and saying that whites are evil."&lt;ref name="kolchin"/&gt;

[[Theodore W. Allen]], pioneering writer on "white skin privilege" and "white privilege" from the 1960s until his death in 2005, offered a critical review "On Roediger’s Wages of Whiteness" (Revised Edition)].&lt;ref name="Wages" /&gt; He personally put "whiteness" in quotes because he shied away from using the term. As Allen explained, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"it’s an abstract noun, it’s an abstraction, it’s an attribute of some people, it’s not the role they play. And the white race is an actual objective thing. It’s not anthropologic, it’s a historically developed identity of European Americans and Anglo-Americans and so it has to be dealt with. It functions... in this history of ours and it has to be recognized as such. . . .to slough it off under the heading of ‘whiteness,’ to me seems to get away from the basic white race identity trauma."&lt;ref name="Wages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 78 n. 187}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Cuffay was mixed-race; the son of a [[Gillingham, Kent]] woman of Anglo-Saxon heritage, Juliana Fox and a man of African heritage, Chatham Cuffey who was previously enslaved and originally from [[Saint Kitts]] (then a British colony). 
He was born in 1788 in Old Brompton, an area of the [[Medway Towns]] that is now in Gillingham. Cuffay was apprenticed to a tailor, and later worked for Matthews and Acworth, on Chatham High Street. He was of short stature, being {{convert|4|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}} tall. Cuffay moved to London around 1819 and was married three times. His only daughter Ann Juliana Cuffay, was baptised at St Mary Magdalenes Church, Gillingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aubry|2005|p=27}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chartist organiser ==
Cuffay rejected the [[Owenism|Owenite]] trade unions of the London tailors. He went on strike with his fellow tailors in 1834, demanding a ten-hour workday between April to July and an [[eight-hour day]] during the rest of the year with pay of 6 shillings and 5 pence a day. The strike collapsed, Cuffay was sacked and subsequently [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklisted]] from employment.&lt;ref name=A28&gt;{{Harvnb|Aubry|2005|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, Cuffay helped to form the Metropolitan Tailors' Charter Association. He was elected first to the Chartist Metropolitan Delegate Council in 1841 and onto the National Executive in 1842.&lt;ref name=A28/&gt;

Cuffay was one of the organisers of the large [[Chartism#1848 Petition|Chartist rally]] on [[Kennington Common]] on 10 April 1848, but was dismayed by the timidity of other leaders, who had rejected the idea that the rally should be a show of force. Cuffay's radical faction soon became involved in plans for a display of "physical force".

==Arrest and transportation==
Betrayed by a government spy, Cuffay was arrested and accused of "conspiring to levy war" against [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name=Sandiford /&gt; Defended by eminent [[barrister]] [[John Walter Huddleston]], he was convicted of preparing acts of arson, intended as a signal for the planned armed uprising. Sentenced to 21 years [[penal transportation]], Cuffay spent the rest of his life in [[Tasmania]].

Though he was pardoned three years after his conviction, Cuffay elected to stay in Tasmania, working as a tailor and involving himself in local politics. He died in poverty at the Hobart Invalid Depot in July 1870.&lt;ref name=Sandiford&gt;Keith A. P. Sandiford, ''A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora'', Hansib Publications, 2008, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A29&gt;{{Harvnb|Aubry|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuffay's transportation to Australia did not end his political activity. He continued to organise and agitate for democratic rights in Tasmania until he died in 1870, at the age of 82. Although Cuffay died a pauper, seven Australian newspapers in three states – Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria – published obituaries. One observed that his grave had been "marked", should a memorial to him be built at some future time. The memorial never transpired, and Cuffay was forgotten in Australia and Britain. Interest has since been rekindled, with plans in motion to construct the abandoned memorial or a statue on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2011/3275929.htm "The Isle of Denial: William Cuffay in Van Diemens Land".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and events==
Cuffay was the subject of a 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] programme entitled ''Britain's Black Revolutionary'' written and presented by the former trades union leader [[Bill Morris, Baron Morris of Handsworth|Bill Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t4q0j "Britain's Black Revolutionary"], BBC Radio 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuffay was also the subject of a 2011 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Hindsight radio documentary, entitled ''Isle of Denial: William Cuffay in Van Diemen's Land'', which was shortlisted in the NSW Premiers Award in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/hindsight/the-isle-of-denial-william-cuffay-in-van-diemens/2925954 "Isle of Denial: William Cuffay in Van Diemen's Land"], ABC Radio National Hindsight.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2013, a small exhibition was mounted in the UK Houses of Parliament, marking the 175th anniversary of the publication of the People's Charter. It included, poignantly, the copy of Byron's collected poetry that London Chartists had given to Cuffay when he was transported, "as a token of their sincere regard and affection for his genuine patriotism and moral worth".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Star'', 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
