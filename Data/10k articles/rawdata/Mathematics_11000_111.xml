{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement Statistics''' ('''AP Statistics''', '''AP Stat''' or '''AP Stats''') is a college-level [[high school]] [[statistics]] course offered in the United States through the [[College Board]]'s [[Advanced Placement]] program. This course is equivalent to a one semester, non-[[calculus]]-based introductory college statistics course and is normally offered to [[eleventh grade|juniors]] and [[twelfth grade|seniors]] in high school.

One of the College Board's more recent additions,&lt;ref name="mulekar4"&gt;Mulekar (2004), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; the AP Statistics exam was first administered in May 1996 to supplement the AP program's math offerings, which had previously consisted of only [[Advanced Placement Calculus|AP Calculus AB and BC]].&lt;ref name="piccolino"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Piccolino |first=Anthony V. |date=May 1996 |title=The Advanced Placement course in statistics: Increasing students' options |journal= The Mathematics Teacher|volume= 89|issue= 5|pages=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], enrollment in AP Statistics classes has increased at a higher rate than in any other AP class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Statistics: A Desktop Quick Reference|last=Boslaugh |first=Sarah |author2=Paul Andrew Watters|year= 2008 |publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=0-596-51049-7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnhgO65Pyl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may receive college credit or upper-level college course placement upon the successful completion of a three-hour exam ordinarily administered in May. The exam consists of a multiple choice section and a free response section that are both 90 minutes long. Each section is weighted equally in determining the students' composite scores.

The Advanced Placement program has offered students the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the [[Educational Testing Service]], the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997.&lt;ref name="piccolino"/&gt; The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 [[academic year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Developing Students' Statistical Reasoning: Connecting Research and Teaching Practice |last=Garfield |first=Joan B. |author2=Dani Ben-Zvi |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4020-8382-3 |page=8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lAZMh4aRmA4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year [[algebra]] course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in [[academic major|majors]] that use statistics has grown.&lt;ref name="piccolino"/&gt; A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year.&lt;ref name="hinders3"/&gt; Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, making it one of the 10 largest AP exams.

==Course==
If the course is provided by their school, students normally take AP Statistics in their junior or senior year and may decide to take it concurrently with a [[pre-calculus]] course.&lt;ref name="mulekar4"/&gt; This offering is intended to imitate a one-semester, non-calculus based college statistics course, but high schools can decide to offer the course over one [[Academic term|semester]], two [[Academic term|trimesters]], or a full [[Academic term|academic year]].&lt;ref name="piccolino"/&gt;

The six-member AP Statistics Test Development Committee is responsible for developing the curriculum. Appointed by the College Board, the committee consists of three college statistics teachers and three high school statistics teachers who are typically asked to serve for terms of three years.&lt;ref name="mulekar3"&gt;Mulekar (2004), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hinders4"&gt;Hinders (2007), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
[[Image:Black cherry tree histogram.svg|thumb|right|Students are expected to be able to interpret graphs, such as this [[histogram]], and analyze its characteristics, including [[average|center]], [[Statistical dispersion|spread]], shape, [[outlier]]s, clusters, and gaps.&lt;ref name="koehler7-9"/&gt;]]
Emphasis is placed not on actual arithmetic computation, but rather on conceptual understanding and interpretation.&lt;ref name="mulekar5"&gt;Mulekar (2004), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves [[data analysis|exploring data]]&lt;ref name="piccolino"/&gt; and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including [[univariate]], [[bivariate data|bivariate]], and [[categorical data|categorical]] data.&lt;ref name="koehler7-9"&gt;Koehler (2008), pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; The second theme involves [[design of experiments|planning and conducting a study]] and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students must be aware of the various methods of [[data collection]] through [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] or [[experiment]]ation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (2008), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The third theme involves [[probability]] and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (2008), pp. 8, 10&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves [[statistical inference]] using [[point estimation]], [[confidence intervals]], and [[significance test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (2008), pp. 8, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
{{see also|Advanced Placement Exams}}
Along with the course curriculum, the exam is developed by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and clarity.&lt;ref name="hinders4"/&gt; Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.&lt;ref name="mulekar3"/&gt;

===Structure===
The exam is offered every year in May.&lt;ref name="mulekar8"&gt;Mulekar (2004), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Students are not expected to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to [[descriptive statistics]], [[probability]], and [[inferential statistics]] is provided. Moreover, tables for the [[normal distribution|normal]], [[Student's t]] and [[chi-squared distribution]]s are given as well.&lt;ref name="piccolino"/&gt; Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities.&lt;ref name="simmons6"/&gt; The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1997), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each.&lt;ref name="simmons5"&gt;Simmons (2009), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts.&lt;ref name="simmons5"/&gt; The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.&lt;ref name="simmons6"&gt;Simmons (2009), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiple choice section is scored immediately after the exam by computer.&lt;ref name="mulekar8"/&gt; One point is awarded for each correct answer, no points are credited or deducted for unanswered questions, and points are no longer deducted for having an incorrect answer.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1997), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Students' answers to the free-response section are reviewed in early June by readers that include high school and college statistics teachers gathered in a designated location.&lt;ref name="mulekar8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simmons7"&gt;Simmons (2009), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.&lt;ref name="mulekar8"/&gt;

Both sections are weighted equally when the composite score is calculated.&lt;ref name="simmons5"/&gt; The composite score is reported on a scale from 1 to 5, with a score of 5 being the highest possible.&lt;ref name="simmons7"/&gt;

[[File:Boulier1.JPG|right|thumb|A Chinese abacus, ''[[Suanpan]]'']]
[[File:Houghton Typ 520.03.736 - Margarita philosophica.jpg|right|thumb|''Calculating-Table'' by [[Gregor Reisch]]: ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1503. The woodcut shows ''Arithmetica'' instructing an [[algorism|algorist]] and an abacist (inaccurately represented as [[Boethius]] and [[Pythagoras]]). There was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' into Europe in the 12th century until its triumph in the 16th.&lt;ref name=Boyer253&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''abacus''' (''plural'' '''abaci''' or '''abacuses'''), also called a '''counting frame''', is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=Boyer253/&gt; The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abacuses are often constructed as a [[bamboo]] frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abacuses come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach [[arithmetic]], although they remain popular in the [[post-Soviet states]] as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese [[soroban]], have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating [[Square root|square roots]]. Some of these methods may work with non-[[Natural number|natural]] numbers (numbers such as {{Math|1.5}} and {{Math|{{Frac|3|4}}}}).

Although today many use [[Calculator|calculators]] and [[Computer|computers]] instead of abacuses to calculate, abacuses still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[Africa]] use abacuses, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children.&lt;ref name="Boyer253" /&gt; Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.

==Etymology==
The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄβαξ ''abax'' which means something without base, and improperly, any piece of rectangular board or plank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Stefani|1909|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaisford|1962|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasserre|Livadaras|1976|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alternatively, without reference to ancient texts on etymology, it has been suggested that it means "a square tablet strewn with dust",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1966|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "drawing-board covered with dust (for the use of mathematics)"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onions|Friedrichsen|Burchfield|1967|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of the Greek word, ἄβακoς ''abakos''). Whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular, there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven.&lt;ref name=pull17&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Both C. J. Gadd, a keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the [[British Museum]], and [[Jacob Levy]], a Jewish Historian who wrote ''Neuhebräisches und chaldäisches wörterbuch über die Talmudim und Midraschim [Neuhebräisches and Chaldean dictionary on the Talmuds and Midrashi]'' disagree with the "dust table" theory.&lt;ref name=pull17/&gt;}} Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a [[Northwest Semitic]], perhaps [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], word akin to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ʾābāq'' (אבק), "dust" (or in post-Biblical sense meaning "sand used as a writing surface").&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{harvnb|Huehnergard|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preferred plural of ''abacus'' is a subject of disagreement, with both ''abacuses''&lt;ref name = SOED&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''abaci''&lt;ref name = SOED/&gt; (hard "c") in use. The user of an abacus is called an ''abacist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gove|1976|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mesopotamian===
The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[Sumer]]ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars point to a character from the [[Babylon]]ian [[cuneiform]] which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crump|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of Old Babylonian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melville|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians "may have used the abacus for the operations of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carruccio|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian===
The use of the abacus in [[Ancient Egypt]] is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered.&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1958|pp=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian===
During the [[Achaemenid Empire]], around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Sassanian]] and [[Iran]]ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – [[India]], [[China]], and the [[Roman Empire]], when it is thought to have been exported to other countries.

The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Demosthenes]] (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head.&lt;ref name=Will/&gt;&lt;ref name=pull&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A play by [[Alexis (poet)|Alexis]] from the 4th century BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting, and both [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] and [[Polybius]] mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less, like the pebbles on an abacus.&lt;ref name=pull/&gt; The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1846 AD (the [[Salamis Tablet]]), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble {{convert|149|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|4.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from this time frame the ''Darius Vase'' was unearthed in 1851. It was covered with pictures including a "treasurer" holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other.&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;

The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese abacus, known as the ''[[suanpan]]'' (算盤, lit. "calculating tray"), is typically {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam; beads moved toward the beam are counted, while those moved away from it are not.&lt;ref name="ryerson"&gt;{{harvnb|Fernandes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''suanpan'' can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.

The prototype of the Chinese abacus is the appeared during the Han Dynasty, and the beads are oval. In the Song Dynasty or before used the 4:1 type or four beads abacus similar to the modern abacus or commony known as Japanese style abacus, "you can make a number by hand," and "beads are counted", which can be expressed as a decimal number. Therefore, the abacus is designed as a four-bead abacus.

In the early Ming Dynasty, the abacus began to appear in the form of 1:5 abacus. The upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads. "you can make a number by hand," and "the number of beads will be counted". Binary or any of the following numbers, so the abacus is designed as a five-bead abacus.

In the late Ming Dynasty, the abacus styles that appeared in the  form of 2:5. The upper deck had two beads, and the bottom had five beads. "You can make a number by hand," and "Beads are counted." It can be expressed in hexadecimal or any of the following numbers, and because the calculation method at that time is a Chinese catty equal to sixteen tael（一斤十六兩）which means hexadecimal, the abacus is designed as a two-five bead.

''Suanpan'' can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.

In the long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297), a ''suanpan'' is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).

The similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard ''suanpan'' has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the ''suanpan'' is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.

===Roman===
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]
The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2010|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman "ounces" (i.e. fractions).

===Indian===
The decimal number system invented in India replaced the abacus in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="UniOfNthC1"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and "Arabic" Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=2004-07-04|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Abhidharmakośabhāṣya]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher [[Vasumitra]] said that "placing a wick (Sanskrit ''vartikā'') on the number one (''ekāṅka'') means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand".  It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been. Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Körner|1996|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu texts used the term ''śūnya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mollin|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
{{Main|Soroban}}
[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|Japanese [[soroban]]]]
In Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|算盤, そろばん}}, lit. "Counting tray"), imported from China in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Gul&gt;{{harvnb|Gullberg|1997|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started, as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation popular appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China.

Today's Japanese abacus is a 1:4 type, four-bead abacus was introduced from China in the Muromachi era. It adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads. The top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the Chinese or Korean abacus , and the decimal number can be expressed, so the abacus is designed as one four abacus. The beads are always in the shape of a diamond. The quotient division is generally used instead of the division method; at the same time, in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication. Later, Japan had a 3:5 abacus called天三算盤, which is now the Ize Rongji collection of Shansi Village in Yamagata City. There were also had 2:5 beads abacus.
With the four-bead abacus spread, it is also common to use Japanese abacus around the world. There are also improved Japanese abacus in various places. One of the Japanese-made abacus made in China is an aluminum frame plastic bead abacus. The file is next to the four beads, and the "clearing" button, press the clearing button, immediately put the upper bead to the upper position, the lower bead is dialed to the lower position, immediately clearing, easy to use.

The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean===
The Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.&lt;ref name=Will&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thocp"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jami|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans call it ''jupan'' (주판), ''supan'' (수판) or ''jusan'' (주산).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The four beads abacus( 1:4 ) was introduced to Korea Goryeo Dynaty from the China during Song Dynasty, later the five beads abacus (5:1) abacus was introduced to Korean from China during the Ming Dynasty.

===Native American===

Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Aztec]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanyal|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word Nepōhualtzintzin {{IPA-nah|nepoːwaɬˈt͡sint͡sin|}} comes from [[Nahuatl]] and it is formed by the roots; ''Ne'' – personal -; ''pōhual'' or ''pōhualli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈpoːwalːi|}} – the account -; and ''tzintzin'' {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡sint͡sin|}} – small similar elements. Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the [[Calmecac]] to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|temaɬˈpoʍkeʔ|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.

The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.

Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{sfrac|1|4}} days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in [[floating point]], which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.

The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|pp=94–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]] culture, and even some bracelets of [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.

George I. Sanchez, "Arithmetic in Maya", Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.

The [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albree|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; like advanced [[tally stick]]s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for "counting tool"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aimi|De Pasquale|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnett|Ryan|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hudgins|2004|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leushina|1991|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.

The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trogeman|Ernst|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flegg|1983|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and the [[Armenians|Armenian]] people also used abacuses similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a ''coulba'' by the Turks and a ''choreb'' by the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School abacus==
[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Early-20th-century abacus used in Danish elementary school.]]
[[File:Telraam.JPG|thumb|A twenty bead ''rekenrek'']]
Around the world, abacuses have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the [[numeral system]] and [[arithmetic]].

In Western countries, a bead frame similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

The wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, the gap between the 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire, suggests the latter use.

The red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number-related lessons. The twenty bead version, referred to by its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name ''rekenrek'' ("calculating frame"), is often used, sometimes on a string of beads, sometimes on a rigid framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2011|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological analysis ==
By learning how to calculate with abacus, one can improve his mental calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing large number calculations. [[Mental abacus|Abacus‐based mental calculation]] (AMC) was derived from the abacus which means doing calculation, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in mind with an imaged abacus. It is a high-level cognitive skill that run through calculations with an effective algorithm. People doing long-term AMC training shows higher numerical memory capacity and has more effectively connected neural pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Yuzheng|last2=Geng|first2=Fengji|last3=Tao|first3=Lixia|last4=Hu|first4=Nantu|last5=Du|first5=Fenglei|last6=Fu|first6=Kuang|last7=Chen|first7=Feiyan|date=2010-12-14|title=Enhanced white matter tracts integrity in children with abacus training|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.20996|journal=Human Brain Mapping|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=10–21|doi=10.1002/hbm.20996|issn=1065-9471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Tung-Hsin|last2=Chen|first2=Chia-Lin|last3=Huang|first3=Yung-Hui|last4=Liu|first4=Ren-Shyan|last5=Hsieh|first5=Jen-Chuen|last6=Lee|first6=Jason J.

==Uses by the blind==
An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a '''Cranmer abacus''' is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]]. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]].&lt;ref name="aph"&gt;{{harvnb|Terlau|Gissoni|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students.{{POV inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Presley|D'Andrea|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth code]] (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and [[long division]] problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.&lt;ref name="aph" /&gt;

==Binary abacus==
[[File:Bbinary Abacus 002.jpg|150px|thumb|Two binary abacuses constructed by Dr. Robert C. Good, Jr., made from two Chinese abaci]]
The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Good Jr.|1985|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a [[binary number |binary system]] on a computer, or via [[ASCII]]. The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows. The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an "on" or "off" position.

In [[mathematics]], an [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] of numbers is said to '''converge absolutely''' (or to be '''absolutely convergent''') if the sum of the [[absolute value]]s of the summands is finite&lt;!-- don't link to [[finite set]], please --&gt;.  More precisely, a real or complex series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''converge absolutely''' if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left|a_n\right| = L&lt;/math&gt; for some real number &lt;math&gt;\textstyle L&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, an [[improper integral]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_0^\infty f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;, is said to converge absolutely if the integral of the absolute value of the integrand is finite—that is, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_0^\infty \left|f(x)\right|dx = L.&lt;/math&gt;

Absolute convergence is important for the study of infinite series because its definition is strong enough to have properties of finite sums that not all convergent series possess, yet is broad enough to occur commonly. (A convergent series that is not absolutely convergent is called [[Conditional convergence|conditionally convergent]].)  Absolutely convergent series behave "nicely".  For instance, rearrangements do not change the value of the sum.  This is not true for conditionally convergent series: The [[alternating harmonic series]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;, while its rearrangement &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; (in which the repeating pattern of signs is two positive terms followed by one negative term) converges to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{3}{2}\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Background==
One may study the convergence of series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; whose terms ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are elements of an arbitrary [[topological abelian group|abelian topological group]].  The notion of absolute convergence requires more structure, namely a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], which is a real-valued function &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|: G \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; on abelian group ''G'' (written [[Abelian group#Notation|additively]], with identity element 0) such that:
# The norm of the identity element of ''G'' is zero: &lt;math&gt;\|0\| = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# For every ''x'' in ''G'', &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# For every ''x'' in ''G'', &lt;math&gt;\|-x\| = \|x\|.&lt;/math&gt;
# For every ''x'', ''y'' in ''G'', &lt;math&gt;\|x+y\| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \|x-y\|&lt;/math&gt; induces on ''G'' the structure of a [[metric space]] (a type of [[topology]]). We can therefore consider ''G''-valued series and define such a series to be absolutely convergent if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \|a_n\| &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, these statements apply using the norm |''x''| ([[absolute value]]) in the space of real numbers or complex numbers.

==Relation to convergence==
If ''G'' is [[Complete (topology)|complete]] with respect to the metric ''d'', then every absolutely convergent series is convergent.  The proof is the same as for complex-valued series: use the completeness to derive the Cauchy criterion for convergence&amp;mdash;a series is convergent if and only if its tails can be made arbitrarily small in norm&amp;mdash;and apply the triangle inequality.&lt;!-- too HOWTOish? --&gt;

In particular, for series with values in any [[Banach space]], absolute convergence implies convergence. The converse is also true: if absolute convergence implies convergence in a normed space, then the space is a Banach space.&lt;!--Banach spaces are specific here.--&gt;

If a series is convergent but not absolutely convergent, it is called [[conditionally convergent]]. An example of a conditionally convergent series is the [[alternating harmonic series]]. Many standard tests for divergence and convergence, most notably including the [[ratio test]] and the [[root test]], demonstrate absolute convergence. This is because a [[power series]] is absolutely convergent on the interior of its disk&lt;!--What's a 'disk'? Need a more standard synonym (or explanation)--&gt; of convergence.

===Proof that any absolutely convergent series of complex numbers is convergent===
Suppose that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum |a_k|, a_k\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. Then equivalently, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum [\mathrm{Re}(a_k)^2+\mathrm{Im}(a_k)^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, which implies that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum |\mathrm{Re}(a_k)|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum|\mathrm{Im}(a_k)|&lt;/math&gt; converge by termwise comparison of non-negative terms.  It suffices to show that the convergence of these series implies the convergence of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum \mathrm{Re}(a_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum \mathrm{Im}(a_k)&lt;/math&gt;, for then, the convergence of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum a_k=\sum \mathrm{Re}(a_k)+i\sum\mathrm{Im}(a_k)&lt;/math&gt; would follow, by the definition of the convergence of complex-valued series. 

The preceding discussion shows that we need only prove that convergence of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum |a_k|, a_k\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; implies the convergence of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum a_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum |a_k|, a_k\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be convergent.  Since  &lt;math&gt;0 \leq a_k + |a_k| \leq 2|a_k|&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;0 \leq \sum_{k = 1}^n (a_k + |a_k|) \leq \sum_{k = 1}^n 2|a_k|&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum 2|a_k|&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;s_n=\sum_{k = 1}^n (a_k + |a_k|)&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded monotonic sequence of partial sums, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum (a_k + |a_k|)&lt;/math&gt; must also converge.  Noting that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum a_k = \sum(a_k+|a_k|) - \sum |a_k|&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of convergent series, we conclude that it too is a convergent series, as desired.

==== Alternative proof using the Cauchy criterion and triangle inequality ====
By applying the Cauchy criterion for the convergence of a complex series, we can also prove this fact as a simple implication of the [[triangle inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=71–72|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the [[Cauchy's convergence test|Cauchy criterion]], &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum |a_i|&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\big|\sum_{i=m}^n |a_i|\big|=\sum_{i=m}^n |a_i|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;m,n\geq N&lt;/math&gt;. But the triangle inequality implies that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\big|\sum_{i=m}^n a_i\big|\leq\sum_{i=m}^n |a_i|&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\big|\sum_{i=m}^n a_i\big|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;m,n\geq N&lt;/math&gt;, which is exactly the Cauchy criterion for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof that any absolutely convergent series in a Banach space is convergent===
The above result can be easily generalized to every Banach space {{nowrap|(''X'', ǁ&amp;thinsp;&amp;sdot;&amp;thinsp;ǁ)}}.  Let {{nowrap| &amp;sum;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }} be an absolutely convergent series in&amp;nbsp;''X''.  As &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sum_{k=1}^n\|x_k\|&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, for any {{nowrap|&amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0}} and large enough natural numbers {{nowrap|''m'' &amp;gt; ''n''}} it holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sum_{k=1}^m\|x_k\|-\sum_{k=1}^n\|x_k\|\right| = \sum_{k=n+1}^m\|x_k\|&lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

By the triangle inequality for the norm {{nowrap| ǁ&amp;thinsp;&amp;sdot;&amp;thinsp;ǁ}}, one immediately gets:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\|\sum_{k=1}^m x_k-\sum_{k=1}^nx_k\right\| = \left\|\sum_{k=n+1}^m x_k\right\| \le \sum_{k=n+1}^m\|x_k\|&lt;\varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;
which means that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sum_{k=1}^nx_k&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in&amp;nbsp;''X'', hence the series is convergent in&amp;nbsp;''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Rearrangements and unconditional convergence==
In the general context of a ''G''-valued series, a distinction is made between absolute and unconditional convergence, and the assertion that a real or complex series which is not absolutely convergent is necessarily conditionally convergent (meaning not unconditionally convergent) is then a theorem, not a definition.  This is discussed in more detail below.

Given a series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; with values in a normed abelian group ''G'' and a [[permutation]] σ of the natural numbers, one builds a new series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, said to be a rearrangement of the original series.  A series is said to be [[unconditionally convergent]] if all rearrangements of the series are convergent to the same value.

When ''G'' is complete, absolute convergence implies unconditional convergence:

:'''Theorem.''' Let 
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i=A \in G, \quad \sum_{i=1}^\infty \|a_i\|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; 
:and let {{math|''σ'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} be a permutation. Then: 
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(i)}=A.&lt;/math&gt;

The issue of the converse is interesting.  For real series it follows from the [[Riemann rearrangement theorem]] that unconditional convergence implies absolute convergence.  Since a series with values in a finite-dimensional normed space is absolutely convergent if each of its one-dimensional projections is absolutely convergent, it follows that absolute and unconditional convergence coincide for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued series.

But there are unconditionally and non-absolutely convergent series with values in [[Banach space]] ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, for example:
 
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \tfrac{1}{n} e_n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{e_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is an orthonormal basis.  A theorem of [[Aryeh Dvoretzky|A.&amp;nbsp;Dvoretzky]] and [[Claude Ambrose Rogers|C.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Rogers]] asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space admits an unconditionally  convergent series that is not absolutely convergent.&lt;ref&gt;Dvoretzky, A.; Rogers, C. A. (1950), "Absolute and unconditional convergence in normed linear spaces", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. '''36''':192&amp;ndash;197.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof of the theorem===
For any ε &gt; 0, we can choose some &lt;math&gt;\kappa_\varepsilon,\lambda_\varepsilon \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\forall N&gt;\kappa_\varepsilon &amp;\quad \sum_{n=N}^\infty \|a_n\| &lt; \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2} \\ 
\forall N&gt;\lambda_\varepsilon &amp;\quad \left\|\sum_{n=1}^N a_n-A\right\| &lt; \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
N_\varepsilon &amp;=\max \left \{ \kappa_\varepsilon, \lambda_\varepsilon \right \} \\
M_{\sigma,\varepsilon} &amp;= \max \left\{  \sigma^{-1}\left( \left \{ 1,\dots,N_\varepsilon \right \}\right) \right\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally for any integer &lt;math&gt; N &gt; M_{\sigma,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; let

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_{\sigma,\varepsilon} &amp;= \left\{ 1,\ldots,N \right\}\setminus \sigma^{-1}\left( \left \{ 1,\dots,N_\varepsilon \right \}\right) \\
S_{\sigma,\varepsilon} &amp;= \min \left \{ \sigma(k) \ : \ k \in I_{\sigma,\varepsilon} \right \} \\
L_{\sigma,\varepsilon} &amp;= \max \left \{ \sigma(k) \ : \ k \in I_{\sigma,\varepsilon} \right \}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left\|\sum_{i=1}^N a_{\sigma(i)}-A \right\| &amp;= \left\| \sum_{i \in \sigma^{-1}\left(\{ 1,\dots,N_\varepsilon \}\right)} a_{\sigma(i)} - A  +  
\sum_{i\in I_{\sigma,\varepsilon}} a_{\sigma(i)} \right\| \\
&amp;\leq \left\|\sum_{j=1}^{N_\varepsilon} a_j - A \right\| + \left\|\sum_{i\in I_{\sigma,\varepsilon}} a_{\sigma(i)} \right\| \\
&amp;\leq \left\|\sum_{j=1}^{N_\varepsilon} a_j - A \right\| + \sum_{i \in I_{\sigma,\varepsilon}} \left \| a_{\sigma(i)} \right \| \\
&amp;\leq \left\|\sum_{j=1}^{N_\varepsilon} a_j - A \right\| + \sum_{j = S_{\sigma,\varepsilon}}^{L_{\sigma,\varepsilon}} \left \| a_j \right \| \\
&amp;\leq \left\|\sum_{j=1}^{N_\varepsilon} a_j - A \right\| + \sum_{j = N_\varepsilon + 1}^{\infty} \left \| a_j \right \| &amp;&amp; S_{\sigma,\varepsilon} \geq N_{\varepsilon}+1\\
&amp;&lt; \varepsilon
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that

:&lt;math&gt; \forall\varepsilon &gt; 0, \exists M_{\sigma,\varepsilon}, \forall N &gt; M_{\sigma,\varepsilon} \quad \left\|\sum_{i=1}^N a_{\sigma(i)}-A \right\|&lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(i)}=A&lt;/math&gt;

[[Q.E.D.]]

==Products of series==
The [[Cauchy product]] of two series converges to the product of the sums if at least one of the series converges absolutely.  That is, suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n = B&lt;/math&gt;.

The Cauchy product is defined as the sum of terms ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' where:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, if ''either'' the ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' sum converges absolutely, then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n = AB.&lt;/math&gt;

==Absolute convergence of integrals==
The integral &lt;math&gt;\int_A f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; of a real or complex-valued function is said to '''converge absolutely''' if &lt;math&gt;\int_A \left|f(x)\right|\,dx &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;  One also says that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''absolutely integrable'''.  The issue of absolute integrability is intricate and depends on whether the Riemann, Lebesgue, or Kurzweil-Henstock (gauge) integral is considered; for the Riemann integral, it also depends on whether we only consider integrability in its proper sense (&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; both bounded), or permit the more general case of improper integrals. 

As a standard property of the Riemann integral, when &lt;math&gt;A=[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded interval, every continuous function is bounded and (Riemann) integrable, and since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; continuous implies &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; continuous, every continuous function is absolutely integrable.  In fact, since &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is (properly) integrable and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, it follows that &lt;math&gt;|f|=|\cdot|\circ f&lt;/math&gt; is properly Riemann integrable if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is.  However, this implication does not hold in the case of improper integrals.  For instance, the function &lt;math&gt;f:[1,\infty)\to\mathbb{R},\ \ x\mapsto x^{-1}\sin x&lt;/math&gt; is improperly Riemann integrable on its unbounded domain, but it is not absolutely integrable: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx=\frac{1}{2}\big[\pi - 2\mathrm{Si}(1)\big]\approx 0.62&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \Big|\frac{\sin x}{x}\Big|dx=\infty&lt;/math&gt;.   &lt;/blockquote&gt;Indeed, more generally, given any series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n &lt;/math&gt; one can consider the associated step function &lt;math&gt;f_a: [0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;f_a([n,n+1)) = a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty f_a \, dx&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely, converges conditionally or diverges according to the corresponding behavior of &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n. &lt;/math&gt;

The situation is different for the Lebesgue integral, which does not handle bounded and unbounded domains of integration separately (''see below'').  The fact that the integral of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded in the examples above implies that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is also not integrable in the Lebesgue sense.  In fact, in the Lebesgue theory of integration, given that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is measurable, &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; is (Lebesgue) integrable if and only if &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is (Lebesgue) integrable.  However, the hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is measurable is crucial; it is not generally true that absolutely integrable functions on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; are integrable (simply because they may fail to be measurable): let &lt;math&gt;S \subset [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; be a nonmeasurable subset and consider &lt;math&gt;f = \chi_S - 1/2,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic function of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not Lebesgue measurable and thus not integrable, but &lt;math&gt;|f|\equiv 1/2&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function and clearly integrable.  

On the other hand, a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be Kurzweil-Henstock integrable (or "gauge integrable") while &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is not.  This includes the case of improperly Riemann integrable functions.

In a general sense, on any measure space &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the Lebesgue integral of a real-valued function is defined in terms of its positive and negative parts, so the facts:

# ''f'' integrable implies |''f''| integrable
# ''f'' measurable, |''f''| integrable implies ''f'' integrable

are essentially built into the definition of the Lebesgue integral.  In particular, applying the theory to the counting measure on a set ''S'', one recovers the notion of unordered summation of series developed by Moore–Smith using (what are now called) nets.  When ''S'' = '''N''' is the set of natural numbers, Lebesgue integrability, unordered summability and absolute convergence all coincide.

Finally, all of the above holds for integrals with values in a Banach space.  The definition of a Banach-valued Riemann integral is an evident modification of the usual one.  For the Lebesgue integral one needs to circumvent the decomposition into positive and negative parts with Daniell's more functional analytic approach, obtaining the [[Bochner integral]].

'''Alberto Bressan''' (born 15 June 1956) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]] at [[Penn State University]]. His primary field of research is [[mathematical analysis]] including [[hyperbolic system]]s of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, [[impulsive control]] of [[Lagrangian system]]s, and non-cooperative [[differential game]]s.
He obtained his [[PhD]] in mathematics from [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] under [[Jerrold Bebernes]] in 1982. Bressan received a full professorship at the [[International School for Advanced Studies|SISSA]] in Trieste, Italy in 1991. In 2003, he moved to [[Penn State University]] to assume a full professorship there — a position he still holds. He won the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/prizes/bocher-prize.html|title=Bocher Memorial Prize|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Analysis of Partial Differential Equations Prize of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] in 2007 for his work in [[Partial differential equation|PDEs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.siam.org/prizes/sponsored/siagapde.php|title=SIAM: SIAG/Analysis of Partial Differential Equations Prize|website=www.siam.org|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the Eberly Family Chair in Mathematics at Penn State in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2008-news/bressan8-2008.htm/|title=Alberto Bressan is Named Holder of the Eberly Family Chair in Mathematics |date=August 2008|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above, his honors include the ''[[Feltrinelli Prize|A. Feltrinelli prize]] for Mathematics, Mechanics and Applications'' of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2006-news/Bressan9-2006.htm|title=Bressan Awarded Antonio Feltrinelli Prize |date=2006-09-26|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bressan has contributed several important results in the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws and was invited to give a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] at Beijing in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/o/ICM/Speakers/SortedByLastname.php|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers since 1950 |publisher=[[International Mathematical Union]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/Videos/ICM2002/muster.php?Bressan_Alberto|title=Hyperbolic Systems of Conservation Laws in One Space Dimension|last=Bressan|first=Alberto|date=2002-08-26|work=Video|publisher=[[International Mathematical Union]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early work was on certain mathematical problems from the theory of combustion. His research to date includes a number of key results in such diverse areas as: hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and nonlinear wave equations, impulsive control of Lagrangian system, systems of [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s (related to non-cooperative differential games), Nash equilibrium solutions in feedback form for infinite-horizon, discounted differential games, dynamic blocking problems (mathematical models of wild fire confinement), and optimization problems for elliptic equations.

{{Floating-point}}

The '''bfloat16 floating-point format''' is a [[computer number format]] occupying [[16-bit|16 bits]] in [[computer memory]]; it represents a wide [[dynamic range]] of numeric values by using a [[floating point|floating radix point]]. This format is a truncated (16-bit) version of the 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point format]] (binary32) with the intent of [[Hardware acceleration|accelerating]] [[machine learning]] and [[Intelligent_sensor|near-sensor computing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.23919/DATE.2018.8342167|chapter=A transprecision floating-point platform for ultra-low power computing|title=2018 Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe Conference &amp; Exhibition (DATE)|pages=1051–1056|year=2018|last1=Tagliavini|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Mach|first2=Stefan|last3=Rossi|first3=Davide|last4=Marongiu|first4=Andrea|last5=Benin|first5=Luca|isbn=978-3-9819263-0-9|arxiv=1711.10374}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It preserves the approximate dynamic range of 32-bit floating-point numbers by retaining 8 [[Exponent bias|exponent bits]], but supports only a 8-bit precision rather than the 24-bit [[significand]] of the binary32 format. More so than single-precision 32-bit floating-point numbers, bfloat16 numbers are unsuitable for integer calculations, but this is not their intended use.

The bfloat16 format is utilized in upcoming Intel [[AI accelerator|AI processors]], such as [[Nervana Systems|Nervana]] NNP-L1000, [[Xeon]] processors, and Intel [[FPGA]]s,&lt;ref name="vent_Inte"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Intel unveils Nervana Neural Net L-1000 for accelerated AI training | author = Khari Johnson | work = VentureBeat | date = 2018-05-23 | accessdate = 2018-05-23 | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/23/intel-unveils-nervana-neural-net-l-1000-for-accelerated-ai-training/ |quote = ...Intel will be extending bfloat16 support across our AI product lines, including Intel Xeon processors and Intel FPGAs. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="top5_Inte"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Intel Lays Out New Roadmap for AI Portfolio | author = Michael Feldman | work = TOP500 Supercomputer Sites | date = 2018-05-23 | accessdate = 2018-05-23 | url = https://www.top500.org/news/intel-lays-out-new-roadmap-for-ai-portfolio/ | quote = Intel plans to support this format across all their AI products, including the Xeon and FPGA lines }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toms_Inte"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Intel To Launch Spring Crest, Its First Neural Network Processor, In 2019 | author = Lucian Armasu | work = Tom's Hardware | date = 2018-05-23 | accessdate = 2018-05-23 | url = https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-neural-network-processor-lake-crest,37105.html | quote = Intel said that the NNP-L1000 would also support bfloat16, a numerical format that’s being adopted by all the ML industry players for neural networks.

== bfloat16 floating-point format ==
&lt;!-- "significand", with a d at the end, is a technical term, please do not confuse with "significant" --&gt;

'''bfloat16''' has the following format:
* [[Sign bit]]: 1 bit
* [[Exponent]] width: 8 bits
* [[Significand]] [[precision (arithmetic)|precision]]: 8 bits (7 explicitly stored), as opposed to 24 bits in a classical single-precision floating-point format

The bfloat16 format, being a truncated [[Single-precision floating-point format|IEEE 754 single-precision]] 32-bit float, allows for fast [[Type conversion|conversion]] to and from an IEEE 754 single-precision 32-bit float, and preserves the exponent bits while reducing the significand. Preserving the exponent bits maintains the 32-bit float's range of ~1e-38 to ~3e38.&lt;ref name="googleio18-day1-time2575"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Livestream Day 1: Stage 8 (Google I/O '18) - YouTube | author =  | work = Google | date = 2018-05-08 | accessdate = 2018-05-23 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm67WcLzfvc&amp;t=2555 | language =   | quote = In many models this is a drop-in replacement for float-32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bits are laid out as follows:

[[Image:Bfloat16 format.svg|Structure of the bfloat16 floating-point format|upright=1.2|frameless]]

Contrast to a [[Single-precision floating-point format|IEEE 754 single-precision]] 32-bit float:

[[Image:Float example.svg]]

=== Exponent encoding ===
The bfloat16 binary floating-point exponent is encoded using an [[Offset binary|offset-binary]] representation, with the zero offset being 127; also known as exponent bias in the IEEE 754 standard.

* E&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 01&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;−7F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = −126
* E&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = FE&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;−7F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 127
* [[Exponent bias]] = 7F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 127

Thus, in order to get the true exponent as defined by the offset-binary representation, the offset of 127 has to be subtracted from the value of the exponent field.

The minimum and maximum values of the exponent field (00&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and FF&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) are interpreted specially, like in the IEEE 754 standard formats.

The minimum positive normal value is 2&lt;sup&gt;−126&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1.18 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−38&lt;/sup&gt; and the minimum positive (subnormal) value is 2&lt;sup&gt;−126−7&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;−133&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 9.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−41&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Encoding of special values ==

=== Positive and negative infinity ===
Just as in [[IEEE 754]], positive and negative infinity are represented with their corresponding [[sign bit]]s, all 8 exponent bits set (FF&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;) and all significand bits zero. Explicitly,&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
val    s_exponent_signcnd
+inf = 0_11111111_0000000
-inf = 1_11111111_0000000
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== NaN ===
Just as in [[IEEE 754]], [[NaN]] values are represented with either sign bit, all 8 exponent bits set (FF&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;) and not all significand bits zero. Explicitly,&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
val    s_exponent_signcnd
+NaN = 0_11111111_klmnopq
-NaN = 1_11111111_klmonpq
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;where at least one of ''k, l, m, n, o, p,'' or ''q'' is 1. As with IEEE 754, NaN values can be quiet or signaling, although there are no known uses of signaling bfloat16 NaNs as of September 2018.

These examples are given in bit ''representation'', in [[hexadecimal]] and [[Binary number|binary]], of the floating-point value. This includes the sign, (biased) exponent, and significand.
 3f80 = 0 01111111 0000000 = 1
 c000 = 1 10000000 0000000 = −2

 7f7f = 0 11111110 1111111 = (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) × 2&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3.38953139 × 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; (max finite positive value in bfloat16 precision)
 0080 = 0 00000001 0000000 = 2&lt;sup&gt;−126&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1.175494351 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−38&lt;/sup&gt; (min normalized positive value in bfloat16 precision and single-precision floating point)
The maximum positive finite value of a normal bfloat16 number is 3.38953139 × 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;, slightly below (2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) × 2&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.402823466 × 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;, the max finite positive value representable in single precision.

=== Zeros and infinities ===
 0000 = 0 00000000 0000000 = 0
 8000 = 1 00000000 0000000 = −0

 7f80 = 0 11111111 0000000 = infinity

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">The '''Blaschke selection theorem''' is a result in [[topology]] and [[convex geometry]] about [[sequence]]s of [[convex set]]s.  Specifically, given a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{K_n\}&lt;/math&gt; of convex sets contained in a [[bounded set]], the theorem guarantees the existence of a subsequence &lt;math&gt;\{K_{n_m}\}&lt;/math&gt; and a convex set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K_{n_m}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Hausdorff metric]].  The theorem is named for [[Wilhelm Blaschke]].

==Alternate statements==
* A succinct statement of the theorem is that a [[metric space]] of convex bodies is [[locally compact]].
* Using the [[Hausdorff metric]] on sets, every infinite collection of compact subsets of the unit ball has a limit point (and that limit point is itself a [[compact set]]).

==Application==

As an example of its use, the [[Isoperimetric inequality|isoperimetric problem]] can be shown to have a solution.&lt;ref name=KellyWeiss&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J. Kelly|author2=Max L. Weiss|title=Geometry and Convexity: A Study in Mathematical Methods|publisher=Wiley|year=1979|pages=Section 6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, there exists a curve of fixed length that encloses the maximum area possible.  Other problems likewise can be shown to have a solution:
* [[Lebesgue's universal covering problem]] for a convex universal cover of minimal size for the collection of all sets in the plane of unit diameter,&lt;ref name=KellyWeiss/&gt;
* the maximum inclusion problem,&lt;ref name=KellyWeiss/&gt;
* and the [[Moser's worm problem]] for a convex universal cover of minimal size for the collection of planar curves of unit length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wetzel | first=John E. |date=July 2005 | title=The Classical Worm Problem --- A Status Report | journal=Geombinatorics | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description| A combinatorial game solved using overheating }}

The analysis of Blockbusting may be used as the basis of a strategy for the combinatorial game of [[Domineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Blockbusting is a [[partisan game]] for two players known as Red and Blue (or Right and Left) played on an &lt;math&gt; n \times 1 &lt;/math&gt; strip of squares called "parcels".
Each player, in turn, claims and colors one previously unclaimed parcel until all parcels have been claimed.
At the end, Left's score is the number of pairs of neighboring parcels both of which he has claimed.
Left therefore tries to maximize that number  while Right tries to minimize it.
Adjacent Right-Right pairs do not affect the score.

Although the purpose of the game is to further the study of [[combinatorial game theory]],
Berlekamp provides an interpretation alluding to the practice of [[blockbusting]] by [[real estate agent]]s:
the players may be seen as rival agents buying up all the parcels on a street,
where Left is a [[segregationist]] trying to place his clients as neighbors of one another
while Right is an integrationist trying to break them up.

The operation of overheating introduced to analyze Blockbusting was later adapted by Berlekamp and [[David Wolfe (mathematician)|David Wolfe]]
to [[warming (combinatorial game theory)|warming]] to analyze the end-game of [[Go (game)|Go]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11704">In [[computing]], a '''cache-oblivious algorithm''' (or cache-transcendent algorithm) is an [[algorithm]] designed to take advantage of a [[CPU cache]] without having the size of the cache (or the length of the [[cache line]]s, etc.) as an explicit parameter. An '''optimal cache-oblivious algorithm''' is a cache-oblivious algorithm that uses the cache optimally (in an [[asymptotic notation|asymptotic]] sense, ignoring constant factors).  Thus, a cache-oblivious algorithm is designed to perform well, without modification, on multiple machines with different cache sizes, or for a [[memory hierarchy]] with different levels of cache having different sizes. Cache-oblivious algorithms are contrasted with explicit ''[[Loop tiling|blocking]],'' as in [[loop nest optimization]], which explicitly breaks a problem into blocks that are optimally sized for a given cache.

Optimal cache-oblivious algorithms are known for the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]], [[Cache-oblivious matrix multiplication|matrix multiplication]], [[Funnelsort|sorting]], [[matrix transposition]], and several other problems.  Because these algorithms are only optimal in an asymptotic sense (ignoring constant factors), further machine-specific tuning may be required to obtain nearly optimal performance in an absolute sense. The goal of cache-oblivious algorithms is to reduce the amount of such tuning that is required.

Typically, a cache-oblivious algorithm works by a [[recursion|recursive]] [[divide and conquer algorithm]], where the problem is divided into smaller and smaller subproblems.  Eventually, one reaches a subproblem size that fits into cache, regardless of the cache size.  For example, an optimal cache-oblivious matrix multiplication is obtained by recursively dividing each matrix into four sub-matrices to be multiplied, multiplying the submatrices in a [[depth-first]] fashion. In tuning for a specific machine, one may use a [[hybrid algorithm]] which uses blocking tuned for the specific cache sizes at the bottom level, but otherwise uses the cache-oblivious algorithm.

== History ==
The idea (and name) for cache-oblivious algorithms was conceived by [[Charles E. Leiserson]] as early as 1996 and first published by [[Harald Prokop]] in his master's thesis at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Prokop"&gt;Harald Prokop. [http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/Prokop99.pdf Cache-Oblivious Algorithms]. Masters thesis, MIT. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many predecessors, typically analyzing specific problems; these are discussed in detail in Frigo et al. 1999. Early examples cited include Singleton 1969 for a recursive Fast Fourier Transform, similar ideas in Aggarwal et al. 1987, Frigo 1996 for matrix multiplication and LU decomposition, and [[Todd Veldhuizen]] 1996 for matrix algorithms in the [[Blitz++]] library.

==Idealized cache model==

Cache-oblivious algorithms are typically analyzed using an idealized model of the cache, sometimes called the '''cache-oblivious model'''.  This model is much easier to analyze than a real cache's characteristics (which have complicated associativity, replacement policies, etc.), but in many cases is provably within a constant factor of a more realistic cache's performance. It is different than the [[external memory model]] because cache-oblivious algorithms do not know the [[Block (data storage)|block size]] or the [[Cache (computing)|cache]] size.

In particular, the cache-oblivious model is an [[abstract machine]] (i.e. a theoretical [[model of computation]]). It is similar to the [[RAM model|RAM machine model]] which replaces the [[Turing machine]]'s infinite tape with an infinite array. Each location within the array can be accessed in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time, similar to the [[Random access memory]] on a real computer. Unlike the RAM machine model, it also introduces a cache: a second level of storage between the RAM and the CPU. The other differences between the two models are listed below. In the cache-oblivious model:

[[File:External memory.svg|thumb|The cache on the left holds &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{M}{B}&lt;/math&gt; blocks of size &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; each, for a total of {{mvar|M}} objects. The external memory on the right is unbounded.]]

*Memory is broken into blocks of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; objects each
*A load or a store between [[main memory]] and a CPU register may now be serviced from the cache.
*If a load or a store cannot be serviced from the cache, it is called a ''cache miss''.
*A cache miss results in one block being loaded from main memory into the cache. Namely, if the CPU tries to access word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the line containing &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is loaded into the cache. If the cache was previously full, then a line will be evicted as well (see replacement policy below).
*The cache holds &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; objects, where &lt;math&gt;M = \Omega(B^2)&lt;/math&gt;. This is also known as the ''tall cache assumption''.
*The cache is fully associative: each line can be loaded into any location in the cache.&lt;ref name="Kumar"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The replacement policy is optimal. In other words, the cache is assumed to be given the entire sequence of memory accesses during algorithm execution. If it needs to evict a line at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it will look into its sequence of future requests and evict the line that is accessed furthest in the future. This can be emulated in practice with the [[Least Recently Used]] policy, which is shown to be within a small constant factor of the offline optimal replacement strategy&lt;ref name="Frigo99"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=M. |last1=Frigo |first2=C.

Amortized Efficiency of List Update and Paging Rules. In ''Communications of the ACM'', Volume 28, Number 2, p.202-208. Feb 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

To measure the complexity of an algorithm that executes within the cache-oblivious model, we measure the number of [[cache miss]]es that the algorithm experiences. Because the model captures the fact that accessing elements in the [[cache (computing)|cache]] is much faster than accessing things in [[main memory]], the [[running time]] of the algorithm is defined only by the number of memory transfers between the cache and main memory. This is similar to the [[external memory model]], which all of the features above, but cache-oblivious algorithms are independent of cache parameters (&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Demaine02"&gt;[[Erik Demaine]]. [http://erikdemaine.org/papers/BRICS2002/ Cache-Oblivious Algorithms and Data Structures], in Lecture Notes from the EEF Summer School on Massive Data Sets, BRICS, University of Aarhus, Denmark, June 27–July 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of such an algorithm is that what is efficient on a cache-oblivious machine is likely to be efficient across many real machines without fine tuning for particular real machine parameters. For many problems, an optimal cache-oblivious algorithm will also be optimal for a machine with more than two [[memory hierarchy]] levels.&lt;ref name="Frigo99"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Row_and_column_major_order.svg|thumb|upright|Illustration of row- and column-major order]]
For example, it is possible to design a variant of [[unrolled linked list]]s which is cache-oblivious and allows list traversal of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements in &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{N}{B}&lt;/math&gt; time, where &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the cache size in elements.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} For a fixed &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, this is &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. However, the advantage of the algorithm is that it can scale to take advantage of larger cache line sizes (larger values of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;).

The simplest cache-oblivious algorithm presented in Frigo et al. is an out-of-place [[matrix transpose]] operation ([[in-place matrix transposition|in-place algorithms]] have also been devised for transposition, but are much more complicated for non-square matrices). Given ''m''&amp;times;''n'' array '''A''' and ''n''&amp;times;''m'' array '''B''', we would like to store the transpose of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The naive solution traverses one array in row-major order and another in column-major. The result is that when the matrices are large, we get a cache miss on every step of the column-wise traversal. The total number of cache misses is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(mn)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Matrix_transpose_dc.svg|thumb|right|Principle of cache-oblivious algorithm for matrix transposition using a divide and conquer-approach. The graphic shows the recursive step ('''a''' → '''b''') of dividing the matrix and transposing each part individually.]]
The cache-oblivious algorithm has optimal work complexity &lt;math&gt;O(mn)&lt;/math&gt; and optimal cache complexity &lt;math&gt;O(1+mn/B)&lt;/math&gt;. The basic idea is to reduce the transpose of two large matrices into the transpose of small (sub)matrices. We do this by dividing the matrices in half along their larger dimension until we just have to perform the transpose of a matrix that will fit into the cache.  Because the cache size is not known to the algorithm, the matrices will continue to be divided recursively even after this point, but these further subdivisions will be in cache.  Once the dimensions &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are small enough so an ''input'' array of size &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; and an output array of size &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; fit into the cache, both row-major and column-major traversals result in &lt;math&gt;O(mn)&lt;/math&gt; work and &lt;math&gt;O(mn/B)&lt;/math&gt; cache misses. By using this divide and conquer approach we can achieve the same level of complexity for the overall matrix.

(In principle, one could continue dividing the matrices until a base case of size 1&amp;times;1 is reached, but in practice one uses a larger base case (e.g. 16&amp;times;16) in order to [[Amortized analysis|amortize]] the overhead of the recursive subroutine calls.)

Most cache-oblivious algorithms rely on a divide-and-conquer approach. They reduce the problem, so that it eventually fits in cache no matter how small the cache is, and end the recursion at some small size determined by the function-call overhead and similar cache-unrelated optimizations, and then use some cache-efficient access pattern to merge the results of these small, solved problems.

Like [[external sorting]] in the [[external memory model]], cache-oblivious sorting is possible in two variants: [[funnelsort]], which resembles [[mergesort]], and [[cache-oblivious distribution sort]], which resembles [[quicksort]]. Like their external memory counterparts, both achieve a [[running time]] of &lt;math&gt;O(\tfrac{N}{B} \log_{\tfrac{M}{B}} \tfrac{N}{B})&lt;/math&gt;, which matches a [[lower bound]] and is thus [[asymptotically optimal]].&lt;ref name="Demaine02"/&gt;

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[Lie theory]] and [[algebraic topology]], the notion of '''Cartan pair''' is a technical condition on the relationship between a [[reductive Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and a subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; reductive in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. 

A reductive pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''Cartan''' if the relative [[Lie algebra cohomology]] 
:&lt;math&gt;H^*(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})&lt;/math&gt; 
is isomorphic to the tensor product of the characteristic subalgebra 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\big(S(\mathfrak{k}^*) \to H^*(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})\big)&lt;/math&gt; 
and an exterior subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \hat P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H^*(\mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt;, where
*&lt;math&gt;\hat P&lt;/math&gt;, the ''Samelson subspace'', are those primitive elements in the kernel of the composition &lt;math&gt;P \overset\tau\to S(\mathfrak{g}^*) \to S(\mathfrak{k}^*)&lt;/math&gt;, 
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the primitive subspace of &lt;math&gt;H^*(\mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt;, 
*&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transgression_map|transgression]], 
*and the map &lt;math&gt;S(\mathfrak{g}^*) \to S(\mathfrak{k}^*)&lt;/math&gt; of [[symmetric algebra]]s is induced by the restriction map of dual vector spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

On the level of [[Lie groups]], if ''G'' is a compact, connected Lie group and ''K'' a closed connected subgroup, there are natural fiber bundles
:&lt;math&gt;G \to G_K \to BK&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
&lt;math&gt;G_K := (EK \times G)/K \simeq G/K&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Universal_bundle#Use_in_the_study_of_group_actions|homotopy quotient]], here [[homotopy equivalent]] to the regular quotient, and
:&lt;math&gt;G/K \overset\chi\to BK \overset{r}\to BG&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the characteristic algebra is the image of &lt;math&gt;\chi^*\colon H^*(BK) \to H^*(G/K)&lt;/math&gt;, the transgression &lt;math&gt;\tau\colon P \to H^*(BG)&lt;/math&gt; from the primitive subspace ''P'' of &lt;math&gt;H^*(G)&lt;/math&gt; is that arising from the [[edge map]]s in the [[Serre spectral sequence]] of the [[universal bundle]] &lt;math&gt;G \to EG \to BG&lt;/math&gt;, and the subspace &lt;math&gt;\hat P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H^*(G/K)&lt;/math&gt; is the kernel of &lt;math&gt;r^* \circ \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[universal algebra]], two [[congruences]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''permutable''' if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \circ \beta = \beta \circ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  A '''congruence-permutable algebra''' is one in which all congruences are permutable.  A [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras is congruence-permutable if every algebra in the variety is congruence-permutable.

A '''Mal'cev term''' is a term ''M'' for which

: &lt;math&gt;
M(x, x, y) = y = M(y, x, x).
&lt;/math&gt;

A congruence-permutable variety is one whose signature contains a Mal'cev term.

Most classical varieties in abstract algebra, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s, are congruence-permutable.  Any variety that contains a group operation is congruence-permutable, and the Mal'cev term is &lt;math&gt;xy^{-1}z&lt;/math&gt;.

Let {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}} be an [[affine bundle]] modelled over a vector bundle {{math|{{overline|''Y''}} → ''X''}}. A [[connection (fibred manifold)|connection]] {{math|Γ}} on {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}} is called the '''affine connection''' if it as a section {{math|Γ : ''Y'' → J&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''Y''}} of the [[jet bundle]] {{math|J&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''Y'' → ''Y''}} of {{math|''Y''}} is an affine bundle morphism over {{math|''X''}}. In particular, this is the case of an [[affine connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]] {{math|T''X''}} of a [[smooth manifold]] {{math|''X''}}.

With respect to affine bundle coordinates {{math|(''x&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''y&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} on {{math|''Y''}}, an affine connection {{math|Γ}} on {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}} is given by the [[connection (fibred manifold)|tangent-valued connection form]]

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Gamma &amp;=dx^\lambda\otimes \left(\partial_\lambda + \Gamma_\lambda^i\partial_i\right)\,, \\ \Gamma_\lambda^i&amp;={{\Gamma_\lambda}^i}_j\left(x^\nu\right) y^j + \sigma_\lambda^i\left(x^\nu\right)\,. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An affine bundle is a fiber bundle with a [[affine group|general affine]] [[fiber bundle|structure group]] {{math|GA(''m'', ℝ)}} of affine transformations of its typical fiber {{math|''V''}} of dimension {{math|''m''}}. Therefore, an affine connection is associated to a [[connection (principal bundle)|principal connection]]. It always exists.
 
For any affine connection {{math|Γ : ''Y'' → J&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''Y''}}, the corresponding [[affine bundle|linear derivative]]  {{math|{{overline|Γ}} : {{overline|''Y''}} → J&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;{{overline|''Y''}}}} of an affine morphism {{math|Γ}} defines a unique [[connection (vector bundle)|linear connection]] on a vector bundle {{math|{{overline|''Y''}} → ''X''}}. With respect to linear bundle coordinates {{math|(''x&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;'', {{overline|''y''}}&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} on {{math|{{overline|''Y''}}}}, this connection reads

: &lt;math&gt; \overline \Gamma=dx^\lambda\otimes\left(\partial_\lambda +{{\Gamma_\lambda}^i}_j\left(x^\nu\right) \overline y^j\overline\partial_i\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since every vector bundle is an affine bundle, any linear connection on
a vector bundle also is an affine connection.

If {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}} is a vector bundle, both an affine connection {{math|Γ}} and an associated linear connection {{math|{{overline|Γ}}}} are
connections on the same vector bundle {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}}, and their difference is a basic soldering form on
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma= \sigma_\lambda^i(x^\nu) dx^\lambda\otimes\partial_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, every affine connection on a vector bundle {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}} is a sum of a linear connection and a basic soldering form on {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}}.

Due to the canonical vertical splitting {{math|V''Y'' {{=}} ''Y'' × ''Y''}}, this soldering form is brought into a [[vector-valued differential form|vector-valued form]]
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma= \sigma_\lambda^i(x^\nu) dx^\lambda\otimes e_i &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a fiber basis for {{math|''Y''}}.

Given an affine connection {{math|Γ}} on a vector bundle {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}}, let {{math|''R''}} and {{math|{{overline|''R''}}}} be the [[connection (fibred manifold)|curvatures]] of a connection {{math|Γ}} and the associated linear connection {{math|{{overline|Γ}}}}, respectively.  It is readily observed that {{math|''R'' {{=}} {{overline|''R''}} + ''T''}}, where

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T &amp;=\tfrac12 T_{\lambda\mu}^i dx^\lambda\wedge dx^\mu\otimes \partial_i\,, \\
T_{\lambda \mu}^i &amp;= \partial_\lambda\sigma_\mu^i - \partial_\mu\sigma_\lambda^i + \sigma_\lambda^h {{\Gamma_\mu}^i}_h - \sigma_\mu^h {{\Gamma_\lambda}^i}_h\,, 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[connection (fibred manifold)|torsion]] of {{math|Γ}} with respect to the basic soldering form {{math|''σ''}}.

In particular, let us consider the tangent bundle {{math|T''X''}} of a manifold {{math|''X''}} coordinated by {{math|(''x&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''ẋ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}. There is the canonical soldering form
:&lt;math&gt;\theta=dx^\mu\otimes \dot\partial_\mu &lt;/math&gt;
on {{math|T''X''}} which coincides with the [[tautological one-form]]
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_X=dx^\mu\otimes \partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt;
on {{math|''X''}} due to the canonical vertical splitting {{math|VT''X'' {{=}} T''X'' × T''X''}}. Given an arbitrary linear connection {{math|Γ}} on {{math|T''X''}}, the corresponding affine connection

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A&amp;=\Gamma +\theta\,, \\
A_\lambda^\mu&amp;={{\Gamma_\lambda}^\mu}_\nu \dot x^\nu +\delta^\mu_\lambda\,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

on {{math|T''X''}} is the [[Cartan connection]]. The torsion of the Cartan connection {{math|''A''}} with respect to the soldering form {{math|''θ''}} coincides with the [[torsion tensor|torsion]] of a linear connection {{math|Γ}}, and its curvature is a sum {{math|''R'' + ''T''}} of the curvature and the torsion of {{math|Γ}}.

In [[mathematics]], '''factorization''' (also '''factorisation''' in some forms of [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|British English]]) or '''factoring''' consists of writing a number or another [[mathematical object]] as a product of several ''factors'', usually smaller or simpler objects of the same kind. For example, {{math|3 × 5}} is a factorization of the [[integer]] {{math|15}}, and {{math|(''x'' – 2)(''x'' + 2)}} is a factorization of the [[polynomial]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – 4}}.

Factorization is not usually considered meaningful within number systems possessing [[division ring|division]], such as the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, since any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be trivially written as &lt;math&gt;(xy)\times(1/y)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not zero. However, a meaningful factorization for a [[rational number]] or a [[rational function]] can be obtained by writing it in lowest terms and separately factoring its numerator and denominator. 

Factorization was first considered by [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]] in the case of integers. They proved the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], which asserts that every positive integer may be factored into a product of [[prime number]]s, which cannot be further factored into integers greater than 1. Moreover, this factorization is unique [[up to]] the order of the factors. Although [[integer factorization]] is a sort of inverse to multiplication, it is much more difficult [[Integer_factorization|algorithmically]], a fact which is exploited in the [[RSA cryptosystem]] to implement [[public-key cryptography]].

[[Polynomial factorization]] has also been studied for centuries. In elementary algebra, factoring a polynomial reduces the problem of finding its [[Zero_of_a_function|roots]] to finding the roots of the factors. Polynomials with coefficients in the integers or in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] possess the [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization property]], a version of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic with prime numbers replaced by [[irreducible polynomial]]s. In particular, a [[univariate polynomial]] with [[complex number|complex]] coefficients admits a unique (up to ordering) factorization into [[linear polynomial]]s: this is a version of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. In this case, the factorization can be done with [[root-finding algorithm]]s. The case of polynomials with integer coefficients is fundamental for [[computer algebra]]. There are efficient computer [[algorithm]]s for computing (complete) factorizations within the ring of polynomials with rational number coefficients (see [[factorization of polynomials]]).

A [[commutative ring]] possessing the unique factorization property is called a [[unique factorization domain]]. There are [[number system]]s, such as certain [[ring of algebraic integers|rings of algebraic integers]], which are not unique factorization domains. However, rings of algebraic integers satisfy the weaker property of [[Dedekind domain]]s: [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] factor uniquely into [[prime ideal]]s.

''Factorization'' may also refer to more general decompositions of a mathematical object into the product of smaller or simpler objects. For example, every function may be factored into the composition of a [[surjective function]] with an [[injective function]]. [[matrix (math)|Matrices]] possess many kinds of [[matrix factorization]]s. For example, every matrix has a unique [[LU decomposition|LUP factorization]] as a product of a [[lower triangular matrix]] {{mvar|L}} with all diagonal entries equal to one, an [[upper triangular matrix]] {{mvar|U}}, and a [[permutation matrix]] {{mvar|P}}; this is a matrix formulation of [[Gaussian elimination]].

==Integers==
{{main|Integer factorization}}

By the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], every [[integer]] greater than 1 has a unique (up to the order of the factors) factorization into [[prime number]]s, which are those integers which cannot be further factorized into the product of integers greater than one.

For computing the factorization of an integer {{mvar|n}}, one needs an [[algorithm]] for finding a [[divisor]] {{mvar|q}} of {{mvar|n}} or deciding that {{mvar|n}} is prime. When such a divisor is found, the repeated application of this algorithm to the factors {{mvar|q}} and {{math|''n'' / ''q''}} gives eventually the complete factorization of {{mvar|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hardy |last2= Wright|title= An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers|isbn=978-0198531715|edition=5th|year=1980|publisher=Oxford Science Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For finding a divisor {{mvar|q}} of {{mvar|n}}, if any, it suffices to test all values of {{mvar|q}} such that {{math|1 &lt; q}} and {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''n''}}. In fact, if {{math|''r''}} is a divisor of {{mvar|n}} such that {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''n''}}, then {{math|1=''q'' = ''n'' / ''r''}} is a divisor of {{mvar|n}} such that {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''n''}}.

If one tests the values of {{mvar|q}} in increasing order, the first divisor that is found is necessarily a prime number, and the ''cofactor'' {{math|1=''r'' = ''n'' / ''q''}} cannot have any divisor smaller than {{mvar|q}}. For getting the complete factorization, it suffices thus to continue the algorithm by searching a divisor of {{mvar|r}} that is not smaller than {{mvar|q}} and not greater than {{math|{{sqrt|''r''}}}}.

There is no need to test all values of {{mvar|q}} for applying the method. In principle, it suffices to test only prime divisors. This needs to have a table of prime numbers that may be generated for example with the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]]. As the method of factorization does essentially the same work as the sieve of Eratosthenes, it is generally more efficient to test for a divisor only those numbers for which it is not immediately clear whether they are prime or not. Typically, one may proceed by testing 2, 3, 5, and the numbers &gt; 5, whose last digit is 1, 3, 7, 9 and the sum of digits is not a multiple of 3.

This method works well for factoring small integers, but is inefficient for larger integers. For example, [[Pierre de Fermat]] was unable to discover that the 6th [[Fermat number]] 
:&lt;math&gt;1+2^{2^5}=1+2^{32}=4,294,967,297&lt;/math&gt;
is not a prime number. In fact, applying the above method would require more than 10,000 divisions, for a number that has 10 [[decimal digit]]s.

There are more efficient factoring algorithms. However they remain relatively inefficient, as, with the present state of the art, one cannot factorize, even with the more powerful computers, a number of 500 decimal digits that is the product of two randomly chosen prime numbers. This insures the security of the [[RSA cryptosystem]], which is widely used for secure [[internet]] communication.

===Example===
For factoring {{math|1=''n'' = 1386}} into primes:
* Start with division by 2: the number is even, and {{math|1=''n'' = 2 · 693}}. Continue with 693, and 2 as a first divisor candidate. 
* 693 is odd (2 is not a divisor), but is a multiple of 3: one has {{math|1= 693 = 3 · 231}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 2 · 3 · 231}}. Continue with 231, and 3 as a first divisor candidate.
* 231 is also a multiple of 3: one has {{math|1= 231 = 3 · 77}}, and thus {{math|1=''n'' = 2 · 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 77}}. Continue with 77, and 3 as a first divisor candidate.
* 77 is not a multiple of 3, since the sum of its digits is 14, not a multiple of 3. It is also not a multiple of 5 because its last digit is 7. The next odd divisor to be tested is 7. One has {{math|1= 77 = 7 · 11}}, and thus {{math|1=''n'' = 2 · 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 7 · 11}}. This shows that 7 is prime (easy to test directly). Continue with 11, and 7 as a first divisor candidate. 
* As {{math|7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 11}}, one has finished. Thus 11 is prime, and the prime factorization is 
: {{math|1=1386 = 2 · 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 7 · 11}}.

==Expressions==
Manipulating [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] is the basis of [[algebra]]. Factorization is one of the most important methods for expression manipulation for several reasons. If one can put an [[equation]] in a factored form {{math|1=''E''⋅''F'' = 0}}, then the solving problem splits into two independent (and generally easier) problems {{math|1=''E'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''F'' = 0}}. When an expression can be factored, the factors are often much simpler, and may, therefore, offer some insight on the problem. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;x^3-ax^2-bx^2-cx^2+ abx+acx+bcx-abc&lt;/math&gt;
having 16 multiplications, 4 subtractions and 3 additions, may be factored into the much simpler expression 
:&lt;math&gt;(x-a)(x-b)(x-c),&lt;/math&gt; 
with only two multiplications and three subtractions. Moreover, the factored form gives immediately the [[zero of a function|roots]] ''x = a,b,c'' of the polynomial in {{mvar|x}} represented by these expressions.

On the other hand, factorization is not always possible, and when it is possible, the factors are not always simpler. For example, &lt;math&gt;x^{997}-1&lt;/math&gt; can be factored into two [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible factors]] &lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{996}+x^{995}+\cdots+x^2+x+1&lt;/math&gt;.

Various methods have been developed for finding factorizations; some are described [[#General methods|below]].

Solving [[algebraic equation]]s may be viewed as a problem of factorization. In fact, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] can be stated as follows. Every [[polynomial]] in {{mvar|x}} of degree {{math|''n''}} with [[complex number|complex]] coefficients may be factorized into {{math|''n''}} linear factors &lt;math&gt;x-a_i,&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}, where the {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}s are the roots of the polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1925|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the structure of the factorization is known in these cases, the
{{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}s generally cannot be computed in terms of radicals (''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; roots), by the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]. In most cases, the best that can be done is computing [[approximation|approximate value]]s of the roots with a [[root-finding algorithm]].

===History of factorization of expressions===

The systematic use of algebraic manipulations for simplifying expressions (more specifically [[equation]]s)) may be dated to 9th century, with [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|al-Khwarizmi]]'s book ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'', which is titled with two such types of manipulation. However, even for solving [[quadratic equation]]s, factoring method was not used before [[Thomas Harriot|Harriot]]’s work published in 1631, ten years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;In {{citation|first=Vera|last=Sanford|title=A Short History of Mathematics|year=2008|origyear=1930|publisher=Read Books|isbn=9781409727101}}, the author notes “In view of the present emphasis given to the solution of quadratic equations by factoring, it is interesting to note that this method was not used until Harriot’s work of 1631".&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas'', Harriot drew, in a first section, tables for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of [[monomial]]s, [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s, and [[trinomial]]s. Then, in a second section, he set up the equation {{math|1=''aa'' − ''ba'' + ''ca''  = + ''bc''}}, and showed that this matches the form of multiplication he had previously provided, giving the factorization  {{math|(''a'' − ''b'')(''a'' + ''c'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=771CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Harriot, ''Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===General methods===
The methods that are described below apply to any expression that is a sum, or may be transformed into a sum. Therefore, they are most often applied to [[polynomial]]s, even if they may applied also when the terms of the sum are not [[monomial]]s, that is product of variables and constants

====Common factor====
It may occur that all terms of a sum are products and that some factors are common to all terms. In this case, the [[Distributive property|distributive law]] allows factoring out this common factor. If there are several such common factors, it is worth to divide out the greatest such common factor. Also, if there are integer coefficients, one may factor out the [[greatest common divisor]] of these coefficients.

For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fite|1921|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;6x^3y^2 + 8x^4y^3 - 10x^5y^3 = 2x^3y^2(3 + 4xy -5x^2y),&lt;/math&gt;
since 2 is the greatest common divisor of 6, 8, and 10, and &lt;math&gt;x^3y^2&lt;/math&gt; divides all terms.

====Grouping====
Grouping terms may allow using other methods for getting a factorization.

For example, to factor 
: &lt;math&gt;4x^2+20x+3xy+15y, &lt;/math&gt;
one may remark that the first two terms have a common factor {{mvar|x}}, and the last two terms have the common factor {{mvar|y}}. Thus
: &lt;math&gt;4x^2+20x+3xy+15y = (4x^2+20x)+(3xy+15y) = 4x(x+5)+3y(x+5). &lt;/math&gt;
Then a simple inspection shows the common factor {{math|''x'' + 5}}, leading to the factorization 
: &lt;math&gt;4x^2+20x+3xy+15y = (4x+3y)(x+5).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, this works for sums of 4 terms that have been obtained as the product of two [[binomial (polynomial)|binomials]]. Although not frequently, this may work also for more complicated examples.

====Adding and subtracting terms====
Sometimes, some term grouping lets appear a part of a [[#Recognizable patterns|Recognizable pattern]]. It is then useful to add terms for completing the pattern, and subtract them for not changing the value of the expression. 

A typical use of this is the [[completing the square]] method for getting [[quadratic formula]]. 

Another example is the factorization of &lt;math&gt;x^4 + 1.&lt;/math&gt; If one introduces the [[complex number|imaginary]] [[square root of –1]], commonly denoted {{mvar|i}}, then one has a [[difference of squares]]
:&lt;math&gt;x^4+1=(x^2+i)(x^2-i).&lt;/math&gt;
However, one may also want a factorization with [[real number]] coefficients. By adding and subtracting &lt;math&gt;2x^2,&lt;/math&gt; and grouping three terms together, one may recognize the square of a [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x^4+1 = (x^4+2x^2+1)-2x^2= (x^2+1)^2 - \left(x\sqrt2\right)^2 =\left(x^2+x\sqrt2 +1\right)\left(x^2-x\sqrt2 +1\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Subtracting and adding &lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt; also yields the factorization 
:&lt;math&gt;x^4+1=\left(x^2+x\sqrt{-2} -1\right)\left(x^2-x\sqrt{-2} -1\right).&lt;/math&gt;
These factorizations work not only over the complex numbers, but also over any [[field (mathematics)|field]], where either 1, 2 or –2 is a square. In a [[finite field]], the product of two non-squares is a square; this implies that the [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;x^4 + 1,&lt;/math&gt; which is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the integers, is reducible [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] every [[prime number]]. For example
:&lt;math&gt;x^4 + 1 \equiv (x+1)^4 \pmod 2;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^4 + 1 \equiv (x^2+x-1)(x^2-x-1) \pmod 3,\qquad&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;1^2 \equiv -2 \pmod 3;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^4 + 1 \equiv (x^2+2)(x^2-2) \pmod 5,\qquad&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;2^2 \equiv -1 \pmod 5;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^4 + 1 \equiv (x^2+3x+1)(x^2-3x+1) \pmod 7,\qquad&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;3^2 \equiv 2 \pmod 7.&lt;/math&gt;

===Recognizable patterns===
Many [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] provide an equality between a sum and a product. Above methods may be used for letting appear in an expression the sum side of some identity, which may therefore be replaced by a product. 

Below are identities whose left-hand-side are commonly used as patterns (this means that the variables {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|F}} that appear in these identities may represent any subexpression of the expression that has to be factorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Selby|1970|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*;[[Difference of two squares]]
::&lt;math&gt; E^2 - F^2 = (E+F)(E-F),&lt;/math&gt;
:For example,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - x^2 +2xy - y^2 &amp;= (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - (x^2 -2xy + y^2) \\
&amp;= (a+b)^2 - (x -y)^2 \\
&amp;= (a+b + x -y)(a+b -x + y).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
*;Sum/difference of two cubes
[[File:Differenceofcubes.jpg|thumb|A visual representation of the factorization of cubes using volumes. For a sum of cubes, simply substitute z=-y.]]
::&lt;math&gt; E^3 + F^3 = (E + F)(E^2 - EF + F^2)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; E^3 - F^3 = (E - F)(E^2 + EF + F^2)&lt;/math&gt;
*;Difference of two fourth powers
::&lt;math&gt; E^4 - F^4 = (E^2 + F^2)(E^2 - F^2) = (E^2 + F^2)(E + F)(E - F)&lt;/math&gt;
*;Sum/difference of two {{mvar|n}}th powers
:In the following identities, the factors may often be further factorized
:*;Difference, even exponent
::&lt;math&gt;E^{2n}-F^{2n}= (E^n+F^n)(E^n-F^n)&lt;/math&gt;
:*;Difference, even or odd exponent
::&lt;math&gt; E^n - F^n  = (E-F)(E^{n-1} + E^{n-2}F + E^{n-3}F^2 + \cdots + EF^{n-2}  + F^{n-1} )&lt;/math&gt;
::This is an example showing that the factors may be much larger than the sum that is factorized.
:*;Sum, odd exponent
::&lt;math&gt; E^n + F^n  = (E+F)(E^{n-1} - E^{n-2}F + E^{n-3}F^2 - \cdots - EF^{n-2}  + F^{n-1} )&lt;/math&gt;
::(Obtained by changing {{mvar|F}} by {{math|–''F''}} in the preceding formula)
:*;Sum, even exponent
::If the exponent is a power of two then the expression cannot, in general, be factorized without introducing [[complex numbers]] (if {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|F}} contain complex numbers, this may be not the case). If has an odd divisor, that is if {{math|1=''n'' = ''pq''}} with {{mvar|p}} odd, one may use the preceding formula applied to &lt;math&gt;(E^q)^p+(F^q)^p.&lt;/math&gt;

*;Trinomials and cubic formulas
:::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy +yz+xz)\, &amp; = (x + y+ z)^2 \\
 x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \,&amp; = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz)\\
 x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3x^2(y + z) +3y^2(x+z) + 3z^2(x+y) + 6xyz \,&amp; = (x + y+z)^3 \\
 x^4 + x^2y^2 + y^4 \,&amp; = (x^2 + xy+y^2)(x^2 - xy + y^2).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

*;Binomial expansions
[[File:binomial_theorem_visualisation.svg|thumb|300px|Visualisation of binomial expansion up to the 4th power]]
:The [[binomial theorem]] supplies patterns that can easily be recognized from the integers that appear in them 
:In low degree:
::&lt;math&gt; a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 = (a+b)^3 &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3 = (a-b)^3 &lt;/math&gt;
:More generally, the coefficients of the expanded forms of &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a-b)^n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[binomial coefficient]]s, that appear in the {{math|''n''}}th row of [[Pascal's triangle]].

====Roots of unity====
The {{mvar|n}}th [[roots of unity]] are the [[complex number]]s that are a [[zero of a function]] root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^n-1.&lt;/math&gt; They are thus the numbers 
:&lt;math&gt;e^{2ik\pi/n}=\cos \frac{2\pi}n +i\sin \frac{2\pi}n&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;k=0, \ldots, n-1.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that for any two expressions {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|F}}, one has:
:&lt;math&gt;E^n-F^n= (E-F)\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(E-F e^{2ik\pi/n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E^{n}+F^{n}=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(E-F e^{(2k+1)\pi/n}\right) \qquad \text{if } n \text{ is even}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E^{n}+F^{n}=(E+F)\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(E+F e^{2ik\pi/n}\right) \qquad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|F}} are real expressions, and one want real factors, one has to replace every pair of [[complex conjugate]] factors by its product. As the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\alpha},&lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(a-be^{i\alpha}\right)\left(a-be^{-i\alpha}\right)=
a^2-ab\left(e^{i\alpha}+e^{-i\alpha}\right)+b^2e^{i\alpha}e^{-i\alpha}=
a^2-2ab\cos\,\alpha +b^2,  &lt;/math&gt;
one has the following real factorizations (one pass to one to the other by changing {{mvar|k}} into {{math|''n'' – ''k''}} or {{math|''n'' + 1 – ''k''}}, and applying usual [[trigonometric formulas]])
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}E^{2n}-F^{2n}&amp;= (E-F)(E+F)\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(E^2-2EF \cos\,\frac{k\pi}n +F^2\right)\\
&amp;=(E-F)(E+F)\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(E^2+2EF \cos\,\frac{k\pi}n +F^2\right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}E^{2n} + F^{2n} &amp;= \prod_{k=1}^n \left(E^2 + 2EF\cos\,\frac{(2k-1)\pi}{2n}+F^2\right)\\
&amp;=\prod_{k=1}^n \left(E^2 - 2EF\cos\,\frac{(2k-1)\pi}{2n}+F^2\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[cosine]]s that appear in these factorizations are [[algebraic number]]s, and may be expressed in terms of [[nth root|radicals]] (this is possible, because their [[Galois group]] is cyclic), however these radical expressions are too complicate for being used, except for low values of {{mvar|n}}. For example
:&lt;math&gt; a^4 + b^4 = (a^2 - \sqrt 2 ab + b^2)(a^2 + \sqrt 2 ab + b^2).&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a^5 - b^5 = (a - b)\left(a^2 + \frac{1-\sqrt 5}2 ab + b^2\right)\left(a^2 +\frac{1+\sqrt 5}2 ab + b^2\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a^5 + b^5 = (a + b)\left(a^2 - \frac{1-\sqrt 5}2 ab + b^2\right)\left(a^2 -\frac{1+\sqrt 5}2 ab + b^2\right),&lt;/math&gt;

Often one want a factorization with rational coefficients. Such a factorization involves [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s. For expressing rational factorizations of sums and differences or powers, we need a notation for the [[homogenization of a polynomial|homogenization]] of a polynomial: if &lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0x^n+a_ix^{n-1} +\cdots +a_n,&lt;/math&gt; its ''homogenization'' is the [[bivariate polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;\overline P(x,y)=a_0x^n+a_ix^{n-1}y +\cdots +a_ny^n.&lt;/math&gt; Then, one has
:&lt;math&gt;E^n-F^n=\prod_{k\mid n}\overline Q_n(E,F),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E^n+F^n=\prod_{k\mid 2n,k\not\mid n}\overline Q_n(E,F),&lt;/math&gt;
where the products are taken over all divisors of {{mvar|n}}, or all divisors of {{math|2''n''}} that do not divide {{mvar|n}}, and &lt;math&gt;Q_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the {{mvar|n}}th cyclotomic polynomial.

For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;a^6-b^6= \overline Q_1(a,b)\overline Q_2(a,b)\overline Q_3(a,b)\overline Q_6(a,b)=(a-b)(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)(a^2+ab+b^2),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a^6+b^6=\overline Q_4(a,b)\overline Q_{12}(a,b) = (a^2+b^2)(a^4-a^2b^2+b^2),&lt;/math&gt;
since the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and the divisors of 12 that do not divide 6 are 4 and 12.

==Polynomials==
For polynomials, factorization is strongly related with the problem of solving [[algebraic equation]]s. An algebraic equation has the form
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_n,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is a polynomial in {{mvar|x}}, such that &lt;math&gt;a_0\ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;
A solution of this equation (also called [[zero of a function|root]] of the polynomial) is a value {{mvar|r}} of {{mvar|x}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;P(r)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=Q(x)R(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is a factorization of {{mvar|P}} as a product of two polynomials, then the roots of {{mvar|P}} are the union of the roots of {{mvar|Q}} and the roots of {{mvar|R}}. Thus solving {{mvar|P}} is reduced to the simpler problems of solving {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}}.

Conversely, the [[factor theorem]] asserts that, if {{mvar|r}} is a root of {{mvar|P}}, then {{mvar|P}} may be factored as
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=(x-r)Q(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} is the quotient of [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]] of {{mvar|P}} by {{math|''x'' – ''r''}}.

If the coefficients of {{mvar|P}} are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that {{mvar|P}} has a real or complex root. Using the factor theorem recursively, it results that
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0(x-r_1)\cdots (x-r_n),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r_1, \ldots, r_n&lt;/math&gt; are the real or complex roots of {{mvar|P}}, with some of them possibly repeated. This complete factorization is unique [[up to]] the order of the factors.

If the coefficients of {{mvar|P}} are real, one want generally a factorization where factors have real coefficients. In this case, the factors of the complete factorization may have some factors that have the degree two. This factorization may easily be deduced form the above complete factorization. In fact, if {{math|1=''r'' = ''a'' + ''ib''}} is a non-real root of {{mvar|P}}, then its [[complex conjugate]] {{math|1=''s'' = ''a'' - ''ib''}} is also a root of {{mvar|P}}. So, the product 
:&lt;math&gt;(x-r)(x-s) = x^2-(r+s)x+rs =x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;
is a factor of {{mvar|P}} that has real coefficients. This grouping of non-real factors may be continued until getting eventually a factorization with real factors that are polynomials of degrees one or two.

For computing these real or complex factorizations, one has to know the roots of the polynomial. In general, they may not be computed exactly, and only approximative values of the roots may be obtained. See [[Root-finding algorithm]] for a summary of the numerous efficient [[algorithm]]s that have been designed for this purpose.

Most algebraic equations that are encountered in practice have [[integer]] or [[rational number|rational]] coefficients, and one may want a factorization with factors of the same kind. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] may be generalized to this case. That is, polynomials with integer or rational coefficients have the [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization property]]. More precisely, every polynomial with rational coefficients may be factorized in a product
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=q\,P_1(x)\cdots P_k(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|q}} is a rational number and &lt;math&gt;P_1, \ldots, P_k&lt;/math&gt; are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients that are [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] and [[primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive]]; this means that none &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; may be written as the product two polynomials (with integer coefficients) that are neither 1 nor –1 (integers are considered as polynomials of degree zero). Moreover, this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors and the multiplication by –1 of an even number of factors.

There are efficient [[algorithm]]s for computing this factorization, which are implemented in most [[computer algebra]] systems. See [[Factorization of polynomials]]. Unfortunately, for a paper-and-pencil computation, these algorithms are too complicate for being usable. Beside general heuristics that are described above, only a few methods are available in this case, which generally work only for polynomials of low degree, with few nonzero coefficients. The main such methods are described in next subsections.

===Primitive part–content factorization===
{{main|Polynomial factorization#Primitive part–content factorization}}

Every polynomial with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients, may be factorized, in a unique way, as the product of a rational number and a polynomial with integer coefficients, which is [[primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive]] (that is, the [[greatest common divisor]] of the coefficients is 1), and has a positive leading coefficient (coefficient of the term of the highest degree). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;-10x^2 + 5x + 5 = (-5)\cdot (2x^2 - x - 1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}x^5 + \frac{7}{2} x^2 + 2x + 1 = \frac{1}{6} ( 2x^5 + 21x^2 + 12x + 6)&lt;/math&gt;

In this factorization, the rational number is called the [[primitive part and content|content]], and the primitive polynomial is the [[primitive part]]. The computation of this factorization may be done as follows: firstly, reduce all coefficients to a common denominator, for getting the quotient by an integer {{mvar|q}} of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then one divides out the greater common divisor {{mvar|p}} of the coefficients of this polynomial for getting the primitive part, the content being &lt;math&gt;p/q.&lt;/math&gt; Finally, if needed, one changes the signs of {{mvar|p}} and all coefficients of the primitive part.

This factorization may produce a result that is larger than the original polynomial (typically when there are many [[coprime integers|coprime]] denominators), but, even when this is the case, the primitive part is generally easier to manipulate for further factorization.

===Using the factor theorem===
{{main|Factor theorem}}

The factor theorem states that, if {{mvar|r}} is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]]
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x+a_0&lt;/math&gt; 
(that is {{math|1=''P''(''r'') = 0}} ), then there is a factorization 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=(x-r)Q(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x)=b_0x^{n-1}+\cdots+b_{n-2}x+b_{n-1},&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;a_0=b_0,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;b_i=a_0r^i +\cdots+a_{i-1}r+a_i&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'' – 1}}.

This may be useful when, either by inspection, or by using some external information, one knows a root of the polynomial. For computing {{math|''Q''(''x'')}}, instead of using the above formula, one may also use [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].

For example, for the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^3 - 3x + 2,&lt;/math&gt; one may easily see that the sum of its coefficients is 1. Thus {{math|1=''r'' = 1}} is a root. As {{math|1=''r'' + 0 = 1}}, and &lt;math&gt;r^2 +0r-3=-2,&lt;/math&gt; one has 
:&lt;math&gt;x^3 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Rational roots===
Searching [[rational number|rational]] roots of a polynomial makes sense only for polynomials with rational coefficients. Primitive part-content factorization (see [[#Primitive part-content factorization|above]]) reduces the problem of searching rational roots to the case of polynomials with integer coefficients such that the [[greatest common divisor]] of the coefficients is one, 

If &lt;math&gt;\frac pq&lt;/math&gt; is a rational root of such a polynomial 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x+a_n,&lt;/math&gt;
the factor theorem shows that one has a factorization
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=(qx-p)Q(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where both factors have integer coefficients (the fact that {{mvar|Q}} has integer coefficients results from the above formula for the quotient of {{math|''P''(''x'')}} by &lt;math&gt;x-p/q&lt;/math&gt;).

Comparing the coefficients of degree {{mvar|n}} and the constant coefficients in the above equality shows that, if &lt;math&gt;\frac pq&lt;/math&gt; is a rational root in [[reduced fraction|reduced form]], then {{mvar|q}} is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;a_0,&lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|p}} is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;a_n.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore there is a finite number of possibilities for {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}, which can be systematically examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickson|1922|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the polynomial 
:&lt;math&gt;2x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x - 6&lt;/math&gt; 
has a rational root &lt;math&gt;p/q,&lt;/math&gt; then {{mvar|p}} must divides 6, that is &lt;math&gt;p\in\{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm3, \pm 6\}, &lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|q}} must divides 2, that is &lt;math&gt;q\in\{1, 2\}. &lt;/math&gt; Moreover, if {{math|''x'' &lt; 0}}, all terms of the polynomial are negative, and, therefore, a root cannot be negative. That is, one must have 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac pq \in \{1, 2, 3, 6, \frac 12, \frac 32\}.&lt;/math&gt;
A direct computation shows that &lt;math&gt;\frac 32&lt;/math&gt; is a root, and that there is no other rational root. Applying the factor theorem leads finally to the factorization
&lt;math&gt;2x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x - 6 = (2x -3)(x^2 -2x + 2).&lt;/math&gt;

====AC method====
For [[quadratic polynomial]]s, the above method may be adapted, leading to the so called  ''ac method'' of factorization.&lt;ref&gt;Stover, Christopher [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ACMethod.html AC Method - Mathworld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112231252/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ACMethod.html |date=2014-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Let consider the quadratic polynomial 
:&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
with integer coefficients. If it has a rational root, its denominator must divides {{math|''a''}} evenly. So, it may be written as a possibly [[irreducible fraction|reducible fraction]] &lt;math&gt;\frac ra.&lt;/math&gt; By [[Vieta's formulas]], the other root is
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac ba-\frac ra =-\frac{b+r}a = \frac sa,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;s=-(b+r).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the second root is also rational, and the second Vieta's formula gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac sa\frac ra =\frac ca,&lt;/math&gt;
that is 
:&lt;math&gt;rs=ac\quad \text{and}\quad r+s=-b.&lt;/math&gt;
Checking all pairs of integers whose product is {{math|''ac''}} gives the rational roots, if any.

For example, let consider the quadratic polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;6x^2 + 13x + 6.&lt;/math&gt;
Inspection of the factors of {{math|1=''ac'' = 36}} leads to {{math|1=4 + 9 = 13 = ''b''}}, giving the two roots 
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac 46 =-\frac 23 \quad \text{and} \quad -\frac96 = -\frac 32,&lt;/math&gt;

and the factorization 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
6x^2 + 13x + 6 &amp; = 6(x+\frac 23)(x+\frac 32)\\
&amp;= (3x+2)(2x+3).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Using formulas for polynomial roots===
Any univariate [[quadratic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; can be factored using the [[quadratic formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - \alpha)(x - \beta)  = a\left(x - \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right) \left(x - \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the two [[zero of a function|roots]] of the polynomial.

If {{math|''a, b, c''}} are all [[real number|real]], the factors are real if and only if the [[discriminant]] &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative. Otherwise, the quadratic polynomial cannot be factorized into non-constant real factors.

The quadratic formula is valid when the coefficients belong to any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different from two, and, in particular, for coefficients in a [[finite field]] with an odd number of elements.&lt;ref&gt;In a field of characteristic 2, one has 2 = 0, and the formula produces a division by zero.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also formulas for roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quartic function|quartic]] polynomials, which are, in general, too complicated for practical use. The [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] shows that there are no general root formulas in terms of radicals for polynomials of degree five or higher.

===Using relations between roots===
It may occur that one knows some relationship between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. Using this knowledge may help factoring the polynomial and finding its roots. [[Galois theory]] is based on a systematic study of the relations between roots and coefficients, that include [[Vieta's formulas]]. 

Here, we consider the simpler case where two roots &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the relation
:&lt;math&gt;x_2=Q(x_1),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Q}} is a polynomial. 

This implies that &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is a common root of &lt;math&gt;P(Q(x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(x).&lt;/math&gt; Its is therefore a root of the [[Polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] of these two polynomials. It follows that this greatest common divisor is a non constant factor of &lt;math&gt;P(x).&lt;/math&gt; [[Euclidean algorithm for polynomials]] allows computing this greatest common factor.

For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnside|Panton|1960|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; if one know or guess that:
&lt;math&gt;P(x)=x^3 -5x^2 -16x +80&lt;/math&gt; 
has two roots that sum to zero, one may apply Euclidean algorithm to &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(-x).&lt;/math&gt; The first division step consists in adding &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(-x),&lt;/math&gt; giving the remainder of 
:&lt;math&gt;-10(x^2-16).&lt;/math&gt;
Then, dividing &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x^2-16&lt;/math&gt; gives zero as a new remainder, and {{math|''x'' – 5}} as a quotient, leading to the complete factorization
:&lt;math&gt;x^3 - 5x^2 - 16x + 80 = (x -5)(x-4)(x+4).&lt;/math&gt;

==Unique factorization domains==

The integers and the polynomials over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] share the property of unique factorization, that is, every nonzero element may be factored into a product of an invertible element (a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], &amp;plusmn;1 in the case of integers) and a product of [[irreducible element]]s ([[prime number]]s, in the case of integers), and this factorization is unique up to rearranging the factors and shifting units among the factors. [[Integral domain]]s which share this property are called [[unique factorization domain]]s (UFD).

[[Greatest common divisor]]s exist in UFDs, and conversely, every integral domain in which greatest common divisors exist is an UFD. Every [[principal ideal domain]] is an UFD.

A [[Euclidean domain]] is a integral domain on which is defined a [[Euclidean division]] similar to that of integers. Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain, and thus a UFD. 

In a Euclidean domain, Euclidean division allows defining a [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing greatest common divisors. However this does not imply the existence of a factorization algorithm. There is an explicit example of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}} such that there cannot exist any factorization algorithm in the Euclidean domain {{math|''F''[''x'']}} of the univariate polynomials over {{mvar|F}}.

==Ideals==
{{Main|Dedekind domain}}
In [[algebraic number theory]], the study of [[Diophantine equation]]s led mathematicians, during 19th century, to introduce generalizations of the [[integer]]s called [[algebraic integer]]s. The first [[ring of algebraic integers]] that have been considered were [[Gaussian integer]]s and [[Eisenstein integer]]s, which share with usual integers the property of being [[principal ideal domain]]s, and have thus the [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization property]]. 

Unfortunately, it soon appeared that most rings of algebraic integers are not principal and do not have unique factorization. The simplest example is &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[\sqrt{-5}],&lt;/math&gt; in which
:&lt;math&gt;9=3\cdot 3 = (2+\sqrt{-5})(2-\sqrt{-5}),&lt;/math&gt;
and all these factors are [[irreducible element|irreducible]].

This lack of unique factorization is a major difficulty for solving Diophantine equations. For example, many wrong proofs of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (probably including [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat's]] ''"truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain"'') were based on the implicit supposition of unique factorization.

This difficulty was resolved by [[Dedekind]], who proved that the rings of algebraic integers have unique factorization of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]]: in these rings, every ideal is a product of [[prime ideal]]s, and this factorization is unique up the order of the factors. The [[integral domain]]s that have this unique factorization property are now called [[Dedekind domain]]s. They have many nice properties that make them fundamental in algebraic number theory.

==Matrices==

Matrix rings are non-commutative and have no unique factorization: there are, in general, many ways of writing a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] as a product of matrices. Thus, the factorization problem consists of finding factors of specified types. For example the [[LU decomposition]] gives a matrix as the product of a [[lower triangular matrix]] by an [[upper triangular matrix]]. As this is not always possible, one generally considers the "LUP decomposition" having a [[permutation matrix]] as its third factor.

See [[Matrix decomposition]] for the most common types of matrix factorizations.

A [[logical matrix]] represents a [[binary relation]], and [[matrix multiplication]] corresponds to [[composition of relations]]. Decomposition of a relation through factorization serves to profile the nature of the relation, such as a [[difunctional]] relation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76585">'''Foundations of geometry''' is the study of [[geometries]] as [[axiomatic system]]s. There are several sets of axioms which give rise to [[Euclidean geometry]] or to [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. These are fundamental to the study and of historical importance, but there are a great many modern geometries that are not Euclidean which can be studied from this viewpoint. The term '''axiomatic geometry''' can be applied to any geometry that is developed from an axiom system, but is often used to mean Euclidean geometry studied from this point of view. The completeness and independence of general axiomatic systems are important mathematical considerations, but there are also issues to do with the teaching of geometry which come into play.

==Axiomatic systems==
{{main article|Axiomatic system}}
Based on ancient Greek methods, an ''axiomatic system'' is a formal description of a way to establish the ''mathematical truth'' that flows from a fixed set of assumptions. Although applicable to any area of mathematics, geometry is the branch of elementary mathematics in which this method has most extensively been successfully applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several components of an axiomatic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie, Jr.|1964|loc=p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Primitive notion|Primitives]]''' (undefined terms) are the most basic ideas. Typically they include objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things like ''points'', ''lines'' and ''planes'' while a fundamental relationship is that of ''incidence''  – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1974|loc=p. 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; His point being that the primitive terms are just empty shells, place holders if you will, and have no intrinsic properties.
# '''[[Axiom]]s''' (or postulates) are statements about these primitives; for example, ''any two points are together incident with just one line'' (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are  the ''building blocks'' of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.
# The laws of '''[[logic]]'''.
# The '''[[theorem]]s'''&lt;ref&gt;In this context no distinction is made between different categories of theorems. Propositions, lemmas, corollaries, etc. are all treated the same.&lt;/ref&gt; are the logical consequences of the axioms, that is, the statements that can be obtained from the axioms by using the laws of deductive logic.

An ''interpretation'' of an axiomatic system is some particular way of giving concrete meaning to the primitives of that system. If this association of meanings makes the axioms of the system true statements, then the interpretation is called a '''model''' of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a model, all the theorems of the system are automatically true statements.

===Properties of axiomatic systems===
In discussing axiomatic systems several properties are often focused on:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pp. 105 &amp;ndash; 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The axioms of an axiomatic system are said to be [[consistency|consistent]] if no logical contradiction can be derived from them. Except in the simplest systems, consistency is a difficult property to establish in an axiomatic system. On the other hand, if a [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] exists for the axiomatic system, then any contradiction derivable in the system is also derivable in the model, and the axiomatic system is as consistent as any system in which the model belongs. This property (having a model) is referred to as ''relative consistency'' or ''model consistency''.
* An axiom is called [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] if it can not be proved or disproved from the other axioms of the axiomatic system. An axiomatic system is said to be independent if each of its axioms is independent. If a true statement is a [[logical consequence]] of an axiomatic system, then it will be a true statement in every model of that system. To prove that an axiom is independent of the remaining axioms of the system, it is sufficient to find two models of the remaining axioms, for which the axiom is a true statement in one and a false statement in the other. Independence is not always a desirable property from a pedagogical viewpoint.
* An axiomatic system is called [[completeness (logic)|complete]] if every statement expressible in the terms of the system is either provable or has a provable negation. Another way to state this is that no independent statement can be added to a complete axiomatic system which is consistent with axioms of that system. 
* An axiomatic system is [[categorical theory#History and motivation|categorical]] if any two models of the system are [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] (essentially, there is only one model for the system). A categorical system is necessarily complete, but completeness does not imply categoricity. In some situations categoricity is not a desirable property, since categorical axiomatic systems can not be generalized. For instance, the value of the axiomatic system for [[group theory]] is that it is not categorical, so proving a result in group theory means that the result is valid in all the different models for group theory and one doesn't have to reprove the result in each of the non-isomorphic models.

==Euclidean geometry==
{{main article|Euclidean geometry}}
''Euclidean geometry'' is a mathematical system attributed to the [[Alexandria]]n [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]], which he described (although non-rigorously by modern standards) in his textbook on [[geometry]]: the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing [[axiom]]s, and deducing many other [[proposition]]s ([[theorem]]s) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and [[logical system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' begins with plane geometry, still taught in [[secondary school]] as the first [[axiomatic system]] and the first examples of [[Mathematical proof|formal proof]]. It goes on to the [[solid geometry]] of [[three dimensions]]. Much of the ''Elements'' states results of what are now called [[algebra]] and [[number theory]], explained in geometrical language.&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 19"/&gt;

For over two thousand years, the adjective "Euclidean" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the [[parallel postulate]]) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other geometries which are not Euclidean are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century.

===Euclid's ''Elements''===
{{main article|Euclid's Elements}}
Euclid's ''Elements'' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[geometry|geometric]] [[treatise]] consisting of 13 books written by the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] in [[Alexandria]] c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates ([[axiom]]s), propositions ([[theorem]]s and [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructions]]), and [[mathematical proof]]s of the propositions. The thirteen books cover [[Euclidean geometry]] and the ancient Greek version of elementary [[number theory]]. With the exception of [[Autolycus of Pitane|Autolycus']] ''On the Moving Sphere'', the ''Elements'' is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=101|quote=With the exception of the ''Sphere'' of Autolycus, surviving work by Euclid are the oldest Greek mathematical treatises extant; yet of what Euclid wrote more than half has been lost,}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of [[mathematics]]. It has proven instrumental in the development of [[logic]] and modern [[science]].

Euclid's ''Elements'' has been referred to as the most successful&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece (2006) by Nigel Guy Wilson, page 278. Published by Routledge Taylor and Francis Group. Quote:"Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Romand and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer Author of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=100|quote=As teachers at the school he called a band of leading scholars, among whom was the author of the most fabulously successful mathematics textbook ever written – the ''Elements'' (''Stoichia'') of Euclid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influential&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=119|quote=The ''Elements'' of Euclid not only was the earliest major Greek mathematical work to come down to us, but also the most influential textbook of all times.

Perhaps no book other than the Bible can boast so many editions, and certainly no mathematical work has had an influence comparable with that of Euclid's ''Elements''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; textbook ever written. Being first set in type in [[Venice]] in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the [[printing press]] and was estimated by [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] to be second only to the [[Bible]] in the number of editions published,&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"/&gt; with the number reaching well over one thousand.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Roots of Elementary Mathematics by Lucas Nicolaas Hendrik Bunt, Phillip S. Jones, Jack D. Bedient (1988), page 142. Dover publications. Quote:"the ''Elements'' became known to Western Europe via the Arabs and the Moors. There the ''Elements'' became the foundation of mathematical education. More than 1000 editions of the ''Elements'' are known. In all probability it is, next to the ''Bible'', the most widely spread book in the civilization of the Western world."&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, when the [[quadrivium]] was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's ''Elements'' was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.&lt;ref&gt;From the introduction by Amit Hagar to ''Euclid and His Modern Rivals'' by Lewis Carroll (2009, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble) pg. xxviii: &lt;blockquote&gt;Geometry emerged as an indispensable part of the standard education of the English gentleman in the eighteenth century; by the Victorian period it was also becoming an important part of the education of artisans, children at Board Schools, colonial subjects and, to a rather lesser degree, women. ... The standard textbook for this purpose was none other than Euclid's ''The Elements''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elements'' are mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. It is assumed that its superiority over earlier treatments was recognized, with the consequence that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.

Books I–IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g., ''If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.'' The [[Pythagorean theorem]] is proved.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, book I, proposition 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Books V and VII–X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as [[prime numbers]] and [[rational number|rational]] and [[irrational number]]s are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.

Books XI–XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.

[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.]]

Near the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five [[postulate]]s (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|1956|loc=pp. 195 &amp;ndash; 202 (vol 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Let the following be postulated":
# "To draw a [[straight line]] from any [[Point (geometry)|point]] to any point."
# "To produce [extend] a [[Line segment|finite straight line]] continuously in a straight line."
# "To describe a [[circle]] with any centre and distance [radius]."
# "That all right angles are equal to one another."
# ''The [[parallel postulate]]'': "That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles."

Although Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also assumed to produce unique objects.

The success of the ''Elements'' is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are supposedly his. Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the ''Elements'', encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The ''Elements'' still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.

===A critique of Euclid===
The standards of mathematical rigor have changed since Euclid wrote the ''Elements''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern attitudes towards, and viewpoints of, an axiomatic system can make it appear that Euclid was in some way ''sloppy'' or ''careless'' in his approach to the subject, but this is an ahistorical illusion. It is only after the foundations were being carefully examined in response to the introduction of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] that what we now consider ''flaws'' began to emerge. Mathematician and historian [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] put these criticisms in perspective, remarking that "the fact that for two thousand years [the ''Elements''] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ball|1960|loc=p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main issues with Euclid's presentation are:
* Lack of recognition of the concept of [[primitive notion|primitive terms]], objects and notions that must be left undefined in the development of an axiomatic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie, Jr.|1964|loc=p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of superposition in some proofs without there being an axiomatic justification of this method.&lt;ref name="Faber 1983 loc=p. 109"&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=p. 109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of a concept of continuity which is needed to prove the existence of some points and lines that Euclid constructs.&lt;ref name="Faber 1983 loc=p. 109"/&gt;
* Lack of clarity on whether a straight line is infinite or boundary-less in the second postulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=p. 113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of the concept of ''betweeness'' used, among other things, for distinguishing between the inside and outside of various figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=p. 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclid's list of axioms in the ''Elements'' was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that seemed the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|1956|loc=p. 62 (vol. I)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not go astray and prove erroneous things because of this since he is actually making use of implicit assumptions whose validity appears to be justified by the diagrams which accompany his proofs. Later mathematicians have incorporated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms, thereby greatly extending that list.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1974|loc=p. 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|1956|loc=p. 242 (vol. I)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal then they are congruent; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|1956|loc=p. 249 (vol. I)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address these issues in Euclid's work, later authors have either attempted to ''fill in the holes'' in Euclid's presentation&amp;ndash;the most notable of these attempts is due to [[David Hilbert|D. Hilbert]]&amp;ndash;or to organize the axiom system around different concepts, as [[George David Birkhoff|G.D. Birkhoff]] has done.

===Pasch and Peano===
The German mathematician [[Moritz Pasch]] (1843&amp;ndash;1930) was the first to accomplish the task of putting Euclidean geometry on a firm axiomatic footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Vorlesungen über neuere Geometrie'' published in 1882, Pasch laid the foundations of the modern axiomatic method. He originated the concept of [[primitive notion]] (which he called ''Kernbegriffe'') and together with the axioms (''Kernsätzen'') he constructs a formal system which is free from any intuitive influences. According to Pasch, the only place where intuition should play a role is in deciding what the primitive notions and axioms should be. Thus, for Pasch, ''point'' is a primitive notion but ''line'' (straight line) is not, since we have good intuition about points but no one has ever seen or had experience with an infinite line. The primitive notion that Pasch uses in its place is ''line segment''.

Pasch observed that the ordering of points on a line (or equivalently containment properties of line segments) is not properly resolved by Euclid's axioms; thus, [[Pasch's theorem]], stating that if two line segment containment relations hold then a third one also holds, cannot be proven from Euclid's axioms. The related [[Pasch's axiom]] concerns the intersection properties of lines and triangles.

Pasch's work on the foundations set the standard for rigor, not only in geometry but also in the wider context of mathematics. His breakthrough ideas are now so commonplace that it is difficult to remember that they had a single originator. Pasch's work directly influenced many other mathematicians, in particular D. Hilbert and the Italian mathematician [[G. Peano|Giuseppe Peano]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932). Peano's work, largely a translation of Pasch's treatise into the notation of symbolic logic (which Peano invented), uses the primitive notions of ''point'' and ''betweeness''. Peano breaks the empirical tie in the choice of primitive notions and axioms that Pasch required. For Peano, the entire system is purely formal, divorced from any empirical input.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pieri and the Italian school of geometers===
The Italian mathematician [[Mario Pieri]] (1860&amp;ndash;1913) took a different approach and considered a system in which there were only two primitive notions, that of ''point'' and of ''motion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasch had used four primitives and Peano had reduced this to three, but both of these approaches relied on some concept of betweeness which Pieri replaced by his formulation of [[motion (geometry)|motion]]. In 1905 Pieri gave the first axiomatic treatment of [[complex number|complex]] [[projective geometry]] which did not start by building [[real number|real]] projective geometry.

Pieri was a member of a group of Italian geometers and logicians that Peano had gathered around himself in Turin. This group of assistants, junior colleagues and others were dedicated to carrying out Peano's logico&amp;ndash;geometrical program of putting the foundations of geometry on firm axiomatic footing based on Peano's logical symbolism. Besides Pieri, [[Burali-Forti]], [[Alessandro Padoa|Padoa]] and [[Gino Fano|Fano]] were in this group. In 1900 there were two international conferences held back-to-back in Paris, the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] and the Second [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. This group of Italian mathematicians was very much in evidence at these congresses, pushing their axiomatic agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri did not attend since he had recently moved to Sicily, but he did have a paper of his read at the Congress of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Padoa gave a well regarded talk and Peano, in the question period after [[David Hilbert]]'s famous address on [[Hilbert's problems|unsolved problems]], remarked that his colleagues had already solved Hilbert's second problem.

===Hilbert's axioms===
{{main article|Hilbert's axioms}}
[[File:Hilbert.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;David Hilbert&lt;/center&gt;]]
At the University of Göttingen, during the 1898&amp;ndash;1899 winter term, the eminent German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] (1862&amp;ndash;1943) presented a course of lectures on the foundations of geometry. At the request of [[Felix Klein]], Professor Hilbert was asked to write up the lecture notes for this course in time for the summer 1899 dedication ceremony of a monument to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|C.F. Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] to be held at the university. The rearranged lectures were published in June 1899 under the title ''[[Grundlagen der Geometrie]]'' (Foundations of Geometry). The influence of the book was immediate. According to {{harvtxt|Eves|1963|loc=pp. 384&amp;ndash;5}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By developing a postulate set for Euclidean geometry that does not depart too greatly in spirit from Euclid's own, and by employing a minimum of symbolism, Hilbert succeeded in convincing mathematicians to a far greater extent than had Pasch and Peano, of the purely hypothetico-deductive nature of geometry. But the influence of Hilbert's work went far beyond this, for, backed by the author's great mathematical authority, it firmly implanted the postulational method, not only in the field of geometry, but also in essentially every other branch of mathematics. The stimulus to the development of the foundations of mathematics provided by Hilbert's little book is difficult to overestimate. Lacking the strange symbolism of the works of Pasch and Peano, Hilbert's work can be read, in great part, by any intelligent student of high school geometry.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is difficult to specify the axioms used by Hilbert without referring to the publication history of the ''Grundlagen'' since Hilbert changed and modified them several times. The original monograph was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbert|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert's lifetime. New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised. The modifications in these editions occur in the appendices and in supplements. The changes in the text were large when compared to the original and a new English translation was commissioned by Open Court Publishers, who had published the Townsend translation. So, the 2nd English Edition was translated by Leo Unger from the 10th German edition in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbert|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation incorporates several revisions and enlargements of the later German editions by Paul Bernays. The differences between the two English translations are due not only to Hilbert, but also to differing choices made by the two translators. What follows will be based on the Unger translation.

Hilbert's [[axiom system]] is constructed with six [[primitive notion]]s: [[Point (geometry)|''point'']], [[Line (geometry)|''line'']], [[Plane (mathematics)|''plane'']], ''betweenness'',  ''lies on (containment)'', and ''congruence''.

All points, lines, and planes in the following axioms are distinct unless otherwise stated.

:'''I. Incidence'''

# For every two points ''A'' and ''B'' there exists a line ''a'' that contains them both. We write ''AB'' = ''a'' or ''BA'' = ''a''. Instead of “contains,” we may also employ other forms of expression; for example, we may say “''A'' lies upon ''a''”, “''A'' is a point of ''a''”, “''a'' goes through ''A'' and through ''B''”, “''a'' joins ''A'' to ''B''”, etc. If ''A'' lies upon ''a'' and at the same time upon another line ''b'', we make use also of the expression: “The lines ''a'' and ''b'' have the point ''A'' in common,” etc.
# For every two points there exists no more than one line that contains them both; consequently, if ''AB'' = ''a'' and ''AC'' = ''a'', where ''B'' ≠ ''C'', then also ''BC'' = a''.
# There exist at least two points on a line. There exist at least three points that do not lie on a line.
# For every three points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' not situated on the same line there exists a plane α that contains all of them. For every plane there exists a point which lies on it. We write ''ABC'' = ''α''. We employ also the expressions: “''A'', ''B'', ''C'', lie in α”; “A, B, C are points of α”, etc.
# For every three points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' which do not lie in the same line, there exists no more than one plane that contains them all.
# If two points ''A'', ''B'' of a line ''a'' lie in a plane α, then every point of ''a'' lies in α. In this case we say: “The line ''a'' lies in the plane α,” etc.
# If two planes α, β have a point ''A'' in common, then they have at least a second point ''B'' in common.
# There exist at least four points not lying in a plane.

:'''II. Order'''

# If a point ''B'' lies between points ''A'' and ''C'', ''B'' is also between ''C'' and ''A'', and there exists a line containing the distinct points ''A,B,C''.
# If ''A'' and ''C'' are two points of a line, then there exists at least one point ''B'' lying between ''A'' and ''C''. 
# Of any three points situated on a line, there is no more than one which lies between the other two.
# [[Pasch's Axiom]]: Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be three points not lying in the same line and let ''a'' be a line lying in the plane ''ABC'' and not passing through any of the points ''A'', ''B'', ''C''. Then, if the line ''a'' passes through a point of the segment ''AB'', it will also pass through either a point of the segment ''BC'' or a point of the segment ''AC''.

:'''III. Congruence'''

# If ''A'', ''B'' are two points on a line ''a'', and if ''A′'' is a point upon the same or another line ''a′'' , then, upon a given side of ''A′'' on the straight line ''a′'' , we can always find a point ''B′'' so that the segment ''AB'' is congruent to the segment ''A′B′'' . We indicate this relation by writing ''AB'' &amp;cong; ''A′'' ''B′''. Every segment is congruent to itself; that is, we always have ''AB'' &amp;cong; ''AB''.&lt;br&gt;We can state the above axiom briefly by saying that every segment can be ''laid off'' upon a given side of a given point of a given straight line in at least one way.
# If a segment ''AB'' is congruent to the segment ''A′B′'' and also to the segment ''A″B″'', then the segment ''A′B′'' is congruent to the segment ''A″B″''; that is, if ''AB'' &amp;cong; ''A′B′'' and ''AB'' ≅ ''A″B″'', then ''A′B′'' ≅ ''A″B″''.
# Let ''AB'' and ''BC'' be two segments of a line ''a'' which have no points in common aside from the point ''B'', and, furthermore, let ''A′B′'' and ''B′C′'' be two segments of the same or of another line ''a′'' having, likewise, no point other than ''B′'' in common. Then, if ''AB'' &amp;cong; ''A′B′'' and ''BC'' ≅ ''B′C′'', we have ''AC'' &amp;cong; ''A′C′''.
# Let an angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h'',''k'') be given in the plane α and let a line ''a′'' be given in a plane α′. Suppose also that, in the plane α′, a definite side of the straight line ''a′'' be assigned. Denote by ''h′'' a ray of the straight line ''a′'' emanating from a point ''O′'' of this line. Then in the plane α′ there is one and only one ray ''k′'' such that the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h'', ''k''), or ∠&amp;nbsp;(''k'', ''h''), is congruent to the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'') and at the same time all interior points of the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'') lie upon the given side of ''a′''. We express this relation by means of the notation ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h'', ''k'') &amp;cong; ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'').
# If the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h'', ''k'') is congruent to the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'') and to the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h″'', ''k″''), then the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'') is congruent to the angle ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h″'', ''k″''); that is to say, if ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h'', ''k'') &amp;cong; ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'') and ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h'', ''k'') &amp;cong; ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h″'', ''k″''), then ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h′'', ''k′'') &amp;cong; ∠&amp;nbsp;(''h″'', ''k″'').

:'''IV. Parallels'''

# (Euclid's Axiom):&lt;ref&gt;This is Hilbert's terminology. This statement is more familiarly known as [[Playfair's axiom]].&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''a'' be any line and ''A'' a point not on it. Then there is at most one line in the plane, determined by ''a'' and ''A'', that passes through ''A'' and does not intersect ''a''.

:'''V. Continuity'''

# [[Axiom of Archimedes]]. If ''AB'' and ''CD'' are any segments then there exists a number ''n'' such that ''n'' segments ''CD'' constructed contiguously from ''A'', along the ray from ''A'' through ''B'', will pass beyond the point ''B''.
# ''Axiom of line completeness''. An extension of a set of points on a line with its order and congruence relations that would preserve the relations existing among the original elements as well as the fundamental properties of line order and congruence that follows from Axioms I–III and from V-1 is impossible.

====Changes in Hilbert's axioms====
When the monograph of 1899 was translated into French, Hilbert added:
:: V.2 ''Axiom of completeness''. To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid.

This axiom is not needed for the development of Euclidean geometry, but is needed to establish a [[bijection]] between the [[real number]]s and the points on a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an essential ingredient in Hilbert's proof of the consistency of his axiom system.

By the 7th edition of the ''Grundlagen'', this axiom had been replaced by the axiom of line completeness given above and the old axiom V.2 became Theorem 32.

Also to be found in the 1899 monograph (and appearing in the Townsend translation) is:
:II.4. Any four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' of a line can always be labeled so that ''B'' shall lie between ''A'' and ''C'' and also between ''A'' and ''D'', and, furthermore, that ''C'' shall lie between ''A'' and ''D'' and also between ''B'' and ''D''.

However, [[E.H. Moore]] and [[R.L. Moore]] independently proved that this axiom is redundant, and the former published this result in an article appearing in the ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'' in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=E.H.|last=Moore|title=On the projective axioms of geometry|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|year=1902|volume=3|pages=142&amp;ndash;158|doi=10.2307/1986321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilbert moved the axiom to Theorem 5 and renumbered the axioms accordingly (old axiom II-5 (Pasch's axiom) now became II-4).

While not as dramatic as these changes, most of the remaining axioms were also modified in form and/or function over the course of the first seven editions.

====Consistency and Independence====
Going beyond the establishment of a satisfactory set of axioms, Hilbert also proved the consistency of his system relative to the theory of real numbers by constructing a model of his axiom system from the real numbers. He proved the independence of some of his axioms by constructing models of geometries which satisfy all except the one axiom under consideration. Thus, there are examples of geometries satisfying all except the Archimedean axiom V.1 (non-Archimedean geometries), all except the parallel axiom IV.1 (non-Euclidean geometries) and so on. Using the same technique he also showed how some important theorems depended on certain axioms and were independent of others. Some of his models were very complex and other mathematicians tried to simplify them. For instance, Hilbert's model for showing the independence of [[Desargues theorem]] from certain axioms ultimately led Ray Moulton to discover the non-Desarguesian [[Moulton plane]]. These investigations by Hilbert virtually inaugurated the modern study of abstract geometry in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 387"&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birkhoff's axioms===
{{main article|Birkhoff's axioms}}
[[File:George David Birkhoff 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;George David Birkhoff&lt;/center&gt;]]
In 1932, [[George David Birkhoff|G. D. Birkhoff]] created a set of four [[postulate]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]] sometimes referred to as ''Birkhoff's axioms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=George David|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=George David Birkhoff|title=A set of postulates for plane geometry|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=33|year=1932|pages=329&amp;ndash;345|doi=10.2307/1968336}}&lt;/ref&gt; These postulates are all based on basic [[geometry]] that can be experimentally verified with a [[Vernier scale|scale]] and [[protractor]]. In a radical departure from the synthetic approach of Hilbert, Birkhoff was the first to build the foundations of geometry on the [[real number]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=p. 400}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this powerful assumption that permits the small number of axioms in this system.

====Postulates====

Birkhoff uses four undefined terms: ''point'', ''line'', ''distance'' and ''angle''. His postulates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=pp. 400&amp;ndash;1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Postulate I: Postulate of Line Measure'''.  
The points ''A'', ''B'', ... of any line can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the [[real number]]s ''x'' so that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;| =&amp;nbsp;d(''A,&amp;nbsp;B'') for all points ''A'' and&amp;nbsp;''B''.

'''Postulate II: Point-Line Postulate'''.  
There is one and only one straight line, ''ℓ'', that contains any two given distinct points ''P'' and&amp;nbsp;''Q''.

'''Postulate III: Postulate of Angle Measure'''.  
The rays {''ℓ,&amp;nbsp;m,&amp;nbsp;n'',&amp;nbsp;...} through any point ''O'' can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers ''a''&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;2''π'') so that if ''A'' and ''B'' are points (not equal to ''O'') of ''ℓ'' and ''m'', respectively, the difference ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;2π) of the numbers associated with the lines ''ℓ'' and ''m'' is &lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;''AOB''. Furthermore, if the point ''B'' on ''m'' varies continuously in a line ''r'' not containing the vertex ''O'', the number ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; varies continuously also.

'''Postulate IV: Postulate of Similarity'''.  
If in two triangles ''ABC'' and ''A'B'C'&amp;nbsp;'' and for some constant ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, ''d''(''A',&amp;nbsp;B' '') =&amp;nbsp;''kd''(''A, B''), ''d''(''A',&amp;nbsp;C'&amp;nbsp;'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kd''(''A,&amp;nbsp;C'') and &lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;''B'A'C'&amp;nbsp;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±&lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;''BAC'', then ''d''(''B',&amp;nbsp;C'&amp;nbsp;'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kd''(''B,&amp;nbsp;C''), &lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''C'B'A'&amp;nbsp;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±&lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;''CBA'', and &lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;''A'C'B'&amp;nbsp;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±&lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;''ACB''.

===School geometry===
[[File:George Bruce Halsted.jpeg|right|thumb|George Bruce Halsted]]

Whether or not it is wise to teach Euclidean geometry from an axiomatic viewpoint at the high school level has been a matter of debate. There have been many attempts to do so and not all of them have been successful. In 1904, [[George Bruce Halsted]] published a high school geometry text based on Hilbert's axiom set.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G. B.|last=Halsted|title=Rational Geometry|year=1904|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logical criticisms of this text led to a highly revised second edition.&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 388"&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the launching of the Russian satellite [[Sputnik crisis|Sputnik]] there was a call to revise the school mathematics curriculum. From this effort there arose the [[New Math]] program of the 1960s. With this as a background, many individuals and groups set about to provide textual material for geometry classes based on an axiomatic approach.

====Mac Lane's axioms====
[[File:Saunders MacLane.jpg|left|thumb|Saunders Mac Lane]]

[[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1909&amp;ndash;2005), a mathematician,&lt;ref&gt;among his several achievements, he is the cofounder (with [[Samuel Eilenberg]]) of [[Category theory]].&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a paper in 1959 in which he proposed a set of axioms for Euclidean geometry in the spirit of Birkhoff's treatment using a distance function to associate real numbers with line segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Saunders|last=Mac Lane|title=Metric postulates for plane geometry|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=66|year=1959|pages=543&amp;ndash;555|doi=10.2307/2309851}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first attempt to base a school level treatment on Birkhoff's system, in fact, Birkhoff and Ralph Beatley had written a high school text in 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=G.D.|last1=Birkhoff|first2=R.|last2=Beatley|title=Basic Geometry|year=1940|publisher=Scott, Foresman and Company|place=Chicago}} [Reprint of 3rd edition: American Mathematical Society, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8218-2101-5}}]&lt;/ref&gt; which developed Euclidean geometry from five axioms and the ability to measure line segments and angles. However, in order to gear the treatment to a high school audience, some mathematical and logical arguments were either ignored or slurred over.&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 388"/&gt;

In Mac Lane's system there are four [[primitive notion]]s (undefined terms): ''point'', ''distance'', ''line'' and ''angle measure''. There are also 14 axioms, four giving the properties of the distance function, four describing properties of lines, four discussing angles (which are directed angles in this treatment), a similarity axiom (essentially the same as Birkhoff's) and a continuity axiom which can be used to derive the [[Crossbar theorem]] and its converse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=pp. 401&amp;ndash;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased number of axioms has the pedagogical advantage of making early proofs in the development easier to follow and the use of a familiar [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] permits a rapid advancement through basic material so that the more "interesting" aspects of the subject can be gotten to sooner.

====SMSG (School Mathematics Study Group) axioms====

In the 1960s a new set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, suitable for high school geometry courses, was introduced by the [[School Mathematics Study Group]] (SMSG), as a part of the [[New math]] curricula. This set of axioms follows the Birkhoff model of using the real numbers to gain quick entry into the geometric fundamentals. However, whereas Birkhoff tried to minimize the number of axioms used, and most authors were concerned with the independence of the axioms in their treatments, the SMSG axiom list was intentionally made large and redundant for pedagogical reasons.&lt;ref name="Venema 2006 loc=p. 55"&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMSG only produced a mimeographed text using these axioms,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG)|title=Geometry, Parts 1 and 2 (Student Text)|year=1961|publisher=Yale University Press|place=New Haven and London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Edwin E. Moise]], a member of the SMSG, wrote a high school text based on this system,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Edwin E.|last1=Moise|first2=Floyd L.|last2=Downs|title=Geometry|year=1991|publisher=Addison–Wesley|place=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a college level text, {{harvtxt|Moise|1974}}, with some of the redundancy removed and modifications made to the axioms for a more sophisticated audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=p. 403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight undefined terms: ''point'', ''line'', ''plane'', ''lie on'', ''distance'', ''angle measure'', ''area'' and ''volume''. The 22 axioms of this system are given individual names for ease of reference. Amongst these are to be found: the Ruler Postulate, the Ruler Placement Postulate, the Plane Separation Postulate, the Angle Addition Postulate, the [[Side angle side]] (SAS) Postulate, the Parallel Postulate (in [[Playfair's axiom|Playfair's form]]), and [[Cavalieri's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=pp. 403&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UCSMP (University of Chicago School Mathematics Project) axioms====
Although much of the [[New math]] curriculum has been drastically modified or abandoned, the geometry portion has remained relatively stable. Modern high school textbooks use axiom systems that are very similar to those of the SMSG. For example, the texts produced by the [[University of Chicago School Mathematics Project]] (UCSMP) use a system which, besides some updating of language, differs mainly from the SMSG system in that it includes some [[Transformation (function)|transformation]] concepts under its "Reflection Postulate".&lt;ref name="Venema 2006 loc=p. 55"/&gt;

There are only three undefined terms: ''point'', ''line'' and ''plane''. There are eight "postulates", but most of these have several parts (which are generally called ''assumptions'' in this system). Counting these parts, there are 32 axioms in this system. Amongst the postulates can be found the [[point-line-plane postulate]], the [[Triangle inequality]] postulate, postulates for distance, angle measurement, corresponding angles, area and volume, and the Reflection postulate. The reflection postulate is used as a replacement for the SAS postulate of SMSG system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venema|2006|loc=pp. 405 &amp;ndash; 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other systems===
[[Oswald Veblen]] (1880 &amp;ndash; 1960) provided a new axiom system in 1904 when he replaced the concept of "betweeness", as used by Hilbert and Pasch, with a new primitive, ''order''. This permitted several primitive terms used by Hilbert to become defined entities, reducing the number of primitive notions to two, ''point'' and ''order''.&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 387"/&gt;

Many other axiomatic systems for Euclidean geometry have been proposed over the years. A comparison of many of these can be found in a 1927 monograph by Henry George Forder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H.G.|last=Forder|title=The Foundations of Euclidean Geometry|year=1927|publisher=Cambridge University Press|place=New York}} (reprinted by Dover, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Forder also gives, by combining axioms from different systems, his own treatment based on the two primitive notions of ''point'' and ''order''. He also provides a more abstract treatment of one of Pieri's systems (from 1909) based on the primitives ''point'' and ''congruence''.&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 388"/&gt;

Starting with Peano, there has been a parallel thread of interest amongst logicians concerning the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean geometry. This can be seen, in part, in the notation used to describe the axioms. Pieri claimed that even though he wrote in the traditional language of geometry, he was always thinking in terms of the logical notation introduced by Peano, and used that formalism to see how to prove things. A typical example of this type of notation can be found in the work of [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|E. V. Huntington]] (1874 &amp;ndash; 1952) who, in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=E.V.|last=Huntington|title=A set of postulates for abstract geometry, expressed in terms of the simple relation of inclusion|journal=Mathematische Annalen|volume=73|year=1913|pages=522&amp;ndash;559|doi=10.1007/bf01455955}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced an axiomatic treatment of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry based upon the primitive notions of ''sphere'' and ''inclusion'' (one sphere lying within another).&lt;ref name="Eves 1963 loc=p. 388"/&gt; Beyond notation there is also interest in the logical structure of the theory of geometry. [[Alfred Tarski]] proved that a portion of geometry, which he called ''elementary'' geometry, is a first order logical theory (see [[Tarski's axioms]]).

Modern text treatments of the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean geometry follow the pattern of H.G. Forder and [[Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson|Gilbert de B. Robinson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G. de B.|last=Robinson|title=The Foundations of Geometry|publisher=University of Toronto Press|place=Toronto|year=1946|edition=2nd|series=Mathematical Expositions No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who mix and match axioms from different systems to produce different emphasizes. {{harvtxt|Venema|2006}} is a modern example of this approach.

==Non-Euclidean geometry==
{{main article|Non-Euclidean geometry}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of the role which mathematics plays in science and implications of scientific knowledge for all of our beliefs, revolutionary changes in man's understanding of the nature of mathematics could not but mean revolutionary changes in his understanding of science, doctrines of philosophy, religious and ethical beliefs, and, in fact, all intellectual disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Morris|last=Kline|title=Mathematics for the Nonmathematician|year=1967|publisher=Dover|place=New York|isbn=0-486-24823-2|page= 474}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the first half of the nineteenth century a revolution took place in the field of geometry that was as scientifically important as the Copernican revolution in astronomy and as philosophically profound as the Darwinian theory of evolution in its impact on the way we think. This was the consequence of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1974|loc=p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For over two thousand years, starting in the time of Euclid, the postulates which grounded geometry were considered self-evident truths about physical space. Geometers thought that they were deducing other, more obscure truths from them, without the possibility of error. This view became untenable with the development of hyperbolic geometry. There were now two incompatible systems of geometry (and more came later) that were self-consistent and compatible with the observable physical world. "From this point on, the whole discussion of the relation between geometry and physical space was carried on in quite different terms."{{harv|Moise|1974|loc=p. 388}}

To obtain a non-Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) ''must'' be replaced by its [[negation]]. Negating the [[Playfair's axiom]] form, since it is a compound statement (... there exists one and only one ...), can be done in two ways. Either there will exist more than one line through the point parallel to the given line or there will exist no lines through the point parallel to the given line. In the first case, replacing the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) with the statement "In a plane, given a point P and a line ''ℓ'' not passing through P, there exist two lines through P which do not meet ''ℓ''" and keeping all the other axioms, yields [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;while only two lines are postulated, it is easily shown that there must be an infinite number of such lines.&lt;/ref&gt; The second case is not dealt with as easily. Simply replacing the parallel postulate with the statement, "In a plane, given a point P and a line ''ℓ'' not passing through P, all the lines through P meet ''ℓ''", does not give a consistent set of axioms. This follows since parallel lines exist in absolute geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Book I Proposition 27 of Euclid's ''Elements''&lt;/ref&gt; but this statement would say that there are no parallel lines. This problem was known (in a different guise) to Khayyam, Saccheri and Lambert and was the basis for their rejecting what was known as the "obtuse angle case". In order to obtain a consistent set of axioms which includes this axiom about having no parallel lines, some of the other axioms must be tweaked. The adjustments to be made depend upon the axiom system being used. Amongst others these tweaks will have the effect of modifying Euclid's second postulate from the statement that line segments can be extended indefinitely to the statement that lines are unbounded. [[Riemann]]'s [[elliptic geometry]] emerges as the most natural geometry satisfying this axiom.

It was [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] who coined the term "non-Euclidean geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein, ''Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint: Geometry'', Dover, 1948 (reprint of English translation of 3rd Edition, 1940. First edition in German, 1908) pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to his own, unpublished work, which today we call ''hyperbolic geometry''. Several authors still consider "non-Euclidean geometry" and "hyperbolic geometry" to be synonyms. In 1871, [[Felix Klein]], by adapting a metric discussed by [[Arthur Cayley]] in 1852, was able to bring metric properties into a projective setting and was thus able to unify the treatments of hyperbolic, euclidean and elliptic geometry under the umbrella of [[projective geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Klein, Über die sogenannte nichteuklidische Geometrie, ''Mathematische Annalen'', '''4'''(1871).&lt;/ref&gt; Klein is responsible for the terms "hyperbolic" and "elliptic" (in his system he called Euclidean geometry "parabolic", a term which has not survived the test of time and is used today only in a few disciplines.) His influence has led to the common usage of the term "non-Euclidean geometry" to mean either "hyperbolic" or "elliptic" geometry.

There are some mathematicians who would extend the list of geometries that should be called "non-Euclidean" in various ways. In other disciplines, most notably [[mathematical physics]], where Klein's influence was not as strong, the term "non-Euclidean" is often taken to mean ''not'' Euclidean.

===Euclid's parallel postulate===
{{main article|Parallel postulate}}
For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. A possible reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that, unlike the first four postulates, the parallel postulate isn't self-evident. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=History of the Parallel Postulate|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=27|issue=1|pages=16–23|date=Jan 1920|author=Florence P. Lewis|doi=10.2307/2973238|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 27, No. 1|postscript=.|jstor=2973238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate from the other four, many of them being accepted as proofs for long periods of time until the mistake was found. Invariably the mistake was assuming some 'obvious' property which turned out to be equivalent to the fifth postulate. Eventually it was realized that this postulate may not be provable from the other four. According to {{harvtxt|Trudeau|1987|loc=p. 154}} this opinion about the parallel postulate (Postulate 5) does appear in print:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Apparently the first to do so was G. S. Klügel (1739&amp;ndash;1812), a doctoral student at the University of Gottingen, with the support of his teacher A. G. Kästner, in the former's 1763 dissertation ''Conatuum praecipuorum theoriam parallelarum demonstrandi recensio'' (Review of the Most Celebrated Attempts at Demonstrating the Theory of Parallels). In this work Klügel examined 28 attempts to prove Postulate 5 (including Saccheri's), found them all deficient, and offered the opinion that Postulate 5 is unprovable and is supported solely by the judgment of our senses.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The beginning of the 19th century would finally witness decisive steps in the creation of non-Euclidean geometry. Circa 1813, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and independently around 1818, the German professor of law [[Ferdinand Karl Schweikart]]&lt;ref&gt;In a letter of December 1818, Ferdinand Karl Schweikart (1780–1859) sketched a few insights into non-Euclidean geometry.  The letter was forwarded to Gauss in 1819 by Gauss's former student Gerling.  In his reply to Gerling, Gauss praised Schweikart and mentioned his own, earlier research into non-Euclidean geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; had the germinal ideas of non-Euclidean geometry worked out, but neither published any results. Then, around 1830, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[János Bolyai]] and the [[Russia]]n mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published treatises on what we today call [[hyperbolic geometry]].  Consequently, hyperbolic geometry has been  called Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, as both mathematicians, independent of each other, are the basic authors of non-Euclidean geometry. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] mentioned to Bolyai's father, when shown the younger Bolyai's work, that he had developed such a geometry several years before,&lt;ref&gt;In the letter to Wolfgang (Farkas) Bolyai of March 6, 1832 Gauss claims to have worked on the problem for thirty or thirty-five years {{harv|Faber|1983|loc=p. 162}}. In his 1824 letter to Taurinus {{harv|Faber|1983|loc=p. 158}} he claimed that he had been working on the problem for over 30 years and provided enough detail to show that he actually had worked out the details. According to {{harvtxt|Faber|1983|loc=p. 156}} it wasn't until around 1813 that Gauss had come to accept the existence of a new geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not publish. While Lobachevsky created a non-Euclidean geometry by negating the parallel postulate, Bolyai worked out a geometry where both the Euclidean and the hyperbolic geometry are possible depending on a parameter ''k''. Bolyai ends his work by mentioning that it is not possible to decide through mathematical reasoning alone if the geometry of the physical universe is Euclidean or non-Euclidean; this is a task for the physical sciences. 
The [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrami, Eugenio ''Teoria fondamentale degli spazî di curvatura costante'', Annali. di Mat., ser II 2 (1868), 232&amp;ndash;255&lt;/ref&gt;

The various attempted proofs of the parallel postulate produced a long list of theorems that are equivalent to the parallel postulate. Equivalence here means that in the presence of the other axioms of the geometry each of these theorems can be assumed to be true and the parallel postulate can be proved from this altered set of axioms. This is not the same as [[logical equivalence]].&lt;ref&gt;An appropriate example of logical equivalence is given by Playfair's axiom and Euclid I.30 (see [[Playfair's axiom#Transitivity of parallelism]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In different sets of axioms for Euclidean geometry, any of these can replace the Euclidean parallel postulate.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Hilbert uses Playfair's axiom while Birkhoff uses the theorem about similar but not congruent triangles.&lt;/ref&gt; The following partial list indicates some of these theorems that are of historical interest.&lt;ref&gt;attributions are due to {{harvnb|Trudeau|1987|loc=pp. 128&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Parallel straight lines are equidistant. (Poseidonios, 1st century B.C.)
# All the points equidistant from a given straight line, on a given side of it, constitute a straight line. (Christoph Clavius, 1574)
# [[Playfair's axiom]]. In a plane, there is at most one line that can be drawn parallel to another given one through an external point. (Proclus, 5th century, but popularized by John Playfair, late 18th century)
# The sum of the [[angle]]s in every [[triangle]] is 180° (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733; Adrien-Marie Legendre, early 19th century)
# There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180°. (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733; Adrien-Marie Legendre, early 19th century)
# There exists a pair of [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]], but not [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]], triangles. (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733)
# Every triangle can be [[circumscribe]]d. (Adrien-Marie Legendre, Farkas Bolyai, early 19th century)
# If three angles of a [[quadrilateral]] are [[right angle]]s, then the fourth angle is also a right angle. (Alexis-Claude Clairaut, 1741; Johann Heinrich Lambert, 1766)
# There exists a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles. (Geralamo Saccheri, 1733)
# [[John Wallis#Geometry|Wallis' postulate]]. On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle. (John Wallis, 1663; Lazare-Nicholas-Marguerite Carnot, 1803; Adrien-Marie Legendre, 1824)
# There is no upper limit to the [[area (geometry)|area]] of a triangle. (Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1799)
# The summit angles of the [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] are 90°. (Geralamo Saccheri, 1733)
# [[Proclus]]' axiom. If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, both of which are coplanar with the original line, then it also intersects the other. (Proclus, 5th century)

===Neutral (or Absolute) geometry===
{{main article|Absolute geometry}}
'''Absolute geometry''' is a [[geometry]] based on an [[axiom system]] consisting of all the axioms giving [[Euclidean geometry]] except for the [[parallel postulate]] or any of its alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Use a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry such as [[Hilbert's axioms]] or another modern equivalent {{harv|Faber|1983|loc=p. 131}}. Euclid's original set of axioms is ambiguous and not complete, it does not form a basis for Euclidean geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced by [[János Bolyai]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;In "''Appendix exhibiting the absolute science of space: independent of the truth or falsity of Euclid's Axiom XI (by no means previously decided)''" {{harv|Faber|1983|loc=p. 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as '''neutral geometry''',&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg cites W. Prenowitz and M. Jordan (Greenberg, p. xvi) for having used the term ''neutral geometry'' to refer to that part of Euclidean geometry that does not depend on Euclid's parallel postulate.  He says that the word ''absolute'' in ''absolute geometry'' misleadingly implies that all other geometries depend on it.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate.

====Relation to other geometries====
In [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], the first 28 propositions and Proposition I.31 avoid using the parallel postulate, and therefore are valid theorems in absolute geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trudeau|1987|loc=p. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proposition I.31 proves the existence of parallel lines (by construction). Also,  the [[Saccheri–Legendre theorem]], which states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is at most 180°, can be proved.

The theorems of absolute geometry hold in [[hyperbolic geometry]] as well as in [[Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Absolute geometry is, in fact, the intersection of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry when these are regarded as sets of propositions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute geometry is inconsistent with [[elliptic geometry]]: in elliptic geometry there are no parallel lines at all, but in absolute geometry parallel lines do exist. Also, in elliptic geometry, the sum of the angles in any triangle is greater than 180°.

====Incompleteness====
Logically, the axioms do not form a [[complete theory]] since one can add extra independent axioms without making the axiom system inconsistent.  One can extend absolute geometry by adding different axioms about parallelism and get incompatible but consistent axiom systems, giving rise to Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry.  Thus every theorem of absolute geometry is a theorem of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry.  However the converse is not true. Also, absolute geometry is ''not'' a [[categorical theory]], since it has models that are not isomorphic.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Hyperbolic geometry===
{{main article|Hyperbolic geometry}}
In the axiomatic approach to '''hyperbolic geometry''' (also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai–Lobachevskian geometry), one additional axiom is added to the axioms giving [[absolute geometry]]. The new axiom is ''Lobachevsky's parallel postulate'' (also known as the ''characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry''):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=p. 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Through a point not on a given line there exists (in the plane determined by this point and line) at least two lines which do not meet the given line.
With this addition, the axiom system is now complete.

Although the new axiom asserts only the existence of two lines, it is readily established that there are an infinite number of lines through the given point which do not meet the given line. Given this plenitude, one must be careful with terminology in this setting, as the term ''parallel line'' no longer has the unique meaning that it has in Euclidean geometry. Specifically, let ''P'' be a point not on a given line &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''PA'' be the perpendicular drawn from ''P'' to &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; (meeting at point ''A''). The lines through ''P'' fall into two classes, those that meet &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and those that don't. The characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry says that there are at least two lines of the latter type. Of the lines which don't meet &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, there will be (on each side of ''PA'') a line making the smallest angle with ''PA''. Sometimes these lines are referred to as the ''first'' lines through ''P'' which don't meet &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and are variously called ''limiting, asymptotic'' or ''parallel'' lines (when this last term is used, these are the &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; parallel lines). All other lines through ''P'' which do not meet &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are called ''non-intersecting'' or ''ultraparallel'' lines.

Since hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry are both built on the axioms of absolute geometry, they share many properties and propositions. However, the consequences of replacing the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry with the characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry can be dramatic. To mention a few of these:

[[File:Lambert quadrilateral.svg|upright|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Lambert quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry&lt;/center&gt;]]
* A [[Lambert quadrilateral]] is a quadrilateral which has three right angles. The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is [[Acute angle|acute]] if the geometry is hyperbolic, and a [[right angle]] if the geometry is Euclidean. Furthermore, [[rectangle]]s can exist (a statement equivalent to the parallel postulate) only in Euclidean geometry.
* A [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is a quadrilateral which has two sides of equal length, both perpendicular to a side called the ''base''. The other two angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are called the ''summit angles'' and they have equal measure. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, and right angles if the geometry is Euclidean.
* The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is less than 180° if the geometry is hyperbolic, and equal to 180° if the geometry is Euclidean. The [[Defect (geometry)|''defect'']] of a triangle is the numerical value (180° – sum of the measures of the angles of the triangle). This result may also be stated as: the defect of triangles in hyperbolic geometry is positive, and the defect of triangles in Euclidean geometry is zero.
* The [[area of a triangle]] in hyperbolic geometry is bounded while triangles exist with arbitrarily large areas in Euclidean geometry.
* The set of points on the same side and equally far from a given straight line themselves form a line in Euclidean geometry, but don't in hyperbolic geometry (they form a [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycle]].)

Advocates of the position that Euclidean geometry is the one and only "true" geometry received a setback when, in a memoir published in 1868, "Fundamental theory of spaces of constant curvature",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Eugenio|last=Beltrami|title=Teoria fondamentale degli spazii di curvatura costante| journal=Annali. di Mat., ser II|volume=2|year=1868|pages=232–255|doi=10.1007/BF02419615}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugenio Beltrami]] gave an abstract proof of [[equiconsistency]] of hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry for any dimension. He accomplished this by introducing several models of non-Euclidean geometry that are now known as the [[Beltrami–Klein model]], the [[Poincaré disk model]], and the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], together with transformations that relate them. For the half-plane model, Beltrami cited a note by [[Liouville]] in the treatise of [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]] on [[differential geometry]]. Beltrami also showed that ''n''-dimensional Euclidean geometry is realized on a [[horosphere]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]], so the logical relation between consistency of the Euclidean and the non-Euclidean geometries is symmetric.

===Elliptic geometry===
{{main article|Elliptic geometry}}
Another way to modify the [[Parallel postulate|Euclidean parallel postulate]] is to assume that there are no parallel lines in a plane. Unlike the situation with [[hyperbolic geometry]], where we just add one new axiom, we can not obtain a consistent system by adding this statement as a new axiom to the axioms of [[absolute geometry]]. This follows since parallel lines provably exist in absolute geometry. Other axioms must be changed.

Starting with [[Hilbert's axioms]] the necessary changes involve removing Hilbert's four axioms of order and replacing them with these seven axioms of separation concerned with a new undefined relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2007|loc=pp. 541–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an undefined ([[primitive notion|primitive]]) relation between four points, ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' denoted by (''A'',''C''|''B'',''D'') and read as "''A'' and ''C'' separate ''B'' and ''D''",&lt;ref&gt;Visualize four points on a circle which in counter-clockwise order are ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D''.&lt;/ref&gt; satisfying these axioms:
# If (''A'',''B''|''C'',''D''), then the points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are [[collinear]] and distinct.
# If (''A'',''B''|''C'',''D''), then (''C'',''D''|''A'',''B'') and (''B'',''A''|''D'',''C'').
# If (''A'',''B''|''C'',''D''), then not (''A'',''C''|''B'',''D'').
# If points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are collinear and distinct then (''A'',''B''|''C'',''D'') or (''A'',''C''|''B'',''D'') or (''A'',''D''|''B'',''C'').
# If points ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are collinear and distinct, then there exists a point ''D'' such that (''A'',''B''|''C'',''D'').
# For any five distinct collinear points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' and ''E'', if (''A'',''B''|''D'',''E''), then either  (''A'',''B''|''C'',''D'') or (''A'',''B''|''C'',''E'').
# [[Perspectivity|Perspectivities]] preserve separation.

Since the Hilbert notion of "betweeness" has been removed, terms which were defined using that concept need to be redefined.&lt;ref&gt;This reenforces the futility of attempting to "fix" Euclid's axioms to obtain this geometry. Changes need to be made in the unstated assumptions of Euclid.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a line segment ''AB'' defined as the points ''A'' and ''B'' and all the points ''between'' ''A'' and ''B'' in absolute geometry, needs to be reformulated. A line segment in this new geometry is determined by three collinear points ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' and consists of those three points and all the points not separated from ''B'' by ''A'' and ''C''. There are further consequences. Since two points do not determine a line segment uniquely, three noncollinear points do not determine a unique triangle, and the definition of triangle has to be reformulated.

Once these notions have been redefined, the other axioms of absolute geometry (incidence, congruence and continuity) all make sense and are left alone. Together with the new axiom on the nonexistence of parallel lines we have a consistent system of axioms giving a new geometry. The geometry that results is called (plane) ''Elliptic geometry''.

[[File:Saccheri quads.svg|150px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Saccheri quadrilaterals in Euclidean, Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometry&lt;/center&gt;]]

Even though elliptic geometry is not an extension of absolute geometry (as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry are), there is a certain "symmetry" in the propositions of the three geometries that reflects a deeper connection which was observed by Felix Klein. Some of the propositions which exhibit this property are:

* The fourth angle of a [[Lambert quadrilateral]] is an [[obtuse angle]] in elliptic geometry.
* The summit angles of a [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] are obtuse in elliptic geometry.
* The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is greater than 180° if the geometry is elliptic. That is, the [[Defect (geometry)|defect]] of a triangle is negative.&lt;ref&gt;Negative defect is called the ''excess'', so this may also be phrased as&amp;ndash; triangles have a positive excess in elliptic geometry.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the lines perpendicular to a given line meet at a common point in elliptic geometry, called the [[Pole and polar|''pole'']] of the line. In hyperbolic geometry these lines are mutually non-intersecting, while in Euclidean geometry they are mutually parallel.

Other results, such as the [[exterior angle theorem]], clearly emphasize the difference between elliptic and the geometries that are extensions of absolute geometry.

Absolute geometry is an extension of [[ordered geometry]], and thus, all theorems in ordered geometry hold in absolute geometry. The converse is not true. Absolute geometry assumes the first four of Euclid's Axioms (or their equivalents), to be contrasted with [[affine geometry]], which does not assume Euclid's third and fourth axioms. Ordered geometry is a common foundation of both absolute and affine geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, pgs.&amp;nbsp;175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical career==
Hjorth earned his Ph.D. in 1993, under the direction of [[W. Hugh Woodin]], with a dissertation entitled ''On the influence of second uniform indiscernible''.   He held faculty positions at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and the [[University of Melbourne]].  Among his most important contributions to [[set theory]] was the so-called theory of ''turbulence'', used in the theory of [[Borel equivalence relation]]s.

==Chess career==
Hjorth won the [[Doeberl Cup]] in Canberra in 1982, 1985 and 1987 and played for Australia in the [[Chess Olympiad]]s of 1982, 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/players/uoi0cc2f.html|title=Men's Chess Olympiads: Gregory Hjorth|publisher=OlimpBase|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best single performance was at Brighton (BCF Championship) 1984, where he scored four of seven possible points (57%) against 2551-rated opposition, for a [[Glossary of chess#Performance rating|performance rating]] of 2570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/SingleEvent.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S054335000000121100709200011810100|title=Event Details: Amsterdam (OHRA), 1984|last=Sonas|first=Jeff|publisher=ChessMetrics|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27962">'''Human body weight''' refers to a person's [[Mass versus weight|mass or weight]].  Body weight is measured in [[kilogram]]s, a measure of mass, throughout the world, although in some countries such as the United States it is measured in [[pound (mass)|pounds]], or as in the United Kingdom, [[stone (imperial mass)|stones]] and pounds. Most hospitals, even in the United States, now use kilograms for calculations, but use kilograms and pounds together for other purposes.

Strictly speaking, body weight is the measurement of weight without items located on the person. Practically though, body weight may be measured with clothes on, but without shoes or heavy accessories such as mobile phones and wallets and using manual or digital weighing scales. Excess or reduced body weight is regarded as an indicator of determining a person's health, with body volume measurement providing an extra dimension by calculating the distribution of body weight.

== Estimation in children ==
[[File:Broselowtape.JPG|thumb|An example of a half unfolded Broselow tape.]]

There are a number of methods to estimate weight in children for circumstances (such as emergencies) when actual weight cannot be measured. Most involve a [[parent]] or health care provider guessing the child's weight through weight-estimation formulas. These formulas base their findings on the child's age and tape-based systems of weight estimation. Of the many formulas that have been used for estimating body weight, some include the [[APLS]] formula, the Leffler formula, and Theron formula.&lt;ref name=Ped09/&gt; There are also several types of tape-based systems for estimating children's weight, with the most well-known being the [[Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape|Broselow tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubitz|first=Deborah|journal=Ann Emerg Med|year=1988|volume=17|issue=6|pmid=3377285|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(88)80396-2|last2=Seidel|first2=JS|last3=Chameides|first3=L|last4=Luten|first4=RC|last5=Zaritsky|first5=AL|last6=Campbell|first6=FW|title=A rapid method for estimating weight and resuscitation drug dosages from length in the pediatric age group|pages=576–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broselow tape is based on length with weight read from the appropriate color area. Newer systems, such as the PAWPER tape, make use of a simple two-step process to estimate weight: the length-based weight estimation is modified according to the child's body [[habit (biology)|habit]]us to increase the accuracy of the final weight prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Wells
|first=Mike
|journal=Sanguine

The Leffler formula is used for children 0–10&amp;nbsp;years of age.&lt;ref name=Ped09/&gt;  In those less than a year old it is

&lt;math&gt;m = \tfrac{1}{2}a_m + 4&lt;/math&gt;

and for those 1–10 years old it is

&lt;math&gt;m = 2a_y + 10&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the number of kilograms the child weighs and ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively are the number of months or years old the child is.&lt;ref name=Ped09/&gt;

The Theron formula is

&lt;math&gt;m = e^{0.175571a_y + 2.197099}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' and ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; are as above.&lt;ref name=Ped09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=So TY, Farrington E, Absher RK |title=Evaluation of the accuracy of different methods used to estimate weights in the pediatric population |journal=Pediatrics |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=e1045–51 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19482737 |doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1968 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluctuation ==
Body weight varies throughout the day, as the amount of water in the body is not constant. It changes frequently due to activities such as drinking, urinating, or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jessica|title=Stop Hating the Scale|url=http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/when-your-weight-fluctuates-whats-normal-and-whats-not|website=Shape Magazine|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talens|first1=Dick|title=What the Number on the Scale Really Means|url=http://greatist.com/health/understanding-scale-bloat-and-weight-loss|website=Greatist|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional sports participants may deliberately dehydrate themselves to enter a lower weight class, a practice known as [[weight cutting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Orion|title=Making Weight: Why Fighters Cut Weight and 3 Tips for Doing It|url=https://breakingmuscle.com/learn/making-weight-why-fighters-cut-weight-and-3-tips-for-doing-it|website=Breaking Muscle|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal body weight==
Ideal body weight (IBW) was initially introduced by Devine in 1974 to allow estimation of drug [[clearance (medicine)|clearances]] in obese patients;&lt;ref name=devine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devine|first1=Ben J|title=Gentamicin therapy|journal=Drug Intell Clin Pharm|date=1974|volume=8|issue=11|pages=650–5|doi=10.1177/106002807400801104}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; researchers have since shown that the metabolism of certain drugs relates more to IBW than total body weight.&lt;ref name="IBW"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pai|first=Manjunath P|author2=Paloucek, Frank P|title=The Origin of the "Ideal" Body Weight Equations|journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=September 2000|volume=34|pages=1066–1069|doi=10.1345/aph.19381|pmid=10981254|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was based on the use of insurance data that demonstrated the relative mortality for males and females according to different height–weight combinations.

The most common estimation of IBW is by the Devine formula; other models exist and have been noted to give similar results.&lt;ref name=IBW /&gt; Other methods used in estimating the ideal body weight are [[body mass index]] and the Hamwi method. The IBW is not the perfect fat measurement as it does not show the fat or muscle percentage in one's body. For example, athletes' results show that they are overweight when they are actually very fit and healthy. Machines like the [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA) can accurately measure the percentage and weight of (fat, muscle, bone) in a body.

===Devine formula===
The Devine formula for calculating ideal body weight in adults is as follows:&lt;ref name=IBW /&gt;

*Male ideal body weight = {{convert|50|kg}} + {{convert|0.9|kg}} × (height (cm) − 152)
*Female ideal body weight = {{convert|45.5|kg}} + {{convert|0.9|kg}} × (height (cm) − 152)

===Hamwi method===
The Hamwi method is used to calculate the ideal body weight of the general adult:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geriatric Nutrition Handbook|page=15|isbn=978-0412136412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Male ideal body weight = {{convert|48|kg}} + {{convert|1.1|kg}} × (height /cm − 152)
*Female ideal body weight = {{convert|45.4|kg}} + {{convert|0.9|kg}} × (height /cm − 152)

==Usage==
===Sports===
Participants in sports such as [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[judo]], [[Olympic weightlifting]], and [[powerlifting]] are classified according to their body weight, measured in units of mass such as pounds or kilograms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">In [[geometric group theory]] and [[dynamical systems]] the '''iterated monodromy group''' of a [[covering map]] is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] describing the [[monodromy action]] of the [[fundamental group]] on all [[iteration]]s of the covering. A single covering map between spaces is therefore used to create a tower of coverings, by placing the covering over itself repeatedly. In terms of the [[Galois theory of covering spaces]], this construction on spaces is expected to correspond to a construction on groups. The iterated monodromy group provides this construction, and it is applied to encode the combinatorics and [[symbolic dynamics]] of the covering, and provide examples of [[self-similar group]]s.

==Definition==

The '''iterated monodromy group''' of ''f'' is the following [[quotient group]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IMG}f := \frac{\pi_1 (X, t)}{\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathrm{Ker}\,\digamma^n}&lt;/math&gt;

where :

*&lt;math&gt;f:X_1\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[covering map|covering]] of a [[Connected space#Path connectedness|path-connected]] and [[Connected space#Local connectedness|locally path-connected]] topological space ''X'' by its subset &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;, 
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 (X, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fundamental group]] of ''X'' and
* &lt;math&gt;\digamma :\pi_1 (X, t)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sym}\,f^{-1}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[monodromy group|monodromy action]] for ''f''.
* &lt;math&gt;\digamma^n:\pi_1 (X, t)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sym}\,f^{-n}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the monodromy action of the &lt;math&gt;n^\mathrm{th}&lt;/math&gt; iteration of ''f'', &lt;math&gt;\forall n\in\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Action==
The iterated monodromy group acts by [[automorphisms|automorphism]] on the [[Tree (graph theory)|rooted tree]] of preimages
:&lt;math&gt;T_f := \bigsqcup_{n\ge 0}f^{-n}(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where a vertex &lt;math&gt;z\in f^{-n}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is connected by an edge with &lt;math&gt;f(z)\in f^{-(n-1)}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

===Iterated monodromy groups of rational functions===
Let :
* ''f'' be a complex [[rational function]] 
* &lt;math&gt;P_f&lt;/math&gt; be the union of [[Orbit (dynamics)|forward orbits]] of its [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] (the [[post-critical set]]).

If &lt;math&gt;P_f&lt;/math&gt; is finite (or has a finite set of [[accumulation point]]s), then the iterated monodromy group of ''f'' is the iterated monodromy group of the covering &lt;math&gt;f:\hat C\setminus f^{-1}(P_f)\rightarrow \hat C\setminus P_f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\hat C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann sphere]].

Iterated monodromy groups of rational functions usually have exotic properties from the point of view of classical group theory. Most of them are infinitely presented, many have [[intermediate growth]].

==== IMG of polynomials====

The [[Basilica group]] is the iterated monodromy group of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;z^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16688">{{distinguish|text=the [[Dirac delta function]], nor with the [[Kronecker symbol]]}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''Kronecker delta''' (named after [[Leopold Kronecker]]) is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of two [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], usually just non-negative [[integer]]s. The function is 1 if the variables are equal, and 0 otherwise:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
0 &amp;\text{if } i \neq j,   \\
1 &amp;\text{if } i=j.   \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where the Kronecker delta {{mvar|δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[piecewise]] function of variables {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}}. For example, {{math|''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, whereas {{math|''δ''&lt;sub&gt;3&amp;thinsp;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}}.

The Kronecker delta appears naturally in many areas of mathematics, physics and engineering, as a means of compactly expressing its definition above.

In  [[linear algebra]], the {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} [[identity matrix]] {{math|'''I'''}} has entries equal to the Kronecker delta:
:&lt;math&gt; I_{ij} = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; 
where {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} take the values {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, and the [[inner product]] of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{i}\delta_{ij}b_{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

The restriction to positive integers is common, but there is no reason it cannot have [[negative integer]]s as well as positive, or any discrete [[rational number]]s. If {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} above take rational values, then for example
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \delta_{(-1)(-3)}&amp;=0 &amp;\qquad \delta_{(-2)(-2)}&amp;=1 \\ \delta_{\left(\frac12\right)\left(-\frac32\right)}&amp;=0 &amp;\qquad \delta_{\left(\frac53\right)\left(\frac53\right)}&amp;=1. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This latter case is for convenience.

== Properties ==
The following equations are satisfied: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{j} \delta_{ij} a_j  &amp;= a_i,\\
\sum_{i} a_i\delta_{ij}   &amp;= a_j,\\
\sum_{k} \delta_{ik}\delta_{kj} &amp;= \delta_{ij}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the matrix {{math|'''δ'''}} can be considered as an identity matrix.

Another useful representation is the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{nm} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k = 1}^N e^{2 \pi i \frac{k}{N}(n-m)}&lt;/math&gt;
This can be derived using the formula for the [[finite geometric series]].

==Alternative notation==
Using the [[Iverson bracket]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij} = [i=j ].&lt;/math&gt;

Often, a single-argument notation {{mvar|δ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used, which is equivalent to setting {{math|''j'' {{=}} 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{i} = \begin{cases}
0, &amp; \mbox{if } i \ne 0  \\
1, &amp; \mbox{if } i=0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[linear algebra]], it can be thought of as a [[tensor]], and is written {{mvar|δ{{su|p=i|b=j}}}}. Sometimes the Kronecker delta is called the substitution tensor.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trowbridge |first=J. H. |year=1998 |title=On a Technique for Measurement of Turbulent Shear Stress in the Presence of Surface Waves |journal=[[Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=291 |doi=10.1175/1520-0426(1998)015&lt;0290:OATFMO&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital signal processing==
[[Image:unit impulse.gif|thumb|right|An impulse function]]
Similarly, in [[digital signal processing]], the same concept is represented as a sequence or discrete function on {{math|ℤ}} (the [[integer]]s):

:&lt;math&gt;\delta[n] = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; n \ne 0 \\ 1, &amp; n = 0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The function is referred to as an ''impulse'', or ''[[unit impulse]]''.  When it is the input to a [[discrete-time signal]] processing element, the output is called the [[impulse response]] of the element.

&lt;!-- Please do not "correct" sifting to shifting.  The Kronecker delta acts as a sieve; that is, it *sifts*. --&gt;
The Kronecker delta has the so-called ''sifting'' property that for {{math|''j'' ∈ ℤ}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty a_i \delta_{ij} =a_j.&lt;/math&gt;
and if the integers are viewed as a [[measure space]], endowed with the [[counting measure]], then this property coincides with the defining property of the [[Dirac delta function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x-y)f(x)\, dx=f(y),&lt;/math&gt;
and in fact Dirac's delta was named after the Kronecker delta because of this analogous property.  In signal processing it is usually the context (discrete or continuous time) that distinguishes the Kronecker and Dirac "functions".  And by convention, {{math|''δ''(''t'')}} generally indicates continuous time (Dirac), whereas arguments like {{mvar|i}}, {{mvar|j}}, {{mvar|k}}, {{mvar|l}}, {{mvar|m}}, and {{mvar|n}} are usually reserved for discrete time (Kronecker).  Another common practice is to represent discrete sequences with square brackets; thus: {{math|''δ''[''n'']}}. It is important to note that the Kronecker delta is not the result of directly sampling the Dirac delta function.

The Kronecker delta forms the multiplicative [[identity element]] of an [[incidence algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Eugene | last1=Spiegel | first2=Christopher J. | last2=O'Donnell | title=Incidence Algebras | publisher=Marcel Dekker | isbn=0-8247-0036-8 | year=1997 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | volume=206 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Dirac delta function==
In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the Kronecker delta and [[Dirac delta function]] can both be used to represent a [[discrete distribution]].  If the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of a distribution consists of points {{math|'''x''' {{=}} {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}}, with corresponding probabilities {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, then the [[probability mass function]] {{math|''p''(''x'')}} of the distribution over {{math|'''x'''}} can be written, using the Kronecker delta, as

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{x x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, the [[probability density function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} of the distribution can be written using the Dirac delta function as

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta(x-x_i).&lt;/math&gt;

Under certain conditions, the Kronecker delta can arise from sampling a Dirac delta function.  For example, if a Dirac delta impulse occurs exactly at a sampling point and is ideally lowpass-filtered (with cutoff at the critical frequency) per the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]], the resulting discrete-time signal will be a Kronecker delta function.

==Generalizations==
If it is considered as a type {{math|(1,1)}} [[tensor]], the Kronecker tensor can be written
{{math|''δ''{{su|p=''i''|b=''j''|lh=0.9em}}}} with a [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] index {{mvar|j}} and [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] index {{mvar|i}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{i}_{j} = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; (i \ne j), \\ 1 &amp; (i = j). \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This tensor represents:
* The identity mapping (or identity matrix), considered as a [[linear mapping]] {{math|''V'' → ''V''}} or {{math|''V''{{sup|∗}} → ''V''{{sup|∗}}}}
* The [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] or [[tensor contraction]], considered as a mapping {{math|''V''{{sup|∗}} ⊗ ''V'' → ''K''}}
* The map {{math|''K'' → ''V''{{sup|∗}} ⊗ ''V''}}, representing scalar multiplication as a sum of [[outer product]]s.

The '''{{visible anchor|generalized Kronecker delta}}''' or '''multi-index Kronecker delta''' of order {{math|2''p''}} is a type {{math|(''p'',''p'')}} tensor that is a completely [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its {{mvar|p}} upper indices, and also in its {{mvar|p}} lower indices.

Two definitions that differ by a factor of {{math|''p''!}} are in use. Below, the version is presented has nonzero components scaled to be {{math|±1}}. The second version has nonzero components that are {{math|±{{sfrac|1|''p''!}}}}, with consequent changes scaling factors in formulae, such as the scaling factors of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''p''!}}}} in [[#Properties of generalized Kronecker delta|''§ Properties of generalized Kronecker delta'']] below disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.physics.tamu.edu/pope/geom-group.pdf|first=Christopher|last=Pope|date=2008|title=Geometry and Group Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definitions of generalized Kronecker delta ===
In terms of the indices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Theodore|last=Frankel|title=The Geometry of Physics: An Introduction|edition=3rd|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=9781107602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=D. C.|last=Agarwal|title=Tensor Calculus and Riemannian Geometry|edition=22nd|date=2007|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|ISBN=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p }_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} = \begin{cases}
+1 &amp; \quad \text{if } \nu_1 \dots \nu_p \text{ are distinct integers and are an even permutation of } \mu_1 \dots \mu_p \\
-1 &amp; \quad \text{if } \nu_1 \dots \nu_p \text{ are distinct integers and are an odd permutation of } \mu_1 \dots \mu_p \\
\;\;0 &amp; \quad \text{in all other cases}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|S&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the [[symmetric group]] of degree {{mvar|p}}, then:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} 
= \sum_{\sigma \in \mathrm{S}_p} \sgn(\sigma)\, \delta^{\mu_1}_{\nu_{\sigma(1)}}\cdots\delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_{\sigma(p)}}
= \sum_{\sigma \in \mathrm{S}_p} \sgn(\sigma)\, \delta^{\mu_{\sigma(1)}}_{\nu_1}\cdots\delta^{\mu_{\sigma(p)}}_{\nu_p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Antisymmetric tensor#Notation|anti-symmetrization]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} 
= p! \delta^{\mu_1}_{\lbrack \nu_1} \dots \delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_p \rbrack}
= p! \delta^{\lbrack \mu_1}_{\nu_1} \dots \delta^{\mu_p \rbrack}_{\nu_p}.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of a {{math|''p'' × ''p''}} [[determinant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Lovelock |first2=Hanno |last2=Rund |title=Tensors, Differential Forms, and Variational Principles |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1989 |isbn=0-486-65840-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p }_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} =
\begin{vmatrix}
\delta^{\mu_1}_{\nu_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \delta^{\mu_1}_{\nu_p} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_p}
\end{vmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Laplace expansion]] ([[Determinant#Laplace's formula and the adjugate matrix|Laplace's formula]]) of determinant, it may be defined [[Recursion|recursively]]:&lt;ref&gt;A recursive definition requires a first case, which may be taken as {{math|1=''δ'' = 1}} for {{math|1=''p'' = 0}}, or alternatively {{math|1=''δ''{{su|p=''μ''|b=''ν''|lh=0.9em}} = ''δ''{{su|p=''μ''|b=''ν''|lh=0.9em}}}} for {{math|1=''p'' = 1}} (generalized delta in terms of standard delta).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p}
    &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^p (-1)^{p+k} \delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_k} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_{k} \dots \check\mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \check\nu_k \dots \nu_p} \\
    &amp;= \delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_p} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_{p - 1}}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_{p-1}} - \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \delta^{\mu_p}_{\nu_k} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_{k-1}\, \mu_k\, \mu_{k+1} \dots \mu_{p-1}}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_{k-1}\, \nu_p\, \nu_{k+1} \dots \nu_{p-1}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the caron, {{math|ˇ}}, indicates an index that is omitted from the sequence.

When {{math|1=''p'' = ''n''}} (the dimension of the vector space), in terms of the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_n}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_n} = \varepsilon^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_n}\varepsilon_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Properties of the generalized Kronecker delta ===
The generalized Kronecker delta may be used for [[Antisymmetric tensor#Notation|anti-symmetrization]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{p!} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} a^{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} &amp;= a^{\lbrack \mu_1 \dots \mu_p \rbrack} , \\
 \frac{1}{p!} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} a_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p} &amp;= a_{\lbrack \nu_1 \dots \nu_p \rbrack} . \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From the above equations and the properties of [[anti-symmetric tensor]]s, we can derive the properties of the generalized Kronecker delta:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{p!} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} a^{\lbrack \nu_1 \dots \nu_p \rbrack} &amp;= a^{\lbrack \mu_1 \dots \mu_p \rbrack} , \\
 \frac{1}{p!} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} a_{\lbrack \mu_1 \dots \mu_p \rbrack} &amp;= a_{\lbrack \nu_1 \dots \nu_p \rbrack} , \\
 \frac{1}{p!} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p} \delta^{\nu_1 \dots \nu_p}_{\rho_1 \dots \rho_p} &amp;= \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\rho_1 \dots \rho_p} ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which are the generalized version of formulae written in ''{{section link||Properties}}''. The last formula is equivalent to the [[Cauchy–Binet formula]].

Reducing the order via summation of the indices may be expressed by the identity&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first=Sadri |last=Hassani |title=Mathematical Methods: For Students of Physics and Related Fields |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-387-09503-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_s \, \mu_{s+1} \dots \mu_p}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_s \, \mu_{s+1} \dots \mu_p} = \frac{(n-s)!}{(n-p)!} \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_s}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_s}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using both the summation rule for the case {{math|1=''p'' = ''n''}} and the relation with the Levi-Civita symbol,
[[Levi-Civita symbol#n dimensions|the summation rule of the Levi-Civita symbol]] is derived:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_s}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_s} = \frac{1}{(n-s)!}\varepsilon^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_s \, \rho_{s+1} \dots \rho_n}\varepsilon_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_s \, \rho_{s+1} \dots \rho_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Integral representations==
For any integer {{mvar|n}}, using a standard [[Residue (complex analysis)|residue]] calculation we can write an integral representation for the Kronecker delta as the integral below, where the contour of the integral goes counterclockwise around zero. This representation is also equivalent to a definite integral by a rotation in the complex plane.

:&lt;math&gt;  \delta_{x,n} = \frac1{2\pi i} \oint_{|z|=1} z^{x-n-1} \,dz=\frac1{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{i(x-n)\varphi} \,d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

==The Kronecker comb==
The Kronecker comb function with period {{mvar|N}} is defined (using [[digital signal processing|DSP]] notation) as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_N[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \delta[n-kN],&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} and {{mvar|n}} are integers. The Kronecker comb thus consists of an infinite series of unit impulses {{mvar|N}} units apart, and includes the unit impulse at zero. It may be considered to be the discrete analog of the [[Dirac comb]].

==Kronecker integral==

The Kronecker delta is also called degree of mapping of one surface into another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Advanced Calculus |first=Wilfred |last=Kaplan |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2003 |isbn=0-201-79937-5 |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wywnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose a mapping takes place from surface {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;}} that are boundaries of regions, {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;}} which is simply connected with one-to-one correspondence. In this framework, if {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} are parameters for {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}} are each oriented by the outer normal {{math|'''n'''}}:

:&lt;math&gt; u=u(s,t), \quad v=v(s,t), \quad w=w(s,t), &lt;/math&gt;

while the normal has the direction of

:&lt;math&gt;(u_{s} \mathbf{i} +v_{s} \mathbf{j} + w_{s} \mathbf{k}) \times (u_{t}\mathbf{i} +v_{t}\mathbf{j} +w_{t}\mathbf{k}).&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''(''u'',''v'',''w'')}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''y''(''u'',''v'',''w'')}}, {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''z''(''u'',''v'',''w'')}} be defined and smooth in a domain containing {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and let these equations define the mapping of {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}} onto {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then the degree {{mvar|δ}} of mapping is {{math|{{sfrac|1|4π}}}} times the solid angle of the image {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;uvw&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to the interior point of {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''O''}}. If {{math|''O''}} is the origin of the region, {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the degree, {{mvar|δ}} is given by the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\frac{1}{4\pi}\iint_{R_{st}}\left(x^2+y^2+z^2\right)^{-\frac32}
\begin{vmatrix} x &amp; y &amp; z \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial s} &amp; \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} &amp; \frac{\partial z}{\partial s} \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &amp; \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &amp; \frac{\partial z}{\partial t}
\end{vmatrix} \, ds \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5980">In [[differential geometry]] there are a number of second-order, linear, [[elliptic operator|elliptic]] [[differential operators]] bearing the name '''[[Laplace operator|Laplacian]]'''.  This article provides an overview of some of them.

== Connection Laplacian ==
The '''connection Laplacian''', also known as the '''rough Laplacian''', is a differential operator acting on the various tensor bundles of a manifold, defined in terms of a [[Riemannian metric|Riemannian]]- or [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] metric.  When applied to functions (i.e. tensors of rank 0), the connection
Laplacian is often called the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]].  It is defined as the trace of the [[second covariant derivative]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T= \text{tr}\;\nabla^2 T,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is any tensor, &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] associated to the metric, and the trace is taken with respect to
the metric.  Recall that the second covariant derivative of ''T'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_{X,Y} T = \nabla_X \nabla_Y T - \nabla_{\nabla_X Y} T.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that with this definition, the connection Laplacian has negative [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]].  On functions, it agrees with
the operator given as the divergence of the gradient.

If the connection of interest is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] one can find a convenient formula for the Laplacian of a scalar function in terms of partial derivatives with respect to a coordinate system:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi = |g|^{-1/2} \partial_\mu\left( |g|^{1/2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu\right)\phi &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar function, &lt;math&gt;|g|&lt;/math&gt; is absolute value of the determinant of the metric (absolute value is necessary in the [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian case]], e.g. in [[General Relativity]]) and &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Metric tensor#Inverse metric|inverse of the metric tensor]].

== Hodge Laplacian ==
The '''Hodge Laplacian''', also known as the '''Laplace–de Rham operator''', is a differential operator acting on [[differential forms]].  (Abstractly,
it is a second order operator on each exterior power of the [[cotangent bundle]].)  This operator is defined on any manifold equipped with
a [[Riemannian metric|Riemannian]]- or [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] metric.

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta= \mathrm{d}\delta+\delta\mathrm{d} = (\mathrm{d}+\delta)^2,\;&lt;/math&gt;

where d is the [[exterior derivative]] or differential and δ is the [[codifferential]].  The Hodge Laplacian on a compact manifold has nonnegative [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]].

The connection Laplacian may also be taken to act on differential forms by restricting it to act on skew-symmetric tensors.  The connection Laplacian differs from the Hodge Laplacian by means of a [[Weitzenböck identity]].

== Bochner Laplacian ==
The '''Bochner Laplacian''' is defined differently from the connection Laplacian, but the two will turn out to differ only by a sign, whenever the former is defined.  Let ''M'' be a compact, oriented manifold equipped with a metric.  Let ''E'' be a vector bundle over ''M'' equipped with a fiber metric and a compatible connection, &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.  This connection gives rise to a differential operator
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow \Gamma(T^*M\otimes E)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(E)&lt;/math&gt; denotes smooth sections of ''E'', and ''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;M is the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M''.  It is possible to take the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-adjoint of &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;, giving a differential operator
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla^*:\Gamma(T^*M\otimes E)\rightarrow \Gamma(E).&lt;/math&gt;
The '''Bochner Laplacian''' is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\nabla^*\nabla&lt;/math&gt;
which is a second order operator acting on sections of the vector bundle ''E''.  Note that the connection Laplacian and Bochner Laplacian differ only by a sign:
::&lt;math&gt; \nabla^* \nabla =  - \text{tr}\, \nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Lichnerowicz Laplacian ==
The '''Lichnerowicz Laplacian'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Chow | first1=Bennett | last2=Lu | first2=Peng | last3=Ni | first3=Lei | title=Hamilton's Ricci flow | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-4231-7 | id={{ISBN|978-0-8218-4231-7}} |mr=2274812 | year=2006 | volume=77}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is defined on symmetric tensors by taking &lt;math&gt;\nabla : \Gamma(\operatorname{Sym}^k(TM))\to \Gamma(\operatorname{Sym}^{k+1}(TM))&lt;/math&gt; to be the symmetrized covariant derivative.  The Lichnerowicz Laplacian is then defined by &lt;math&gt;\Delta_L = \nabla^*\nabla&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nabla^*&lt;/math&gt; is the formal adjoint.  The Lichnerowicz Laplacian differs from the usual tensor Laplacian by a [[Weitzenbock formula]] involving the [[Riemann curvature tensor]], and has natural applications in the study of [[Ricci flow]] and the [[prescribed Ricci curvature problem]].

== Conformal Laplacian ==
On a [[Riemannian manifold]], one can define the '''conformal Laplacian''' as an operator on smooth functions; it differs from the Laplace–Beltrami operator by a term involving the [[scalar curvature]] of the underlying metric.  In dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3, the conformal Laplacian, denoted ''L'', acts on a smooth function ''u'' by

:&lt;math&gt;Lu = -4\frac{n-1}{n-2} \Delta u + Ru,&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator (of negative spectrum), and ''R'' is the scalar curvature.  This operator often makes an appearance when studying how the scalar curvature behaves under a conformal change of a Riemannian metric.  If ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3 and ''g'' is a metric and ''u'' is a smooth, positive function, then the [[Conformal map|conformal]] metric

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde g = u^{4/(n-2)} g \, &lt;/math&gt;

has scalar curvature given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde R = u^{-(n+2)/(n-2)} L u. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline of [[graph theory]], the '''line graph''' of an [[undirected graph]] ''G'' is another graph ''L''(''G'') that represents the adjacencies between [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] of ''G''. The name line graph comes from a paper by {{harvtxt|Harary|Norman|1960}} although both {{harvtxt|Whitney|1932}} and {{harvtxt|Krausz|1943}} used the construction before this.{{sfnp|Hemminger|Beineke|1978|p=273}} Other terms used for the line graph include the '''covering graph''', the '''derivative''', the '''edge-to-vertex dual''', the '''conjugate''', the '''representative graph''', and the '''ϑ-obrazom''',{{sfnp|Hemminger|Beineke|1978|p=273}} as well as the '''edge graph''', the '''interchange graph''', the '''adjoint graph''', and the '''derived graph'''.&lt;ref name="h72-71"&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvs|authorlink=Hassler Whitney|first=Hassler|last=Whitney|year=1932|txt}} proved that with one exceptional case the structure of a [[connected graph]] ''G'' can be recovered completely from its line graph.&lt;ref name="whitney"/&gt; Many other properties of line graphs follow by translating the properties of the underlying graph from vertices into edges, and by Whitney's theorem the same translation can also be done in the other direction. Line graphs are [[claw-free graph|claw-free]], and the line graphs of [[bipartite graph]]s are [[perfect graph|perfect]]. Line graphs are characterized by nine [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden subgraphs]] and can be recognized in [[linear time]].

Various extensions of the concept of a line graph have been studied, including line graphs of line graphs, line graphs of multigraphs, line graphs of hypergraphs, and line graphs of weighted graphs.

==Formal definition==
Given a graph ''G'', its line graph ''L''(''G'') is a graph such that
* each [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] of ''L''(''G'') represents an edge of ''G''; and
* two vertices of ''L''(''G'') are [[Adjacent (graph theory)|adjacent]] if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint ("are incident") in ''G''.
That is, it is the [[intersection graph]] of the edges of ''G'', representing each edge by the set of its two endpoints.&lt;ref name="h72-71"/&gt;

== Example ==

The following figures show a graph (left, with blue vertices) and its line graph (right, with green vertices). Each vertex of the line graph is shown labeled with the pair of endpoints of the corresponding edge in the original graph. For instance, the green vertex on the right labeled 1,3 corresponds to the edge on the left between the blue vertices 1 and 3. Green vertex 1,3 is adjacent to three other green vertices: 1,4 and 1,2 (corresponding to edges sharing the endpoint 1 in the blue graph) and 4,3 (corresponding to an edge sharing the endpoint 3 in the blue graph).

===Translated properties of the underlying graph===
Properties of a graph ''G'' that depend only on adjacency between edges may be translated into equivalent properties in ''L''(''G'') that depend on adjacency between vertices. For instance, a [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]] in ''G'' is a set of edges no two of which are adjacent, and corresponds to a set of vertices in ''L''(''G'') no two of which are adjacent, that is, an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]].&lt;ref name="paschos"&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorial Optimization and Theoretical Computer Science: Interfaces and Perspectives|first=Vangelis Th.|last=Paschos|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9780470393673|page=394|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOMH9fPOicgC&amp;pg=PA394|quotation=Clearly, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the matchings of a graph and the independent sets of its line graph.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus,
* The line graph of a [[connected graph]] is connected. If ''G'' is connected, it contains a [[path (graph theory)|path]] connecting any two of its edges, which translates into a path in ''L''(''G'') containing any two of the vertices of ''L''(''G''). However, a graph ''G'' that has some isolated vertices, and is therefore disconnected, may nevertheless have a connected line graph.&lt;ref&gt;The need to consider isolated vertices when considering the connectivity of line graphs is pointed out by {{harvtxt|Cvetković|Rowlinson|Simić|2004}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FA8SObZcbs4C&amp;pg=PA32 p.&amp;nbsp;32].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A line graph has an [[articulation point]] if and only if the underlying graph has a [[bridge (graph theory)|bridge]] for which neither endpoint has degree one.&lt;ref name="h72-71"/&gt;
* For a graph ''G'' with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges, the number of vertices of the line graph ''L''(''G'') is ''m'', and the number of edges of ''L''(''G'') is half the sum of the squares of the [[degree (graph theory)|degrees]] of the vertices in ''G'', minus ''m''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, Theorem 8.1, p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[maximum independent set problem|maximum independent set]] in a line graph corresponds to [[maximum matching]] in the original graph. Since maximum matchings may be found in polynomial time, so may the maximum independent sets of line graphs, despite the hardness of the maximum independent set problem for more general families of graphs.&lt;ref name="paschos"/&gt;
* The [[edge chromatic number]] of a graph ''G'' is equal to the [[vertex chromatic number]] of its line graph ''L''(''G'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Graph Theory|volume=173|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=Reinhard|last=Diestel|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9783540261834|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aR2TMYQr2CMC&amp;pg=PA112}}. Also in [http://diestel-graph-theory.com/basic.html free online edition], Chapter 5 ("Colouring"), p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The line graph of an [[edge-transitive graph]] is [[vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]]. This property can be used to generate families of graphs that (like the [[Petersen graph]]) are vertex-transitive but are not [[Cayley graph]]s: if ''G'' is an edge-transitive graph that has at least five vertices, is not bipartite, and has odd vertex degrees, then ''L''(''G'') is a vertex-transitive non-Cayley graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* If a graph ''G'' has an [[Euler cycle]], that is, if ''G'' is connected and has an even number of edges at each vertex, then the line graph of ''G'' is [[Hamiltonian graph|Hamiltonian]]. However, not all Hamiltonian cycles in line graphs come from Euler cycles in this way; for instance, the line graph of a Hamiltonian graph ''G'' is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether ''G'' is also Eulerian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, Theorem 8.8, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If two simple graphs are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] then their line graphs are also isomorphic. The [[Graph isomorphism#Whitney theorem|Whitney graph isomorphism theorem]] provides a converse to this for all but one pair of graphs.
* In the context of complex network theory, the line graph of a random network preserves many of the properties of the network such as the [[Small-world network|small-world property]] (the existence of short paths between all pairs of vertices) and the shape of its [[degree distribution]].{{sfnp|Ramezanpour|Karimipour|Mashaghi|2003}} {{harvtxt|Evans|Lambiotte|2009}} observe that any method for finding vertex clusters in a complex network can be applied to the line graph and used to cluster its edges instead.

===Whitney isomorphism theorem===
[[File:Diamond graph.svg|thumb|120px|The [[diamond graph]], an exception to the strong Whitney theorem]]
If the line graphs of two [[connected graph]]s are isomorphic, then the underlying graphs are isomorphic, except in the case of the triangle graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[Claw (graph theory)|claw]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;, which have isomorphic line graphs but are not themselves isomorphic.&lt;ref name="whitney"&gt;{{harvtxt|Whitney|1932}}; {{harvtxt|Krausz|1943}}; {{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, Theorem 8.3, p.&amp;nbsp;72. Harary gives a simplified proof of this theorem by {{harvtxt|Jung|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;, there are some other exceptional small graphs with the property that their line graph has a higher degree of symmetry than the graph itself. For instance, the [[diamond graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; (two triangles sharing an edge) has four [[graph automorphism]]s but its line graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,2&lt;/sub&gt; has eight. In the illustration of the diamond graph shown, rotating the graph by 90 degrees is not a symmetry of the graph, but is a symmetry of its line graph. However, all such exceptional cases have at most four vertices. A strengthened version of the Whitney isomorphism theorem states that, for connected graphs with more than four vertices, there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of the graphs and isomorphisms of their line graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jung|1966}}; {{harvtxt|Degiorgi|Simon|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogues of the Whitney isomorphism theorem have been proven for the line graphs of [[multigraph]]s, but are more complicated in this case.&lt;ref name="z97"/&gt;

===Strongly regular and perfect line graphs===
[[File:Line perfect graph.svg|thumb|240px|A line perfect graph. The edges in each biconnected component are colored black if the component is bipartite, blue if the component is a tetrahedron, and red if the component is a book of triangles.]]
The line graph of the complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also known as the '''triangular graph''', the [[Johnson graph]] ''J''(''n'',2), or the [[complement (graph theory)|complement]] of the [[Kneser graph]] ''KG''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Triangular graphs are characterized by their [[Spectral graph theory|spectra]], except for ''n'' = 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The line graph of a [[bipartite graph]] is [[Perfect graph|perfect]] (see [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)|Kőnig's theorem]]), but need not be bipartite as the example of the claw graph shows. The line graphs of bipartite graphs form one of the key building blocks of perfect graphs, used in the proof of the [[strong perfect graph theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Like the line graphs of complete graphs, they can be characterized with one exception by their numbers of vertices, numbers of edges, and number of shared neighbors for adjacent and non-adjacent points. The one exceptional case is ''L''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt;), which shares its parameters with the [[Shrikhande graph]]. When both sides of the bipartition have the same number of vertices, these graphs are again strongly regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, Theorem 8.7, p.&amp;nbsp;79. Harary credits this characterization of line graphs of complete bipartite graphs to Moon and Hoffman. The case of equal numbers of vertices on both sides had previously been proven by Shrikhande.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a graph ''G'' is said to be a [[line perfect graph]] if ''L''(''G'') is a [[perfect graph]]. The line perfect graphs are exactly the graphs that do not contain a [[cycle (graph theory)|simple cycle]] of odd length greater than three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Trotter|1977}}; {{harvtxt|de Werra|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, a graph is line perfect if and only if each of its [[biconnected component]]s is either bipartite or of the form ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (the tetrahedron) or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (a book of one or more triangles all sharing a common edge).{{sfnp|Maffray|1992}} Every line perfect graph is itself perfect.{{sfnp|Trotter|1977}}

===Other related graph families===
All line graphs are [[claw-free graph]]s, graphs without an [[induced subgraph]] in the form of a three-leaf tree.&lt;ref name="h72-8.4"/&gt; As with claw-free graphs more generally, every connected line graph ''L''(''G'') with an even number of edges has a [[perfect matching]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

All [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[adjacency matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a line graph are at least &amp;minus;2. The reason for this is that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;A=J^TJ-2I&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the signless incidence matrix of the pre-line graph and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the identity. In particular, &lt;math&gt;A+2I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gramian matrix]] of a system of vectors: all graphs with this property have been called generalized line graphs.{{sfnp|Cvetković|Rowlinson|Simić|2004}}

== Characterization and recognition ==

===Clique partition===
[[File:Line graph clique partition.svg|thumb|280px|Partition of a line graph into cliques]]
For an arbitrary graph ''G'', and an arbitrary vertex ''v'' in ''G'', the set of edges incident to ''v'' corresponds to a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] in the line graph ''L''(''G''). The cliques formed in this way partition the edges of ''L''(''G''). Each vertex of ''L''(''G'') belongs to exactly two of them (the two cliques corresponding to the two endpoints of the corresponding edge in ''G'').

The existence of such a partition into cliques can be used to characterize the line graphs:
A graph ''L'' is the line graph of some other graph or multigraph if and only if it is possible to find a collection of cliques in ''L'' (allowing some of the cliques to be single vertices) that partition the edges of ''L'', such that each vertex of ''L'' belongs to exactly two of the cliques.&lt;ref name="h72-8.4"&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, Theorem 8.4, p.&amp;nbsp;74, gives three equivalent characterizations of line graphs: the partition of the edges into cliques, the property of being [[claw-free]] and odd [[Diamond graph|diamond]]-free, and the nine forbidden graphs of Beineke.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the line graph of a graph (rather than a multigraph) if this set of cliques satisfies the additional condition that no two vertices of ''L'' are both in the same two cliques. Given such a family of cliques, the underlying graph ''G'' for which ''L'' is the line graph can be recovered by making one vertex in ''G'' for each clique, and an edge in ''G'' for each vertex in ''L'' with its endpoints being the two cliques containing the vertex in ''L''. By the strong version of Whitney's isomorphism theorem, if the underlying graph ''G'' has more than four vertices, there can be only one partition of this type.

For example, this characterization can be used to show that the following graph is not a line graph:
:[[File:LineGraphExampleA.svg|100px]]
In this example, the edges going upward, to the left, and to the right from the central degree-four vertex do not have any cliques in common. Therefore, any partition of the graph's edges into cliques would have to have at least one clique for each of these three edges, and these three cliques would all intersect in that central vertex, violating the requirement that each vertex appear in exactly two cliques. Thus, the graph shown is not a line graph.

===Forbidden subgraphs===
[[File:Forbidden line subgraphs.svg|thumb|300px|The nine minimal non-line graphs, from Beineke's forbidden-subgraph characterization of line graphs. A graph is a line graph if and only if it does not contain one of these nine graphs as an induced subgraph.]]
Another characterization of line graphs was proven in {{harvtxt|Beineke|1970}} (and reported earlier without proof by {{harvtxt|Beineke|1968}}). He showed that there are nine minimal graphs that are not line graphs, such that any graph that is not a line graph has one of these nine graphs as an [[induced subgraph]]. That is, a graph is a line graph if and only if no subset of its vertices induces one of these nine graphs. In the example above, the four topmost vertices induce a claw (that is, a [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;), shown on the top left of the illustration of forbidden subgraphs. Therefore, by Beineke's characterization, this example cannot be a line graph. For graphs with minimum degree at least 5, only the six subgraphs in the left and right columns of the figure are needed in the characterization.&lt;ref name="mt97"&gt;{{harvtxt|Metelsky|Tyshkevich|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algorithms===
{{harvtxt|Roussopoulos|1973}} and {{harvtxt|Lehot|1974}} described linear time algorithms for recognizing line graphs and reconstructing their original graphs. {{harvtxt|Sysło|1982}} generalized these methods to [[directed graph]]s. {{harvtxt|Degiorgi|Simon|1995}} described an efficient data structure for maintaining a dynamic graph, subject to vertex insertions and deletions, and maintaining a representation of the input as a line graph (when it exists) in time proportional to the number of changed edges at each step.

The algorithms of {{harvtxt|Roussopoulos|1973}} and {{harvtxt|Lehot|1974}} are based on characterizations of line graphs involving odd triangles (triangles in the line graph with the property that there exists another vertex adjacent to an odd number of triangle vertices). However, the algorithm of {{harvtxt|Degiorgi|Simon|1995}} uses only Whitney's isomorphism theorem.  It is complicated by the need to recognize deletions that cause the remaining graph to become a line graph, but when specialized to the static recognition problem only insertions need to be performed, and the algorithm performs the following steps:
*Construct the input graph ''L'' by adding vertices one at a time, at each step choosing a vertex to add that is adjacent to at least one previously-added vertex. While adding vertices to ''L'', maintain a graph ''G'' for which ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''(''G''); if the algorithm ever fails to find an appropriate graph ''G'', then the input is not a line graph and the algorithm terminates.
*When adding a vertex ''v'' to a graph ''L''(''G'') for which ''G'' has four or fewer vertices, it might be the case that  the line graph representation is not unique. But in this case, the augmented graph is small enough that a representation of it as a line graph can be found by a [[brute force search]] in constant time.
*When adding a vertex ''v'' to a larger graph ''L'' that equals the line graph of another graph ''G'', let ''S'' be the subgraph of ''G'' formed by the edges that correspond to the neighbors of ''v'' in ''L''. Check that ''S'' has a [[vertex cover]] consisting of one vertex or two non-adjacent vertices. If there are two vertices in the cover, augment ''G'' by adding an edge (corresponding to ''v'') that connects these two vertices. If there is only one vertex in the cover, then add a new vertex to ''G'', adjacent to this vertex.
Each step either takes constant time, or involves finding a vertex cover of constant size within a graph ''S'' whose size is proportional to the number of neighbors of&amp;nbsp;''v''. Thus, the total time for the whole algorithm is proportional to the sum of the numbers of neighbors of all vertices, which (by the [[handshaking lemma]]) is proportional to the number of input edges.

==Iterating the line graph operator==
{{harvtxt|van Rooij|Wilf|1965}} consider the sequence of graphs
:&lt;math&gt;G, L(G), L(L(G)), L(L(L(G))), \dots.\ &lt;/math&gt;
They show that, when ''G'' is a finite [[connected graph]], only four behaviors are possible for this sequence:
*If ''G'' is a [[cycle graph]] then ''L''(''G'') and each subsequent graph in this sequence are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'' itself.  These are the only connected graphs for which ''L''(''G'') is isomorphic to ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;This result is also Theorem 8.2 of {{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If ''G'' is a claw ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''L''(''G'') and all subsequent graphs in the sequence are triangles.
*If ''G'' is a [[path graph]] then each subsequent graph in the sequence is a shorter path until eventually the sequence terminates with an [[empty graph]].
*In all remaining cases, the sizes of the graphs in this sequence eventually increase without bound.
If ''G'' is not connected, this classification applies separately to each component of ''G''.

For connected graphs that are not paths, all sufficiently high numbers of iteration of the line graph operation produce graphs that are Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, Theorem 8.11, p.&amp;nbsp;81. Harary credits this result to [[Gary Chartrand]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==

=== Medial graphs and convex polyhedra ===
{{main article|Medial graph}}
When a [[planar graph]] ''G'' has maximum [[degree (graph theory)|vertex degree]] three, its line graph is planar, and every planar embedding of ''G'' can be extended to an embedding of ''L''(''G''). However, there exist planar graphs with higher degree whose line graphs are nonplanar. These include, for example, the 5-star ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,5&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[gem graph]] formed by adding two non-crossing diagonals within a regular pentagon, and all [[convex polyhedron|convex polyhedra]] with a vertex of degree four or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sedláček|1964}}; {{harvtxt|Greenwell|Hemminger|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative construction, the [[medial graph]], coincides with the line graph for planar graphs with maximum degree three, but is always planar. It has the same vertices as the line graph, but potentially fewer edges: two vertices of the medial graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding two edges are consecutive on some face of the planar embedding. The medial graph of the [[dual graph]] of a plane graph is the same as the medial graph of the original plane graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Total graphs===
The total graph ''T''(''G'') of a graph ''G'' has as its vertices the elements (vertices or edges) of ''G'', and has an edge between two elements whenever they are either incident or adjacent. The total graph may also be obtained by subdividing each edge of ''G'' and then taking the [[Graph power|square]] of the subdivided graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1972}}, p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multigraphs===
The concept of the line graph of ''G'' may naturally be extended to the case where ''G'' is a multigraph. In this case, the characterizations of these graphs can be simplified: the characterization in terms of clique partitions no longer needs to prevent two vertices from belonging to the same to cliques, and the characterization by forbidden graphs has seven forbidden graphs instead of nine.{{sfnp|Ryjáček|Vrána|2011}}

However, for multigraphs, there are larger numbers of pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that have the same line graphs. For instance a complete bipartite graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has the same line graph as the [[dipole graph]] and [[Shannon multigraph]] with the same number of edges. Nevertheless, analogues to Whitney's isomorphism theorem can still be derived in this case.&lt;ref name="z97"&gt;{{harvtxt|Zverovich|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Line digraphs{{anchor|Line digraph}}===
[[File:DeBruijn-as-line-digraph.svg|thumb|360px|Construction of the [[de Bruijn graph]]s as iterated line digraphs]]
It is also possible to generalize line graphs to directed graphs.{{sfnp|Harary|Norman|1960}} If ''G'' is a directed graph, its '''directed line graph''' or '''line digraph''' has one vertex for each edge of ''G''. Two vertices representing directed edges from ''u'' to ''v'' and from ''w'' to ''x'' in ''G'' are connected by an edge from ''uv'' to ''wx'' in the line digraph when ''v'' = ''w''. That is, each edge in the line digraph of ''G'' represents a length-two directed path in ''G''.  The [[de Bruijn graph]]s may be formed by repeating this process of forming directed line graphs, starting from a [[complete graph|complete directed graph]].{{sfnp|Zhang|Lin|1987}}

===Weighted line graphs===
In a line graph ''L''(''G''), each vertex of degree ''k'' in the original graph ''G'' creates ''k(k-1)/2'' edges in the line graph.  For many types of analysis this means high-degree nodes in ''G'' are over-represented in the line graph ''L''(''G'').  For instance, consider a [[random walk]] on the vertices of the original graph ''G''.  This will pass along some edge ''e'' with some frequency ''f''. On the other hand, this edge ''e'' is mapped to a unique vertex, say ''v'', in the line graph ''L''(''G'').  If we now perform the same type of random walk on the vertices of the line graph, the frequency with which ''v'' is visited can be completely different from ''f''.  If our edge ''e'' in ''G'' was connected to nodes of degree ''O(k)'', it will be traversed ''O(k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' more frequently in the line graph ''L''(''G'').  Put another way, the Whitney graph isomorphism theorem guarantees that the line graph almost always encodes the topology of the original graph ''G'' faithfully but it does not guarantee that dynamics on these two graphs have a simple relationship.  One solution is to construct a weighted line graph, that is, a line graph with [[Weighted graph|weighted edges]].  There are several natural ways to do this.{{sfnp|Evans|Lambiotte|2009}} For instance if edges ''d'' and ''e'' in the graph ''G'' are incident at a vertex ''v'' with degree ''k'', then in the line graph ''L''(''G'') the edge connecting the two vertices ''d'' and ''e'' can be given weight ''1/(k-1)''.  In this way every edge in ''G'' (provided neither end is connected to a vertex of degree '1') will have strength ''2'' in the line graph ''L''(''G'') corresponding to the two ends that the edge has in ''G''. It is straightforward to extend this definition of a weighted line graph to cases where the original graph ''G'' was directed or even weighted.{{sfnp|Evans|Lambiotte|2010}}  The principle in all cases is to ensure the line graph ''L''(''G'') reflects the dynamics as well as the topology of the original graph ''G''.

===Line graphs of hypergraphs===
{{main article|Line graph of a hypergraph}}
The edges of a [[hypergraph]] may form an arbitrary [[family of sets]], so the [[line graph of a hypergraph]] is the same as the [[intersection graph]] of the sets from the family.&lt;ref name="mt97"/&gt;

===''Software Development: A Rigorous Approach''===
* [[Cliff Jones (computer scientist)|Cliff Jones]]
* 1980

Description: Cliff Jones' textbook Software Development: A Rigorous Approach is the first full-length exposition of the Vienna Development Method (VDM), which had evolved (principally) at IBM's Vienna research lab over the previous decade and which combines the idea of program refinement as per [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]] with that of data refinement (or reification) whereby algebraically-defined abstract data types are formally transformed into progressively more "concrete" representations.

===''The Science of Programming''===
* [[David Gries]]
* 1981

Description: David Gries' textbook The Science of Programming describes Dijkstra's weakest precondition method of formal program derivation, except in a very much more accessible manner than Dijkstra's earlier ''A Discipline of Programming''.

It shows how to construct programs that work correctly (without bugs, other than from typing errors). It does this by showing how to use precondition and postcondition predicate expressions and program proving techniques to guide the way programs are created.

The examples in the book are all small-scale, and clearly academic (as opposed to real-world). They emphasize basic algorithms, such as sorting and merging, and string manipulation. Subroutines (functions) are included, but object-oriented and functional programming environments are not addressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19750">This is a list of [[WP:N|notable]] '''numerical libraries''', which are [[Library (computing)|libraries]] used in [[software development]] for performing [[numerical analysis|numerical]] calculations.  It is not a complete listing but is instead a list of numerical libraries with articles on Wikipedia, with few exceptions.

The choice of a typical library depends on a diverse range of requirements such as: desired features (for e.g.: large dimensional linear algebra, parallel computation, partial differential equations), commercial/opensource nature, readability of API, portability or platform/compiler dependence (for e.g.: Linux, Windows, Visual C++, GCC), performance in speed, ease-of-use, continued support from developers, standard compliance, specialized optimization in code for specific application scenarios or even the size of the code-base to be installed.

As we find comprehensive surveys rarely available, there is almost always (at least initially) a difficult choice among a number of possible libraries.
Often it tends to be at the discretion of the user based on his own taste and comforts, only due to the lack of proper information.

The '''long hundred''', '''great hundred''', or '''twelfty'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zupko|first=Ronald Edward|title=A dictionary of Weights and Measures of the British Isles|year=1985|publisher=American Philosophy Society|location=Philidephia|isbn=978-0-87169-168-2|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the "hundred" of six [[20 (number)|score]] ([[120 (number)|120]]) used in [[Germanic languages]] prior to the 15th century. The number was simply described as '''hundred''' and translated into [[Latin]] in Germanic-speaking countries as {{lang|la|centum}} ([[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] '''c.'''), but the qualifier "long" is now added because present [[English language|English]] uses the word "hundred" exclusively to refer to the number of five score ([[100 (number)|100]]) instead.

The long hundred was 120 but the '''long thousand''' was reckoned decimally as 10 long hundreds ([[1200 (number)|1200]]).

==Etymology==
The word is [[cognate]] with ''hunderd'' in [[Old Frisian]], ''hundrað'' in [[Old Norse]], and ''hundert'' in [[Old German]].&lt;ref name=TFD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hundred |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hundred |work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=Fifth |year=2016 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company |via=[[The Free Dictionary]] |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of glosses such as "tentywise" or "ten-count" denoting that certain numbers are to be understood as [[decimal]]. Such glosses would not be expected where decimal counting was usual. In the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] [[Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wulfila.be/gothic/browse/text/?book=6&amp;chapter=15 I Cor. 15:6]&lt;/ref&gt; some [[marginalia]] glosses a five hundred (''fimf hundram'') in the text as being understood ''taihuntewjam'' ("tentywise").  Similar words are known in [[Germanic languages|most other Germanic languages]]. [[Old Norse]] clearly used such a system, with its words for "one hundred and eighty" meaning 200 and "two hundred" meaning 240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=E V|title=Introduction to Old Norse|year=1957|publisher=Claredon Press|location=Oxford|pages=292–293|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49127454/Introduction-to-Old-Norse-by-E-V-Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in [[medieval England]] and [[medieval Scotland|Scotland]] is documented by [[W.H. Stevenson|Stevenson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=W. H.|title=The long hundred and its use in England|journal=Archaeological Review|date=December 1899|volume= 4|issue= 5|pages=313–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Goodare|Goodare]], although Goodare notes that it was sometimes avoided by using numbers such as "seven score".&lt;ref name=Goodare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodare|first=Julian|title=The Long Hundred in medieval and early modern Scotland|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|year=1993|volume=123|pages=395–418|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_123/123_395_418.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assize of Weights and Measures]], one of [[Kingdom of England|England]]'s [[statutes of uncertain date]] from {{circa|lk=no|1300}}, shows both the short and long hundred in competing use: the [[hundred (unit)|hundred]] of [[kippers]] is formed by six score fish and the hundred of [[hemp]] [[canvas]] and [[linen cloth]] is formed by six score [[ell]]s but the [[hundredweight|hundred of pounds]] to be used in measuring bulk goods is five times twenty and the hundred of [[herring|fresh herring]] is five score fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Statutes of the Realm |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I |date=1810 |location=London |publisher=G. Eyre &amp; A. Strahan |p=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the original [[Latin]] text, the numeral c. is used for a value of 120: {{abbr|{{lang|la|Et quodlibet c. continet vi. xx.}}|Latin: And each such 'hundred' contains six twenties.}}&lt;ref name=tract&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Ruffhead |editor-first=Owen |editor-link=Owen Ruffhead |title=The Statutes at Large |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I: From Magna Charta&lt;!--sic--&gt; to the End of the Reign of King Henry the Sixth.

The reckoning by long hundreds waned as [[Arabic numerals]] spread throughout Europe during and after the 14th century.

Given a fixed oriented line ''L'' in the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a '''meander''' of order ''n'' is a [[Jordan curve|non-self-intersecting closed curve]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which transversally intersects the line at 2''n'' points for some positive integer ''n''. The line and curve together form a '''meandric system'''.  Two meanders are said to be equivalent if there is a [[homeomorphism]] of the whole plane that takes ''L'' to itself and takes one meander to the other.

===Examples===

The meander of order 1 intersects the line twice:
:[[Image:Meander M1 jaredwf.png|Meander M1 jaredwf.png]]

The meanders of order 2 intersect the line four times.

===Meandric numbers===

The number of distinct meanders of order ''n'' is the '''meandric number''' ''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first fifteen meandric numbers are given below {{OEIS|id=A005315}}.

:''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = [[1 (number)|1]]
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = [[2 (number)|2]] 
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = [[8 (number)|8]]
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = [[42 (number)|42]]
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 262
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1828
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 13820
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 110954
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 933458
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 8152860
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 73424650
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 678390116
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; = 6405031050
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; = 61606881612
:''M''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; = 602188541928

===Meandric permutations===
[[File:Meanderperm.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Meandric permutation &lt;br /&gt;(1 8 5 4 3 6 7 2)&lt;/center&gt;]]
A '''meandric permutation''' of order ''n'' is defined on the set {1, 2, ..., 2''n''} and is determined by a meandric system in the following way:
* With the line oriented from left to right, each intersection of the meander is consecutively labelled with the integers, starting at 1.
* The curve is oriented upward at the intersection labelled 1.
* The [[cyclic permutation]] with no fixed points is obtained by following the oriented curve through the labelled intersection points.

In the diagram on the right, the order 4 meandric permutation is given by (1 8 5 4 3 6 7 2). This is a [[permutation]] written in [[cyclic notation]] and not to be confused with [[one-line notation]].

If π is a meandric permutation, then π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of two [[cyclic permutation|cycles]], one containing of all the even symbols and the other all the odd symbols. Permutations with this property are called ''alternate permutations'', since the symbols in the original permutation alternate between odd and even integers. However, not all alternate permutations are meandric because it may not be possible to draw them without introducing a self-intersection in the curve. For example, the order 3 alternate permutation, (1 4 3 6 5 2), is not meandric.

==Open meander==

Given a fixed oriented line ''L'' in the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an '''open meander''' of order ''n'' is a non-self-intersecting oriented curve in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which transversally intersects the line at ''n'' points for some positive integer ''n''.  Two open meanders are said to be equivalent if they are [[homeomorphic]] in the plane.

===Examples===

The open meander of order 1 intersects the line once:
:[[Image:OpenMeanderM1.svg]]

The open meander of order 2 intersects the line twice:
:[[Image:Open Meander M2 jaredwf.png|Open Meander M2 jaredwf.png]]

===Open meandric numbers===

The number of distinct open meanders of order ''n'' is the '''open meandric number''' ''m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first fifteen open meandric numbers are given below {{OEIS|id=A005316}}.

:''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = [[1 (number)|1]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = [[1 (number)|1]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = [[2 (number)|2]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = [[3 (number)|3]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = [[8 (number)|8]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = [[14 (number)|14]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = [[42 (number)|42]]
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = [[81 (number)|81]] 
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 262
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 538
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 1828 
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 3926 
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; = 13820  
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; = 30694  
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; = 110954

==Semi-meander==

Given a fixed oriented [[ray (geometry)|ray]] ''R'' in the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a '''semi-meander''' of order ''n'' is a non-self-intersecting closed curve in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which transversally intersects the ray at ''n'' points for some positive integer ''n''.  Two semi-meanders are said to be equivalent if they are [[homeomorphic]] in the plane.

===Examples===

The semi-meander of order 1 intersects the ray once:
:&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Semi-meander M1 jaredwf.png|Semi-meander M1 jaredwf.png]] --&gt;

The semi-meander of order 2 intersects the ray twice:
:[[Image:Meander M1 jaredwf.png|Meander M1 jaredwf.png]]

===Semi-meandric numbers===

The number of distinct semi-meanders of order ''n'' is the '''semi-meandric number''' ''&lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (usually denoted with an overline instead of an underline). The first fifteen semi-meandric numbers are given below {{OEIS|id=A000682}}.

:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = [[1 (number)|1]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = [[1 (number)|1]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = [[2 (number)|2]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = [[4 (number)|4]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = [[10 (number)|10]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = [[24 (number)|24]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = [[66 (number)|66]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = [[174 (number)|174]]
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 504
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 1406
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 4210
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 12198
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; = 37378
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; = 111278
:&lt;u&gt;''M''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; = 346846

==Properties of meandric numbers==

There is an [[injective function]] from meandric to open meandric numbers:
:''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;

Each meandric number can be [[Upper bound|bounded]] by semi-meandric numbers:
:''&lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''&lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

For ''n'' &gt; 1, meandric numbers are [[even and odd numbers|even]]:
:''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 0 (mod 2)

{{italic title}}
'''''Metaman: The Merging of Humans and Machines into a Global Superorganism''''' ({{ISBN|067170723X}}) is a 1993 book by author [[Gregory Stock]].  The title refers to a [[superorganism]] comprising humanity and its technology. 

While many people have had ideas about a [[global brain]], they have tended to suppose that this can be improved or altered by humans according to their will. Metaman can be seen as a development that directs humanity's will to its own ends, whether it likes it or not, through the operation of market forces. While it is difficult to think of making a life-form based on metals that can mine its own 'food', it is possible to imagine a superorganism that incorporates humans as its "cells" and entices them to sustain it ([[communalness]]), just as our cells interwork to sustain us.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3468">'''Modal fictionalism''' is a term used in [[philosophy]], and more specifically in the [[metaphysics]] of [[Modal logic|modality]], to describe the position that holds that modality can be analysed in terms of a fiction about [[possible world]]s. The theory comes in two versions: Strong and Timid. Both positions were first exposed by [[Gideon Rosen]] starting from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Rosen, Modal Fictionalism, Mind, 99, 395 (1990), pp. 327-54.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Strong fictionalism about possible worlds==

According to strong fictionalism about possible worlds (another name for strong modal fictionalism), the following bi-conditionals are necessary and specify the truth-conditions for certain cases of modal claims:
# It is possible that P iff the translation of P into the language of a fiction F (containing possible worlds) holds according to F.
# It is necessary that P iff the translation of P into the language of a fiction F (containing possible worlds) always holds.

Recent supporters of this view added further specifications of these bi-conditionals to counter certain objections. In the case of claims of possibility, the revised bi-conditional is thus spelled out: (1.1) it is possible that P iff At this universe, presently, the translation of P into the language of a fiction F holds according to F.&lt;ref&gt;Seahwa Kim, 'Modal Fictionalism and Analysis', in Mark Kalderon (ed.) Fictionalism in Metaphysics (Oxford: Clarendon Press), pp. 116-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timid fictionalism about possible worlds==

According to a timid version of fictionalism about possible worlds, our possible worlds can be properly understood as involving reference to a fiction, but the aforementioned bi-conditionals should not be taken as an analysis of certain cases of modality.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Moyal product''' (after [[José Enrique Moyal]]; also called the '''star product''' or '''Weyl–Groenewold product''', after [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold]]) is perhaps the best-known example of a '''phase-space star product'''.  It is an associative, non-commutative product, ★,   on the functions on ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt;,  equipped with its [[Poisson bracket]] (with a generalization to [[symplectic manifold]]s, described below).  It is a special case of the ★-product of the "algebra of symbols" of a [[universal enveloping algebra]].

==Historical comments==
The Moyal product is named after [[José Enrique Moyal]], but is also sometimes called the [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]]–Groenewold product as it was introduced by [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold|H. J. Groenewold]] in his 1946 doctoral dissertation, in a trenchant appreciation&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Groenewold, "On the Principles of elementary quantum mechanics", ''Physica'','''12''' (1946) pp. 405–460.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Wigner-Weyl transform|Weyl correspondence]].  Moyal actually appears not to know about the product in his celebrated article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moyal | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Bartlett | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100000487 | first2 = M.

E. Moyal]", ANU E-press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular naming after Moyal appears to have emerged only in the 1970s, in homage to his flat [[phase space formulation|phase-space quantization]] picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Definition==
The product for [[smooth function]]s ''f'' and ''g'' on ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;f \star g = fg + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \hbar^n C_n(f,g),&lt;/math&gt;

where each ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a certain bi[[differential operator]] of order ''n'' characterized by the following properties (see below for an explicit formula):

# &lt;math&gt;f \star g = fg + \mathcal O(\hbar)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;p
&gt; Deformation of the pointwise product — implicit in the formula above.
# &lt;math&gt;f \star g - g \star f = i\hbar\{f,g\} + \mathcal O(\hbar^3) \equiv i\hbar \{\{f,g\}\}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;p
&gt; Deformation of the Poisson bracket, called [[Moyal bracket]].
# &lt;math&gt;f \star 1 = 1 \star f = f&lt;/math&gt; &lt;p
&gt; The 1 of the undeformed algebra is also the identity in the new algebra.
# &lt;math&gt;\overline{f \star g} = \overline{g} \star \overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;p
&gt; The complex conjugate is an antilinear antiautomorphism.

Note that, if one wishes to take functions valued in the [[real numbers]], then an alternative version eliminates the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in condition 2 and eliminates condition 4.

If one restricts to polynomial functions, the above algebra is isomorphic to the [[Weyl algebra]] ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the two offer alternative realizations of the [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl map]] of the space of polynomials in {{mvar|n}} variables (or the [[symmetric algebra]] of a vector space of dimension 2''n'').

To provide an explicit formula, consider a constant [[Poisson bivector]] Π on ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi = \sum_{i,j} \Pi^{ij} \partial_i \wedge \partial_j,&lt;/math&gt;
where Π&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt; is a complex number for each ''i'', ''j''.{{what|reason=What is a Poisson bivector? It is not defined at the link. Is it simply the inverse of a symplectic form? If so, the components should be real numbers, not complex.|date=August 2016}}

The star product of two functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; can then be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;f \star g = fg + \frac{i\hbar}{2} \sum_{i,j} \Pi^{ij} (\partial_i f) (\partial_j g)
 - \frac{\hbar^2}{8} \sum_{i,j,k,m} \Pi^{ij} \Pi^{km} (\partial_i \partial_k f) (\partial_j \partial_m g) + \ldots,&lt;/math&gt;

where ħ is the [[reduced Planck constant]], treated as a formal parameter here. This is a special case of what is known as the [[universal enveloping algebra|Berezin formula]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Berezin|F. A. Berezin]], "Some remarks about the associated envelope of a Lie algebra", ''Funct. Anal. Appl.'' '''1''' (1967) p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; on the algebra of symbols and can be given a closed form&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Bekaert, "[http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ptm/pmif/Rencontres/ModaveI/Xavier.pdf Universal enveloping algebras and some applications in physics]" (2005) ''Lecture, Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics''.&lt;/ref&gt; (which follows from the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]]). The closed form can be obtained by using the [[Matrix exponential|exponential]]:
:&lt;math&gt;f \star g = m \circ e^{\frac{i\hbar}{2} \Pi}(f \otimes g),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the multiplication map, &lt;math&gt;m(a \otimes b) = ab&lt;/math&gt;, and the exponential is treated as a power series:
:&lt;math&gt;e^A := 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} A^n.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the formula for &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;C_n = \frac{i^n}{2^n n!} m \circ \Pi^n.&lt;/math&gt;

As indicated, often one eliminates all occurrences of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; above, and the formulas then restrict naturally to real numbers.

Note that if the functions ''f'' and ''g'' are polynomials, the above infinite sums become finite (reducing to the ordinary Weyl-algebra case).

The relationship of the Moyal product to the generalized ★-product used in the definition of the "algebra of symbols" of a [[universal enveloping algebra]] follows from the fact that the [[Weyl algebra]] is the universal enveloping algebra of the [[Heisenberg algebra]] (modulo that the center equals the unit).

==On manifolds==
On any symplectic manifold, one can, at least locally, choose coordinates so as to make the symplectic structure ''constant'', by [[Darboux's theorem]]; and, using the associated Poisson bivector, one may consider the above formula.  For it to work globally,
as a function on the whole manifold (and not just a local formula), one must equip the symplectic manifold with a torsion-free symplectic [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]]. This makes it a [[Fedosov manifold]].

More general results for ''arbitrary Poisson manifolds'' (where the Darboux theorem does not apply) are given by the [[Kontsevich quantization formula]].

A simple explicit example of the construction and utility of the &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-product (for the simplest case of a two-dimensional euclidean [[phase space]]) is given in the article on the [[Wigner–Weyl transform]]: two Gaussians compose with this &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-product according to a hyperbolic tangent law:&lt;ref&gt;[[Cosmas Zachos|C. Zachos]], [[David Fairlie|D. Fairlie]], and [[Thomas Curtright|T. Curtright]], "Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space" (World Scientific, Singapore, 2005) {{isbn|978-981-238-384-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\exp\left[-a\left(x^2 + p^2\right)\right] \star \exp\left[-b\left(x^2 + p^2\right)\right] =
 \frac{1}{1 + \hbar^2 ab} \exp\left[-\frac{a + b}{1 + \hbar^2 ab} \left(x^2 + p^2\right)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

(Note the classical limit, {{math|''ħ'' → 0}}.)

''Every correspondence prescription'' between phase space and Hilbert space, however, induces ''its own'' [[Transformation between distributions in time–frequency analysis|proper]] &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-product.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, L. (1995) ''Time-Frequency Analysis'', Prentice-Hall, New York, 1995. {{isbn|978-0135945322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0370-1573(95)00007-4| title = Theory and application of the quantum phase-space distribution functions| journal = Physics Reports| volume = 259| issue = 3| pages = 147| year = 1995| last1 = Lee | first1 = H.

Similar results are seen in the [[Segal–Bargmann space]] and in the [[theta representation]] of the [[Heisenberg group]], where the creation and annhilation operators &lt;math&gt;a^* = z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a = \partial/\partial z&lt;/math&gt; are understood to act on the complex plane (respectively, the [[upper half-plane]] for the Heisenberg group), so that the position and momenta operators are given by &lt;math&gt;x = (a + a^*)/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p = (a - a^*)/(2i)&lt;/math&gt;.  This situation is clearly different from the case where the positions are taken to be real-valued, but does offer insights into the overall algebraic structure of the Heisenberg algebra and its envelope, the Weyl algebra.

A '''parameter''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:παρά#Ancient Greek|παρά]], ''para'': "beside", "subsidiary"; and [[wikt:μέτρον#Ancient Greek|μέτρον]], ''metron'': "measure"), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular [[system]] (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc.

''Parameter'' has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including [[mathematics]], [[computing]] and [[computer programming]], [[engineering]], [[statistics]], [[logic]] and [[linguistics]]. Within and across these fields, careful distinction must be maintained of the different usages of the term ''parameter'' and of other terms often associated with it, such as [[argument]],  [[property (disambiguation)#Philosophy and science|property]], [[axiom]], [[variable (disambiguation)|variable]], [[Function (disambiguation)#Math, computing and engineering|function]], [[attribute (disambiguation)|attribute]], etc.&lt;ref name="freestyle"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/parameter "Parameter"] in [[TheFreeDictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical functions==
&lt;!--
 [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], and the mathematical [[science]]s, a ''parameter'' is a quantity that serves to relate [[function (mathematics)|function]]s and [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s using a common variable when such a relationship would be difficult to explicate with an [[equation]].
--&gt;
[[Mathematical function]]s have one or more [[Argument of a function|arguments]] that are designated in the definition by [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s. A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general [[quadratic function]] by declaring
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;;

Here, the variable ''x'' designates the function's argument, but ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are parameters that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-''b'' logarithm by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\log_b(x)=\frac{\log(x)}{\log(b)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''b'' is a parameter that indicates which logarithmic function is being used. It is not an argument of the function, and will, for instance, be a constant when considering the [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\log_b'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In some informal situations it is a matter of convention (or historical accident) whether some or all of the symbols in a function definition are called parameters. However, changing the status of symbols between parameter and variable changes the function as a mathematical object. For instance, the notation for the [[falling factorial power]]
:&lt;math&gt;n^{\underline k}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)&lt;/math&gt;,
defines a [[Polynomial#Polynomial functions|polynomial function]] of ''n'' (when ''k'' is considered a parameter), but is not a polynomial function of ''k'' (when ''n'' is considered a parameter). Indeed, in the latter case, it is only defined for non-negative integer arguments. More formal presentations of such situations typically start out with a function of several variables (including all those that might sometimes be called "parameters") such as
:&lt;math&gt;(n,k) \mapsto n^{\underline{k}}&lt;/math&gt;
as the most fundamental object being considered, then defining functions with fewer variables from the main one by means of [[currying]].

Sometimes it is useful to consider all functions with certain parameters as ''parametric family'', i.e. as an [[indexed family]] of functions. Examples from probability theory [[#Probability theory|are given further below]].

===Examples===
* In a section on frequently misused words in his book ''The Writer's Art'', [[James J. Kilpatrick]] quoted a letter from a correspondent, giving examples to illustrate the correct use of the word ''parameter'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;W.M. Woods ... a mathematician ... writes ... "... a variable is one of the many things a ''parameter'' is not." ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Kilpatrick quoting Woods] "Now ... the engineers ... change the lever arms of the linkage ... the speed of the car ... will still depend on the pedal position ...'' but in a ... different manner''.  You have changed a parameter"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* A [[parametric equaliser]] is an [[audio filter]] that allows the [[frequency]] of maximum cut or boost to be set by one control, and the size of the cut or boost by another. These settings, the frequency level of the peak or trough, are two of the parameters of a frequency response curve, and in a two-control equaliser they completely describe the curve. More elaborate parametric equalisers may allow other parameters to be varied, such as skew. These parameters each describe some aspect of the response curve seen as a whole, over all frequencies.  A [[graphic equaliser]] provides individual level controls for various frequency bands, each of which acts only on that particular frequency band.
* If asked to imagine the graph of the relationship ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, one typically visualizes a range of values of ''x'', but only one value of ''a''. Of course a different value of ''a'' can be used, generating a different relation between ''x'' and ''y''. Thus ''a'' is a parameter: it is less variable than the variable ''x'' or ''y'', but it is not an explicit constant like the exponent&amp;nbsp;2. More precisely, changing the parameter ''a'' gives a different (though related) problem, whereas the variations of the variables ''x'' and ''y'' (and their interrelation) are part of the problem itself.
* In calculating income based on wage and hours worked (income equals wage multiplied by hours worked), it is typically assumed that the number of hours worked is easily changed, but the wage is more static. This makes ''wage'' a parameter, ''hours worked'' an [[independent variable]], and ''income'' a [[dependent variable]].

===Mathematical models===
In the context of a [[mathematical model]], such as a [[probability distribution]], the distinction between variables and parameters was described by Bard as follows:
:We refer to the relations which supposedly describe a certain physical situation, as a ''model''. Typically, a model consists of one or more equations. The quantities appearing in the equations we classify into ''variables'' and ''parameters''. The distinction between these is not always clear cut, and it frequently depends on the context in which the variables appear. Usually a model is designed to explain the relationships that exist among quantities which can be measured independently in an experiment; these are the variables of the model. To formulate these relationships, however, one frequently introduces "constants" which stand for inherent properties of nature (or of the materials and equipment used in a given experiment). These are the parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yonathan |last=Bard |year=1974 |title=Nonlinear Parameter Estimation |page=11 |location=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=0-12-078250-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytic geometry===
{{See also|parametric equation}}

In [[analytic geometry]], [[curve]]s are often given as the image of some function. The argument of the function is invariably called "the parameter". A circle of radius 1 centered at the origin can be specified in more than one form:
*''implicit'' form
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt;
*''parametric'' form
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(\cos \; t,\sin \; t)&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''t'' is the ''parameter''.
Hence these equations, which might be called functions elsewhere are in analytic geometry characterized as [[parametric equations]] and the [[independent variable]]s are considered as parameters.

===Mathematical analysis===
In [[mathematical analysis]], integrals dependent on a parameter are often considered. These are of the form
:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{x_0(t)}^{x_1(t)}f(x;t)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
In this formula, ''t'' is the argument of the function ''F'', and on the right-hand side the ''parameter'' on which the integral depends. When evaluating the integral, ''t'' is held constant, and so it is considered to be a parameter.  If we are interested in the value of ''F'' for different values of ''t'', we then consider ''t'' to be a variable. The quantity ''x'' is a ''[[Bound variable|dummy variable]]'' or ''variable of integration'' (confusingly, also sometimes called a ''parameter of integration'').

===Statistics and econometrics===
{{main|Statistical parameter}}
In [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]], the probability framework above still holds, but attention shifts to [[statistical estimation|estimating]] the parameters of a distribution based on observed data, or [[Hypothesis testing|testing hypotheses]] about them. In [[Frequentist inference|frequentist estimation]] parameters are considered "fixed but unknown", whereas in [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian estimation]] they are treated as random variables, and their uncertainty is described as a distribution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[estimation theory]] of statistics, "statistic" or [[estimator]] refers to samples, whereas "parameter" or [[estimand]] refers to populations, where the samples are taken from. A [[statistic]] is a numerical characteristic of a sample that can be used as an estimate of the corresponding parameter, the numerical characteristic of the [[statistical population|population]] from which the sample was drawn.

For example, the [[sample mean]] (estimator), denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline X&lt;/math&gt;, can be used as an estimate of the ''mean'' parameter (estimand), denoted ''μ'', of the population from which the sample was drawn. Similarly, the [[sample variance]] (estimator), denoted ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, can be used to estimate the ''variance'' parameter (estimand), denoted ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of the population from which the sample was drawn. (Note that the sample standard deviation (''S'') is not an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (''σ''): see [[Unbiased estimation of standard deviation]].)

It is possible to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of [[probability distribution]]s. In that case, one speaks of ''[[non-parametric statistics]]'' as opposed to the [[parametric statistics]] just described. For example, a test based on [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the [[Correlation and dependence|population correlation]].

===Probability theory===
[[File:Poisson pmf.svg|thumb|right|These traces all represent Poisson distributions, but with different values for the parameter &amp;lambda;]]In [[probability theory]], one may describe the [[probability distribution|distribution]] of a [[random variable]] as belonging to a ''family'' of [[probability distribution]]s, distinguished from each other by the values of a finite number of ''parameters''. For example, one talks about "a [[Poisson distribution]] with mean value λ".  The function defining the distribution (the [[probability mass function]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;f(k;\lambda)=\frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;
This example nicely illustrates the distinction between constants, parameters, and variables. ''e'' is [[Euler's number]], a fundamental [[mathematical constant]]. The parameter λ is the [[mean]] number of observations of some phenomenon in question, a property characteristic of the system.  ''k'' is a variable, in this case the number of occurrences of the phenomenon actually observed from a particular sample.  If we want to know the probability of observing ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; occurrences, we plug it into the function to get &lt;math&gt;f(k_1 ; \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.  Without altering the system, we can take multiple samples, which will have a range of values of ''k'', but the system is always characterized by the same λ.

For instance, suppose we have a [[radioactivity|radioactive]] sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes.  We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods.  The measurements exhibit different values of ''k'', and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of ''k'' will come up in a proportion given by the probability mass function above.  From measurement to measurement, however, λ remains constant at 5.  If we do not alter the system, then the parameter λ is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter λ would increase.

Another common distribution is the [[normal distribution]], which has as parameters the mean μ and the variance σ².

In these above examples, the distributions of the random variables are completely specified by the type of distribution, i.e. Poisson or normal, and the parameter values, i.e. mean and variance.  In such a case, we have a parameterized distribution.

It is possible to use the sequence of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] (mean, mean square, ...) or [[cumulant]]s (mean, variance, ...) as parameters for a probability distribution: see [[Statistical parameter]].

==Computing==
In computing, a parameter is defined as  "a reference or value that is passed to a function, procedure, subroutine, command, or program".&lt;ref name="freestyle" /&gt;  For example, the name of a file, (a parameter), is passed to a computer program, which then performs a specific function; that is, a program may be passed the name of a file on which it will perform the specific function.

==Computer programming==
{{Main article|Parameter (computer programming)}}
In [[computer programming]], two notions of [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] are commonly used, and are referred to as [[Parameter (computer programming)#Parameters and arguments|parameters and arguments]]—or more formally as a '''formal parameter''' and an '''actual parameter'''.

For example, in the definition of a function such as
: y = ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' + 2,
''x'' is the ''formal parameter'' (the ''parameter'') of the defined function.

When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in
:''f''(3): or,  ''y'' = ''f''(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,
3 is the ''actual parameter'' (the ''argument'') for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the ''formal parameter'' of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms ''parameter'' and ''argument'' might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in [[functional programming]] and its foundational disciplines, [[lambda calculus]] and [[combinatory logic]]. Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] define parameter and argument as given here, while [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] uses an [[Parameter (computer programming)#Alternative convention in Eiffel|alternative convention]].

==Engineering==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[RLC circuit]] --&gt;
In [[engineering]] (especially involving data acquisition) the term ''parameter'' sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. This usage isn't consistent, as sometimes the term ''channel'' refers to an individual measured item, with ''parameter'' referring to the setup information about that channel.

"Speaking generally, '''properties''' are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; '''parameters''' are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Trimmer |year=1950 |title=Response of Physical Systems |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=13 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences.

==Environmental science==
In environmental science and particularly in [[chemistry]] and [[microbiology]], a parameter is used to describe a discrete chemical or microbiological entity that can be assigned a value: commonly a concentration, but may also be a logical entity (present or absent), a [[statistics|statistical]] result such as a [[Percentile|95%ile]] value or in some cases a subjective value.

==Linguistics==
Within linguistics, the word "parameter" is almost exclusively used to denote a binary switch in a [[Universal Grammar]] within a [[Principles and Parameters]] framework.

==Logic==
In [[logic]], the parameters passed to (or operated on by) an ''open predicate'' are called ''parameters'' by some authors (e.g., [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]], "Natural Deduction"; [[Lawrence Paulson|Paulson]], "Designing a theorem prover"). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called ''variables''. This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision must be made to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate ''variables'', and when defining substitution have to distinguish between ''[[free variable]]s'' and ''[[bound variable]]s''.

==Music==
{{main article|Musical parameter}}
In music theory, a parameter denotes an element which may be manipulated (composed), separately from the other elements. The term is used particularly for [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[loudness]], [[duration (music)|duration]], and [[timbre]], though theorists or composers have sometimes considered other musical aspects as parameters. The term is particularly used in [[serial music]], where each parameter may follow some specified series. [[Paul Lansky]] and [[George Perle]] criticized the extension of the word "parameter" to this sense, since it is not closely related to its mathematical sense,&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Parameter|author=Paul Lansky|author2=George Perle|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains common.  The term is also common in music production, as the functions of audio processing units (such as the attack, release, ratio, threshold, and other variables on a compressor) are defined by parameters specific to the type of unit (compressor, equalizer, delay, etc.).

In [[mathematics]], a [[permutation group]] ''G'' [[group action|acting]] on a non-empty set ''X'' is called '''primitive''' if ''G'' acts [[Group_action#Types_of_actions|transitively]] on ''X'' and ''G'' preserves no nontrivial [[Partition_of_a_set|partition]] of ''X'', where nontrivial partition means a partition that isn't a partition into singleton sets or partition into one set ''X''. Otherwise, if ''G'' is transitive and ''G'' does preserve a nontrivial partition, ''G'' is called '''imprimitive'''. 

While primitive permutation groups are transitive by definition, not all transitive permutation groups are primitive. The requirement that a primitive group be transitive is necessary only when ''X'' is a 2-element set and the action is trivial; otherwise, the condition that ''G'' preserves no nontrivial partition implies that ''G'' is transitive. This is because for non-transitive actions either the [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of ''G'' form a nontrivial partition preserved by ''G'', or the group action is trivial, in which case any nontrivial partition of ''X'' (which exists for |''X''|≥''3'') is preserved by ''G''.

This terminology was introduced by [[Évariste Galois]] in his last letter, in which he used the French term ''équation primitive'' for an equation whose [[Galois group]] is primitive.&lt;ref&gt; Galois' last letter: http://www.galois.ihp.fr/ressources/vie-et-oeuvre-de-galois/lettres/lettre-testament&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same letter he stated also the following theorem.

If ''G'' is a primitive [[solvable group]] acting on a finite set ''X'', then the order of ''X'' is a power of a [[prime number]] ''p'', ''X'' may be identified with an [[affine space]] over the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements and ''G'' acts on ''X'' as a subgroup of the [[affine group]].

An imprimitive permutation group is an example of an [[induced representation]]; examples include [[coset]] representations ''G''/''H'' in cases where ''H'' is not a [[maximal subgroup]]. When ''H'' is maximal, the coset representation is primitive. 

If the set ''X'' is finite, its cardinality is called the "degree" of ''G''. 
The numbers of primitive groups of small degree were stated by [[Robert Carmichael]] in 1937:

{| class="wikitable"
| Degree || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || [[OEIS]]
|-
| Number || 1 || 2 || 2 || 5 || 4 || 7 || 7 || 11 || 9 || 8 || 6 || 9 || 4 || 6 || 22 || 10 || 4 || 8 || 4 || 9 || 4 || 7 || 5 || {{OEIS link|id=A000019}}
|}

Note the large number of primitive groups of degree 16.  As Carmichael notes, all of these groups, except for the [[symmetric group|symmetric]] and [[alternating group|alternating]] group, are subgroups of the [[affine group]] on the 4-dimensional space over the 2-element [[finite field]].

== Examples ==
* Consider the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; acting on the set &lt;math&gt;X=\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; and the permutation 
: &lt;math&gt;\eta=\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Both &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; and the group generated by &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are primitive.
* Now consider the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_4&lt;/math&gt; acting on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; and the permutation 
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
The group generated by &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is not primitive, since the partition &lt;math&gt;(X_1, X_2)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X_1 = \{1,3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2 = \{2,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is preserved under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X_1) = X_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X_2)=X_1&lt;/math&gt;.
* Every transitive group of prime degree is primitive
* The [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; acting on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is primitive for every ''n'' and the [[alternating group]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; acting on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is primitive for every&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26469">The '''quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations''', designed by [[Aram Harrow]], Avinatan Hassidim, and [[Seth Lloyd]], is a [[quantum algorithm]] formulated in 2009 for solving [[System of linear equations|linear systems]]. The algorithm estimates the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector to a given linear system of equations.&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al."&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 0811.3171|last1 = Harrow|first1 = Aram W|title = Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 103|issue = 15|pages = 150502|last2 = Hassidim|first2 = Avinatan|last3 = Lloyd|first3 = Seth|year = 2008|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid = 19905613|bibcode = 2009PhRvL.103o0502H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is one of the main fundamental algorithms expected to provide a speedup over their classical counterparts, along with [[Shor's Algorithm|Shor's factoring algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm|Grover's search algorithm]] and [[Universal quantum simulator|quantum simulation]]. Provided the linear system is a [[sparse matrix|sparse]] and has a low [[condition number]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, and that the user is interested in the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector, instead of the values of the solution vector itself, then the algorithm has a runtime of &lt;math&gt;O(\log(N)\kappa^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of variables in the linear system. This offers an exponential speedup over the fastest classical algorithm, which runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;O(N\sqrt{\kappa})&lt;/math&gt; for positive semidefinite matrices).

An implementation of the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations was first demonstrated in 2013 by Cai et al., Barz et al. and Pan et al. in parallel. The demonstrations consisted of simple linear equations on specially designed quantum devices.&lt;ref name="Experimental quantum computing to solve systems of linear equations by Cai et al."&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.230501|pmid = 25167475|title = Experimental Quantum Computing to Solve Systems of Linear Equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 110|issue = 23|pages = 230501|year = 2013|last1 = Cai|first1 = X.-D|last2 = Weedbrook|first2 = C|last3 = Su|first3 = Z.-E|last4 = Chen|first4 = M.-C|last5 = Gu|first5 = Mile|last6 = Zhu|first6 = M.-J|last7 = Li|first7 = Li|last8 = Liu|first8 = Nai-Le|last9 = Lu|first9 = Chao-Yang|last10 = Pan|first10 = Jian-Wei|bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110w0501C|arxiv = 1302.4310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarzKassal2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barz|first1=Stefanie|last2=Kassal|first2=Ivan|last3=Ringbauer|first3=Martin|last4=Lipp|first4=Yannick Ole|last5=Dakić|first5=Borivoje|last6=Aspuru-Guzik|first6=Alán|last7=Walther|first7=Philip|title=A two-qubit photonic quantum processor and its application to solving systems of linear equations|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|year=2014|pages=6115|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep06115|pmid=25135432|pmc=4137340|arxiv=1302.1210|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E6115B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimental realization of quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Pan et al."&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1302.1946|last1 = Pan|first1 = Jian|title = Experimental realization of quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 89|issue = 2|pages = 022313|last2 = Cao|first2 = Yudong|last3 = Yao|first3 = Xiwei|last4 = Li|first4 = Zhaokai|last5 = Ju|first5 = Chenyong|last6 = Peng|first6 = Xinhua|last7 = Kais|first7 = Sabre|last8 = Du|first8 = Jiangfeng|last9 = Du|first9 = Jiangfeng|year = 2013|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.89.022313|bibcode = 2014PhRvA..89b2313P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of a general-purpose version of the algorithm appeared in 2018 in the work of Zhao et al.&lt;ref name="Bayesian Deep Learning on a Quantum Computer by Zhao et al."&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint = 1806.11463|last1 = Zhao|first1 = Zhikuan|title = Bayesian Deep Learning on a Quantum Computer|last2 = Pozas-Kerstjens|first2 = Alejandro|last3 = Rebentrost|first3 = Patrick|last4 = Wittek|first4 = Peter|year = 2018|class = quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the prevalence of linear systems in virtually all areas of science and engineering, the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations has the potential for widespread applicability.&lt;ref name="Quantum Computer Runs The Most Practically Useful Quantum Algorithm by Chao-Yang Lu and Jian-Wei Pan"&gt;[http://www.2physics.com/2013/06/quantum-computer-runs-most-practically.html Quantum Computer Runs The Most Practically Useful Quantum Algorithm, by Lu and Pan].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==

The problem we are trying to solve is: given a &lt;math&gt;N \times N&lt;/math&gt; [[Hermitian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt;, find the solution vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;A\overrightarrow{x}=\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt;. This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; itself, but rather the result of applying some operator &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; onto x, &lt;math&gt;\langle x|M|x\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

First, the algorithm represents the vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; as a [[quantum state]] of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle=\sum_{i \mathop =1}^N b_i|i\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator &lt;math&gt;e^{iAt}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for a superposition of different times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The ability to decompose &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; into the eigenbasis of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and to find the corresponding eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j&lt;/math&gt; is facilitated by the use of [[quantum phase estimation]].

The state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \mathop =1}^N \beta_j|u_j\rangle|\lambda_j\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; is the eigenvector basis of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle=\sum_{j \mathop =1}^N \beta_j|u_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

We would then like to perform the linear map taking &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C\lambda^{-1}_j|\lambda_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a normalizing constant. The linear mapping operation is not unitary and thus will require a number of repetitions as it has some probability of failing. After it succeeds, we uncompute the &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt; register and are left with a state proportional to:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \mathop =1}^N \beta_i\lambda^{-1}_j|u_j\rangle=A^{-1}|b\rangle=|x\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;|x\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a quantum-mechanical representation of the desired solution vector&amp;nbsp;''x''. To read out all components of ''x'' would require the procedure be repeated at least ''N'' times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator ''M'' acting on&amp;nbsp;''x''. By mapping ''M'' to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to ''M'', we obtain an estimate of the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle x|M|x\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector ''x'' to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector&amp;nbsp;''x''.

== Explanation of the algorithm ==

=== Initialization ===

Firstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] so that it can be converted into a [[unitary operator]]. In the case where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not Hermitian, define 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 &amp; A \\
     A^t &amp; 0  
  \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve &lt;math&gt;Cy=\begin{bmatrix}
     b \\
     0  
  \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;y = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 \\
     x  
  \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

Secondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; that can take some arbitrary quantum state &lt;math&gt;|\mathrm{initial}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as input. Any error in the preparation of state &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is ignored.

Finally, the algorithm assumes that the state &lt;math&gt;| \psi_0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; can be prepared efficiently. Where

: &lt;math&gt;| \psi_0 \rangle := \sqrt{2/T} \sum_{\tau \mathop =0}^{T-1} \sin\pi\left(\tfrac{\tau+\tfrac{1}{2}}{T}\right) |\tau\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for some large &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients of &lt;math&gt;| \psi_0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the &lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{invert}&lt;/math&gt; subroutine described below.

=== Hamiltonian simulation ===

[[Hamiltonian simulation]] is used to transform the Hermitian matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most ''s'' nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time&amp;nbsp;O(''s''). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows &lt;math&gt;e^{iAt}&lt;/math&gt; to be simulated in time &lt;math&gt;O(\log(N)s^2t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== &lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{invert}&lt;/math&gt; subroutine ===
The key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted &lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{invert}&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as follows and incorporates a [[phase estimation]] subroutine:

1. Prepare &lt;math&gt;|\psi_0\rangle^C&lt;/math&gt; on register ''C''

2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)

3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register&amp;nbsp;''C''. Denote the resulting basis states with &lt;math&gt;|k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. Define &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k:=2\pi k/t_0&lt;/math&gt;.

4. Adjoin a three-dimensional register ''S'' in the state
: &lt;math&gt;|h(\lambda_k)\rangle^S := \sqrt{1-f(\lambda_k)^2 - g(\lambda_k)^2} |\mathrm{nothing} \rangle^S + f(\lambda_k)| \mathrm{well} \rangle^S+g (\lambda_k) | \mathrm{ill} \rangle^S, &lt;/math&gt;

5. Reverse steps 1–3, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.

The phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of ''A'' up to error &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

The ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of ''A''.  In this register, the functions ''f'', ''g'', are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in the ill-conditioned subspace of ''A'' and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion. Producing a state proportional to the inverse of ''A'' requires 'well' to be measured, after which the overall state of the system collapses to the desired state by the extended [[Born rule]].

=== Main loop ===

The body of the algorithm follows the [[amplitude amplification]] procedure: starting with &lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{invert}B|\mathrm{initial}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the following operation is repeatedly applied:

: &lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{invert}BR_\mathrm{init}B^\dagger U^\dagger_\mathrm{invert}R_\mathrm{succ}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{succ}=I-2|\mathrm{well}\rangle\langle \mathrm{well}|,&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{init}=I-2|\mathrm{initial}\rangle\langle\mathrm{initial}|.&lt;/math&gt;

After each repetition, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is measured and will produce a value of 'nothing', 'well', or 'ill' as described above. This loop is repeated until &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is measured, which occurs with a probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Rather than repeating &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; times to minimize error, amplitude amplification is used to achieve the same error resilience using only &lt;math&gt;O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; repetitions.

=== Scalar measurement ===

After successfully measuring 'well' on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the system will be in a state proportional to:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \mathop =1}^N \beta_i \lambda^{-1}_j |u_j\rangle = A^{-1} |b \rangle = | x\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we perform the quantum-mechanical operator corresponding to M and obtain an estimate of the value of &lt;math&gt;\langle x|M|x\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

== Run time analysis ==

=== Classical efficiency ===

The best classical algorithm which produces the actual solution vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Gaussian elimination]], which runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N^3)&lt;/math&gt; time.

If ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and positive semi-definite, then the [[Conjugate Gradient method]] can be used to find the solution vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; can be found in &lt;math&gt;O(Ns\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; time by minimizing the quadratic function &lt;math&gt;|A\overrightarrow{x} -\overrightarrow{b}|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

When only a summary statistic of the solution vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; is needed, as is the case for the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, a classical computer can find an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}^\dagger M \overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;O(N\sqrt{\kappa})&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Quantum efficiency ===

The quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations originally proposed by Harrow et al. was shown to be &lt;math&gt;O(\kappa^2\log N)&lt;/math&gt;. The runtime of this algorithm was subsequently improved to &lt;math&gt;O(\kappa \log^3\kappa \log N)&lt;/math&gt; by Andris Ambainis.&lt;ref name="Variable time amplitude amplification and a faster quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations by Adris Ambainis"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint = 1010.4458|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Variable time amplitude amplification and a faster quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations|year = 2010|class = quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the HHL algorithm maintains its logarithmic scaling only for sparse or low rank matrices, Wossnig et al.&lt;ref name="Quantum linear system algorithm for dense matrices by Leonard Wossnig, Zhikuan Zhao, Anupam Prakash"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1704.06174|last1 = Wossnig|first1 = Leonard|title = A quantum linear system algorithm for dense matrices|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 120|issue = 5|pages = 050502|last2 = Zhao|first2 = Zhikuan|last3 = Prakash|first3 = Anupam|year = 2017|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.050502|pmid = 29481180|bibcode = 2018PhRvL.120e0502W}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended the HHL algorithm based on a quantum singular value estimation technique and provide a linear system algorithm for dense matrices which runs in &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt N \log N \kappa^2)&lt;/math&gt; time compared to the &lt;math&gt;O(N \log N \kappa^2)&lt;/math&gt; of the standard HHL algorithm.

=== Optimality ===

An important factor in the performance of the matrix inversion algorithm is the condition number of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the ratio of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s largest and smallest eigenvalues. As the condition number increases, the ease with which the solution vector can be found using gradient descent methods such as the [[conjugate gradient method]] decreases, as &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; becomes closer to a matrix which cannot be inverted and the solution vector becomes less stable. This algorithm assumes that all elements of the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; lie between &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; and 1, in which case the claimed run-time proportional to &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; will be achieved. Therefore, the speedup over classical algorithms is increased further when &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{poly}(\log(N))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al."/&gt;

If the run-time of the algorithm were made poly-logarithmic in &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; then problems solvable on ''n'' qubits could be solved in poly(''n'') time, causing the complexity class [[BQP]] to be equal to [[PSPACE]].&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al."/&gt;

== Error analysis ==

Performing the Hamiltonian simulation, which is the dominant source of error, is done by simulating &lt;math&gt;e^{iAt}&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is s-sparse, this can be done with an error bounded by a constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which will translate to the additive error achieved in the output state &lt;math&gt;|x\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The phase estimation step errs by &lt;math&gt;O\left(\frac{1}{t_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt; in estimating &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which translates into a relative error of &lt;math&gt;O\left(\frac{1}{\lambda t_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge 1/\kappa &lt;/math&gt;, taking &lt;math&gt;t_0=O(\kappa\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; induces a final error of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. This requires that the overall run-time efficiency be increased proportional to &lt;math&gt;O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to minimize error.

== Experimental realization ==

While there does not yet exist a quantum computer that can truly offer a speedup over a classical computer, implementation of a "proof of concept" remains an important milestone in the development of a new quantum algorithm. Demonstrating the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations remained a challenge for years after its proposal until 2013 when it was demonstrated by Cai et al., Barz et al. and Pan et al. in parallel.

=== Cai et al. ===
Published in Physical Review Letters 110, 230501 (2013), Cai et al. reported an experimental demonstration of the simplest meaningful instance of this algorithm, that is, solving 2*2 linear equations for various input vectors. The quantum circuit is optimized and compiled into a linear optical network with four photonic quantum bits (qubits) and four controlled logic gates, which is used to coherently implement every subroutine for this algorithm. For various input vectors, the quantum computer gives solutions for the linear equations with reasonably high precision, ranging from fidelities of 0.825 to 0.993.&lt;ref name="Experimental quantum computing to solve systems of linear equations by Cai et al: Arxiv"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1302.4310|last1 = Cai|first1 = X. -D|title = Experimental Quantum Computing to Solve Systems of Linear Equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 110|issue = 23|pages = 230501|last2 = Weedbrook|first2 = Christian|last3 = Su|first3 = Z. -E|last4 = Chen|first4 = M. -C|last5 = Gu|first5 = Mile|last6 = Zhu|first6 = M. -J|last7 = Li|first7 = L|last8 = Liu|first8 = N. -L|last9 = Lu|first9 = Chao-Yang|last10 = Pan|first10 = Jian-Wei|year = 2013|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.230501|pmid = 25167475|bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110w0501C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barz et al. ===

On February 5, 2013, Barz et al. demonstrated the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations on a photonic quantum computing architecture. This implementation used two consecutive entangling gates on the same pair of polarization-encoded qubits. Two separately controlled NOT gates were realized where the successful operation of the first was heralded by a measurement of two ancillary photons. Barz et al. found that the fidelity in the obtained output state ranged from 64.7% to 98.1% due to the influence of higher-order emissions from spontaneous parametric down-conversion.&lt;ref name="BarzKassal2014"/&gt;

=== Pan et al. ===

On February 8, 2013 Pan et al. reported a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of the quantum algorithm using a 4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor. The implementation was tested using simple linear systems of only 2 variables. Across three experiments they obtain the solution vector with over 96% fidelity.&lt;ref name="Experimental realization of quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Pan et al."/&gt;

== Applications ==

Quantum computers are devices that harness quantum mechanics to perform computations in ways that classical computers cannot. For certain problems, quantum algorithms supply exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, the most famous example being Shor's factoring algorithm. Few such exponential speedups are known, and those that are (such as the use of quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems) have so far found limited use outside the domain of quantum mechanics. This algorithm provides an exponentially faster method of estimating features of the solution of a set of linear equations, which is a problem ubiquitous in science and engineering, both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems.

=== Electromagnetic scattering ===
Clader et al. provided an preconditioned version of the linear systems algorithm that provided two advances. First, they demonstrated how a [[preconditioner]] could be included within the quantum algorithm. This expands the class of problems that can achieve the promised exponential speedup, since the scaling of HHL and the best classical algorithms are both polynomial in the [[condition number]]. The second advance was the demonstration of how to use HHL to solve for the [[radar cross-section]] of a complex shape. This was one of the first end to end examples of how to use HHL to solve a concrete problem exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm. &lt;ref name="Preconditioned quantum linear system algorithm by Clader et al."&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.250504|pmid = 23829722|title = Preconditioned Quantum Linear System Algorithm|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 110|issue = 25|pages = 250504|year = 2013|last1 = Clader|first1 = B.

=== Linear differential equation solving ===

Dominic Berry proposed a new algorithm for solving linear time dependent differential equations as an extension of the quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations. Berry provides an efficient algorithm for solving the full-time evolution under sparse linear differential equations on a quantum computer.&lt;ref name="High-order quantum algorithm for solving linear differential equations by Dominic Berry"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1010.2745|last1 = Berry|first1 = Dominic W|title = High-order quantum algorithm for solving linear differential equations|journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical|volume = 47|issue = 10|pages = 105301|year = 2010|doi = 10.1088/1751-8113/47/10/105301|bibcode = 2014JPhA...47j5301B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Least-squares fitting ===

Wiebe et al. provide a new quantum algorithm to determine the quality of a [[least-squares fit]] in which a continuous function is used to approximate a set of discrete points by extending the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations. As the amount of discrete points increases, the time required to produce a least-squares fit using even a quantum computer running a quantum state tomography algorithm becomes very large. Wiebe et al. find that in many cases, their algorithm can efficiently find a concise approximation of the data points, eliminating the need for the higher-complexity tomography algorithm.&lt;ref name="Quantum Data Fitting by Wiebe et al."&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1204.5242|last1 = Wiebe|first1 = Nathan|title = Quantum Data Fitting|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 109|issue = 5|pages = 050505|last2 = Braun|first2 = Daniel|last3 = Lloyd|first3 = Seth|year = 2012|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050505|pmid = 23006156|bibcode = 2012PhRvL.109e0505W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine learning and big data analysis ===
{{main|Quantum machine learning}}

[[Machine learning]] is the study of systems that can identify trends in data. Tasks in machine learning frequently involve manipulating and classifying a large volume of data in high-dimensional vector spaces. The runtime of classical machine learning algorithms is limited by a polynomial dependence on both the volume of data and the dimensions of the space. Quantum computers are capable of manipulating high-dimensional vectors using tensor product spaces are thus the perfect platform for machine learning algorithms.&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning by Lloyd et al."&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint = 1307.0411|last1 = Lloyd|first1 = Seth|title = Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning|last2 = Mohseni|first2 = Masoud|last3 = Rebentrost|first3 = Patrick|year = 2013|class = quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations has been applied to a support vector machine, which is an optimized linear or non-linear binary classifier. A support vector machine can be used for supervised machine learning, in which  training set of already classified data is available, or unsupervised machine learning, in which all data given to the system is unclassified. Rebentrost et al. show that a quantum support vector machine can be used for [[big data]] classification and achieve an exponential speedup over classical computers.&lt;ref name="Quantum support vector machine for big feature and big data classification by Rebentrost et al."&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint = 1307.0471v2|last1 = Rebentrost|first1 = Patrick|title = Quantum support vector machine for big feature and big data classification|last2 = Mohseni|first2 = Masoud|last3 = Lloyd|first3 = Seth|year = 2013|class = quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2018, Zhao et al. developed an algorithm for performing Bayesian training of deep neural networks in quantum computers with an exponential speedup over classical training due to the use of the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations&lt;ref name="Bayesian Deep Learning on a Quantum Computer by Zhao et al."/&gt;, providing also the first general-purpose implementation of the algorithm to be run in [[Cloud-based quantum computing|cloud-based quantum computers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=apozas/bayesian-dl-quantum |url=https://gitlab.com/apozas/bayesian-dl-quantum |website=GitLab |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Optimization (computer science)|code optimization]] during the translation of computer programs into an executable form, and in mathematical reduction generally, a '''reduction strategy''' for a [[term rewriting system]] determines which reducible subterms (or '''reducible expressions''', '''redexes''') should be reduced (''contracted'') within a term; it may be the case that a term may contain multiple redexes which are disjoint from one another and that choosing to contract one redex before another may have no influence on the resulting reduced form of the term, or that the redexes in a term do overlap and that choosing to contract one of the overlapping redexes over the other may result in a different reduced form of the term. It is the choice of which redex at each step in the reduction to contract that determines the strategy chosen. This can be seen as a practical application of the theoretical notion of [[Reduction strategy (lambda calculus)|reduction strategy]] in [[lambda calculus]].

'''Stochastic Petri nets''' are a form of [[Petri net]] where the transitions fire after a probabilistic delay determined by a [[random variable]].  

==Definition==
A ''stochastic Petri net'' is a five-tuple ''SPN'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'', ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Λ'') where:
# ''P'' is a set of states, called ''places''.
# ''T'' is a set of ''transitions''.
# ''F'' where ''F'' &lt;big&gt;⊂&lt;/big&gt; (''P'' × ''T'') &lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt; (''T'' × ''P'') is a set of flow relations called "arcs" between places and transitions (and between transitions and places).
# ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''initial marking''.
# ''Λ = '' is the array of ''firing rates λ'' associated with the transitions. The firing rate, a [[random variable]], can also be a function λ(''M'') of the current marking.

==Correspondence to Markov process==
The [[reachability]] graph of stochastic Petri nets can be mapped directly to a [[Markov process]]. It satisfies the [[Markov property]], since its states depend only on the current marking. 
Each state in the reachability graph is mapped to a state in the Markov process, and the firing of a transition with firing rate λ corresponds to a Markov state transition with probability λ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9442">A '''tractrix''' (from the [[Latin]] verb ''trahere'' "pull, drag"; plural: '''tractrices''') is the [[curve]] along which an object moves, under the influence of friction, when pulled on a [[horizontal plane]] by a [[line segment]] attached to a tractor (pulling) point that moves at a right angle to the initial line between the object and the puller at an [[infinitesimal]] [[speed]]. It is therefore a [[curve of pursuit]]. It was first introduced by [[Claude Perrault]] in 1670, and later studied by [[Isaac Newton]] (1676) and [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1692).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Image:Tractrix.png|thumb|180px|right|Tractrix with object initially at {{math|(4,0)}}]]

==Mathematical derivation==
Suppose the object is placed at {{math|(''a'',0)}} (or {{math|(4,0)}} in the example shown at right), and the puller in the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], so {{mvar|a}} is the length of the pulling thread (4 in the example at right). Then the puller starts to move along the {{mvar|y}} axis in the positive direction. At every moment, the thread will be tangent to the curve {{math|1=''y'' = ''y''(''x'')}} described by the object, so that it becomes completely determined by the movement of the puller. Mathematically, the movement will be described then by the  [[differential equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
with the initial condition {{math|1=''y''(''a'') = 0}} whose solution is
:&lt;math&gt;y = \int_x^a\frac{\sqrt{a^2-t^2}}{t}\,dt = \pm \left ( a\ln{\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{x}}-\sqrt{a^2-x^2} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The first term of this solution can also be written 
:&lt;math&gt;a \operatorname{arsech}\frac{x}{a}, &lt;/math&gt; 
where {{math|arsech}} is the [[inverse hyperbolic secant]] function.

The negative branch denotes the case where the puller moves in the negative direction from the origin. Both branches belong to the tractrix, meeting at the [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]] point {{math|(''a'',0)}}.

==Basis of the tractrix==
The essential property of the tractrix is constancy of the distance between a point {{mvar|P}} on the curve and the intersection of the [[tangent line]] at {{mvar|P}} with the [[asymptote]] of the curve.
 
The tractrix might be regarded in a multitude of ways:
 
# It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the center of a hyperbolic spiral rolling (without skidding) on a straight line.
# The [[involute]] of the [[catenary]] function, which describes a fully flexible, [[elastomer|inelastic]], homogeneous string attached to two points that is subjected to a gravitational field. The catenary has the equation {{math|1=''y''(''x'') = ''a'' cosh {{sfrac|''x''|''a''}}}}.
#The trajectory determined by the middle of the back axle of a car pulled by a rope at a constant speed and with a constant direction (initially perpendicular to the vehicle). 
[[Image:Tractrixtry.gif|thumb|500px|right|Tractrix by dragging a pole.]]
The function admits a horizontal asymptote. The curve is symmetrical with respect to the {{mvar|y}}-axis. The curvature radius is {{math|1=''r'' = ''a'' cot {{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}.

A great implication that the tractrix had was the study of the revolution surface of it around its asymptote: the [[pseudosphere]]. Studied by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} as a surface of constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]], the pseudosphere is a local model of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. The idea was carried further by Kasner and Newman in their book ''Mathematics and the Imagination'',{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} where they show a [[toy train]] dragging a [[pocket watch]] to generate the tractrix.

==Properties==
[[Image:Evolute2.gif|thumb|500px|right|Catenary as [[evolute]] of a tractrix]]
&lt;!-- [[Image:Involute.gif|thumb|500px|right|Tractrix as [[evolute]] of a catenary]] --&gt;
* Due to the geometrical way it was defined, the tractrix has the property that the segment of its [[tangent]], between the [[asymptote]] and the point of tangency, has constant length {{mvar|a}}.
* The [[arc length]] of one branch between {{math|1=''x'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1=''x'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|''a'' ln {{sfrac|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}.
* The area between the tractrix and its asymptote is {{math|{{sfrac|π''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}} which can be found using [[integral|integration]] or [[Mamikon's theorem]].
* The [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the [[surface normal|normal]]s of the tractrix (that is,  the [[evolute]] of the tractrix) is the [[catenary]] (or ''chain curve'') given by {{math|1=''y'' = ''a'' cosh {{sfrac|''x''|''a''}}}}.
* The surface of revolution created by revolving a tractrix about its asymptote is a [[pseudosphere]].

==Practical application==
In 1927, P.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;H. Voigt patented a [[horn loudspeaker]] design based on the assumption that a wave front traveling through the horn is spherical of a constant radius. The idea is to minimize distortion caused by internal reflection of sound within the horn. The resulting shape is the surface of revolution of a tractrix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volvotreter.de/downloads/Dinsdale_Horns_1.pdf Horn loudspeaker design pp. 4–5. (Reprinted from Wireless World, March 1974)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important application is in the forming technology for sheet metal. In particular a tractrix profile is used for the corner of the die on which the sheet metal is bent during deep drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Metal Forming|last = Lange|first = Kurt|publisher = McGraw Hill Book Company|year = 1985|isbn = |location = |pages = 20.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[toothed belt]]-pulley design provides improved efficiency for mechanical power transmission using a tractix catenary shape for its teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gates.com/~/media/files/gates/industrial/power-transmission/manuals/powergripdrivedesignmanual_17195_2014.pdf|title=Gates Powergrip GT3 Drive Design Manual|date=2014|accessdate=17 November 2017|website=Gates Corporation|quote=The GT tooth profile is based on the tractix mathematical function. Engineering handbooks describe this function as a “frictionless” system. This early development by Schiele is described as an involute form of a catenary.|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This shape minimizes the friction of the belt teeth engaging the pulley, because the moving teeth engage and disengage with minimal sliding contact.  Original timing belt designs used simpler trapezoidal or circular tooth shapes, which cause significant sliding and friction.

==Drawing machines==
* In October–November 1692, Christiaan Huygens described three tractrix-drawing machines.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* In 1693 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] devised a "universal tractional machine" which, in theory, could integrate any differential equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Logic to Practice: Italian Studies in the Philosophy of Mathematics|quote=... mechanical devices studied ... to solve particular differential equations ... We must recollect Leibniz's 'universal tractional machine'|first=Pietro|last=Milici|editor-first=Gabriele|editor-last=Lolli|publisher=Springer|date=2014|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was an analog computing mechanism implementing the tractional principle.  The device was impractical to build with the technology of Leibniz's time, and was never realized.
* In 1706 [[John Perks]] built a tractional machine in order to realise the [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] quadrature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perks|first1=John|title=The construction and properties of a new quadratrix to the hyperbola|journal=Philosophical Transactions|date=1706|volume=25|pages=2253–2262|jstor=102681}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1729 [[Johann Poleni]] built a tractional device that enabled [[logarithm]]ic [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s to be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poleni|first1=John|title=Epistolarum mathematicanim fasciculus|date=1729|page=letter no. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A history of all these machines can be seen in an article by [[H. J. M. Bos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bos|first1=H.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;M.|title=Recognition and Wonder – Huygens, Tractional Motion and Some Thoughts on the History of Mathematics|url=http://www.gewina.nl/journals/tractrix/bos89.pdf|journal= Euclides|volume= 63 |date=1989 |page=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10350">In [[set theory]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is called '''transitive''' if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:
* whenever ''x'' ∈ ''A'', and ''y'' ∈ ''x'', then ''y'' ∈ ''A''.
* whenever ''x'' ∈ ''A'', and ''x'' is not an [[urelement]], then ''x'' is a [[subset]] of ''A''.
Similarly, a [[class (set theory)|class]] ''M'' is transitive if every element of ''M'' is a subset of ''M''.

== Examples ==
Using the definition of [[ordinal number]]s suggested by [[John von Neumann]], ordinal numbers are defined as [[hereditary property|hereditarily]] transitive sets: an ordinal number is a transitive set whose members are also transitive (and thus ordinals). The class of all ordinals is a transitive class.

Any of the stages ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; leading to the construction of the [[von Neumann universe]] ''V'' and [[Gödel's constructible universe]] ''L'' are transitive sets. The [[universe (mathematics)|universe]]s ''L'' and ''V'' themselves are transitive classes.

This is a complete list of all finite transitive sets with up to 20 brackets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of rooted identity trees with n nodes (rooted trees whose automorphism group is the identity group).|url=https://oeis.org/A004111|website=OEIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
A set ''X'' is transitive if and only if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup X \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all elements of ''X'' that are sets, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup X = \{y \mid (\exists x \in X) y \in x\}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''X'' is transitive, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup X&lt;/math&gt; is transitive. If ''X'' and ''Y'' are transitive, then ''X''&amp;cup;''Y''&amp;cup;{''X'',''Y''} is transitive. In general, if ''X'' is a class all of whose elements are transitive sets, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X \cup \bigcup X&lt;/math&gt; is transitive.

A set ''X'' which does not contain urelements is transitive if and only if it is a subset of its own [[power set]], &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X \subset \mathcal{P}(X).&lt;/math&gt; The power set of a transitive set without urelements is transitive.

== Transitive closure ==
The '''transitive closure''' of a set ''X'' is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) transitive set which contains ''X''.  Suppose one is given a set ''X'', then the transitive closure of ''X'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{TC}(X) = \bigcup \left\{ X,\; \bigcup X,\; \bigcup\bigcup X,\; \bigcup\bigcup\bigcup X,\; \bigcup\bigcup\bigcup\bigcup X, \ldots\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proof. Denote &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_0 = X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_{n+1} = \bigcup X_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then we claim that the set 
:&lt;math&gt;T = \operatorname{TC}(X) = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty X_n&lt;/math&gt;

is transitive, and whenever &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is a transitive set containing &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T \subseteq T_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y \in x \in T&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x \in X_n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y \in \bigcup X_n = X_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_{n+1} \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y \in T&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is transitive.

Now let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; be as above. We prove by induction that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_n \subseteq T_1 \ \forall n&lt;/math&gt; thus proving that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T \subseteq T_1&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_0 = X \subseteq T_1&lt;/math&gt; we have a base. Now assume &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_n \subseteq T_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_{n+1} = \bigcup X_n \subseteq \bigcup T_1&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is transitive so &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup T_1 \subseteq T_1&lt;/math&gt; whence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_{n+1} \subseteq T_1&lt;/math&gt;. Done.

Note that this is the set of all of the objects related to ''X'' by the [[transitive closure]] of the membership relation.

==Transitive models of set theory==
Transitive classes are often used for construction of [[relative interpretation|interpretation]]s of set theory in itself, usually called [[inner model]]s. The reason is that properties defined by [[bounded quantifier|bounded formulas]] are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] for transitive classes.

A transitive set (or class) that is a model of a [[theory (mathematical logic)|formal system]] of set theory is called a '''transitive model''' of the system (provided that the element relation of the model is the restriction of the true element relation to the universe of the model). Transitivity is an important factor in determining the absoluteness of formulas.

In the superstructure approach to [[non-standard analysis]], the non-standard universes satisfy strong transitivity.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt (1998) p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]], a '''universal vertex''' is a [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] of an [[undirected graph]] that is adjacent to all other vertices of the graph. It may also be called a '''dominating vertex''', as it forms a one-element [[dominating set]] in the graph.

A graph that contains a universal vertex may be called a '''cone'''. In this context, the universal vertex may also be called the '''apex''' of the cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==In special families of graphs==
The [[Star (graph theory)|stars]] are exactly the [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] that have a universal vertex, and may be constructed by adding a universal vertex to an [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]]. The [[wheel graph]]s, similarly, may be formed by adding a universal vertex to a [[cycle graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[trivially perfect graph]]s (the [[comparability graph]]s of [[Tree (set theory)|order-theoretic trees]]) always contain a universal vertex, the root of the tree, and more strongly they may be characterized as the graphs in which every connected [[induced subgraph]] contains a universal vertex.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The connected [[threshold graph]]s form a subclass of the trivially perfect graphs, so they also contain a universal vertex; they may be defined as the graphs that can be formed by repeated addition of either a universal vertex or an isolated vertex (one with no incident edges).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Every graph with a universal vertex is a [[dismantlable graph]], and almost all dismantlable graphs have a universal vertex.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Other properties==
In a graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices, a universal vertex is a vertex whose [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] is exactly {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}}. Therefore, like the [[split graph]]s, graphs with a universal vertex can be recognized purely by their [[degree sequence]]s, without looking at the structure of the graph.

{{Trigonometry}}
[[File:STS-114 Steve Robinson on Canadarm2.jpg|thumb|236px|The [[Canadarm2]] robotic manipulator on the [[International Space Station]] is operated by controlling the angles of its joints. Calculating the final position of the astronaut at the end of the arm requires repeated use of trigonometric functions of those angles.]]

Amongst the lay public of non-mathematicians and non-scientists, [[trigonometry]] is known chiefly for its application to measurement problems, yet is also often used in ways that are far more subtle, such as its place in the [[music theory|theory of music]]; still other uses are more technical, such as in [[number theory]]. The mathematical topics of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transforms]] rely heavily on knowledge of trigonometric functions and find application in a number of areas, including [[statistics]].

==Thomas Paine's statement==

In Chapter XI of [[The Age of Reason]], the American revolutionary and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinker [[Thomas Paine]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Reason |first1=Paine |last1=Thomas |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2004 |isbn= |page=52 |url=http://manybooks.net/pages/painethoetext03twtp410/51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:''The scientific principles that man employs to obtain the foreknowledge of an eclipse, or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are contained chiefly in that part of science that is called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies, is called astronomy; when applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a ruler and compass, it is called geometry; when applied to the construction of plans of edifices, it is called architecture; when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth, it is called land-surveying. In fine, it is the soul of science. It is an eternal truth: it contains the ''mathematical demonstration'' of which man speaks, and the extent of its uses are unknown.

==Historical use for multiplication==

For the 25 years preceding the invention of the [[logarithm]] in 1614, [[prosthaphaeresis]] was the only known generally applicable way of approximating products quickly. It used the identities for the trigonometric functions of sums and differences of angles in terms of the products of trigonometric functions of those angles.

==Some modern uses==

Scientific fields that make use of trigonometry include:

:[[acoustics]], [[architecture]], [[astronomy]], [[cartography]], [[civil engineering]], [[geophysics]], [[crystallography]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], land [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], many [[physical science]]s, [[mechanical engineering]], [[machining]], [[medical imaging]], [[number theory]], [[oceanography]], [[optics]], [[pharmacology]], [[probability theory]], [[seismology]], [[statistics]], and [[visual perception]]

That these fields involve trigonometry does not mean knowledge of trigonometry is needed in order to learn anything about them. It ''does'' mean that ''some'' things in these fields cannot be understood without trigonometry. For example, a professor of [[music]] may perhaps know nothing of mathematics, but would probably know that [[Pythagoras]] was the earliest known contributor to the mathematical theory of music.

In ''some'' of the fields of endeavor listed above it is easy to imagine how trigonometry could be used. For example, in navigation and land surveying, the occasions for the use of trigonometry are in at least some cases simple enough that they can be described in a beginning trigonometry textbook. In the case of music theory, the application of trigonometry is related to work begun by Pythagoras, who observed that the sounds made by plucking two strings of different lengths are consonant if both lengths are small integer multiples of a common length. The resemblance between the shape of a vibrating string and the graph of the [[sine]] function is no mere coincidence. In oceanography, the resemblance between the shapes of some [[wave]]s and the graph of the sine function is also not coincidental. In some other fields, among them [[climatology]], biology, and economics, there are seasonal periodicities. The study of these often involves the periodic nature of the sine and cosine function.

===Fourier series===

Many fields make use of trigonometry in more advanced ways than can be discussed in a single article. Often those involve what are called [[Fourier series]], after the 18th- and 19th-century French mathematician and physicist [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Joseph Fourier]]. Fourier series have a surprisingly diverse array of applications in many scientific fields, in particular in all of the phenomena involving seasonal periodicities mentioned above, and in wave motion, and hence in the study of radiation, of acoustics, of seismology, of modulation of radio waves in electronics, and of electric power engineering.

A Fourier series is a sum of this form:

: &lt;math&gt; \square + \underbrace{\square \cos\theta + \square\sin\theta}_1 + \underbrace{\square \cos(2\theta) + \square\sin(2\theta)}_2 + \underbrace{\square \cos(3\theta) + \square\sin(3\theta)}_3 + \cdots \, &lt;/math&gt;

where each of the squares (&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;) is a different number, and one is adding infinitely many terms. Fourier used these for studying [[heat]] flow and [[diffusion]] (diffusion is the process whereby, when you drop a sugar cube into a gallon of water, the sugar gradually spreads through the water, or a pollutant spreads through the air, or any dissolved substance spreads through any fluid).

Fourier series are also applicable to subjects whose connection with wave motion is far from obvious. One ubiquitous example is [[data compression|digital compression]] whereby [[image compression|images]], [[audio compression (data)|audio]] and [[video compression|video]] data are compressed into a much smaller size which makes their transmission feasible over [[telephone]], [[internet]] and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[computer network|networks]]. Another example, mentioned above, is diffusion. Among others are: the [[geometry of numbers]], [[isoperimetry|isoperimetric problems]], recurrence of [[random walk]]s, [[quadratic reciprocity]], the [[central limit theorem]], [[Heisenberg's inequality]].

===Fourier transforms===

A more abstract concept than Fourier series is the idea of [[Fourier transform]]. Fourier transforms involve [[integral]]s rather than sums, and are used in a similarly diverse array of scientific fields. Many natural laws are expressed by relating ''rates of change'' of quantities to the quantities themselves. For example: The rate of change of population is sometimes jointly proportional to (1) the present population and (2) the amount by which the present population falls short of the [[carrying capacity]]. This kind of relationship is called a [[differential equation]]. If, given this information, one tries to express population as a function of time, one is trying to "solve" the differential equation. Fourier transforms may be used to convert some differential equations to algebraic equations for which methods of solving them are known. Fourier transforms have many uses. In almost any scientific context in which the words spectrum, [[harmonic]], or [[resonance]] are encountered, Fourier transforms or Fourier series are nearby.

===Statistics, including mathematical psychology===

Intelligence quotients are sometimes held to be distributed according to the [[normal distribution|bell-shaped curve]]. About 40% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 100 to 120; correspondingly, about 40% of the population scores between 100 and 120 on IQ tests. Nearly 9% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 120 to 140; correspondingly, about 9% of the population scores between 120 and 140 on IQ tests, etc. Similarly many other things are distributed according to the "bell-shaped curve", including measurement errors in many physical measurements. Why the ubiquity of the "bell-shaped curve"? There is a theoretical reason for this, and it involves Fourier transforms and hence [[trigonometric function]]s. That is one of a variety of applications of Fourier transforms to [[statistics]].

Trigonometric functions are also applied when statisticians study seasonal periodicities, which are often represented by Fourier series.

===Number theory===
There is a hint of a connection between trigonometry and number theory. Loosely speaking, one could say that number theory deals with qualitative properties rather than quantitative properties of numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{42}, \qquad \frac{2}{42}, \qquad \frac{3}{42}, \qquad
\dots\dots, \qquad \frac{39}{42}, \qquad \frac{40}{42}, \qquad
\frac{41}{42}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Discard the ones that are not in lowest terms; keep only those that are in lowest terms:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{42}, \qquad \frac{5}{42}, \qquad \frac{11}{42}, \qquad
\dots, \qquad \frac{31}{42}, \qquad \frac{37}{42}, \qquad
\frac{41}{42}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then bring in trigonometry:

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos\left(2\pi\cdot\frac{1}{42}\right)+
\cos\left(2\pi\cdot\frac{5}{42}\right)+
\cdots+
\cos\left(2\pi\cdot\frac{37}{42}\right)+
\cos\left(2\pi\cdot\frac{41}{42}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the sum is −1, because 42 has an ''odd'' number of prime factors and none of them is repeated: 42 = 2 × 3 × 7. (If there had been an ''even'' number of non-repeated factors then the sum would have been 1; if there had been any repeated prime factors (e.g., 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5) then the sum would have been 0; the sum is the [[Möbius function]] evaluated at 42.) This hints at the possibility of applying [[Fourier analysis]] to number theory.

===Solving non-trigonometric equations===

Various types of [[equation]]s can be solved using trigonometry.

For example, a [[linear difference equation]] or [[linear differential equation]] with constant coefficients has solutions expressed in terms of the [[eigenvalue]]s of its characteristic equation; if some of the eigenvalues are [[Complex number|complex]], the complex terms can be replaced by trigonometric functions of real terms, showing that the dynamic variable exhibits [[oscillations]].

Similarly, [[Cubic function#Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions|cubic equations]] with three real solutions have an [[algebraic solution]] that is unhelpful in that it contains cube roots of complex numbers; again an alternative solution exists in terms of trigonometric functions of real terms.

'''Worker's compensation''' in Germany is a national, compulsory program that insures workers for injuries or illness incurred through their employment, or the [[Commuting|commute]] to or from their employment.  Wage earners, apprentices, family helpers and students including children in kindergarten are covered by this program.  Almost all self-employed persons can voluntarily become insured.&lt;ref name ="gov-bc"&gt;http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/rcwc/research/perrin-thorau-germany.pdf, Government of British Columbia, Comparative Review of Workers’ Compensation Systems in Select Jurisdictions, Germany, Retrieved September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The German [[worker's compensation]] laws were the first of their kind.

==History of workers compensation law in Germany==

The Sickness Bill became law in 1883 and the Accident Bill in 1884. [[Otto Von Bismarck]], Chancellor of the German Empire, introduced the programs to assist workers in the event of accidental injury, illness or old age.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;   This initial system was financed by workers and employers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awcbc.org/en/historyofworkerscompensation.asp, Association of Workers Compensation Boards of Canada, History of Worker's Compensation, Retrieved, September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Sickness Insurance law paid [[indemnity]] for up to 13 weeks. The first 4 weeks were at 50% of prior wages, from the fifth week on the benefit was 66.7% of previous earnings. Workers who were completely [[disabled]] received benefits at 67% after the 13 week, financed entirely by employers. If the disabled person required constant care, then up to 100% of previous wages were awarded.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;

The German compensation system was used as a model for many other nation's worker's compensation programs.

==The modern compensation system in Germany==

Today, in Germany, every worker is a member of a related Workers Compensation Institute (''Berufsgenossenschaft'') and almost all self-employed persons can voluntarily become insured members of an institute as well. The institutes have an approximately 90% return-to-work rate, using vocational retraining and upgraded vocational qualifications as key strategies.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;

All accidents in the workplace - or in the [[Commuting|commute]] to and from it - are covered. 67 diseases are considered occupational diseases and are also covered by the program.

The workers' compensation program is funded by employers (except for the government's coverage
for students and children and a government subsidy to the Agricultural Accident Fund). The average employer contribution (1996) was 1.42% of payroll.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;

An injured worker has a right to appeal to the committee of their Institute. The next level of appeal after this committee is to a [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Specialized_courts|''Sozialgericht'']] court.  The institute must cover the costs of the appeal process, so there are no costs to the worker.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;

===Benefits===

Disability benefits are paid as a weekly "wage loss” compensation. Workers unable to perform their current job due to injury or illness receive periodic payments of 80% of their prior gross earnings until returning to work (up to a maximum total payment).  If rehabilitation is prognosticated to be impossible the worker receives the benefit for 78 weeks.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;

Wages are paid for six weeks by the employer before the employee goes onto short-term disability benefits.

Workers who have a loss of earning capacity due to work injury or occupational disease of 20% or more receive a pension equal to 66.7% of their previous year's earnings, up to the specified maximum. This is paid until the age of 65, unless he or she begins receiving [[old-age pension]] earlier than age 65.

Medical care benefits are comprehensive, with the total cost of physical rehabilitation and appliances being covered. Institutes provide all medical care benefits. The Institutes control the choice of doctor and hospital.&lt;ref name="gov-bc" /&gt;
