      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1145">In mathematics, a '''categorical ring''' is, roughly, a [[category (mathematics)|category]] equipped with addition and multiplication. In other words, a categorical ring is obtained by replacing the underlying set of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] by a category. For example, given a ring ''R'', let ''C'' be a category whose objects are the elements of the set ''R'' and where morphisms are only the identity morphisms. Then ''C'' is a categorical ring. But the point is that one can also consider the situation in which an element of ''R'' comes with a "nontrivial automorphism" (cf. Lurie).

This line of generalization of a ring eventually leads to the notion of an [[En ring|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-ring]].

'''25''' ('''twenty-five''') is the [[natural number]] following [[24 (number)|24]] and preceding [[26 (number)|26]].

==In mathematics==
[[File:25.svg|thumb|25 is a square]]

It is a [[square number]], being [[5 (number)|5]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5 &amp;times; 5. It is one of two two-digit numbers whose square and higher powers of the number also ends in the same last two digits, e.g. 25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 625, the other is [[76 (number)|76]]. It is the smallest square that is also a sum of two (non-zero) squares: 25 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence it often appears in illustrations of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

25 is the sum of the single-digit odd natural numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, the first five odd natural numbers.

25 is a [[centered octagonal number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016754|title=Sloane's A016754 : Odd squares: a(n) = (2n+1)^2. Also centered octagonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[centered square number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001844|title=Sloane's A001844 : Centered square numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[automorphic number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A003226|title=Sloane's A003226 : Automorphic numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

25 percent (%) is equal to {{sfrac|4}}.

It is the smallest [[base 10]] [[Friedman number]] as it can be expressed by its own digits: 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A036057|title=Sloane's A036057 : Friedman numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a [[Cullen number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002064|title=Sloane's A002064 : Cullen numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 is the smallest [[pseudoprime]] satisfying the congruence 7&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 7 mod ''n''.

25 is the smallest [[aspiring number]] &amp;mdash; a composite non-[[sociable number]] whose [[aliquot sequence]] does not terminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A063769|title=Sloane's A063769 : Aspiring numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Shapiro inequality]], 25 is the least odd integer ''n'' such that there exist ''x''{{sub|1}}, ''x''{{sub|2}}, …, ''x''{{sub|''n''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}+x_{i+2}} &lt; \frac{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''{{sub|''n'' + 1}} = ''x''{{sub|1}}, ''x''{{sub|''n'' + 2}} = ''x''{{sub|2}}.

Within base 10 one can readily test for divisibility by 25 by seeing if the last two digits of the number match 00, 25, 50 or 75.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">:''This article is about the curvature of affine plane curves, not to be confused with the [[curvature]] of an [[affine connection]].''
'''Special affine curvature''', also known as the '''equi-affine curvature''' or '''affine curvature''', is a particular type of [[curvature]] that is defined on a plane [[curve]] that remains unchanged under a [[special affine group|special affine transformation]] (an [[affine transformation]] that preserves [[area]]).  The curves of constant equi-affine curvature ''k'' are precisely all non-singular [[conic section|plane conics]].  Those with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 are [[ellipse]]s, those with ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 are [[parabola]]s, and those with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 are [[hyperbola]]s.

The usual Euclidean curvature of a curve at a point is the curvature of its [[osculating circle]], the unique circle making second order contact (having three point contact) with the curve at the point. In the same way, 
the special affine curvature of a  curve at a point ''P'' is the special affine curvature of its '''hyperosculating conic''', which is the unique conic making fourth order [[contact (mathematics)|contact]] (having five point contact) with the curve at ''P''. In other words it is the
limiting position of the (unique) conic through ''P'' and four points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on the curve, as each of the points approaches ''P'':

:&lt;math&gt;P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4\to P.&lt;/math&gt;

In some contexts, the '''affine curvature''' refers to a differential invariant κ of the [[affine group|general affine group]], which may readily obtained from the special affine curvature ''k'' by κ = ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−3/2&lt;/sup&gt;d''k''/d''s'', where ''s'' is the special affine arc length.  Where the general affine group is not used, the special affine curvature ''k'' is sometimes also called the affine curvature {{harv|Shirokov|2001b}}.

==Formal definition==

===Special affine arclength===
To define the special affine curvature, it is necessary first to define the '''special affine arclength''' (also called the '''equi-affine arclength''').  Consider an affine plane curve &lt;math&gt;\beta (t)&lt;/math&gt;. Choose co-ordinates for the affine plane such that the area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors &lt;math&gt;a = (a_1, \; a_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = (b_1, \; b_2)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\det\left[ a\; b \right] = a_{1} b_{2} - a_{2} b_{1}.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the determinant
:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{dt} &amp; \frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
is a well-defined invariant of the special affine group, and gives the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by the velocity and acceleration of the curve β.  Consider a reparameterization of the curve β, say with a new parameter ''s'' related to ''t'' by means of a regular reparameterization ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''(''t'').  This determinant undergoes then a transformation of the following sort, by the [[chain rule]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{dt} &amp; \frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2}\end{bmatrix} &amp;= \det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt} &amp; \left(\frac{d^2\beta}{ds^2}\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2+\frac{d\beta}{ds}\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}\right)\end{bmatrix}\\
&amp;=\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^3\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{ds} &amp; \frac{d^2\beta}{ds^2}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The reparameterization can be chosen so that
:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{ds} &amp; \frac{d^2\beta}{ds^2}\end{bmatrix} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
provided the velocity and acceleration, dβ/d''t'' and d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;β/d''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are [[linearly independent]].  Existence and uniqueness of such a parameterization follows by integration:
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = \int_a^t\sqrt[3]{\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{dt} &amp; \frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2}\end{bmatrix}}\,\,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

This integral is called the '''special affine arclength''', and a curve carrying this parameterization is said to be parameterized with respect to its special affine arclength.

===Special affine curvature===
Suppose that β(''s'') is a curve parameterized with its special affine arclength.  Then the '''special affine curvature''' (or '''equi-affine curvature''') is given by

:&lt;math&gt;k(s) = \det\begin{bmatrix}\beta''(s) &amp; \beta'''(s) \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here β′ denotes the derivative of β with respect to ''s''.

More generally ({{harvnb|Guggenheimer|1977|loc=§7.3}}; {{harvnb|Blaschke|1923|loc=§5}}), for a plane curve with arbitrary parameterization

:&lt;math&gt;t \mapsto (x(t), y(t)),&lt;/math&gt;

the special affine curvature is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
k(t)&amp;=\frac{x''y'''-x'''y''}{(x'y''-x''y')^{5/3}}-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{1}{(x'y''-x''y')^{2/3}}\right]''\\
&amp;= \frac{4(x''y'''-x'''y'')+(x'y''''-x''''y')}{3(x'y''-x''y')^{5/3}} -\frac{5}{9}\frac{(x'y'''-x'''y')^2}{(x'y''-x''y')^{8/3}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

provided the first and second derivatives of the curve are linearly independent.  In the special case of a graph ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''(''x''), these formulas reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;k=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{(y'')^{2/3}}\right)''=\frac{1}{3}\frac{y''''}{(y'')^{5/3}}-\frac{5}{9}\frac{(y''')^2}{(y'')^{8/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to ''x'' ({{harvnb|Blaschke|1923|loc=§5}}; {{harvnb|Shirokov|2001a}}).

===Affine curvature===
Suppose as above that β(''s'') is a curve parameterized by special affine arclength.  There are a pair of invariants of the curve that are invariant under the full general affine group {{harv|Shirokov|2001b}} — the group of all affine motions of the plane, not just those that are area-preserving.  The first of these is

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \sqrt{k(s)}\, ds,&lt;/math&gt;

sometimes called the ''affine arclength'' (although this risks confusion with the special affine arclength described above).  The second is referred to as the ''affine curvature'':

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{1}{k^{3/2}} \frac{dk}{ds}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Conics==
Suppose that β(''s'') is a curve parameterized by special affine arclength with constant affine curvature ''k''.  Let

:&lt;math&gt;C_\beta(s) = \begin{bmatrix}\beta'(s) &amp; \beta''(s)\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that det ''C''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;, since β is assumed to carry the special affine arclength parameterization, and that

:&lt;math&gt;k = \det(C_\beta').\,&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the form of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;C_\beta' = C_\beta\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-k\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

By applying a suitable special affine transformation, we can arrange that ''C''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''I'' is the identity matrix.  Since ''k'' is constant, it follows that ''C''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the [[matrix exponential]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C_\beta(s) &amp;= \exp\left\{s\cdot\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-k\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}\right\}\\
&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\sqrt{k}s&amp;\sqrt{k}\sin\sqrt{k}s\\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\sin\sqrt{k}s&amp;\cos\sqrt{k}s\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The three cases are now as follows.

;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0

If the curvature vanishes identically, then upon passing to a limit,

:&lt;math&gt;C_\beta(s) = \begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\s&amp;1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so β'(''s'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,s), and so integration gives

:&lt;math&gt;\beta(s)=(s,s^2/2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

up to an overall constant translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the parabola ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2.

;''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0

If the special affine curvature is positive, then it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\beta'(s) = \left(\cos\sqrt{k}s,\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\sin\sqrt{k}s\right)&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\beta(s) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\sin\sqrt{k}s, -\frac{1}{k}\cos\sqrt{k}s\right)&lt;/math&gt;

up to a translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the ellipse ''kx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0

If ''k'' is negative, then the trigonometric functions in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; give way to [[hyperbolic function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\beta(s) =\begin{bmatrix}\cosh\sqrt{|k|}s&amp;\sqrt{|k|}\sinh\sqrt{|k|}s\\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{|k|}}\sinh\sqrt{|k|}s&amp;\cosh\sqrt{|k|}s\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\beta(s) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{|k|}}\sinh\sqrt{|k|}s,\frac{1}{|k|}\cosh\sqrt{|k|}s\right)&lt;/math&gt;

up to a translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the hyperbola

:&lt;math&gt;-|k|x^2 + |k|^2y^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Characterization up to affine congruence==
The special affine curvature of an immersed curve is the only (local) invariant of the curve in the following sense:

*If two curves have the same special affine curvature at every point, then one curve is obtained from the other by means of a special affine transformation.

In fact, a slightly stronger statement holds:

*Given any continuous function ''k''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', there exists a curve β whose first and second derivatives are linearly independent, such that the special affine curvature of β relative to the special affine parameterization is equal to the given function ''k''.  The curve β is uniquely determined up to a special affine transformation.

This is analogous to the fundamental theorem of curves in the classical Euclidean [[differential geometry of curves]], in which the complete classification of plane curves up to Euclidean motion depends on a single function κ, the curvature of the curve.  It follows essentially by applying the [[Picard&amp;ndash;Lindelöf theorem]] to the system

:&lt;math&gt;C_\beta' = C_\beta\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-k\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[β′&amp;nbsp;β′′].  An alternative approach, rooted in the theory of [[moving frame]]s, is to apply the existence of a primitive for the [[Darboux derivative]].

==Derivation of the curvature by affine invariance==
The special affine curvature can be derived explicitly by techniques of [[invariant theory]].  For simplicity, suppose that an affine plane curve is given in the form of a graph ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''(''x'').  The special affine group acts on the Cartesian plane via transformations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;\mapsto ax+by + \alpha\\
y&amp;\mapsto cx+dy + \beta,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
with ''ad''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''bc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  The following [[vector field]]s span the [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal generators of the special affine group:

:&lt;math&gt;T_1 = \partial_x, \quad T_2 = \partial_y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X_1 = x\partial_y, \quad X_2 = y\partial_x, \quad H=x\partial_x - y\partial_y.&lt;/math&gt;

An affine transformation not only acts on points, but also on the tangent lines to graphs of the form ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''(''x'').  That is, there is an action of the special affine group on triples of coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;(x,y,y').\,&lt;/math&gt;

The group action is generated by vector fields
:&lt;math&gt;T_1^{(1)},T_2^{(1)},X_1^{(1)},X_2^{(1)},H^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;
defined on the space of three variables (''x'',''y'',''y''′).  These vector fields can be determined by the following two requirements:
* Under the projection onto the ''xy''-plane, they must to project to the corresponding original generators of the action &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2,X_1,X_2,H&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
* The vectors must preserve up to scale the [[contact structure]] of the [[jet (mathematics)|jet space]]
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_1 = dy - y'dx.&lt;/math&gt;
:Concretely, this means that the generators ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; must satisfy
::&lt;math&gt;L_{X^{(1)}}\theta_1 \equiv 0 \pmod{\theta_1}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''L'' is the [[Lie derivative]].

Similarly, the action of the group can be extended to the space of any number of derivatives
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y,y',y'',\dots,y^{(k)}).&lt;/math&gt;
The prolonged vector fields generating the action of the special affine group must then inductively satisfy, for each generator ''X''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''H''}:
* The projection of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(k)&lt;/sup&gt; onto the space of variables (''x'',''y'',''y''′,…,''y''&lt;sup&gt;(''k''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;) is ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''k''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; preserves the contact ideal:
::&lt;math&gt;L_{X^{(k)}}\theta_k \equiv 0 \pmod{\theta_1,\dots, \theta_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_i = dy^{(i-1)} - y^{(i)}dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Carrying out the inductive construction up to order 4 gives

:&lt;math&gt;T_1^{(4)} = \partial_x, \quad T_2^{(4)} = \partial_y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X_1^{(4)} = x\partial_y + \partial_{y'}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}X_2^{(4)} = y\partial_x&amp;-y'^2\partial_{y'}-3y'y''\partial_{y''}-(3y''^2+4y'y''')\partial_{y'''}\\
&amp;-(10y''y'''+5y'y'''')\partial_{y''''}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^{(4)} = x\partial_x - y\partial_y - 2y'\partial_{y'} - 3y''\partial_{y''}-4y'''\partial_{y'''}-5y''''\partial_{y''''}.&lt;/math&gt;

The special affine curvature
:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{1}{3}\frac{y''''}{(y'')^{5/3}}-\frac{5}{9}\frac{(y''')^2}{(y'')^{8/3}}&lt;/math&gt;
does not depend explicitly on ''x'', ''y'', or ''y''′, and so satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;T_1^{(4)}k=T_2^{(4)}k=X_1^{(4)}k=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The vector field ''H'' acts diagonally as a modified [[homogeneity operator]], and it is readily verified that ''H''&lt;sup&gt;(4)&lt;/sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Finally,
:&lt;math&gt;X_2^{(4)}k = \frac{1}{2}[H,X 1]^{(4)}k = \frac{1}{2}[H^{(4)},X 1^{(4)}]k = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The five vector fields
:&lt;math&gt;T_1^{(4)},T_2^{(4)},X_1^{(4)},X_2^{(4)},H^{(4)}&lt;/math&gt;
form an involutive distribution on (an open subset of) '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; so that, by the [[Frobenius integration theorem]], they integrate locally to give a foliation of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; by five-dimensional leaves.  Concretely, each leaf is a local orbit of the special affine group.  The function ''k'' parameterizes these leaves.

The '''arithmetization of analysis''' was a research program in the [[foundations of mathematics]] carried out in the second half of the 19th century. 

==History==
Kronecker originally introduced the term ''arithmetization of analysis'', by which he meant its constructivization in the context of the natural numbers (see quotation at bottom of page).  The meaning of the term later shifted to signify the set-theoretic construction of the real line.   Its main proponent was [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], who argued the geometric foundations of [[calculus]] were not solid enough for rigorous work. 

==Research program==
The highlights of this research program are:
* the various (but equivalent) [[Construction of the real numbers|constructions]] of the [[real number]]s by [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] and [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] resulting in the modern axiomatic definition of the real number field;
* the epsilon-delta definition of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]; and
* the [[naive set theory|naïve set-theoretic]] definition of [[function (mathematics)|function]].

==Legacy==
An important spinoff of the arithmetization of analysis is [[set theory]]. Naive set theory was created by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] and others  after arithmetization was completed as a way to study the singularities of functions appearing in calculus. 

The arithmetization of analysis had several important consequences:
* the widely held belief in the banishment of [[infinitesimal]]s from mathematics until the creation of [[non-standard analysis]] by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s, whereas in reality the work on non-Archimedean systems continued unabated, as documented by P. Ehrlich;
* the shift of the emphasis from [[geometry|geometric]] to [[algebra]]ic reasoning: this has had important consequences in the way mathematics is taught today;
* it made possible the development of modern [[measure theory]] by [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] and the rudiments of [[functional analysis]] by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]; 
* it motivated the currently prevalent philosophical position that all of mathematics should be derivable from logic and set theory, ultimately leading to [[Hilbert's program]], [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s theorems and [[non-standard analysis]].

==Quotations==
* "God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man." &amp;mdash; [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">'''Carl Anton Bretschneider''' (27 May 1808 – 6 November 1878) was a mathematician from [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], Germany. Bretschneider worked in [[geometry]], [[number theory]], and [[history of geometry]]. He also worked on [[logarithmic integral]]s and [[mathematical table]]s. He was one of the first mathematicians to use the symbol γ for [[Euler's constant]] when he published his 1837 paper. He is best known for his discovery of [[Bretschneider's formula]].

The '''Chinese remainder theorem''' is a theorem of [[number theory]], which states that if one knows the remainders of the [[Euclidean division]] of an [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of {{math|''n''}} by the product of these integers, under the condition that the [[divisor]]s are [[pairwise coprime]].

The earliest known statement of the theorem is by the Chinese mathematician Sunzi in ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' in the 3rd century AD.

The Chinese remainder theorem is widely used for computing with large integers, as it allows replacing a computation for which one knows a bound on the size of the result by several similar computations on small integers.

The Chinese remainder theorem (expressed in terms of [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence relation|congruence]]s) is true over every [[principal ideal domain]]. It has been generalized to any [[commutative ring]], with a formulation involving [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].

==History==
The earliest known statement of the theorem, as a problem with specific numbers, appears in the 3rd-century book ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' by the Chinese mathematician Sunzi:&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1998|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|The Chinese remainder theorem appears in [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''.&lt;ref name="Gauss1801.loc=32-36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gauss|Clarke|1986|loc=Art. 32–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The notion of congruences was first introduced and used by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in his ''Disquisitiones Arithmeticae'' of 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss illustrates the Chinese remainder theorem on a problem involving calendars, namely, "to find the years that have a certain period number with respect to the solar and lunar cycle and the Roman indiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ore|1988|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss introduces a procedure for solving the problem that had already been used by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] but was in fact an ancient method that had appeared several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ore|1988|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorem statement==
Let {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' , ..., ''n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be integers greater than 1, which are often called ''[[modular arithmetic|moduli]]'' or ''[[Euclidean division|divisors]]''. Let us denote by {{math|''N''}} the product of the {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that if the {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are [[pairwise coprime]], and if {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are integers such that {{math|0 ≤ ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for every {{math|''i''}}, then there is one and only one integer {{math|''x''}}, such that {{math|0 ≤ ''x'' &lt; ''N''}} and the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{math|''x''}} by {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for every {{math|''i''}}.

This may be restated as follows in term of [[congruence relation|congruence]]s:
If the {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are pairwise coprime, and if {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are any integers, then there exists an integer {{math|''x''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 x &amp;\equiv a_1  \pmod{n_1} \\
  &amp;\vdots \\
 x &amp;\equiv a_k \pmod{n_k},
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and any two such {{math|''x''}} are congruent modulo {{math|''N''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[abstract algebra]], the theorem is often restated as: if the {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are pairwise coprime, the map
:&lt;math&gt;x\ \operatorname{mod} N \;\mapsto\;(x\ \operatorname{mod}n_1,\, \ldots,\, x\ \operatorname{mod} n_k)&lt;/math&gt;
defines a [[ring isomorphism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}/N\Bbb{Z} \cong \Bbb{Z}/n_1\Bbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \Bbb{Z}/n_k\Bbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
between the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''N''}}]] and the [[direct product]] of the rings of integers modulo the {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This means that for doing a sequence of arithmetic operations in &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}/N\Bbb{Z},&lt;/math&gt; one may do the same computation independently in each &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}/n_i\Bbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and then get the result by applying the isomorphism (from the right to the left). This may be much faster than the direct computation if {{math|''N''}} and the number of operations are large. This is widely used, under the name ''multi-modular computation'', for [[linear algebra]] over the integers or the [[rational number]]s.

The theorem can also be restated in the language of [[combinatorics]] as the fact that the infinite [[arithmetic progression]]s of integers form a [[Helly family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchet|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
The existence and the uniqueness of the solution may be proven independently. However, the first proof of existence, given below, uses this uniqueness.

===Uniqueness===
Suppose that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are both solutions to all the congruences. As {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} give the same remainder, when divided by {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, their difference {{math|''x'' − ''y''}} is a multiple of each {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. As the {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are pairwise coprime, their product {{math|''N''}} divides also {{math|''x'' − ''y''}}, and thus {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are congruent modulo {{math|''N''}}. If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}  are supposed to be non negative and less than {{math|''N''}} (as in the first statement of the theorem), then their difference may be a multiple of {{math|''N''}} only if {{math|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.

===Existence (first proof)===
The map
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (x \operatorname{mod} n_1, \ldots, x\operatorname{mod} n_k)&lt;/math&gt;
maps congruence classes modulo {{math|''N''}} to sequences of congruence classes modulo {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The proof of uniqueness shows that this map is [[injective]]. As the [[domain of a function|domain]] and the [[codomain]] of this map have the same number of elements, the map is also [[surjective]], which proves the existence of the solution.

This proof is very simple but does not provide any direct way for computing a solution. Moreover, it cannot be generalized to other situations where the following proof can.

===Existence (constructive proof)===
Existence may be established by an explicit construction of {{mvar|x}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|1993|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This construction may be split into two steps, firstly by solving the problem in the case of two moduli, and the second one by extending this solution to the general case by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the number of moduli.

====Case of two moduli====
We want to solve the system:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  x &amp;\equiv a_1 \pmod {n_1}\\
  x &amp;\equiv a_2 \pmod {n_2},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; are coprime.

[[Bézout's identity]] asserts the existence of two integers &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;m_1n_1+m_2n_2=1.&lt;/math&gt;
The integers &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; may be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].

A solution is given by
:&lt;math&gt;x = a_1m_2n_2+a_2m_1n_1.&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;=a_1m_2n_2+a_2m_1n_1\\
&amp;=a_1(1 - m_1n_1) + a_2m_1n_1 \\
&amp;=a_1 + (a_2 - a_1)m_1n_1,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
implying that &lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_1 \pmod {n_1}.&lt;/math&gt; The second congruence is proved similarly.

====General case====
Let us consider a sequence of congruence equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
  x &amp;\equiv a_1 \pmod{n_1} \\ 
  &amp;\vdots              \\ 
  x &amp;\equiv a_k \pmod{n_k},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise coprime. The two first equations have a solution &lt;math&gt;a_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; provided by the method of the previous section. The set of the solutions of these two first equations is the set of all solutions of the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_{1,2} \pmod{n_1n_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As the other &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; are coprime with &lt;math&gt;n_1n_2,&lt;/math&gt; this reduces solving the initial problem of {{mvar|k}} equations to a similar problem with &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; equations. Iterating the process, one gets eventually the solutions of the initial problem.

===Existence (direct construction)===
For constructing a solution, it is not necessary to make an induction on the number of moduli. However, such a direct construction involves more computation with large numbers, which makes it less efficient and less used. Nevertheless, [[Lagrange interpolation]] is a special case of this construction, applied to polynomials instead of integers.

Let &lt;math&gt;N_i = N/n_i&lt;/math&gt; be the product of all moduli but one. As the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise coprime, &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; are coprime. Thus [[Bézout's identity]] applies, and there exist integers &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;M_iN_i + m_in_i=1.&lt;/math&gt;

A solution of the system of congruences is
:&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=1}^k a_iM_iN_i.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, as &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i\neq j,&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_iM_iN_i \equiv a_i(1-m_in_i) \equiv a_i \pmod{n_i}, &lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Computation==
Let us consider a system of congruences:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
 x &amp;\equiv a_1  \pmod{n_1} \\
 &amp;\vdots             \\ 
 x &amp;\equiv a_k \pmod{n_k}, \\ 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise [[coprime]], and let &lt;math&gt;N=n_1 n_2\cdots n_k.&lt;/math&gt; In this section several methods are described for computing the unique solution for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;0\le x&lt;N,&lt;/math&gt; and these methods are applied on the example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 x &amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \\
 x &amp;\equiv 3 \pmod{4} \\
 x &amp;\equiv 4 \pmod{5}.\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Systematic search===
It is easy to check whether a value of {{mvar|x}} is a solution: it suffices to compute the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{mvar|x}} by each {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus, to find the solution, it suffices to check successively the integers from {{math|0}} to {{mvar|N}} until finding the solution.

Although very simple this method is very inefficient: for the simple example considered here, {{math|40}} integers (including {{math|0}}) have to be checked for finding the solution {{math|39}}. This is an [[exponential time]] algorithm, as the size of the input is, up to a constant factor, the number of digits of {{mvar|N}}, and the average number of operations is of the order of {{mvar|N}}.

Therefore, this method is rarely used, for hand-written computation as well on computers.

===Search by sieving===
The search of the solution may be made dramatically faster by sieving. For this method, we suppose, without loss of generality, that &lt;math&gt;0\le a_i &lt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (if it were not the case, it would suffice to replace each &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; by the remainder of its division by &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;). This implies that the solution belongs to the [[arithmetic progression]]
:&lt;math&gt;a_1, a_1 + n_1, a_1+2n_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
By testing the values of these numbers modulo &lt;math&gt;n_2,&lt;/math&gt; one eventually finds a solution &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; of the two first congruences. Then the solution belongs to the arithmetic progression 
:&lt;math&gt;x_2, x_2 + n_1n_2, x_2+2n_1n_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
Testing the values of these numbers modulo &lt;math&gt;n_3,&lt;/math&gt;, and continuing until every modulus has been tested gives eventually the solution.

This method is faster if the moduli have been ordered by decreasing value, that is if &lt;math&gt;n_1&gt;n_2&gt; \cdots &gt; n_k.&lt;/math&gt; For the example, this gives the following computation. We consider first the numbers that are congruent to 4 modulo 5 (the largest modulus), which are 4, {{nowrap|1=9 = 4 + 5}}, {{nowrap|1=14 = 9 + 5}}, ... For each of them, compute the remainder by 4 (the second largest modulus) until getting a number congruent to 3 modulo 4. Then one can proceed  by adding {{nowrap|1=20 = 5×4}} at each step, and computing only the remainders by 3. This gives
:4 mod 4 → 0. Continue
:4 + 5 = 9 mod 4 →1.  Continue
:9 + 5 = 14 mod 4 → 2. Continue
:14 + 5 = 19 mod 4 → 3. OK, continue by considering remainders modulo 3 and adding 5×4 = 20 each time
:19 mod 3 → 1. Continue
:19 + 20 = 39 mod 3 → 0. OK, this is the result.

This method works well for hand-written computation with a product of moduli that is not too big. However, it is much slower than other methods, for very large products of moduli. Although dramatically faster than the systematic search, this method also has an [[exponential time]] complexity and is therefore not used on computers.

===Using the existence construction===
The [[#Existence (constructive proof)|constructive existence proof]] shows that, in the [[#Case of two moduli|case of two moduli]], the solution may be obtained by the computation of the [[Bézout coefficients]] of the moduli, followed by a few multiplications, additions and reductions modulo &lt;math&gt;n_1n_2&lt;/math&gt; (for getting a result in the interval &lt;math&gt;(0, n_1n_2-1)&lt;/math&gt;). As the Bézout's coefficients may be computed with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]], the whole computation, at most, has a quadratic [[time complexity]] of &lt;math&gt;O((s_1+s_2)^2),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of digits of &lt;math&gt;n_i.&lt;/math&gt;

For more than two moduli, the method for two moduli allows the replacement of any two congruences by a single congruence modulo the product of the moduli. Iterating this process provides eventually the solution with a complexity, which is quadratic in the number of digits of the product of all moduli. This quadratic time complexity does not depend on the order in which the moduli are regrouped. One may regroup the two first moduli, then regroup the resulting modulus with the next one, and so on. This strategy is the easiest to implement, but it also requires more computation involving large numbers.

Another strategy consists in partitioning the moduli in pairs whose product have comparable sizes (as much as possible), applying, in parallel, the method of two moduli to each pair, and iterating with a number of moduli approximatively divided by two. This method allows an easy parallelization of the algorithm. Also, if fast algorithms (that is algorithms working in [[quasilinear time]]) are used for the basic operations, this method provides an algorithm for the whole computation that works in quasilinear time.

On the current example (which has only three moduli), both strategies are identical and work as follows.

[[Bézout's identity]] for 3 and 4 is
:&lt;math&gt;1\times 4 + (-1)\times 3 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
Putting this in the formula given for proving the existence gives 
:&lt;math&gt;0\times 4 + (-3)\times 3 =-9&lt;/math&gt;
for a solution of the two first congruences, the other solutions being obtained by adding to −9 any multiple of {{nowrap|1= 3×4 = 12}}. One may continue with any of these solutions, but the solution {{nowrap|1=3 = −9 +12}} is smaller (in absolute value) and thus leads probably to an easier computation

Bézout identity for 5 and 3×4 = 12 is
:&lt;math&gt;5\times 5 +(-2)\times 12 =1.&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the same formula again, we get a solution of the problem:
:&lt;math&gt;25\times 3 -24\times 4 = -21.&lt;/math&gt;
The other solutions are obtained by adding any multiple of {{nowrap|1=3×4×5 = 60}}, and the smallest positive solution is {{nowrap|1=−21 + 60 = 39}}.

===As a linear Diophantine system===
The system of congruences solved by the Chinese remainder theorem may be rewritten as a [[Diophantine equation#System of linear Diophantine equations|system of simultaneous linear Diophantine equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
 x &amp;= a_1 +x_1n_1\\ 
 &amp;\vdots   \\ 
 x &amp;=a_k+x_kn_k, 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the unknown integers are &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;x_i.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, every general method for solving such systems may be used for finding the solution of Chinese remainder theorem, such as the reduction of the matrix of the system to [[Smith normal form]] or [[Hermite normal form]]. However, as usual when using a general algorithm for a more specific problem, this approach is less efficient than the method of the preceding section, based on a direct use of [[Bézout's identity]].

==Over principal ideal domains==
In {{slink||Theorem statement}}, the Chinese remainder theorem has been stated in three different ways: in terms of remainders, of congruences, and of a ring isomorphism. The statement in terms of remainders does not apply, in general, to [[principal ideal domain]]s, as remainders are not defined in such rings. However, the two other versions make sense over a principal ideal domain {{math|''R''}}: it suffices to replace "integer" by "element of the domain" and &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z&lt;/math&gt; by  {{math|''R''}}. These two versions of the theorem are true in this context, because the proofs (except for the first existence proof), are based on [[Euclid's lemma]] and [[Bézout's identity]], which are true over every principal domain.

However, in general, the theorem is only an existence theorem and does not provide any way for computing the solution, unless one has an algorithm for computing the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

==Over univariate polynomial rings and Euclidean domains==
The statement in terms of remainders given in {{slink||Theorem statement}} cannot be generalized to any principal ideal domain, but its generalization to [[Euclidean domain]]s is straightforward. The [[univariate polynomial]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] is the typical example of a Euclidean domain, which is not the integers. Therefore, we state the theorem for the case of a ring of univariate domain &lt;math&gt;R=K[X]&lt;/math&gt; over a field &lt;math&gt;K.&lt;/math&gt; For getting the theorem for a general Euclidean domain, it suffices to replace the degree by the [[Euclidean function]] of the Euclidean domain.

The Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials is thus: Let &lt;math&gt;P_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; (the moduli) be,  for {{math|1=''i''=1, ..., ''k''}}, [[pairwise coprime]] polynomials in &lt;math&gt;R=K[X]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d_i =\deg P_i&lt;/math&gt; be the degree of &lt;math&gt;P_i(X)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the sum of the &lt;math&gt;d_i.&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;A_i(X), \ldots,A_k(X)&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials such that &lt;math&gt;A_i(X)=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\deg A_i&lt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; for every {{math|''i''}}, then, there is one and only one polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\deg P&lt;D&lt;/math&gt; and the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;P_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; for every {{math|''i''}}.

The construction of the solution may be done as in {{slink||Existence (constructive proof)}} or {{slink||Existence (direct proof)}}. However, the latter construction may be simplified by using, as follows, [[partial fraction decomposition]] instead of [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].

Thus, we want to find a polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies the congruences
:&lt;math&gt;P(X)\equiv A_i(X) \pmod {P_i(X)},&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,k.&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider the polynomials
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    Q(X) &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^{k}P_i(X) \\
  Q_i(X) &amp;= \frac{Q(X)}{P_i(X)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The partial fraction decomposition of &lt;math&gt;1/Q(X)&lt;/math&gt; gives {{mvar|k}} polynomials &lt;math&gt;S_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; with degrees &lt;math&gt;\deg S_i(X) &lt; d_i,&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Q(X)} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{S_i(X)}{P_i(X)},&lt;/math&gt;
and thus
:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sum_{i=1}^{k}S_i(X) Q_i(X).&lt;/math&gt;

Then a solution of the simultaneous congruence system is given by the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k A_i(X) S_i(X) Q_i(X).&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we have
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k A_i(X) S_i(X) Q_i(X)= A_i(X)+ \sum_{j=1}^{k}(A_j(X) - A_i(X)) S_j(X) Q_j(X) \equiv A_i(X)\pmod{P_i(X)},&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k.&lt;/math&gt;

This solution may have a degree larger that &lt;math&gt;D=\sum_{i=1}^k d_i.&lt;/math&gt; The unique solution of degree less than &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; may be deduced by considering the remainder &lt;math&gt;B_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; of the Euclidean division of &lt;math&gt;A_i(X)S_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;P_i(X).&lt;/math&gt; This solution is 
:&lt;math&gt;P(X)=\sum_{i=1}^k B_i(X) Q_i(X).&lt;/math&gt;

===Lagrange interpolation===
A special case of Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials is [[Lagrange interpolation]]. For this, let us consider {{mvar|k}} [[monic polynomial]]s of degree one:

:&lt;math&gt;P_i(X)=X-x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

They are pairwise coprime if the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are all different. The remainder of the division by &lt;math&gt;P_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;P(x_i).&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let &lt;math&gt;A_1, \ldots, A_k&lt;/math&gt; be constants (polynomials of degree 0) in &lt;math&gt;K.&lt;/math&gt; Both Lagrange interpolation and Chinese remainder theorem assert the existence of a unique polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X),&lt;/math&gt; of degree less than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;P(x_i)=A_i,&lt;/math&gt;

for every &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt;

Lagrange interpolation formula is exactly the result, in this case, of the above construction of the solution. More precisely, let 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Q(X)  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^{k}(X-x_i) \\[6pt]
 Q_i(X) &amp;= \frac{Q(X)}{X-x_i}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[partial fraction decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Q(X)}&lt;/math&gt; is 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Q(X)} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{Q_i(x_i)(X-X_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, reducing the right-hand side to a common denominator one gets 

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{Q_i(x_i)(X-X_i)}= \frac{1}{Q(X)} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{Q_i(X)}{Q_i(x_i)},&lt;/math&gt;

and the numerator is equal to one, as being a polynomial of degree less than &lt;math&gt;k,&lt;/math&gt; which takes the value one for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; different values of &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above general formula, we get the Lagrange interpolation formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P(X)=\sum_{i=1}^k A_i\frac{Q_i(X)}{Q_i(x_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Hermite interpolation===
[[Hermite interpolation]] is an application of Chinese remainder theorem for univariate polynomials, which may involve moduli of arbitrary degrees (Lagrange interpolation involves only moduli of degree one).

The problem consists of finding a polynomial of the least possible degree, such that the polynomial and its first derivatives take given values at some fixed points.

More precisely, let &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_k&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; elements of the ground [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K,&lt;/math&gt; and, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots, k,&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;a_{i,0}, a_{i,1}, \ldots, a_{i,r_i-1}&lt;/math&gt; be the values of the first &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; derivatives of the sought polynomial at &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; (including the 0th derivative, which is the value of the polynomial itself). The problem is to find a polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that its ''j''th derivative takes the value &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j} &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_i,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j=0,\ldots,r_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;P_i(X) = \sum_{j=0}^{r_i - 1}\frac{a_{i,j}}{j!}(X - x_i)^j.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the Taylor polynomial   of order &lt;math&gt;r_i-1&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the unknown polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X).&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, we must have
:&lt;math&gt;P(X)\equiv P_i(X) \pmod {(X-x_i)^{r_i}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, any polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt; that satisfies these &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; congruences, in particular verifies, for any &lt;math&gt;i=1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(X)= P_i(X) +o(X-x_i)^{r_i-1} &lt;/math&gt; 
therefore &lt;math&gt;P_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; is its Taylor polynomial of order &lt;math&gt; r_i - 1&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt; solves the initial Hermite interpolation problem.
The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that there exists exactly one polynomial of degree less than the sum of the &lt;math&gt;r_i,&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies these &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; congruences.

There are several ways for computing the solution &lt;math&gt;P(X).&lt;/math&gt; One may use the method described at the beginning of {{slink||Over univariate polynomial rings and Euclidean domains}}. One may also use the constructions given in {{slink||Existence (constructive proof)}} or {{slink||Existence (direct proof)}}.

==Generalization to non-coprime moduli==
The Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to non-coprime moduli. Let &lt;math&gt;m, n, a, b&lt;/math&gt; be any integers, let &lt;math&gt;g = \gcd(m,n)&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the system of congruences:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x &amp;\equiv a \pmod {m} \\
x &amp;\equiv b \pmod {n},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b \pmod g&lt;/math&gt;, then this system of equations has a unique solution modulo &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(m,n) = mn/g&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, it has no solutions.

If we use [[Bézout's identity]] to write &lt;math&gt;g = um + vn&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution is
:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{avn+bum}{g}.&lt;/math&gt;
This defines an integer, as {{mvar|g}} divides both {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}. Otherwise, the proof is very similar to that for coprime moduli.

==Generalization to arbitrary rings==
The Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], by using [[Coprime integers#Coprimality in ring ideals|coprime ideal]]s (also called [[Ideal (ring theory)#Types of ideals|comaximal ideals]]). Two ideals {{mvar|I}} and {{mvar|J}} are coprime if there are elements &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j\in J&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;i+j=1.&lt;/math&gt; This relation plays the role of [[Bézout's identity]] in the proofs related to this generalization, which, otherwise are very similar. The generalization may be stated as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be [[two-sided ideal]]s of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that are pairwise coprime,  and {{math|''I''}} be their intersection. Then we have the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    R/I &amp;\to R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k \\
  x\ \operatorname{mod} I &amp;\mapsto (x\ \operatorname{mod} I_1,\, \ldots,\, x\ \operatorname{mod} I_k),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
between the [[quotient ring]] &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; and the [[direct product of rings|direct product]] of the &lt;math&gt;R/I_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where "&lt;math&gt;x \operatorname{mod} I&lt;/math&gt;" denotes the image of the element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the quotient ring defined by the ideal &lt;math&gt;I.&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is [[commutative ring|commutative]], then the ideal intersection {{math|''I''}} is equal to the [[product of ideals|product of the ideals]] &lt;math&gt;I_i:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
I= I_1\cap I_2 \cap\cdots\cap I_k= I_1I_2\cdots I_k.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Sequence numbering===
The Chinese remainder theorem has been used to construct a [[Gödel numbering for sequences]], which is involved in the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===Fast Fourier transform===
The [[prime-factor FFT algorithm]] (also called Good-Thomas algorithm) uses the Chinese remainder theorem for reducing the computation of a [[fast Fourier transform]] of size &lt;math&gt;n_1n_2&lt;/math&gt; to the computation of two fast Fourier transforms of smaller sizes &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; (providing that &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; are coprime).

===Encryption===
Most [[RSA (cryptosystem)#Using the Chinese remainder algorithm|implementations of RSA use the Chinese remainder theorem]] during signing of [[HTTPS]] certificates and during decryption.

The Chinese remainder theorem can also be used in [[secret sharing]], which consists of distributing a set of shares among a group of people who, all together (but no one alone), can recover a certain secret from the given set of shares. Each of the shares is represented in a congruence, and the solution of the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem is the secret to be recovered. [[Secret sharing using the Chinese remainder theorem]] uses, along with the Chinese remainder theorem, special sequences of integers that guarantee the impossibility of recovering the secret from a set of shares with less than a certain [[cardinality]].

===Range ambiguity resolution===
{{main article | range ambiguity resolution }}

The [[range ambiguity resolution]] techniques used with [[medium pulse repetition frequency]] radar can be seen as a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem.

===Dedekind's theorem===
'''Dedekind's theorem on the linear independence of characters.''' Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[monoid]] and {{mvar|k}} an [[integral domain]], viewed as a monoid by considering the multiplication on {{mvar|k}}. Then any finite family {{math|(&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of distinct monoid homomorphisms {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''M'' → ''k''}} is linearly independent. In other words, every family {{math|(''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of elements {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''k''}} satisfying 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I}\alpha_i f_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

must be equal to the family {{math|(0)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

'''Proof.''' First assume that {{mvar|k}} is a field, otherwise, replace the integral domain {{mvar|k}} by its quotient field, and nothing will change. We can linearly extend the monoid homomorphisms {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''M'' → ''k''}} to {{mvar|k}}-algebra homomorphisms {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''k''[''M''] → ''k''}}, where {{math|''k''[''M'']}} is the [[monoid ring]] of {{mvar|M}} over {{mvar|k}}. Then, by linearity, the condition
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i f_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

yields
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I}\alpha_i F_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, for {{math|''i'', ''j'' ∈ ''I''; ''i'' ≠ ''j''}} the two {{mvar|k}}-linear maps {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''k''[''M''] → ''k''}} and {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''k''[''M''] → ''k''}} are not proportional to each other. Otherwise {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;}} and {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;}} would also be proportional, and thus equal since as monoid homomorphisms they satisfy: {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;(1) {{=}} 1 {{=}} &amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;(1)}}, which contradicts the assumption that they are distinct.

Therefore, the kernels {{math|Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are distinct. Since {{math|''k''[''M'']/Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≅ ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''k''[''M'']) {{=}} ''k''}} is a field, {{math|Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a maximal ideal of {{math|''k''[''M'']}} for every {{math|''i'' ∈ ''I''}}. Because they are distinct and maximal the ideals {{math|Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are coprime whenever {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (for general rings) yields an isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \phi: k[M] / K &amp;\to \prod_{i \in I}k[M] / \mathrm{Ker} F_i \\
     \phi(x + K) &amp;= \left(x + \mathrm{Ker} F_i\right)_{i \in I}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;K = \prod_{i \in I}\mathrm{Ker} F_i = \bigcap_{i \in I}\mathrm{Ker} F_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the map
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Phi: k[M] &amp;\to \prod_{i \in I}k[M]/ \mathrm{Ker} F_i \\
     \Phi(x) &amp;= \left(x + \mathrm{Ker} F_i\right)_{i \in I}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is surjective. Under the isomorphisms {{math|''k''[''M'']/Ker ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''k''[''M'']) {{=}} ''k'',}} the map {{math|Φ}} corresponds to:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \psi: k[M] &amp;\to \prod_{i \in I}k \\
     \psi(x) &amp;= \left[F_i(x)\right]_{i \in I}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I}\alpha_i F_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

yields
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I}\alpha_i u_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for every vector {{math|(''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the image of the map {{mvar|ψ}}. Since {{mvar|ψ}} is surjective, this means that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I}\alpha_i u_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for every vector
:&lt;math&gt;\left(u_i\right)_{i \in I} \in \prod_{i \in I}k.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, {{math|(''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (0)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. QED.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''crepant resolution'''  of a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] is a [[resolution of singularities|resolution]] that does not affect the [[canonical class]] of the [[manifold]]. The term "crepant" was coined by {{harvs |txt |last=Reid |first=Miles |authorlink=Miles Reid |year=1983}} by removing the prefix "dis" from the word "discrepant", to indicate that the resolutions have no discrepancy in the canonical class.

The '''crepant resolution conjecture''' of {{harvtxt|Ruan|2006}} states that the orbifold cohomology of a [[Daniel Gorenstein|Gorenstein]] [[orbifold]] is isomorphic to a semiclassical limit of the quantum cohomology of a crepant resolution.

In 2 dimensions, crepant resolutions of complex Gorenstein quotient singularities ([[du Val singularities]]) always exist and are unique, in 3 dimensions they exist&lt;ref&gt;T. Bridgeland, A. King, M. Reid. ''J. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 14 (2001), 535-554. Theorem 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt; but need not be unique as they can be related by [[flop (algebraic geometry)|flop]]s, and in dimensions greater than 3 they need not exist.

A substitute for crepant resolutions which always exists is a '''terminal model'''. Namely, for every variety ''X'' over a field of characteristic zero such that ''X'' has [[Canonical singularity|canonical]] singularities (for example, [[Rational singularity|rational]] Gorenstein singularities), there is a variety ''Y'' with '''Q'''-factorial [[Canonical singularity|terminal]] singularities and a [[Birational geometry|birational]] projective morphism ''f'': ''Y'' → ''X'' which is crepant in the sense that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''*''K''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;C. Birkar, P. Cascini, C. Hacon, J. McKernan. ''J. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 23 (2010), 405-468. Corollary 1.4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ¬ is a De Morgan involution:  ¬(''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''y'') = ¬''x''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;¬''y'' and ¬¬''x'' = ''x''. (i.e. an  [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] that additionally satisfies [[De Morgan's laws]])

In a De Morgan algebra, the laws

* ¬''x''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x'' = 1 ([[law of the excluded middle]]), and
* ¬''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''x'' = 0 ([[law of noncontradiction]])

do not always hold. In the presence of the De Morgan laws, either law implies the other, and an algebra which satisfies them becomes a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].

Remark: It follows that ¬( x∨y)  = ¬x∧¬y,  ¬1 = 0 and ¬0 = 1 (e.g. ¬1 = ¬1∨0 = ¬1∨¬¬0 = ¬(1∧¬0) = ¬¬0 = 0). Thus ¬ is a dual [[automorphism]].

If the lattice is defined in terms of the order instead, i.e. (A,&amp;nbsp;≤) is a bounded partial order with a least upper bound and greatest lower bound for every pair of elements, and the meet and join operations so defined satisfy the distributive law, then the complementation can also be defined as an involutive anti-automorphism, that is, a structure ''A'' =&amp;nbsp;(A,&amp;nbsp;≤,&amp;nbsp;¬) such that:

* (A,&amp;nbsp;≤) is a [[Bounded set|bounded]] [[distributive lattice]], and
* ¬¬''x'' = ''x'', and
* ''x'' ≤ ''y'' → ¬''y'' ≤ ¬''x''.

De Morgan algebras were introduced by [[Grigore Moisil]]&lt;ref name="BV"&gt;{{cite book| ref = harv| first1=T. S.|last1=Blyth|first2=J.

A. Kalman]].&lt;ref name="Bez"/&gt; (''i''-lattice being an abbreviation for lattice with involution.) They have been further studied in the Argentinian algebraic logic school of [[Antonio Monteiro (mathematician)|Antonio Monteiro]].&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bez"/&gt;

De Morgan algebras are important for the study of the mathematical aspects of [[fuzzy logic]]. The standard fuzzy algebra ''F'' =&amp;nbsp;([0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1],&amp;nbsp;max(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''),&amp;nbsp;min(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''),&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'') is an example of a De Morgan algebra where the laws of excluded middle and noncontradiction do not hold.

Another example is [[J. Michael Dunn|Dunn]]'s 4-valued logic, in which ''false'' &lt; ''neither-true-nor-false'' &lt; ''true'' and ''false'' &lt; ''both-true-and-false'' &lt; ''true'', while ''neither-true-nor-false'' and ''both-true-and-false'' are not comparable.&lt;ref name="Bez"/&gt;

== Kleene algebra ==
If a De Morgan algebra additionally satisfies ''x'' ∧ ¬''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∨ ¬''y'', it is called a '''Kleene algebra'''.&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cignoli75"/&gt; (This notion should not to be confused with the other [[Kleene algebra]] generalizing regular expressions.) This notion has also been called a '''normal ''i''-lattice''' by Kalman.

Examples of Kleene algebras in the sense defined above include: [[lattice-ordered group]]s, [[Post algebra]]s and [[Łukasiewicz algebra]]s.&lt;ref name="Cignoli75"/&gt; [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s also meet this definition of Kleene algebra. The simplest Kleene algebra that is not Boolean is Kleene's [[three-valued logic]] K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="KaarliPixley2000"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kalle |last1=Kaarli|first2=Alden F. |last2=Pixley|title=Polynomial Completeness in Algebraic Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVHDN_EiA0YC&amp;pg=PA297|date=21 July 2000|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-58488-203-9|pages=297–}}&lt;/ref&gt; K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; made its first appearance in [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]'s ''On notation for [[ordinal numbers]]'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.

== Related notions ==
De Morgan algebra is not the only plausible way to generalize the Boolean algebra. Another way is to keep ¬''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''x'' = 0 (i.e. the law of noncontradiction) but to drop the law of the excluded middle and the law of double negation. This approach (called ''semicomplementation'') is well-defined even for a [meet] [[semilattice]]; if the set of semicomplements has a [[greatest element]] it is usually called [[pseudocomplement]]. If the pseudocomplement thus defined satisfies the law of the excluded middle, the resulting algebra is also Boolean. However, if only the weaker law ¬''x''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;¬¬''x'' = 1 is required, this results in [[Stone algebra]]s.&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt; More generally, both De Morgan and Stone algebras are proper subclasses of [[Ockham algebras]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7225">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''definable set''' is an ''n''-ary [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] whose elements are precisely those elements satisfying some [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] in the [[first-order language]] of that structure. A set can be defined with or without '''parameters''', which are elements of the domain that can be referenced in the formula defining the relation.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; be a first-order language, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; an &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;-structure with domain &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a fixed subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; a natural number. Then:
* A set &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq M^m&lt;/math&gt; is ''definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; with parameters from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' if and only if there exists a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi[x_1,\ldots,x_m,y_1,\ldots,y_n]&lt;/math&gt; and elements &lt;math&gt;b_1,\ldots,b_n\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_m\in M&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_m)\in A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models\varphi[a_1,\ldots,a_m,b_1,\ldots,b_n]&lt;/math&gt;
:The bracket notation here indicates the semantic evaluation of the free variables in the formula.
* A set ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; without parameters'' if it is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; with parameters from the empty set (that is, with no parameters in the defining formula).
* A function is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; (with parameters) if its graph is definable (with those parameters) in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.
* An element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; (with parameters) if the singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; (with those parameters).

== Examples ==

=== The natural numbers with only the order relation ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}=(\mathbb{N},&lt;)&lt;/math&gt; be the structure consisting of the [[natural number]]s with the usual ordering. Then every natural number is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; without parameters. The number &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; stating that there exist no elements less than ''x'':

&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\neg\exists y(y&lt;x),&lt;/math&gt;

and a natural &lt;math&gt;n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; stating there exist exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements less than ''x'':

&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\exists x_0\cdots\exists x_{n-1}(x_0&lt;x_1\land\cdots\land x_{n-1}&lt;x\land\forall y(y&lt;x\rightarrow(y\equiv x_0\lor\cdots\lor y\equiv x_{n-1})))&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, one cannot define any specific [[integer]] without parameters in the structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}=(\mathbb{Z},&lt;)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the integers with the usual ordering (see the section on automorphisms below).

=== The natural numbers with their arithmetical operations ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}=(\mathbb{N},+, \cdot, &lt;)&lt;/math&gt; be the first-order structure consisting of the natural numbers and their usual arithmetic operations and order relation. The sets definable in this structure are known as the [[arithmetical set]]s, and are classified in the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]. If the structure is considered in [[second-order logic]] instead of first-order logic, the definable sets of natural numbers in the resulting structure are classified in the [[analytical hierarchy]]. These hierarchies reveal many relationships between definability in this structure and [[computability theory]], and are also of interest in [[descriptive set theory]].

=== The field of real numbers ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}=(\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; be the structure consisting of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s. Although the usual ordering relation is not directly included in the structure, there is a formula that defines the set of nonnegative reals, since these are the only reals that possess square roots:

&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\exists y(y\cdot y\equiv x).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus any &lt;math&gt;a\in\R&lt;/math&gt; is nonnegative if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\models\varphi[a]&lt;/math&gt;. In conjunction with a formula that defines the additive inverse of a real number in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;, one can use &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; to define the usual ordering in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;: for &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\R&lt;/math&gt;, set &lt;math&gt;a\le b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;b-a&lt;/math&gt; is nonnegative. The enlarged structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^{\le}=(\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\cdot,\le)&lt;/math&gt;s is called a [[extension by definitions|definitional extension]] of the original structure. It has the same expressive power as the original structure, in the sense that a set is definable over the enlarged structure from a set of parameters if and only if it is definable over the original structure from that same set of parameters. 

The [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^{\le}&lt;/math&gt; has [[quantifier elimination]]. Thus the definable sets are Boolean combinations of solutions to polynomial equalities and inequalities; these are called [[semi-algebraic sets]]. Generalizing this property of the real line leads to the study of [[o-minimality]].

== Invariance under automorphisms ==

An important result about definable sets is that they are preserved under [[automorphism]]s.
:Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;-structure with domain &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq M^m&lt;/math&gt; definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; with parameters from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\pi:M\to M&lt;/math&gt; be an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; which is the identity on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_m\in M&lt;/math&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_m)\in A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;(\pi(a_1),\ldots,\pi(a_m))\in A&lt;/math&gt;

This result can sometimes be used to classify the definable subsets of a given structure. For example, in the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}=(\mathbb{Z},&lt;)&lt;/math&gt; above, any translation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is an automorphism preserving the empty set of parameters, and thus it is impossible to define any particular integer in this structure without parameters in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, since any two integers are carried to each other by a translation and its inverse, the only sets of integers definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt; without parameters are the empty set and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; itself. In contrast, there are infinitely many definable sets of pairs (or indeed ''n''-tuples for any fixed ''n''&gt;1) of elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, since any automorphism (translation) preserves the "distance" between two elements.

== Additional results ==

The [[Tarski–Vaught test]] is used to characterize the [[elementary substructure]]s of a given structure.

In [[geometry]], an '''equidissection''' is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a [[polygon]] into [[triangle]]s of equal [[area]].  The study of equidissections began in the late 1960s with [[Monsky's theorem]], which states that a [[square (geometry)|square]] cannot be equidissected into an odd number of triangles.{{sfn|Monsky|1970}} In fact, [[almost all|most]] polygons cannot be equidissected at all.{{sfn|Kasimatis|Stein|1990}}

Much of the literature is aimed at generalizing Monsky's theorem to broader classes of polygons. The general question is: Which polygons can be equidissected into how many pieces? Particular attention has been given to [[trapezoid]]s, [[kite (geometry)|kite]]s, [[regular polygon]]s, [[zonogon|centrally symmetric polygon]]s, [[polyomino]]s, and [[hypercube]]s.{{sfn|Stein|2004}}

Equidissections do not have many direct applications.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|pp=108–109}} They are considered interesting because the results are counterintuitive at first, and for a geometry problem with such a simple definition, the theory requires some surprisingly sophisticated algebraic tools. Many of the results rely upon extending [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuations]] to the [[real number]]s and extending [[Sperner's lemma]] to more general [[colored graph]]s.{{sfn|Stein|2004|p=17}}

==Overview==

===Definitions===
A ''dissection'' of a polygon ''P'' is a finite set of triangles that do not overlap and whose union is all of ''P''. A dissection into ''n'' triangles is called an ''n''-dissection, and it is classified as an ''even dissection'' or an ''odd dissection'' according to whether ''n'' is [[Parity (mathematics)|even or odd]].{{sfn|Stein|2004|p=17}}

An ''equidissection'' is a dissection in which every triangle has the same area. For a polygon ''P'', the set of all ''n'' for which an ''n''-equidissection of ''P'' exists is called the ''spectrum'' of ''P'' and denoted ''S''(''P''). A general theoretical goal is to compute the spectrum of a given polygon.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=120}}

A dissection is called ''[[simplicial complex|simplicial]]'' if the triangles meet only along common edges. Some authors restrict their attention to simplicial dissections, especially in the secondary literature, since they are easier to work with. For example, the usual statement of Sperner's lemma applies only to simplicial dissections. Often simplicial dissections are called ''[[polygon triangulation|triangulations]]'', although the vertices of the triangles are not restricted to the vertices or edges of the polygon. Simplicial equidissections are therefore also called ''equal-area triangulations''.{{sfn|Schulze|2011}}

The terms can be extended to higher-dimensional [[polytope]]s: an equidissection is set of [[simplex]]es having the same ''n''-volume.{{sfn|Mead|1979|p=302}}

===Preliminaries===
It is easy to find an ''n''-equidissection of a triangle for all ''n''. As a result, if a polygon has an ''m''-equidissection, then it also has an ''mn''-equidissection for all ''n''. In fact, often a polygon's spectrum consists precisely of the multiples of some number ''m''; in this case, both the spectrum and the polygon are called ''principal'' and the spectrum is denoted &lt;math&gt;\langle m \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Kasimatis|Stein|1990}} For example, the spectrum of a triangle is &lt;math&gt;\langle 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. A simple example of a non-principal polygon is the quadrilateral with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (3/2, 3/2); its spectrum includes 2 and 3 but not 1.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=126}}

[[Affine transformation]]s of the plane are useful for studying equidissections, including [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s, uniform and non-uniform [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s, [[rotation]]s, [[shear mapping|shears]], and other [[similarity (geometry)|similarities]] and [[linear map]]s. Since an affine transformation preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means that one is free to apply any affine transformation to a polygon that might give it a more manageable form. For example, it is common to choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0).{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|pp=121, 128, 131}}

The fact that affine transformations preserve equidissections also means that certain results can be easily generalized. All results stated for a regular polygon also hold for [[affine-regular polygon]]s; in particular, results concerning the unit square also apply to other parallelograms, including [[rectangle]]s and [[rhombus]]es. All results stated for polygons with [[integer]] coordinates also apply to polygons with [[rational number|rational]] coordinates, or polygons whose vertices fall on any other [[lattice (group)|lattice]].{{sfn|Stein|2004|pp=12–20}}

[[Monsky's theorem]] states that a square has no odd equidissections, so its spectrum is &lt;math&gt;\langle 2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Monsky|1970}} More generally, it is known that [[centrally symmetric]] polygons and [[polyomino]]s have no odd equidissections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monsky|1990}}; {{harvnb|Praton|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conjecture by Stein&lt;!--{{harvtxt|Stein|1990}} missing ref--&gt; proposes that no ''special polygon'' has an odd equidissection, where a special polygon is one whose [[equivalence class]]es of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] edges each sum to the [[zero vector]]. Squares, [[Zonogon|centrally symmetric polygons]], [[polyomino]]s, and [[Polyhex (mathematics)|polyhexes]] are all special polygons.{{sfn|Stein|2004|p=20}}

For ''n'' &gt; 4, the spectrum of a regular ''n''-gon is &lt;math&gt;\langle n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Kasimatis|1989}} For ''n'' &gt; 1, the spectrum of an ''n''-dimensional cube is &lt;math&gt;\langle n! \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n''! is the [[factorial]] of ''n''.{{sfn|Mead|1979}}

Let ''T''(''a'') be a [[trapezoid]] where ''a'' is the ratio of parallel side lengths. If ''a'' is a [[rational number]], then ''T''(''a'') is principal. In fact, if ''r''/''s'' is a fraction in lowest terms, then &lt;math&gt;S(T(r/s)) = \langle r + s \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=122}} More generally, all [[convex polygon]]s with rational coordinates can be equidissected,{{sfn|Su|Ding|2003}} although not all of them are principal; see the above example of a kite with a vertex at (3/2, 3/2).

At the other extreme, if ''a'' is a [[transcendental number]], then ''T''(''a'') has no equidissection. More generally, no polygon whose vertex coordinates are [[algebraically independent]] has an equidissection.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Su|Ding|2003}} for more precise statements of this principle.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that [[almost all]] polygons with more than three sides cannot be equidissected. Although most polygons cannot be cut into equal-area triangles, all polygons can be cut into equal-area quadrilaterals.{{sfn|Hales|Straus|1982|p=42}}

If ''a'' is an [[algebraic number|algebraic]] [[irrational number]], then ''T''(''a'') is a trickier case. If ''a'' is algebraic of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] 2 or 3 ([[Quadratic irrational|quadratic]] or cubic), and its [[conjugate element (field theory)|conjugates]] all have positive [[real part]]s, then ''S''(''T''(''a'')) contains all sufficiently large ''n'' such that ''n''/(1 + ''a'') is an [[algebraic integer]].{{sfn|Jepsen|Monsky|2008}} It is conjectured that a similar condition involving [[stable polynomial]]s may determine whether or not the spectrum is empty for algebraic numbers ''a'' of all degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|2004|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Jepsen|Monsky|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of an equidissection seems like the kind of elementary geometric concept that should be quite old. {{harvtxt|Aigner|Ziegler|2010}} remark of Monsky's theorem, "one could have guessed that surely the answer must have been known for a long time (if not to the Greeks)."{{sfn|Aigner|Ziegler|2010|p=131}} But the study of equidissections did not begin until 1965, when Fred Richman was preparing a [[master's degree]] exam at [[New Mexico State University]].

===Monsky's theorem===
Richman wanted to include a question on geometry in the exam, and he noticed that it was difficult to find (what is now called) an odd equidissection of a square. Richman proved to himself that it was impossible for 3 or 5, that the existence of an ''n''-equidissection implies the existence of an {{nowrap|1=(''n'' + 2)}}-dissection, and that certain quadrilaterals arbitrarily close to being squares have odd equidissections.{{sfn|Thomas|1968|p=187}} However, he did not solve the general problem of odd equidissections of squares, and he left it off the exam. Richman's friend John Thomas became interested in the problem; in his recollection,

:"Everyone to whom the problem was put (myself included) said something like 'that is not my area but the question surely must have been considered and the answer is probably well known.' Some thought they had seen it, but could not remember where. I was interested because it reminded me of [[Sperner's Lemma]] in [[topology]], which has a clever odd-even proof."{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=107}}

Thomas proved that an odd equidissection was impossible if the coordinates of the vertices are rational numbers with odd denominators. He submitted this proof to ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'', but it was put on hold:

:"The referee's reaction was predictable. He thought the problem might be fairly easy (although he could not solve it) and was possibly well-known (although he could find no reference to it)."{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=108}}

The question was instead given as an Advanced Problem in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' {{harv|Richman|Thomas|1967}}. When nobody else submitted a solution, the proof was published in ''Mathematics Magazine'' {{harv|Thomas|1968}}, three years after it was written. {{harvtxt|Monsky|1970}} then built on Thomas' argument to prove that there are no odd equidissections of a square, without any rationality assumptions.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=108}}

Monsky's proof relies on two pillars: a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] result that generalizes Sperner's lemma and an [[algebra]]ic result, the existence of a [[p-adic valuation|2-adic valuation]] on the real numbers. A clever [[graph coloring|coloring]] of the plane then implies that in all dissections of the square, at least one triangle has an area with what amounts to an even denominator, and therefore all equidissections must be even. The essence of the argument is found already in {{harvtxt|Thomas|1968}}, but {{harvtxt|Monsky|1970}} was the first to use a 2-adic valuation to cover dissections with arbitrary coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monsky|1970|p=251}}; {{harvnb|Bekker|Netsvetaev|1998|p=3492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalizations===
The first generalization of Monsky's theorem was {{harvtxt|Mead|1979}}, who proved that the spectrum of an ''n''-dimensional cube is &lt;math&gt;\langle n! \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The proof is revisited by {{harvtxt|Bekker|Netsvetaev|1998}}.

Generalization to regular polygons arrived in 1985, during a geometry seminar run by G. D. Chakerian at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]]. Elaine Kasimatis, a graduate student, "was looking for some algebraic topic she could slip into" the seminar.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=120}} Sherman Stein suggested dissections of the square and the cube: "a topic that Chakerian grudgingly admitted was geometric."{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=120}} After her talk, Stein asked about regular pentagons. Kasimatis answered with {{harvtxt|Kasimatis|1989}}, proving that for ''n'' &gt; 5, the spectrum of a regular ''n''-gon is &lt;math&gt;\langle n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Her proof builds on Monsky's proof, extending the ''p''-adic valuation to the complex numbers for each prime divisor of ''n'' and applying some elementary results from the theory of [[cyclotomic field]]s. It is also the first proof to explicitly use an affine transformation to set up a convenient coordinate system.{{sfn|Stein|2004|p=18}} {{harvtxt|Kasimatis|Stein|1990}} then framed the problem of finding the spectrum of a general polygon, introducing the terms ''spectrum'' and ''principal''.{{sfn|Stein|Szabó|2008|p=120}} They proved that almost all polygons lack equidissections, and that not all polygons are principal.{{sfn|Kasimatis|Stein|1990}}

{{harvtxt|Kasimatis|Stein|1990}} began the study of the spectra of two particular generalizations of squares: trapezoids and kites. Trapezoids have been further studied by {{harvtxt|Jepsen|1996}}, {{harvtxt|Monsky|1996}}, and {{harvtxt|Jepsen|Monsky|2008}}. Kites have been further studied by {{harvtxt|Jepsen|Sedberry|Hoyer|2009}}. General quadrilaterals have been studied in {{harvtxt|Su|Ding|2003}}. Several papers have been authored at [[Hebei Normal University]], chiefly by Professor Ding Ren and his students Du Yatao and Su Zhanjun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Su|Ding|2003}}; {{harvnb|Du|Ding|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to generalize the results for regular ''n''-gons for even ''n'', {{harvtxt|Stein|1989}} conjectured that no centrally symmetric polygon has an odd equidissection, and he proved the ''n'' = 6 and ''n'' = 8 cases. The full conjecture was proved by {{harvtxt|Monsky|1990}}. A decade later, Stein made what he describes as "a surprising breakthrough", conjecturing that no polyomino has an odd equidissection. He proved the result of a polyomino with an odd number of squares in {{harvtxt|Stein|1999}}. The full conjecture was proved when {{harvtxt|Praton|2002}} treated the even case.

The topic of equidissections has recently been popularized by treatments in ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' {{harv|Stein|2004}}, a volume of the [[Carus Mathematical Monographs]] {{harv|Stein|Szabó|2008}}, and the fourth edition of ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]'' {{harv|Aigner|Ziegler|2010}}.

==Related problems==
{{harvtxt|Sakai|Nara|Urrutia|2005}} consider a variation of the problem: Given a convex polygon ''K'', how much of its area can be covered by ''n'' non-overlapping triangles of equal area inside ''K''? The ratio of the area of the best possible coverage to the area of ''K'' is denoted ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''). If ''K'' has an ''n''-equidissection, then ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') = 1; otherwise it is less than 1. The authors show that for a quadrilateral ''K'', ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') ≥ 4''n''/(4''n'' + 1), with ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') = 8/9 if and only if ''K'' is affinely congruent to the trapezoid ''T''(2/3). For a pentagon, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') ≥ 2/3, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') ≥ 3/4, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') ≥ 2''n''/(2''n'' + 1) for ''n'' ≥ 5.

[[Günter M. Ziegler]] asked the converse problem in 2003: Given a dissection of the whole of a polygon into ''n'' triangles, how close can the triangle areas be to equal? In particular, what is the smallest possible difference between the areas of the smallest and largest triangles? Let the smallest difference be ''M''(''n'') for a square and ''M''(''a'', ''n'') for the trapezoid ''T''(''a''). Then ''M''(''n'') is 0 for even ''n'' and greater than 0 for odd ''n''. {{harvtxt|Mansow|2003}} gave the asymptotic upper bound ''M''(''n'') = O(1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (see [[Big O notation]]).{{sfn|Schulze|2011|p=2}} {{harvtxt|Schulze|2011}} improves the bound to ''M''(''n'') = O(1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) with a better dissection, and he proves that there exist values of ''a'' for which ''M''(''a'', ''n'') decreases arbitrarily quickly. {{harvtxt|Labbé|Rote|Ziegler|2018}} obtain a superpolynomial upper bound, derived from an explicit construction that uses the [[Thue–Morse sequence]].

In [[logic]], two formulae are '''equisatisfiable''' if the first formula is [[satisfiable]] whenever the second is and vice versa; in other words, either both formulae are satisfiable or both are not. Equisatisfiable formulae may disagree, however, for a particular choice of variables. As a result, equisatisfiability is different  from [[logical equivalence]], as two equivalent formulae always have the same models.

Equisatisfiability is generally used in the context of translating formulae, so that one can define a translation to be correct if the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Examples of translations involving this concept are [[Skolemization]] and some translations into [[conjunctive normal form]]. 

==Examples==

A translation from propositional logic into propositional logic in which every binary disjunction &lt;math&gt;a \vee b&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;((a \vee n) \wedge (\neg n \vee b))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a new variable (one for each replaced disjunction) is a transformation in which satisfiability is preserved: the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Note that these two formulae are not equivalent: the first formula has the model in which &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is true while &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are false, and this is not a model of the second formula, in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has to be true in this case.

'''Formal epistemology''' uses formal methods from [[decision theory]], [[logic]], [[probability theory]] and [[computability theory]] to model and reason about issues of [[epistemological]] interest. Work in this area spans several academic fields, including [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[economics]], and [[statistics]]. The focus of formal epistemology has tended to differ somewhat from that of traditional epistemology, with topics like uncertainty, induction, and belief revision garnering more attention than the analysis of knowledge, skepticism, and issues with justification.

==History==
Though formally oriented epistemologists have been laboring since the emergence of [[formal logic]] and probability theory (if not earlier), only recently have they been organized under a common disciplinary title. This gain in popularity may be attributed to the organization of yearly Formal Epistemology Workshops by [[Branden Fitelson]] and [[Sahotra Sarkar]], starting in 2004, and the [[PHILOG]]-conferences starting in 2002 (The Network for Philosophical Logic and Its Applications) organized by [[Vincent F. Hendricks]]. Carnegie Mellon University's Philosophy Department hosts an annual summer school in logic and formal epistemology. In 2010, the department founded the [[Center for Formal Epistemology]].

==Topics==
Some of the topics that come under the heading of formal epistemology include:
* [[Ampliative inference]] (including [[inductive logic]]);
* [[Belief revision]] theory
* [[Game theory]] and decision theory;
* [[Algorithmic learning theory]] ([[computational epistemology]]);
* Formal approaches to [[paradoxes]] of belief and/or action;
* Formal models of epistemic states, like [[belief]] and [[uncertainty]];
* Formal theories of [[coherentism]] and confirmation;
* Foundations of probability and statistics.

== Definition ==
Frequent subtree mining is the problem of trying to find all of the patterns whose "support" is over a certain user-specified level, where "support" is calculated as the number of trees in a database which have at least one subtree [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a given pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Dai, H., Srikant, R. and Zhang, C. (2004). "[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2Fb97861 Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.]" ''8th Pacific-Asia Conference, PAKDD 2004, Sydney, Australia, May 26–28, 2004, Proceedings''. 1st ed. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal definition ===
The problem of frequent subtree mining has been formally defined as:&lt;ref name="Chi01" /&gt;

:Given a threshold ''minfreq'', a class of trees &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, a transitive subtree relation &lt;math&gt;P\preceq T&lt;/math&gt; between trees &lt;math&gt;P, T \in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, a finite set of trees &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the frequent subtree mining problem is the problem of finding all trees &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that no two trees in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; are isomorphic and 
::&lt;math&gt;\forall P\in\mathcal{P} : \quad \mathrm{freq}(P, \mathcal{D}) = \sum\nolimits_{T \in \mathcal{D}} d(P,T)\geq \mathrm{minfreq},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{mvar|d}} is an anti-monotone function such that if &lt;math&gt;P' \preceq P&lt;/math&gt; then
::&lt;math&gt;\forall T\in\mathcal{C} : \quad d(P',T)\geq d(P,T).&lt;/math&gt;

== Algorithms ==

In 2002, Mohammed J. Zaki introduced TreeMiner, an efficient algorithm for solving the frequent subtree mining problem, which used a "scope list" to represent tree nodes and which was contrasted with PatternMatcher, an algorithm based on pattern matching.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = //dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=775058|title = Efficiently mining frequent trees in a forest|last = Zaki|first = Mohammed J.|journal = Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining|accessdate = 16 June 2014|year = 2002|pages = 71–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Domains in which frequent subtree mining is useful tend to involve complex relationships between data entities: for instance, the analysis of XML documents often requires frequent subtree mining.&lt;ref name="Chi01" /&gt; Another domain where this is useful is the web usage mining problem: since the actions taken by users when visiting a web site can be recorded and categorized in many different ways, complex databases of trees need to be analyzed with frequent subtree mining.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other domains in which frequent subtree mining is useful include computational biology,&lt;ref name="Dee13"&gt;Deepak, Akshay, David Fernández-Baca, Srikanta Tirthapura, Michael J. Sanderson, and Michelle M. McMahon. "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-013-0676-0 EvoMiner: frequent subtree mining in phylogenetic databases]."

== Challenges ==
Checking whether a pattern (or a transaction) supports a given subgraph is an [[NP-complete]] problem, since it is an NP-complete instance of the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]].&lt;ref name="Chi04"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/2003-reports/030043.pdf|title = Mining Frequent Rooted Trees and Free Trees Using Canonical Forms|last = Chi|first = Yun|journal = Knowledge and Information Systems|accessdate = 16 June 2014|year = 2004|last2 = Yang|first2 = Yirong|last3 = Muntz|first3 = Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to [[combinatorial explosion]], according to Lei et al., "mining all frequent subtree patterns becomes infeasible for a large and dense tree database".&lt;ref name="Zou06"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Zou |first1=Lei |last2=Lu |first2=Yansheng |last3=Zhang |first3=Huaming |last4=Hu |first4=Rong |date=2006 |title=Mining Frequent Induced Subtree Patterns with Subtree-Constraint |book-title=Sixth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops |conference=ICDM Workshops 2006 |pages=3–7 |doi=10.1109/ICDMW.2006.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

For a set ''E'' of equations, its '''deductive closure''' ({{Overunderset|⟷|⁎|''E''}})  is the set of all equations that can be derived by applying equations from ''E'' in any order.
Formally, ''E'' is considered a [[binary relation]], ({{underset|''E''|⟶}}) is its [[rewrite closure]], and ({{Overunderset|⟷|⁎|''E''}}) is the [[equivalence closure]] of ({{underset|''E''|⟶}}).
For a set ''R'' of rewrite rules, its '''deductive closure''' ({{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}} ∘ {{Overunderset|⟵|⁎|''R''}}) is the set of all equations than can be confirmed by applying rules from ''R'' left-to-right to both sides until they are literally equal.
Formally, ''R'' is again viewed as binary relation, ({{underset|''R''|⟶}}) is its rewrite closure, ({{underset|''R''|⟵}}) is its [[converse relation|converse]], and ({{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}} ∘ {{Overunderset|⟵|⁎|''R''}}) is the [[relation composition]] of their [[reflexive transitive closure]]s ({{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}} and {{Overunderset|⟵|⁎|''R''}}).

For example, if {{math|1=''E'' = {{mset|1= 1⋅''x'' = ''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x'' = 1, (''x''⋅''y'')⋅''z'' = ''x''⋅(''y''⋅''z'') }}}} are the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] axioms, the derivation chain
:{{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅(''a''⋅''b'') &amp;nbsp; {{Overunderset|⟷|⁎|''E''}} &amp;nbsp; (''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''a'')⋅''b'' &amp;nbsp; {{Overunderset|⟷|⁎|''E''}} &amp;nbsp; 1⋅''b'' &amp;nbsp; {{Overunderset|⟷|⁎|''E''}} &amp;nbsp; ''b''}}
demonstrates that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅(''a''⋅''b'')  {{Overunderset|⟷|⁎|''E''}} ''b'' is a member of ''E'''s deductive closure.
If {{math|1=''R'' = {{mset| 1⋅''x'' → ''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x'' → 1, (''x''⋅''y'')⋅''z'' → ''x''⋅(''y''⋅''z'') }}}} is a "rewrite rule" version of ''E'', the derivation chains
:{{math|(''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''a'')⋅''b'' &amp;nbsp; {{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}} &amp;nbsp;  1⋅''b'' &amp;nbsp; {{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}} &amp;nbsp; ''b''  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; ''b'' &amp;nbsp; {{Overunderset|⟵|⁎|''R''}} &amp;nbsp; ''b''⋅1}}
demonstrate that (''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''a'')⋅''b'' {{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}}∘{{Overunderset|⟵|⁎|''R''}} ''b''⋅1 is a member of ''R'''s deductive closure.
However, there is no way to derive ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅(''a''⋅''b'') {{Overunderset|⟶|⁎|''R''}}∘{{Overunderset|⟵|⁎|''R''}} ''b'' similar to above, since a right-to-left application of the rule {{math|(''x''⋅''y'')⋅''z'' → ''x''⋅(''y''⋅''z'')}} is not allowed.

The Knuth–Bendix algorithm takes a set ''E'' of equations between [[term (logic)|terms]], and a [[reduction ordering]] (&gt;) on the set of all terms, and attempts to construct a confluent and terminating term rewriting system ''R'' that has the same deductive closure as ''E''.
While proving consequences from ''E'' often requires human intuition, proving consequences from ''R'' does not.
For more details, see [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)#Motivating examples]], which gives an example proof from group theory, performed both using ''E'' and using ''R''.

==Rules==

Given a set ''E'' of equations between [[term (logic)|terms]], the following inference rules can be used to transform it into an equivalent [[convergent term rewrite system]] (if possible):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Bachmair, L., Dershowitz, N., Hsiang, J.| chapter=Orderings for Equational Proofs| title=Proc. IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science|date=Jun 1986| pages=346–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=N. Dershowitz, [[J.-P.

They are based on a user-given [[reduction ordering]] (&gt;) on the set of all terms; it is lifted to a well-founded ordering (▻) on the set of rewrite rules by defining {{math|(''s'' → ''t'') ▻ (''l'' → ''r'')}} if 
* {{math|''s'' [[encompassment ordering|{{underset|e|&gt;}}]] ''l''}}, or
* {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|l}} are [[variant (logic)|literally similar]] and {{math|''t'' &gt; ''r''}}.

==Example==

The following example run, obtained from the [[E theorem prover]], computes a completion of the (additive) group axioms as in Knuth, Bendix (1970).
It starts with the three initial equations for the group (neutral element 0, inverse elements, associativity), using &lt;code&gt;f(X,Y)&lt;/code&gt; for ''X''+''Y'', and &lt;code&gt;i(X)&lt;/code&gt; for −''X''. 
The 10 equations marked with "final" represent the resulting convergent rewrite system.
"pm" is short for "paramodulation", implementing ''deduce''. Critical pair computation is an instance of paramodulation for equational unit clauses.
"rw" is rewriting, implementing ''compose'', ''collapse'', and ''simplify''.

==String rewriting systems in group theory==

An important case in [[computational group theory]] are string rewriting systems which can be used to give canonical labels to elements or [[coset]]s of a [[finitely presented group]] as products of the [[Generating set of a group|generator]]s.  This special case is the focus of this section.

=== Motivation in group theory ===
The [[critical pair lemma]] states that a term rewriting system is [[confluence (term rewriting)|locally confluent]] (or weakly confluent) if and only if all its [[critical pair (logic)|critical pairs]] are convergent. Furthermore, we have [[Newman's lemma]] which states that if an (abstract) rewriting system is [[normal form (term rewriting)|strongly normalizing]] and weakly confluent, then the rewriting system is confluent. So, if we can add rules to the term rewriting system in order to force all critical pairs to be convergent while maintaining the strong normalizing property, then this will force the resultant rewriting system to be confluent.

Consider a [[finitely presented monoid]] &lt;math&gt;M = \langle X \mid R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; where X is a finite set of generators and R is a set of defining relations on X.  Let X&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; be the set of all words in X (i.e. the free monoid generated by X).  Since the relations R generate an equivalence relation on X*, one can consider elements of M to be the equivalence classes of X&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; under R.  For each class ''{w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }'' it is desirable to choose a standard representative ''w&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.  This representative is called the '''canonical''' or '''normal form''' for each word ''w&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the class.  If there is a computable method to determine for each ''w&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' its normal form ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' then the word problem is easily solved.  A confluent rewriting system allows one to do precisely this.

Although the choice of a canonical form can theoretically be made in an arbitrary fashion this approach is generally not computable.  (Consider that an equivalence relation on a language can produce an infinite number of infinite classes.)  If the language is [[well-ordered]] then the order &lt; gives a consistent method for defining minimal representatives, however computing these representatives may still not be possible.  In particular, if a rewriting system is used to calculate minimal representatives then the order &lt; should also have the property:

: A &lt; B → XAY &lt; XBY for all words A,B,X,Y

This property is called '''translation invariance'''.  An order that is both translation-invariant and a well-order is called a '''reduction order'''.

From the presentation of the monoid it is possible to define a rewriting system given by the relations R.  If A x B is in R then either A&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;B in which case B&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;A is a rule in the rewriting system, otherwise A&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;B and A&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;B.  Since &lt; is a reduction order a given word W can be reduced W &gt; W_1 &gt; ... &gt; W_n where W_n is irreducible under the rewriting system.  However, depending on the rules that are applied at each W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;W&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; it is possible to end up with two different irreducible reductions W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;W'&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of W.  However, if the rewriting system given by the relations is converted to a confluent rewriting system via the Knuth–Bendix algorithm, then all reductions are guaranteed to produce the same irreducible word, namely the normal form for that word.

===Description of the algorithm for finitely presented monoids===

Suppose we are given a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] &lt;math&gt; \langle X \mid R \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[generating set of a group|generator]]s and &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] giving the rewriting system.  Suppose further that we have a reduction ordering &lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt; among the words generated by &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;(e.g., [[shortlex order]]).  For each relation &lt;math&gt; P_i = Q_i &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;, suppose &lt;math&gt; Q_i &lt; P_i &lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we begin with the set of reductions &lt;math&gt; P_i \rightarrow Q_i &lt;/math&gt;.

First, if any relation &lt;math&gt; P_i = Q_i &lt;/math&gt; can be reduced, replace &lt;math&gt; P_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q_i &lt;/math&gt; with the reductions.

Next, we add more reductions (that is, rewriting rules) to eliminate possible exceptions of confluence.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt; P_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; i \neq j &lt;/math&gt;, overlap.

# Case 1: either the prefix of &lt;math&gt; P_i&lt;/math&gt; equals the suffix of &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt;, or vice versa.  In the former case, we can write &lt;math&gt; P_i = BC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_j = AB &lt;/math&gt;; in the latter case, &lt;math&gt; P_i = AB &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_j = BC &lt;/math&gt;.
#Case 2: either &lt;math&gt; P_i&lt;/math&gt; is completely contained in (surrounded by)  &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt;, or vice versa. In the former case, we can write &lt;math&gt; P_i = B &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_j = ABC &lt;/math&gt;; in the latter case, &lt;math&gt; P_i = ABC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_j = B &lt;/math&gt;.

Reduce the word &lt;math&gt; ABC &lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt; P_i &lt;/math&gt; first, then using &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt; first.  Call the results &lt;math&gt; r_1, r_2 &lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  If &lt;math&gt; r_1 \neq r_2 &lt;/math&gt;, then we have an instance where confluence could fail.  Hence, add the reduction &lt;math&gt; \max r_1, r_2 \rightarrow \min r_1, r_2 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;.

After adding a rule to &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;, remove any rules in &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; that might have reducible left sides.

Repeat the procedure until all overlapping left sides have been checked.

===Examples===

==== A terminating example ====
Consider the monoid: 
:&lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \mid x^3 = y^3 = (xy)^3 = 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.  
We use the [[shortlex order]]. This is an infinite monoid but nevertheless, the Knuth–Bendix algorithm is able to solve the word problem.

Our beginning three reductions are therefore
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; x^3 \rightarrow 1 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}} 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; y^3 \rightarrow 1 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; (xy)^3 \rightarrow 1 &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

A suffix of &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; (namely &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) is a prefix of &lt;math&gt;(xy)^3=xyxyxy&lt;/math&gt;, so consider the word &lt;math&gt; x^3yxyxy &lt;/math&gt;.  Reducing using ({{EquationNote|1}}), we get &lt;math&gt; yxyxy &lt;/math&gt;.  Reducing using ({{EquationNote|3}}), we get &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, we get &lt;math&gt; yxyxy = x^2 &lt;/math&gt;, giving the reduction rule

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; yxyxy \rightarrow x^2 &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

Similarly, using &lt;math&gt; xyxyxy^3 &lt;/math&gt; and reducing using ({{EquationNote|2}}) and ({{EquationNote|3}}), we get &lt;math&gt; xyxyx = y^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Hence the reduction

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; xyxyx \rightarrow y^2 &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

Both of these rules obsolete ({{EquationNote|3}}), so we remove it.

Next, consider &lt;math&gt; x^3yxyx &lt;/math&gt; by overlapping ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|5}}). Reducing we get &lt;math&gt; yxyx = x^2y^2 &lt;/math&gt;, so we add the rule

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; yxyx \rightarrow x^2y^2&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
Considering &lt;math&gt; xyxyx^3 &lt;/math&gt; by overlapping ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|5}}), we get &lt;math&gt; xyxy = y^2x^2 &lt;/math&gt;, so we add the rule

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; y^2x^2 \rightarrow xyxy &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
These obsolete rules ({{EquationNote|4}}) and ({{EquationNote|5}}), so we remove them.

Now, we are left with the rewriting system
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; x^3 \rightarrow 1 &lt;/math&gt;|({{EquationNote|1}})|RawN=.}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; y^3 \rightarrow 1 &lt;/math&gt;|({{EquationNote|2}})|RawN=.}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; yxyx \rightarrow x^2y^2 &lt;/math&gt;|({{EquationNote|6}})|RawN=.}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; y^2 x^2 \rightarrow xyxy &lt;/math&gt;.|({{EquationNote|7}})|RawN=.}}

Checking the overlaps of these rules, we find no potential failures of confluence.  Therefore, we have a confluent rewriting system, and the algorithm terminates successfully.

==== A non-terminating example ====
The order of the generators may crucially affect whether the Knuth–Bendix completion terminates. As an example, consider the [[free Abelian group]] by the monoid presentation:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y, x^{-1}, y^{-1}\, |\, xy=yx, xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = yy^{-1} = y^{-1}y = 1 \rangle  .&lt;/math&gt;

The Knuth–Bendix completion with respect to lexicographic order &lt;math&gt;x &lt; x^{-1} &lt; y &lt; y^ {-1}&lt;/math&gt; finishes with a convergent system, however considering the length-lexicographic order &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt; x^{-1} &lt; y^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; it does not finish for there are no finite convergent systems compatible with this latter order.&lt;ref name="BogopolskiBumagin2011"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Oleg Bogopolski, Inna Bumagin, Olga Kharlampovich, Enric Ventura|title=Combinatorial and Geometric Group Theory: Dortmund and Ottawa-Montreal conferences|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7643-9911-5|page=62|chapter=Geodesic Rewriting Systems and Pregroups|authors=V. Diekert, A.J. Duncan, A.G. Myasnikov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

If Knuth–Bendix does not succeed, it will either run forever, or fail when it encounters an unorientable equation (i.e. an equation that it cannot turn into a rewrite rule). The enhanced [[completion without failure]] will not fail on unorientable equations and provides a [[semi-decision procedure]] for the word problem.

The notion of [[logged rewriting]] discussed in the paper by Heyworth and Wensley listed below allows some recording or logging of the rewriting process as it proceeds. This is useful for computing identities among relations for presentations of groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2213">In [[mathematics]], '''Kronecker's lemma''' (see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Shiryaev|1996|loc=Lemma IV.3.2}}) is a result about the relationship between convergence of [[infinite sum]]s and convergence of sequences. The lemma is often used in the proofs of theorems concerning sums of independent random variables such as the strong [[Law of large numbers]]. The lemma is named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Leopold Kronecker]].

== The lemma ==
If &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite sequence of real numbers such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^\infty x_m = s&lt;/math&gt; 
exists and is finite, then we have for all &lt;math&gt;0&lt;b_1 \leq b_2 \leq b_3 \leq \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; that 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=1}^n b_kx_k = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
Let &lt;math&gt;S_k&lt;/math&gt; denote the partial sums of the ''x'''s. Using [[summation by parts]],
: &lt;math&gt;\frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=1}^n b_k x_k = S_n - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)S_k&lt;/math&gt;
Pick any ''ε'' &gt; 0. Now choose ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;S_k&lt;/math&gt; is ''ε''-close to ''s'' for ''k'' &gt; ''N''. This can be done as the sequence &lt;math&gt;S_k&lt;/math&gt; converges to ''s''. Then the right hand side is:
: &lt;math&gt;S_n - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)S_k - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=N}^{n-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)S_k&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= S_n - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)S_k - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=N}^{n-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)s - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=N}^{n-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)(S_k - s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= S_n - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)S_k - \frac{b_n-b_N}{b_n}s - \frac1{b_n}\sum_{k=N}^{n-1}(b_{k+1} - b_k)(S_k - s).&lt;/math&gt;
Now, let ''n'' go to infinity. The first term goes to ''s'', which cancels with the third term. The second term goes to zero (as the sum is a fixed value). Since the ''b'' sequence is increasing, the last term is bounded by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon (b_n - b_N)/b_n \leq \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">In [[mathematics]], '''Kummer's congruences''' are some [[Congruence relation|congruence]]s involving [[Bernoulli numbers]], found by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Ernst Eduard Kummer|first=Ernst Eduard|last= Kummer|year=1851}}.

{{harvtxt|Kubota|Leopoldt|1964}} used Kummer's congruences to define the [[p-adic zeta function]].

==Statement==

The simplest form of Kummer's congruence states that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{B_h}{h}\equiv \frac{B_k}{k} \pmod p \text{ whenever } h\equiv k \pmod {p-1}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is a prime, ''h'' and ''k'' are positive even integers not divisible by ''p''−1 and the numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Bernoulli numbers]].

More generally if ''h'' and ''k'' are positive even integers not divisible by  ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, then
:&lt;math&gt; (1-p^{h-1})\frac{B_h}{h}\equiv (1-p^{k-1})\frac{B_k}{k} \pmod {p^{a+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
whenever
:&lt;math&gt; h\equiv k\pmod {\varphi(p^{a+1})}&lt;/math&gt;

where φ(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''a''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the [[Euler totient function]], evaluated at ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''a''+1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''a'' is a non negative integer. At ''a'' = 0, the expression takes the simpler form, as seen above.
The two sides of the Kummer congruence are essentially values of the [[p-adic zeta function]], and the Kummer congruences imply that the ''p''-adic zeta function for negative integers is continuous, so can be extended by continuity to all ''p''-adic integers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3611">The '''Lorenz asymmetry coefficient''' (LAC) is a [[summary statistic]] of the [[Lorenz curve]] that measures the degree of asymmetry of the curve. The Lorenz curve is used to describe the inequality in the distribution of a quantity (usually income or wealth in economics, or size or reproductive output in ecology). The most common summary statistic for the Lorenz curve is the Gini coefficient, which is an overall measure of inequality within the population.  The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient can be a useful supplement to the Gini coefficient. The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;S = F(\mu)+ L(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

where the functions ''F'' and ''L'' are defined as for the [[Lorenz curve]], and ''μ'' is the mean. If ''S''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, then the point where the Lorenz curve is parallel with the line of equality is above the axis of symmetry. Correspondingly, if ''S''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, then the point where the Lorenz curve is parallel to the line of equality is below the axis of symmetry.

If data arise from the [[log-normal distribution]], then ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, i.e., the Lorenz curve is symmetric.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;Damgaard &amp; Weiner (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample statistic ''S'' can be calculated from ''n'' ordered size data, &lt;math&gt;(x_1, ..., x_m,x_{m+1},..., x_n) &lt;/math&gt;, using the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\frac{\mu - x_m}{x_{m+1} - x_m}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F(\mu)=\frac{m + \delta}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\mu)=\frac{L_m + \delta  x_{m+1}}{L_n}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''m'' is the number of individuals with a size or wealth less than&amp;nbsp;''μ''&lt;ref name=DW/&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_i=\sum_{j=1}^i x_j&lt;/math&gt;. However, if one or more of the data size is equal to ''μ'', then S has to defined as an interval instead of a number (see [[#LAC interval when some data is equal to μ]]).

The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient characterizes an important aspect of the shape of a Lorenz curve. It tells which size or wealth classes contribute most to the population’s total inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. If the LAC is less than 1, the inequality is primarily due to the relatively many small or poor individuals. If the LAC is greater than 1, the inequality is primarily due to the few largest or wealthiest individuals.

For incomes distributed according to a [[log-normal distribution]], the LAC is identically 1.

==LAC interval when some data is equal to μ==

The above formulas assume that none of the data values are equal to ''μ''; strictly speaking we assume that data sizes are continuously distributed, so that &lt;math&gt;P(x_i = \mu) \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, if one or more of &lt;math&gt;x_i = \mu&lt;/math&gt;, then a section of the Lorenz curve is parallel to the diagonal, and S has to be defined as an interval instead of a number. The interval can be defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
\left [ \frac{m}{n} + \frac{L_m}{L_n}, \frac{m+a}{n} + \frac{L_{m+a}}{n} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the number of data values that are equal to ''μ''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">In [[mathematics]], a '''Markov information source''', or simply, a '''Markov source''', is an [[information source (mathematics)|information source]] whose underlying dynamics are given by a stationary finite [[Markov chain]].

==Formal definition==
An '''information source''' is a sequence of [[random variable]]s ranging over a finite alphabet &amp;Gamma;, having a [[stationary distribution]].

A Markov information source is then a (stationary) Markov chain ''M'', together with a function

:&lt;math&gt;f:S\to \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;

that maps states ''S'' in the Markov chain to letters in the alphabet &amp;Gamma;.

A '''unifilar Markov source''' is a Markov source for which the values &lt;math&gt;f(s_k)&lt;/math&gt; are distinct whenever each of the states &lt;math&gt;s_k&lt;/math&gt; are reachable, in one step, from a common prior state.  Unifilar sources are notable in that many of their properties are far more easily analyzed, as compared to the general case.

==Applications==
Markov sources are commonly used in [[communication theory]], as a model of a [[transmitter]]. Markov sources also occur in [[natural language processing]], where they are used to represent hidden meaning in a text.  Given the output of a Markov source, whose underlying Markov chain is unknown, the task of solving for the underlying chain is undertaken by the techniques of [[hidden Markov model]]s, such as the [[Viterbi algorithm]].

'''''Mathematics Magazine''''' is a [[peer review|refereed]] bimonthly publication of the [[Mathematical Association of America]].  Its intended audience is teachers of collegiate mathematics, especially at the junior/senior level, and their students. It is explicitly a journal of mathematics rather than pedagogy. Rather than articles in the terse "theorem-proof" style of [[research]] journals, it seeks articles which provide a context for the mathematics they deliver, with examples, applications, illustrations, and historical background.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Moving average crossover.png|thumb|right|Moving average crossover of a 15-day exponential close-price MA (red) crossing over a 50-day exponential close-price MA (yellow)]]

In the [[statistics]] of [[time series]], and in particular the [[statistical finance|analysis of financial time series]] for [[stock trading]] purposes, a '''moving-average crossover''' occurs when, on plotting two [[moving average]]s each based on different degrees of smoothing, the traces of these moving averages cross. It does not predict future direction but shows trends. This indicator uses two (or more) moving averages, a slower moving average and a faster moving average. The faster moving average is a short term moving average. For end-of-day stock markets, for example, it may be 5-, 10- or 25-day period while the slower moving average is medium or long term moving average (e.g. 50-, 100- or 200-day period). A short term moving average is '''faster''' because it only considers prices over short period of time and is thus more reactive to daily price changes. On the other hand, a long term moving average is deemed '''slower''' as it encapsulates prices over a longer period and is more lethargic. However, it tends to smooth out price noises which are often reflected in short term moving averages.

A moving average, as a line by itself, is often overlaid in price charts to indicate price trends. A crossover occurs when a faster moving average (i.e., a shorter period moving average) crosses a slower moving average (i.e. a longer period moving average). In other words, this is when the shorter period moving average line crosses a longer period moving average line. In stock investing, this meeting point is used either to enter (buy or sell) or exit (sell or buy) the market.

The particular case where simple equally weighted moving-averages are used is sometimes called a '''simple moving-average (SMA) crossover'''. Such a crossover can be used to signal a change in trend and can be used to trigger a trade in a [[Black box|Black Box]] trading system.

==Notes==
&lt;big&gt;Golden cross-&lt;/big&gt;There are several types of moving average cross traders use in trading. When 200 days simple moving average cross 50 days simple moving average it is called a golden cross. The golden cross is widely accepted.

&lt;big&gt;Silver cross-&lt;/big&gt;When 50 Exponential moving average cross above or below 100 exponential moving average it is known as a silver cross. Silver cross invented by a Successful forex trader S.A.Hasib. S.A.Hasib believe that exponential moving average helps to understand current market conditions. The exponential moving average also acts as a dynamic support and resistance.

The '''Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics''' is a [[Braille code]] for encoding mathematical and scientific notation linearly using standard six-dot [[Braille cell]]s for tactile reading by the visually impaired. The code was developed by [[Abraham Nemeth]]. The Nemeth Code was first written up in 1952. It was revised in 1956, 1965, and 1972,&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Nemeth Code|url=http://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/fr/fr28/fr280110.htm|accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beginning in 1992 was integrated into [[Unified English Braille]]. It is an example of a compact human-readable [[markup language]].

Nemeth Braille is just one code used to write mathematics in braille. There are many systems in use around the world.&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite web|title=Braille Mathematical Notations|url=http://chezdom.net/blog/?page_id=51|accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of the Nemeth Code ==
The Nemeth Code Book (1972) opens with the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation has been prepared to provide a system of symbols which will allow technical literature to be presented and read in braille. The Code is intended to convey as accurate an impression as is possible to the braille reader of the corresponding printed text, and this is one of its principal features. When the braille reader has a clear conception of the corresponding printed text, the area of communication between himself and his teacher, his colleagues, his associates, and the world at large is greatly broadened. ''A test of the accuracy with which the Code conveys information from the print to the braille text is to effect a transcription in the reverse direction. The amount of agreement between the original printed text and one transcribed from the braille is a measure of the Code's accuracy''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=codebook&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation 1972 Revision |url=http://www.brailleauthority.org/mathscience/nemeth1972.pdf |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence is that the braille transcriber does not need to know the underlying mathematics.
The braille transcriber needs to identify the inkprint symbols and know how to render them in
Nemeth Code braille. For example, if the same math symbol might have two different meanings, this would
not matter; both instances would be brailled the same. This is in contrast to the International
Braille Music Code, where the braille depends on the meaning of the inkprint music. Thus a knowledge of
music is required to produce braille music.

[[Image:Change of axes.svg|thumb|right|Changing orientation of a [[rigid body]] is the same as [[rotation (mathematics)|rotating]] the axes of a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] attached to it.]]

In [[geometry]] the '''orientation''', '''angular position''', or '''attitude''' of an object such as a [[Line (geometry)|line]], [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or [[rigid body]] is part of the description of how it is placed in the [[Euclidean space|space]] it occupies.&lt;ref name=Moores&gt;
{{cite book |title=Structural Geology |page=11 |author1=Robert J. Twiss |author2=Eldridge M. Moores |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14fn03iJ2r8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=attitude+plane+orientation&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=attitude%20plane%20orientation&amp;f=false |chapter=§2.1 The orientation of structures |quote=...the attitude of a plane or a line — that is, its orientation in space — is fundamental to the description of structures. |isbn=0-7167-2252-6 |year=1992 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Namely, it is the imaginary [[rotation]] that is needed to move the object from a reference placement to its current placement. A rotation may not be enough to reach the current placement. It may be necessary to add an imaginary [[translation (geometry)|translation]], called the object's location (or position, or linear position). The location and orientation together fully describe how the object is placed in space. The above-mentioned imaginary rotation and translation may be thought to occur in any order, as the orientation of an object does not change when it translates, and its location does not change when it rotates.

[[Euler's rotation theorem]] shows that in three dimensions any orientation can be reached with a single [[rotation around a fixed axis]]. This gives one common way of representing the orientation using an [[axis–angle representation]]. Other widely used methods include [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation quaternions]], [[Euler angles]], or [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]. More specialist uses include [[Miller indices]] in crystallography, [[strike and dip]] in geology and [[grade (slope)|grade]] on maps and signs.

Typically, the orientation is given relative to a [[frame of reference]], usually specified by a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Mathematical representations==

=== Three dimensions ===
In general the position and orientation in space of a [[rigid body]] are defined as the position and orientation, relative to the main reference frame, of another reference frame, which is fixed relative to the body, and hence translates and rotates with it (the body's ''local reference frame'', or ''local coordinate system''). At least three independent values are needed to describe the orientation of this local frame. Three other values are 
All the points of the body change their position during a rotation except for those lying on the rotation axis. If the rigid body has [[rotational symmetry]] not all orientations are distinguishable, except by observing how the orientation evolves in time from a known starting orientation.  For example, the orientation in space of a [[Line (geometry)|line]], [[line segment]], or [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] can be specified with only two values, for example two [[direction cosines]]. Another example is the position of a point on the earth, often described using the orientation of a line joining it with the earth's center, measured using the two angles of [[longitude and latitude]].  Likewise, the orientation of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] can be described with two values as well, for instance by specifying the orientation of a line [[surface normal|normal]] to that plane, or by using the strike and dip angles.

Further details about the mathematical methods to represent the orientation of rigid bodies and planes in three dimensions are given in the following sections.

=== Two dimensions ===
In [[two dimensions]] the orientation of any object (line, vector, or [[plane figure]]) is given by a single value: the angle through which it has rotated. There is only one degree of freedom and only one fixed point about which the rotation takes place.

== Rigid body in three dimensions ==
{{Main|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions}}

Several methods to describe orientations of a rigid body in three dimensions have been developed. They are summarized in the following sections.

===Euler angles===
{{Main|Euler angles}}
[[File:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|150px|Euler angles, one of the possible ways to describe an orientation]]
The first attempt to represent an orientation was owed to [[Leonhard Euler]]. He imagined three reference frames that could rotate one around the other, and realized that by starting with a fixed reference frame and performing three rotations, he could get any other reference frame in the space (using two rotations to fix the vertical axis and another to fix the other two axes). The values of these three rotations are called [[Euler angles]].

====Tait–Bryan angles====
{{Main|Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles}}
[[File:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|left|150px|Tait–Bryan angles. Other way for describing orientation]]
These are three angles, also known as yaw, pitch and roll, Navigation angles and Cardan angles. Mathematically they constitute a set of six possibilities inside the twelve possible sets of Euler angles, the ordering being the one best used for describing the orientation of a vehicle such as an airplane. In aerospace engineering they are usually referred to as Euler angles.

[[File:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|150px|A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]

===Orientation vector {{anchor|Euler vector|Euler orientation vector}}===
{{Main|Axis–angle representation}}
Euler also realized that the composition of two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation about a different fixed axis ([[Euler's rotation theorem]]). Therefore, the composition of the former three angles has to be equal to only one rotation, whose axis was complicated to calculate until matrices were developed.

Based on this fact he introduced a vectorial way to describe any rotation, with a vector on the rotation axis and module equal to the value of the angle. Therefore, any orientation can be represented by a rotation vector (also called Euler vector) that leads to it from the reference frame. When used to represent an orientation, the rotation vector is commonly called orientation vector, or attitude vector.

A similar method, called [[axis–angle representation]], describes a rotation or orientation using a [[unit vector]] aligned with the rotation axis, and a separate value to indicate the angle (see figure).

===Orientation matrix===
{{Main|Rotation matrix}}
With the introduction of matrices the Euler theorems were rewritten. The rotations were described by [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] referred to as rotation matrices or direction cosine matrices. When used to represent an orientation, a rotation matrix is commonly called orientation matrix, or attitude matrix.

The above-mentioned Euler vector is the [[eigenvector]] of a rotation matrix (a rotation matrix has a unique real [[eigenvalue]]). 
The product of two rotation matrices is the composition of rotations. Therefore, as before, the orientation can be given as the rotation from the initial frame to achieve the frame that we want to describe.

The [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of a non-[[symmetry|symmetrical]] object in ''n''-dimensional space is [[Orthogonal group|SO(''n'')]] [[Product topology|&amp;times;]] [[Euclidean space|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Orientation may be visualized by attaching a basis of [[tangent space|tangent vectors]] to an object. The direction in which each vector points determines its orientation.

===Orientation quaternion===
{{Main|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}
Another way to describe rotations is using [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation quaternions]], also called versors. They are equivalent to rotation matrices and rotation vectors. With respect to rotation vectors, they can be more easily converted to and from matrices. When used to represent orientations, rotation quaternions are typically called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions.

== Plane in three dimensions ==

===Miller indices===
{{Main|Miller index}}
[[File:Miller Indices Cubes.svg|thumb|150px|Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals]]
The attitude of a [[lattice plane]] is the orientation of the line normal to the plane,&lt;ref name=Granville&gt;
{{cite book |author=William Anthony Granville |title=Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus |page=275 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jcAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA275 |chapter=§178 Normal line to a surface |publisher=Ginn &amp; Company |year=1904}}

&lt;/ref&gt; and is described by the plane's [[Miller indices]]. In three-space a family of planes (a series of parallel planes) can be denoted by its [[Miller indices]] (''hkl''),&lt;ref name=Love&gt;

{{cite book |title=A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity| volume=1 |author=Augustus Edward Hough Love |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-GkSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |page=79 ''ff'' |year=1892 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladd&gt;

{{cite book |author1=Marcus Frederick Charles Ladd |author2=Rex Alfred Palmer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNJrAe36BBMC&amp;pg=PA62 |chapter=§2.3 Families of planes and interplanar spacings |page=62 ''ff'' |isbn=0-306-47454-9 |edition=4th |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |title=Structure Determination by X-Ray Crystallography}}

&lt;/ref&gt; so the family of planes has an attitude common to all its constituent planes.

===Strike and dip===
{{Main|Strike and dip}}
[[File:StrikeLine&amp;Dip.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Strike line and dip of a plane describing attitude relative to a horizontal plane and a vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line]]
Many features observed in geology are planes or lines, and their orientation is commonly referred to as their ''attitude''. These attitudes are specified with two angles.

For a line, these angles are called the ''trend'' and the ''plunge''. The trend is the compass direction of the line, and the plunge is the downward angle it makes with a horizontal plane.&lt;ref name=Rowland&gt;

{{cite book |title=Structural Analysis and Synthesis: A Laboratory Course in Structural Geology |author1=Stephen Mark Rowland |author2=Ernest M. Duebendorfer |author3=Ilsa M. Schiefelbein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWnmBEtmg2MC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=%22attitude+of+a+line%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22attitude%20of%20a%20line%22&amp;f=false |chapter=Attitudes of lines and planes |isbn=1-4051-1652-8 |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, |year=2007 |page=1 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a plane, the two angles are called its ''strike (angle)'' and its ''dip (angle)''. A ''strike line'' is the intersection of a horizontal plane with the observed planar feature (and therefore a horizontal line), and the strike angle is the ''bearing'' of this line (that is, relative to [[True north|geographic north]] or from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]]). The dip is the angle between a horizontal plane and the observed planar feature as observed in a third vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line.

==Usage examples==

===Rigid body===
{{Main|Rigid body}}
[[File:plane.svg|thumb|150px|The orientation of a rigid body is determined by three angles]]
The attitude of a rigid body is its orientation as described, for example, by the orientation of a frame fixed in the body relative to a fixed reference frame. The attitude is described by ''attitude coordinates'', and consists of at least three coordinates.&lt;ref name=Schaub&gt;

{{cite book |title=Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems |author1=Hanspeter Schaub |author2=John L. Junkins |chapter=Rigid body kinematics |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXvESNWrfpUC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=attitude+%22rigid+body%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=attitude%20%22rigid%20body%22&amp;f=false |isbn=1-56347-563-4 |year=2003 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  One scheme for orienting a rigid body is based upon body-axes rotation; successive rotations three times about the axes of the body's fixed reference frame, thereby establishing the body's [[Euler angles]].&lt;ref name=Kuipers&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8247">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]], the '''orthogonal complement''' of a [[linear subspace|subspace]] ''W'' of a [[vector space]] ''V'' equipped with a [[bilinear form]] ''B'' is the set ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; of all vectors in ''V'' that are [[orthogonal]] to every vector in ''W''.  Informally, it is called the '''perp''', short for '''perpendicular complement'''.  It is a subspace of ''V''.

==Example==
In the case that ''W'' is the subspace of &lt;math&gt;V = \mathbb{R}^5&lt;/math&gt; (with the usual [[dot product]]) spanned by the rows of the next matrix,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{c c  } 1 &amp; 0  \\ 0 &amp; 1\\ \end{array}&amp; \begin{array}{c c c  } 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\ \hline 6 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 \\ \hline \end{array}    \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

its orthogonal complement ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; is spanned by the three row-vectors  of
 
&lt;math&gt;
       \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{c|c|} -2&amp; -6 \\ -3&amp;-9\\ -5&amp;-3\\  \end{array} &amp; \begin{array}{c c c} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0&amp;1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1\\  \end{array}   \end{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that every vector on the first list is orthogonal to every vector on the second list can be checked by direct computation.  The fact that the spans of these vectors are orthogonal then follows by bilinearity of the dot product.  Finally, the fact that these spaces are orthogonal complements follows from the dimension relationships given below.

==General bilinear forms==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a [[bilinear form]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  We define &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to be left-orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to be right-orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;B(u,v)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  For a subset &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; we define the left orthogonal complement &lt;math&gt;W^\bot&lt;/math&gt; to be

:&lt;math&gt;W^\bot=\left\{x\in V : B( x, y ) = 0 \mbox{ for all } y\in W \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a corresponding definition of right orthogonal complement. For a [[reflexive bilinear form]], where &lt;math&gt;B(u,v)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;B(v,u)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the left and right complements coincide.  This will be the case if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[symmetric bilinear form|symmetric]] or an [[Bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|alternating form]].

The definition extends to a bilinear form on a [[free module]] over a [[commutative ring]], and to a [[sesquilinear form]] extended to include any free module over a commutative ring with [[Conjugate element (field theory)|conjugation]].&lt;ref&gt;Adkins &amp; Weintraub (1992) p.359&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===
* An orthogonal complement is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;;
* If {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;X\subset Y&lt;/math&gt;}} then {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;X^\bot \supset Y^\bot&lt;/math&gt;}};
* The [[Radical of a quadratic space|radical]] &lt;math&gt;V^\bot&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of every orthogonal complement;
* &lt;math&gt;W\subset (W^\bot)^\bot&lt;/math&gt;;
* If &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is [[non-degenerate]] and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional, then &lt;math&gt;\dim(W)+\dim (W^\bot)=\dim V&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_r&lt;/math&gt; are subspaces of a finite-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_* = L_1 \cap L_2 \cap \ldots \cap L_r&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L_*^\bot = L_1^\bot + L_2^\bot + \ldots + L_r^\bot&lt;/math&gt;.

==Inner product spaces==

This section considers orthogonal complements in [[inner product space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins&amp;Weintraub (1992) p.272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===
The orthogonal complement is always closed in the metric topology.  In finite-dimensional spaces, that is merely an instance of the fact that all subspaces of a vector space are closed.  In infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]]s, some subspaces are not closed, but all orthogonal complements are closed.  In such spaces, the orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;(W^\bot)^\bot = \overline W &lt;/math&gt;.

Some other useful properties that always hold are the following. Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space and let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be its linear subspaces. Then:
* &lt;math&gt;X^\bot = \overline X^\bot  &lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt; Y \subset X&lt;/math&gt;, then {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; X^\bot \subset Y ^\bot&lt;/math&gt;}};
* &lt;math&gt;X\cap X^\bot = \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq (X^\bot)^\bot  &lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed linear subspace of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;(X^\bot)^\bot = X&lt;/math&gt;}};
* if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed linear subspace of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then {{nowrap| &lt;math&gt;H = X \oplus X^\bot &lt;/math&gt;}}, the (inner) [[direct sum]].

The orthogonal complement generalizes to the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]], and gives a [[Galois connection]] on subsets of the inner product space, with associated [[closure operator]] the topological closure of the span.

===Finite dimensions===
For a finite-dimensional inner product space of dimension ''n'', the orthogonal complement of a ''k''-dimensional subspace is an {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')}}-dimensional subspace, and the double orthogonal complement is the original subspace:

:(''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = ''W''.

If ''A'' is an {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix, where {{nowrap|Row ''A''}}, {{nowrap|Col ''A''}}, and {{nowrap|Null ''A''}} refer to the [[row space]], [[column space]], and [[null space]] of ''A'' (respectively), we have

:(Row ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = Null ''A''
:(Col ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = Null ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Banach spaces==
There is a natural analog of this notion in general [[Banach space]]s. In this case one defines the orthogonal complement of ''W'' to be a subspace of the [[Dual space|dual]] of ''V'' defined similarly as the [[Dual space#Annihilators|annihilator]]

:&lt;math&gt;W^\bot = \left\{\,x\in V^* : \forall y\in W, x(y) = 0 \, \right\}.\, &lt;/math&gt;

It is always a closed subspace of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. There is also an analog of the double complement property.  ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥⊥&lt;/sup&gt; is now a subspace of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt; (which is not identical to ''V''). However, the [[reflexive space]]s have a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[isomorphism]] ''i'' between ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;. In this case we have

:&lt;math&gt;i\overline{W} = W^{\bot\,\bot}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a rather straightforward consequence of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]].

==Applications==
In [[special relativity]] the orthogonal complement is used to determine the [[world line#Simultaneous hyperplane|simultaneous hyperplane]] at a point of a [[world line]].  The bilinear form η used in [[Minkowski space]] determines a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] of events. The origin and all events on the [[light cone]] are self-orthogonal. When a [[time]] event and a [[space]] event evaluate to zero under the bilinear form, then they are [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]]. This terminology stems from the use of two conjugate hyperbolas in the pseudo-Euclidean plane: [[conjugate diameters]] of these hyperbolas are hyperbolic-orthogonal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7343">In [[geometry]], a '''pentagonal polytope'''&lt;!--Glossary for Hyperspace--&gt; is a [[regular polytope]] in ''n'' dimensions constructed from the [[Coxeter group|H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; Coxeter group]]. The family was named by [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], because the two-dimensional pentagonal polytope is a [[pentagon]]. It can be named by its [[Schläfli symbol]] as {5, 3&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt;} (dodecahedral) or {3&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt;, 5} (icosahedral).

==Family members==
The family starts as [[polytope|1-polytopes]] and ends with ''n'' = 5 as infinite tessellations of 4-dimensional hyperbolic space.

There are two types of pentagonal polytopes; they may be termed the ''dodecahedral'' and ''icosahedral'' types, by their three-dimensional members. The two types are duals of each other.

===Dodecahedral===
The complete family of dodecahedral pentagonal polytopes are:
# [[Line segment]], {&amp;nbsp;}
# [[Pentagon]], {5}
# [[Dodecahedron]], {5, 3} (12 [[pentagon]]al faces)
# [[120-cell]], {5, 3, 3} (120 [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] cells)
# [[Order-3 120-cell honeycomb]], {5, 3, 3, 3} (tessellates hyperbolic 4-space (∞ [[120-cell]] facets)

The facets of each dodecahedral pentagonal polytope are the dodecahedral pentagonal polytopes of one less dimension. Their vertex figures are the [[simplex|simplices]] of one less dimension.

== Related star polytopes and honeycombs ==
The pentagonal polytopes can be [[stellation|stellated]] to form new [[star polytope|star regular polytopes]]:
*In three dimensions, this forms the four [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]], {[[great icosahedron|3,5/2]]}, {[[great stellated dodecahedron|5/2,3]]}, {[[great dodecahedron|5,5/2]]}, and {[[small stellated dodecahedron|5/2,5]]}.
*In four dimensions, this forms the ten [[Schläfli–Hess polychoron|Schläfli–Hess polychora]]: {[[icosahedral 120-cell|3,5,5/2]]}, {[[small stellated 120-cell|5/2,5,3]]}, {[[great 120-cell|5,5/2,5]]}, {[[grand 120-cell|5,3,5/2]]}, {[[great stellated 120-cell|5/2,3,5]]}, {[[grand stellated 120-cell|5/2,5,5/2]]}, {[[great grand 120-cell|5,5/2,3]]}, {[[great icosahedral 120-cell|3,5/2,5]]}, {[[grand 600-cell|3,3,5/2]]}, and {[[great grand stellated 120-cell|5/2,3,3]]}. 
*In four-dimensional hyperbolic space there are [[List of regular polytopes#Tessellations_of_hyperbolic_4-space|four regular star-honeycombs]]: [[Small stellated 120-cell honeycomb|{5/2,5,3,3}]], [[Pentagrammic-order 600-cell honeycomb|{3,3,5,5/2}]], [[Order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb|{3,5,5/2,5}]], and [[Great 120-cell honeycomb|{5,5/2,5,3}]].

Like other polytopes, they can be combined with their duals to form compounds;

*In two dimensions, a [[Decagram (geometry)|decagrammic star figure]] {10/2} is formed,
*In three dimensions, we obtain the [[compound of dodecahedron and icosahedron]],
*In four dimensions, we obtain the [[compound of 120-cell and 600-cell]].

'''Per H. Enflo''' ({{IPA-sv|ˌpæːɹ ˈeːnfluː|lang}}; born 20 May 1944) is a Swedish mathematician working primarily in [[functional analysis]], a field in which he solved [[mathematical problems|problems]] that had been considered fundamental. Three of these problems had been [[open problem|open]] for more than forty years:&lt;ref&gt;Page 586 in Halmos 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Schauder basis#Basis problem|basis problem]] and the [[Approximation property|approximation problem]]&lt;ref&gt;Per Enflo: ''A counterexample to the approximation problem in Banach spaces.'' [[Acta Mathematica]] vol. 130, no. 1, Juli 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and later
* the [[invariant subspace problem]] for [[Banach spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book | last1=Enflo | first1=Per | title=Séminaire Maurey--Schwartz (1975--1976) Espaces L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;, applications radonifiantes et géométrie des espaces de Banach, Exp.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In solving these problems, Enflo developed new techniques which were then used by other researchers in [[functional analysis]] and [[operator theory]] for years. Some of Enflo's research has been important also in other mathematical fields, such as [[number theory]], and in [[computer science]], especially [[computer algebra]] and [[approximation algorithm]]s.

Enflo works at [[Kent State University]], where he holds the title of University Professor. Enflo has earlier held positions at the [[Miller Institute]] for Basic Research in Science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[École Polytechnique]], ([[Paris]]) and The [[Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]].

Enflo is also a [[concert pianist]].

== Enflo's contributions to functional analysis and operator theory ==

In [[mathematical analysis|mathematics]], [[Functional analysis]] is concerned with the study of [[vector space]]s and [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of [[functional space]]s, in particular transformations of [[function (mathematics)|functions]], such as the [[Fourier transform]], as well as in the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations|integral]] equations. In functional analysis, an important class of vector spaces consists of the [[complete space|complete]] [[normed vector space]]s over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers, which are called [[Banach space]]s. An important example of a Banach space is a [[Hilbert space]], where the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] arises from an [[inner product space|inner product]]. Hilbert spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the mathematical formulation of [[quantum mechanics]], [[stochastic processes]], and [[time-series analysis]]. Besides studying spaces of functions, functional analysis also studies the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear operators]] on spaces of functions.

=== Hilbert's fifth problem and embeddings ===
{{see also|Hilbert's fifth problem}}

At Stockholm University, Hans Rådström suggested that Enflo consider [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] in the spirit of functional analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Rådström had himself published several articles on [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] from the point of view of [[semigroup]] theory.
Rådström was also the (initial) advisor of Martin Ribe, who wrote a thesis on metric linear spaces that need not be locally convex; Ribe also used a few of Enflo's ideas on [[metric geometry]], especially "roundness", in obtaining independent results on [[uniformly continuous function|uniform]] and [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] [[embedding]]s (Benyamini and Lindenstrauss). This reference also describes results of Enflo and his students on such embeddings.&lt;/ref&gt; In two years, 1969–1970, Enflo published five papers on Hilbert's fifth problem; these papers are collected in Enflo (1970), along with a short summary. Some of the results of these papers are described in Enflo (1976) and in the last chapter of Benyamini and [[Joram Lindenstrauss|Lindenstrauss]].

==== Applications in computer science ====
{{See also|Approximation algorithm}}
Enflo's techniques have found application in [[computer science]]. [[Algorithm|Algorithm theorists]] derive [[approximation algorithm]]s that embed finite metric spaces into low-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s with low "distortion" (in [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Gromov]]'s terminology for the [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] [[Category theory|category]]; c.f. [[Banach–Mazur distance]]). Low-dimensional problems have lower [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]], of course. More importantly, if the problems embed well in either the [[Euclidean plane]] or the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], then [[Computational geometry|geometric algorithm]]s become exceptionally fast.

However, such [[embedding]] techniques have limitations, as shown by Enflo's (1969) theorem:&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 15.4.1 in Matoušek.&lt;/ref&gt;
: For every &lt;math&gt;m\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- and &lt;math&gt;n=2^m&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;, the [[Hamming cube]] &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; cannot be embedded with "distortion &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;" (or less) into &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space if &lt;math&gt; D &lt; \sqrt{ m }&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- \sqrt{ \log_2{ n } } = --&gt; Consequently, the optimal embedding is the natural embedding, which realizes &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^m&lt;/math&gt; as a subspace of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;Matoušek 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theorem, "found by Enflo [1969], is probably the first result showing an unbounded distortion for [[embedding]]s into [[Euclidean space]]s. Enflo considered the problem of [[uniform continuity|uniform]] embeddability among [[Banach space]]s, and the distortion was an auxiliary device in his proof."&lt;ref&gt;Matoušek 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geometry of Banach spaces ===
{{see also|Uniformly convex space}}
A '''uniformly convex space''' is a [[Banach space]] so that, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is some &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; so that for any two vectors with &lt;math&gt;\|x\|\le1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|y\|\le 1,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\|x+y\|&gt;2-\delta&lt;/math&gt;
implies that
: &lt;math&gt;\|x-y\|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Intuitively, the center of a line segment inside the [[unit ball]] must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short.

In 1972 Enflo proved that "every [[Reflexive space#Super-reflexive space|super-reflexive]] [[Banach space]] admits an equivalent [[uniformly convex space|uniformly convex]] norm".&lt;ref&gt;Beauzamy 1985, page 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pisier.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Other results on convex geometry, like work with Beauzamy &amp; Maurey; maybe on 3-space problems, etc. --&gt;

=== The basis problem and Mazur's goose ===
{{see also|Schauder basis|Approximation problem}}

With one paper, which was published in 1973, Per Enflo solved three problems that had stumped functional analysts for decades: The [[approximation problem|basis problem]] of [[Stefan Banach]], the "[[Scottish Book|Goose problem]]" of [[Stanislaw Mazur]], and the [[approximation problem]] of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. Grothendieck had shown that his approximation problem was the central problem in the [[category theory|theory]] of [[Banach space]]s and [[continuous linear operator]]s.

==== Basis problem of Banach ====
{{Main|Schauder basis}}
{{See also|Stefan Banach|Banach space|Separable space}}
The basis problem was posed by Stefan Banach in his book, ''Theory of Linear Operators''. Banach asked whether every separable [[Banach space]] [[subjunctive mood|has]] a [[Schauder basis]].

A '''Schauder basis''' or '''countable basis''' is similar to the usual (Hamel) [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of a [[vector space]]; the difference is that for Hamel bases we use [[linear combination]]s that are ''finite'' sums, while for Schauder bases they may be ''infinite'' sums. This makes Schauder bases more suitable for the analysis of infinite-dimensional [[topological vector space]]s including [[Banach space]]s.

Schauder bases were described by [[Juliusz Schauder]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schauder | first1 = J. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1927 | title = Zur Theorie stetiger Abbildungen in Funktionalraumen | url = | journal = Mathematische Zeitschrift | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 47–65 | doi = 10.1007/BF01475440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schauder | first1 = J. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1928 | title = Eine Eigenschaft des Haarschen Orthogonalsystems | url = | journal = Mathematische Zeitschrift | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 317–320 | doi = 10.1007/BF01181164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''V'' denote a [[Banach space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F''. A ''Schauder basis'' is a [[sequence]] (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of elements of ''V'' such that for every element ''v'' ∈ ''V'' there exists a ''unique'' sequence (α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of elements in ''F'' so that
: &lt;math&gt; v = \sum_{n \in \N} \alpha_n b_n \,&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] is understood with respect to the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] [[topology]]. Schauder bases can also be defined analogously in a general [[topological vector space]].

[[File:KsiegaSzkocka1.JPG| thumb |In 1937, Polish mathematician [[Stanislaw Mazur]] promised a "live goose" as the prize for solving [[approximation problem|problem 153]] in the [[Scottish Book]]. In 1972, Mazur presented the goose to Per Enflo. ]]

==== Problem 153 in the Scottish Book: Mazur's goose ====
[[File:MazurGes.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972 [[Stanislaw Mazur]] awarded Enflo the promised live goose for solving a problem in the [[Scottish cafe|Scottish book]].]]
{{See also|Scottish Café|Scottish Book|Stanislaw Mazur}}

Banach and other Polish mathematicians would work on mathematical problems at the [[Scottish Café]]. When a problem was especially interesting and when its solution seemed difficult, the problem would be written down in the book of problems, which soon became known as the ''[[Scottish Book]]''. For problems that seemed especially important or difficult or both, the problem's proposer would often pledge to award a prize for its solution.

On 6 November 1936, [[Stanislaw Mazur]] posed a problem on representing continuous functions. Formally writing down ''problem 153'' in the ''Scottish Book'', Mazur promised as the reward a "live goose", an especially rich price during the [[Great Depression]] and on the eve of [[World War II]].

Fairly soon afterwards, it was realized that Mazur's problem was closely related to Banach's problem on the existence of Schauder bases in separable Banach spaces. Most of the other problems in the ''Scottish Book'' were solved regularly. However, there was little progress on Mazur's problem and a few other problems, which became famous [[open problem]]s to mathematicians around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grothendieck's formulation of the approximation problem ====
{{Main|Approximation property|Approximation problem}}
{{See also|Compact operator|Alexander Grothendieck}}

Grothendieck's work on the [[category theory|theory]] of Banach spaces and [[continuous linear operator]]s introduced the [[approximation property]]. A [[Banach space]] is said to have the [[approximation property]], if every [[compact operator]] is a limit of [[finite-rank operator]]s. The converse is always true.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Joram Lindenstrauss]] and L. Tzafriri.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a long monograph, Grothendieck proved that if every Banach space had the approximation property, then every Banach space would have a Schauder basis. Grothendieck thus focused the attention of functional analysts on deciding whether every Banach space have the approximation property.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Enflo's solution ====
In 1972, Per Enflo constructed a separable Banach space that lacks the approximation property and a Schauder basis.&lt;ref&gt;Enflo's "sensation" is discussed on page 287 in {{cite book|last=Pietsch|first=Albrecht|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMorKHumdZAC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=Pietsch,+Enflo&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=enflo&amp;f=false |title=History of Banach spaces and linear operators|publisher=Birkhäuser Boston, Inc.|location=Boston, MA|year=2007|pages=xxiv+855 pp.|isbn=978-0-8176-4367-6| mr = 2300779}} Introductions to Enflo's solution were written by Halmos, by Johnson, by Kwapień, by Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri, by Nedevski and Trojanski, and by Singer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Mazur awarded a [http://www.apprendre-math.info/history/photos/Mazur_2.jpeg live goose] to Enflo in a ceremony at the [[Stefan Banach|Stefan Banach Center]] in [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]]; the "goose reward" ceremony was broadcast throughout [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kałuża, Saxe, Eggleton, Mauldin.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invariant subspace problem and polynomials ===
{{main|Invariant subspace problem}} {{see also|Invariant subspace}}

In [[functional analysis]], one of the most prominent problems was the [[invariant subspace problem]], which required the evaluation of the truth of the following proposition:
:Given a complex [[Banach space]] ''H'' of [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] &gt; 1 and a [[bounded operator|bounded linear operator]] ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H'', then ''H'' has a non-trivial [[closed set|closed]] [[invariant subspace|''T''-invariant subspace]], i.e. there exists a closed [[linear subspace]] ''W'' of ''H'' which is different from {0} and ''H'' such that ''T''(''W'') ⊆ ''W''.
For [[Banach space]]s, the first example of an operator without an invariant subspace was constructed by Enflo. (For [[Hilbert space]]s, the [[invariant subspace problem]] remains [[Unsolved problems in mathematics|open]].)

Enflo proposed a solution to the invariant subspace problem in 1975, publishing an outline in 1976. Enflo submitted the full article in 1981 and the article's complexity and length delayed its publication to 1987&lt;ref name="Beauzamy 1988; Yadav"&gt;Beauzamy 1988; Yadav.&lt;/ref&gt; Enflo's long "manuscript had a world-wide circulation among mathematicians"&lt;ref&gt;Yadav, page 292.&lt;/ref&gt; and some of its ideas were described in publications besides Enflo (1976).&lt;ref&gt;For example, Radjavi and Rosenthal (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|pages=33–37
|author1=Heydar Radjavi  |author2=Peter Rosenthal
 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The invariant subspace problem
|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer
|volume=4

|date=March 1982
|doi=10.1007/BF03022994
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Enflo's works inspired a similar construction of an operator without an invariant subspace for example by Beauzamy, who acknowledged Enflo's ideas.&lt;ref name="Beauzamy 1988; Yadav" /&gt;

In the 1990s, Enflo developed a "constructive" approach to the [[invariant subspace problem]] on Hilbert spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Page 401 in {{cite journal|last1=Foiaş|first1=Ciprian|last2=Jung|first2=Il Bong|last3=Ko|first3=Eungil|last4=Pearcy|first4=Carl | title=On quasinilpotent operators. III | journal=Journal of Operator Theory | volume=54|year=2005|issue=2|pages=401–414}}. Enflo's method of ("forward") "minimal vectors" is also noted in the review of this research article by Gilles Cassier in ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'': {{MR|2186363}}

Enflo's method of minimal vector is described in greater detail in a survey article on the [[invariant subspace problem]] by Enflo and [[Invariant subspace problem|Victor Lomonosov]], which appears in the ''Handbook of the Geometry of Banach Spaces'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Multiplicative inequalities for homogeneous polynomials ====
{{see also|homogeneous polynomial}}

An essential idea in Enflo's construction was "'''concentration of polynomials at low degrees'''": For all positive integers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;C(m,n) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that for all [[homogeneous polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of degrees &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; variables), then
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;|PQ|\geq C(m,n)|P|\,|Q|,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|P|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Enflo proved that &lt;math&gt;C(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the number of variables &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Enflo's original proof was simplified by [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

This result was generalized to other [[normed vector space|norm]]s on the vector space of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s. Of these norms, the most used has been the [[Bombieri norm]].

===== Bombieri norm =====
{{main|Bombieri norm}}
The [[Bombieri norm]] is defined in terms of the following [[scalar product]]:
For all &lt;math&gt; \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{N}^N&lt;/math&gt; we have

: &lt;math&gt;\langle X^\alpha | X^\beta \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \neq \beta&lt;/math&gt;

: For every &lt;math&gt; \alpha \in \mathbb{N}^N&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;||X^\alpha||^2 = \frac{|\alpha|!}{\alpha!},&lt;/math&gt;
where we use the following notation:
if &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_N) \in \mathbb{N}^N&lt;/math&gt;, we write &lt;math&gt;|\alpha| = \Sigma_{i=1}^N \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\alpha! = \Pi_{i=1}^N (\alpha_i!)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\alpha = \Pi_{i=1}^N X_i^{\alpha_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The most remarkable property of this norm is the Bombieri inequality:

Let &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; be two [[homogeneous polynomial]]s respectively of degree &lt;math&gt;d^\circ(P)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^\circ(Q)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; variables, then, the following inequality holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^\circ(P)!d^\circ(Q)!}{(d^\circ(P)+d^\circ(Q))!}||P||^2 \, ||Q||^2 \leq
 ||P\cdot Q||^2 \leq ||P||^2 \, ||Q||^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In the above statement, the Bombieri inequality is the left-hand side inequality; the right-hand side inequality means that the [[Bombieri norm]] is a [[normed algebra|norm]] of the [[normed algebra|algebra]] of polynomials under multiplication.

The Bombieri inequality implies that the product of two polynomials cannot be arbitrarily small, and this lower-bound is fundamental in applications like [[polynomial factorization]] (or in Enflo's construction of an operator without an invariant subspace).

==== Applications ====
{{see also|Polynomial factorization}}
Enflo's idea of "concentration of polynomials at low degrees" has led to important publications in [[number theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery. Schmidt. Beauzamy and Enflo. Beauzamy, Bombieri, Enflo, and Montgomery&lt;/ref&gt; [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] [[Diophantine geometry|and Diophantine geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;Bombieri and Gubler&lt;/ref&gt; and [[polynomial factorization]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth. Beauzamy, Enflo, and Wang.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical biology: Population dynamics ==
{{See also|Mathematical biology|Population dynamics}}

In [[applied mathematics]], Per Enflo has published several papers in [[mathematical biology]], specifically in [[population dynamics]].

=== Human evolution ===
Enflo has also published in [[population genetics]] and [[paleoanthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;The model for the evolution of human population genetics (developed by Enflo and his coauthors) was reported on the cover page of a major Swedish newspaper.{{cite journal | first=Annika | last=Jensfelt | page=1 | journal=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] | date=14 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, all humans belong to one population of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', which is individed by species barrier. However, according to the "Out of Africa" model this is not the first species of hominids: the first species of genus ''Homo'', ''Homo habilis'', evolved in East Africa at least 2 Ma, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. ''Homo erectus'' evolved more than 1.8 Ma, and by 1.5 Ma had spread throughout the [[Old World]].

Anthropologists have been divided as to whether current human population evolved as one interconnected population (as postulated by the [[Multiregional Evolution]] hypothesis), or evolved only in East Africa, [[speciation|speciated]], and then migrating out of Africa and replaced human populations in [[Eurasia]] (called the "Out of Africa" Model or the "Complete Replacement" Model).

Neanderthals and modern humans coexisted in Europe for several thousand years, but the duration of this period is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mellars | first1 = P. | year = 2006 | title = A new radiocarbon revolution and the dispersal of modern humans in Eurasia | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7079| pages = 931–935 | doi = 10.1038/nature04521 | pmid = 16495989 | bibcode=2006Natur.439..931M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans may have first migrated to Europe 40–43,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=banks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=William E. |author2=Francesco d'Errico |author3=A.

With [[John D. Hawks|Hawks]] and [[Milford H. Wolpoff|Wolpoff]], Enflo published an explanation of fossil evidence on the [[DNA]] of [[Neanderthal]] and [[modern human]]s. This article tries to resolve a debate in the [[human evolution#Models of human evolution|evolution of modern humans]] between theories suggesting either [[multiregional origin of modern humans|multiregional]] and [[recent African origin of modern humans|single African]] origins. In particular,
the [[Neanderthal extinction hypotheses|extinction of Neanderthals]] could have happened due to waves of modern humans entered Europe&amp;nbsp;– in technical terms, due to "the continuous influx of modern human DNA into the Neandertal gene pool."&lt;ref&gt;Page 665:

== Piano ==

Per Enflo is also a [[concert pianist]].

A [[child prodigy]]&lt;!-- Zimmerman states that Enflo was a child prodigy in mathematics, also. There were Swedish newspaper articles with titles like "Sweden's answer to Einstein". --&gt; in both music and mathematics, Enflo won the Swedish competition for young pianists at age 11 in 1956, and he won the same competition in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Saxe.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 12, Enflo appeared as a soloist with the Royal Opera Orchestra of Sweden. He debuted in the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]] in 1963. Enflo's teachers included Bruno Seidlhofer, [[Géza Anda]], and Gottfried Boon (who himself was a student of Arthur Schnabel).&lt;ref name="content.bandzoogle.com"&gt;* [http://content.bandzoogle.com/users/chagrinmusic/files/09-10-Season-Brochure_FINAL.pdf Chagrin Valley Chamber Music Concert Series 2009-2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Enflo competed in the first annual [[Van Cliburn Foundation]]’s [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition|International Piano Competition]] for [http://www.cliburn.org/index.php?page=amateur_competition Outstanding Amateurs].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''principle of maximum caliber''' ('''MaxCal''') or '''maximum path entropy principle''', suggested by [[E. T. Jaynes]],&lt;ref name="Jaynes1980" /&gt; can be considered as a generalization of the [[principle of maximum entropy]]. It postulates that the most unbiased probability distribution of paths is the one that maximizes their [[Shannon entropy]]. This entropy of paths is sometimes called the "caliber" of the system, and is given by the path integral

: &lt;math&gt; S[\rho[x()]] = \int D_x \,\, \rho[x()]  \, \ln {\rho[x()] \over \pi[x()]}&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==

The principle of maximum caliber was proposed by [[Edwin T. Jaynes]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="Jaynes1980" /&gt; in an article titled 
''The Minimum Entropy Production Principle'' over the context of to find a principle for to derive the [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics]].

== Mathematical formulation ==

The principle of maximum caliber can be considered as a generalization of the [[principle of maximum entropy]] defined over the paths space, the caliber &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is of the form

: &lt;math&gt; S[\rho[x()]] = \int D_x \rho[x()] \ln {\rho[x()] \over \pi[x()]}&lt;/math&gt;

where for ''n''-constraints

: &lt;math&gt; \int D_x \rho[x()] A_n[x()] = \langle A_n[x()] \rangle = a_n &lt;/math&gt;

it is shown that the probability functional is

: &lt;math&gt; \rho[x()] = \exp\left\{ - \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_n A_n[x()] \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the same way, for n dynamical constraints defined in the interval &lt;math&gt; t \in [0,T] &lt;/math&gt; of the form

: &lt;math&gt; \int D_x \rho[x()] L_n(x(t),\dot x(t), t ) = \langle L_n(x(t),\dot x(t),t ) \rangle = \ell(t)&lt;/math&gt;

it is shown that the probability functional is

: &lt;math&gt; \rho[x()] = \exp\left\{ - \sum_{i=0}^n \int_0^T dt \, \alpha_n(t) L_n(x(t),\dot x(t), t ) \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Maximum caliber and statistical mechanics==

Following the hypothesis of Jaynes, there are publications in which it appears as the principle of maximum caliber it is framed in the context of creating a statistical representation of systems with many degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="Presse2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazoglou2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2015" /&gt;

The concept known as '''rational irrationality''' was popularized by economist [[Bryan Caplan]] in 2001 to reconcile the widespread existence of [[irrationality|irrational]] behavior (particularly in the realms of [[religion]] and [[politics]]) with the assumption of [[rationality]] made by mainstream [[economics]] and [[game theory]].&lt;ref name=CaplanOriginal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/eejformat.doc|title=Caplan's original paper on rational irrationality|publisher=Bryan Caplan|date=|accessdate=2012-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715060845/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/eejformat.doc|archivedate=2009-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CaplanIgnoranceAndIrrationality&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/ratirnew.doc|title=Caplan's paper on rational irrationality versus rational ignorance|publisher=Bryan Caplan |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory, along with its implications for democracy, was expanded upon by Caplan in his book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]''.

The original purpose of the concept was to explain how (allegedly) detrimental policies could be implemented in a democracy, and, unlike conventional [[public choice theory]], Caplan posited that bad policies were selected by voters themselves.  The theory has also been embraced by the [[ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionist]] philosopher [[Michael Huemer]] as an explanation for irrationality in politics.&lt;ref name=HuemerIrrational&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm|title=Michael Huemer on irrationality in politics|publisher=Michael Huemer|date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuemerTEDX&gt;{{cite web|title = Michael Huemer's TEDX talk on irrationality in politics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JYL5VUe5NQ|publisher = Michael Huemer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has also been applied to explain [[religion|religious belief]].&lt;ref name=CaplanReligionDebate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/larrydeb.htm|title = Debate between Caplan and Iannaccone on rational irrationality in religion|publisher = Bryan Caplan|date = |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Two types of rationality, and preferences over beliefs===

Caplan posits that there are two types of rationality:

* ''[[Epistemic]]'' rationality, which roughly consists of forming beliefs in truth-conducive ways, making reasonable efforts to avoid fallacious reasoning, and keeping an open mind for new evidence.
* ''[[Instrumental rationality|Instrumental]]'' rationality, which involves choosing the most comprehensively effective means to attain one’s actual goals, given one’s actual beliefs.

Rational irrationality describes a situation in which it is ''instrumentally'' rational for an actor to be ''epistemically'' irrational.

Caplan argues that rational irrationality is more likely in situations in which:

* people have ''preferences over beliefs'', i.e., some kinds of beliefs are more appealing than others and
* the marginal cost to an individual of holding an erroneous (or irrational) belief is low.

In the framework of [[neoclassical economics]], Caplan posits that there is a ''demand for irrationality''. A person's [[demand curve]] describes the amount of irrationality that the person is willing to tolerate at any given cost of irrationality. By the [[law of demand]], the lower the cost of irrationality, the higher the demand for it. When the cost of error is effectively zero, a person's demand for irrationality is high.

===Rational irrationality versus doublethink===

Rational irrationality is not [[doublethink]] and does not state that the individual deliberately chooses to believe something he or she knows to be false. Rather, the theory is that when the costs of having erroneous beliefs are low, people relax their intellectual standards and allow themselves to be more easily influenced by [[fallacy|fallacious reasoning]], [[cognitive bias]]es, and [[appeal to emotion|emotional appeals]]. In other words, people do not deliberately seek to believe false things but stop putting in the intellectual effort to be open to evidence that may contradict their beliefs.

===Sources of preferences over beliefs===

For rational irrationality to exist, people must have preferences over beliefs: certain beliefs must be appealing to people for reasons ''other than'' their truth value. In an essay on irrationality in politics Michael Huemer&lt;ref name=HuemerIrrational/&gt; identifies some possible sources of preferences over beliefs:

* Self-interested bias: People tend to hold beliefs that, if generally accepted, would benefit themselves or the group with whom they identify. Self-interested bias is complicated by the fact that people may identify with groups to which they do not belong, but feel good about assuming that identity.
* Beliefs as self-image constructors: People prefer to hold beliefs that best fit with the images of themselves that they want to adopt and to project.
* Beliefs as tools of social bonding: People prefer to hold the political beliefs of other people they like and with whom they want to associate.
* Coherence bias: People are biased towards beliefs that ''fit well'' with or reinforce their existing beliefs, regardless of those beliefs' degree of coherence with reality.

==Religion==

Many of the claims of [[religion]]s are not easily verifiable in the day-to-day world. There are many competing religious theories about the [[creation myth|origins of life]], [[reincarnation]], and [[paradise]], but mistaken beliefs about these rarely impose real world costs upon the believers themselves. Thus, it may be instrumentally rational to be epistemically irrational about these matters. In other words, when forming or updating their religious beliefs, people may tend to relax their intellectual standards for the sake of driving popular support towards their beliefs.&lt;ref name=CaplanReligionDebate/&gt;

==Politics==

===Rational irrationality in individual political beliefs===

[[Politics]] is a situation where rational irrationality is expected to be common, according to Caplan's theory. In typical large [[democracy|democracies]], each individual voter has a very low probability of influencing the outcome of an election or determining whether a particular policy will be implemented. Thus, the expected cost of supporting an erroneous policy (obtained by multiplying the cost of the policy by the probability that the individual voter will have a decisive role in influencing the policy) is very low. The psychological benefits of supporting policies that feel good but are in fact harmful may be greater than these small expected costs. This creates a situation where voters may be rationally irrational for practical morale reasons.

===Rational irrationality and systemic biases===

For rational irrationality at an individual level to have an effect on political outcomes, it is necessary that there be ''systemic'' ways in which people are irrational. In other words, people need to have [[systemic bias]]es: there needs to be a systemic difference between people's preferences over beliefs and true beliefs. In the absence of systemic biases, different forms of irrationality would cancel out when aggregated using the voting process.

Caplan attempts to demonstrate empirically the existence of systemic biases in beliefs about [[economics]] in his book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]''.

===Implications for the outcomes of democracy===

When a large number of individuals hold systematically biased beliefs, the ''total'' cost to the democracy of all these irrational beliefs could be significant. Thus, even though every individual voter may be behaving rationally, the voters as a whole are not acting in their collective self-interest. This is analogous to the [[tragedy of the commons]]. Another way of thinking about it is that each voter, by being rationally irrational, creates a small negative [[externality]] for other voters.

Caplan believes that the rational irrationality of voters is one of the reasons why democracies choose suboptimal economic policies, particularly in the area of [[free trade]] versus [[protectionism]]. Philosopher [[Michael Huemer]], in a [[TEDx]] talk on rational irrationality in politics, cited the [[war on terror]] and [[protectionism]] as two examples of rational irrationality in politics.&lt;ref name=HuemerTEDX/&gt;

==Competing and opposing theories of democracy and politics==

Any theory of democracy must take into account the empirical fact that most voters in a democracy have very little idea about the details of politics, including the names of their elected representatives, the terms of office, and the platforms of candidates of major political parties.

Like rational irrationality, some theories of democracy claim that democracies tend to choose bad policies. Other theories claim that despite the empirical observations about voter ignorance, democracies do in fact do fairly well. Below are listed some of these theories and their relation to rational irrationality.

===Rational ignorance and public choice theory===

The most famous theory of democratic failure is [[public choice theory]]. The theory, developed by [[James M. Buchanan|James Buchanan]], [[Gordon Tullock]], and others, relies on [[rational ignorance]]. Voters have a very small probability of influencing policy outcomes, so they do not put much effort to stay up-to-date on politics. This allows [[special interests]] to manipulate the political process and engage in [[rent seeking]]. A key idea of public choice theory is that many harmful policies have [[concentrated benefits and diffuse costs|concentrated benefits (experienced by special interests) and diffuse costs]]. The special interests experiencing the benefits are willing to lobby for the policies, while the costs are spread out very diffusely among a much larger group of people. Because these costs are diffuse, the people bearing the costs do not have enough at stake to lobby against the policies.

Rational irrationality and rational ignorance share some key similarities but are also different in a number of ways. The similarities are that both theories reject the claim that voters are rational and well-informed, and both theories claim that democracy does not function well. However, the theories differ in a number of ways:

* Rational ignorance does not predict any [[systemic bias]]es in voter beliefs. Rather, it is consistent with voters having beliefs that are wrong in ''random'' ways with no overall direction of bias. Rational irrationality, on the other hand, predicts that systemic biases are apt to occur in areas where the policies that feel good are systemically different from the policies that are, in fact, good. 
* Public choice theory explains the failure of democracy in terms of special interests frustrating the will of the people, who are rationally ignorant. With rational irrationality, on the other hand, it is possible for democracies to choose bad policies even if the will of the people is implemented. This does not rule out the possibility of special interest manipulation but gives it a secondary role.

There are two main objections to public choice theory and rational ignorance that do not apply to rational irrationality:

* Miracle of aggregation: If voter errors are purely random and a result of ignorance, then the random errors of the ignorant voters should cancel out and even a small proportion of well-informed voters should suffice for democracy to function well. The objection, at least in this form, does not apply to rational irrationality, because rational irrationality supports [[systemic bias]]es in the voting population.
* Mechanisms that may be devised to keep politicians in check: There are a number of strategies for rationally ignorant voters to keep politicians in check without needing to keep themselves informed about all the details of politics. For instance, if special interest capture is a problem, and voters are rational, voters should tend to be skeptical of any proposed government program by default and demand strong evidence that it is not a sell-out to special interests. By an [[adverse selection]]-type phenomenon, this should cause government to shrink. Empirically, this does not seem to happen, as voting publics are often enthusiastic about government programs whose details they do not understand very well. This suggests either that special interest capture is not a significant problem or that voters are not behaving rationally. This is less of a problem for rational irrationality because voter support for a policy may be an example of rational irrationality.

===Expressive voting===

Brennan and Lomasky have an alternative theory of democratic failure that is quite similar to Caplan's theory of rational irrationality. Their theory, called ''expressive voting'', states that people vote to ''express'' certain beliefs. The key difference between expressive voting and rational irrationality is that the former does not require people to actually ''hold'' systematically biased beliefs, while the latter does.

Loren Lomasky, one of the proponents of expressive voting, explained some of the key differences between the theories in a critical review of Caplan's book.&lt;ref name=LomaskyReview&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k6396012k8647800/|title = Loren Lomasky's review of Caplan's book | doi=10.1007/s11127-007-9273-7 | volume=135|journal=Public Choice|pages=469–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wittman's theory of democratic success===

Donald Wittman has argued that democracy works well.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Wittman's argument rests on raising a number of objections to public choice theory, such as those outlined above while contrasting public choice theory and rational irrationality. Caplan described his own work on rational irrationality as an attempt to rescue democratic failure from Wittman's attacks. After the publication of Caplan's book, Wittman and Caplan debated each other.&lt;ref name=WittmanCaplanDebate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/wittdeb.htm|title = Debate between Bryan Caplan and Donald Wittman on democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">In [[mathematics]], '''Reeb sphere theorem''', named after [[Georges Reeb]], states that

: A closed oriented connected manifold ''M''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that admits a [[singular foliation]] having only centers  is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the foliation has exactly two singularities.

==Morse foliation==

A singularity of a foliation ''F'' is of '''Morse type''' if in its small neighborhood all leaves of the foliation are  [[level set|levels]] of a [[Morse theory|Morse function]], being the singularity a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of the function.  The singularity is a '''center''' if it is a [[maxima and minima|local extremum]] of the function; otherwise, the singularity is a [[saddle]].

The number of centers ''c'' and the number of saddles &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, specifically ''c''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''s'', is tightly connected with the manifold topology.

We denote ind&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;min(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''), the '''index''' of a singularity &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k'' is the index of the corresponding critical point of a Morse function. In particular, a center has index&amp;nbsp;0, index of a saddle is at least&amp;nbsp;1.

A '''Morse foliation''' ''F'' on a manifold ''M'' is a [[singular foliation|singular]] transversely oriented codimension one foliation of class ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with isolated singularities such that:
* each singularity of ''F'' is of Morse type,
* each [[singular leaf]] ''L'' contains a unique singularity&amp;nbsp;''p''; in addition, if ind&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 then &lt;math&gt;L\setminus p&lt;/math&gt; is not connected.

==Reeb sphere theorem==
This is the case ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the case without saddles.

Assume that &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; admits a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;-transversely oriented codimension one foliation &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with a non empty set of singularities all of them centers.

It is a consequence of the [[Reeb stability theorem]].

==Generalization==

More general case is &lt;math&gt;c&gt;s\ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1978, E. Wagneur generalized the Reeb sphere theorem to Morse foliations with saddles. He showed that the number of centers cannot be too much as compared with the number of saddles, notably, &lt;math&gt;c\le s+2&lt;/math&gt;. So there are exactly two cases when &lt;math&gt;c&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;:

:(1)   &lt;math&gt;c=s+2, &lt;/math&gt;

:(2)   &lt;math&gt;c=s+1. &lt;/math&gt;

He obtained a description of the manifold admitting a foliation with singularities that satisfy&amp;nbsp;(1).

'''Rithmomachy''' (or '''Rithmomachia''', also '''Arithmomachia''', '''Rythmomachy''', '''Rhythmomachy''', or sundry other variants; sometimes known as '''The Philosophers' Game''') is a highly complex, early European mathematical board game. The earliest known description of it dates from the eleventh century. A literal translation of the name is "The Battle of the Numbers". The game is much like [[chess]], except most methods of capture depend on the numbers inscribed on each piece.

It has been argued that between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, "rithmomachia served as a practical exemplar for teaching the contemplative values of Boethian mathematical philosophy, which emphasized the natural harmony and perfection of number and proportion. The game, Moyer argues, was used both as a mnemonic drill for the study of Boethian number theory and, more importantly, as a vehicle for moral education, by reminding players of the mathematical harmony of creation."&lt;ref&gt;Sepkoski 698&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Very little, if anything, is known about the origin of the game. But it is known that medieval writers attributed it to [[Pythagoras]], although no trace of it has been discovered in Greek literature, and the earliest mention of it is from the time of [[Hermannus Contractus]] (1013–1054).

The name, which appears in a variety of forms, points to a Greek origin, the more so because Greek was little known at the time when the game first appeared in literature. Based upon the Greek theory of numbers, and having a Greek name, it is still speculated by some that the origin of the game is to be sought in the [[Greek civilization]], and perhaps in the later schools of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] or [[Alexandria]].

The first written evidence of Rithmomachia dates back to around 1030, when a monk, named Asilo, created a game that illustrated the number theory of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius']] ''De institutione arithmetica'', for the students of monastery schools. The rules of the game were improved shortly thereafter by the respected monk, [[Hermannus Contractus]], from [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]], and in the school of [[Liège (city)|Liège]]. In the following centuries, Rithmomachia spread quickly through schools and monasteries in the southern parts of [[Germany]] and [[France]]. It was used mainly as a teaching aid, but, gradually, intellectuals started to play it for pleasure. In the 13th century Rithmomachia came to [[England]], where famous mathematician [[Thomas Bradwardine]] wrote a text about it. Even [[Roger Bacon]] recommended Rithmomachia to his students, while [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] let the inhabitants of the fictitious [[Utopia]] play it for recreation.

The game was well enough known as to justify printed treatises in Latin, French, Italian, and German, in the sixteenth century, and to have public advertisements of the sale of the board and pieces under the shadow of the old [[Sorbonne]].

==Gameplay==
The game was played on a board resembling the one used for chess or checkers, with eight squares on the shorter side, but with sixteen on the longer side. The forms used for the pieces were triangles, squares, and rounds. Pyramids could be formed by stacking pieces. The game was noteworthy in that the black and white forces were not symmetrical. Although each side had the same array of pieces, the numbers on them differed, allowing different possible captures and winning configurations to the two players.

The rules below describe the most common version of the game, played through much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. There was also a variant propounded by Fulke in the 16th century, with significantly different (and somewhat more consistent) capture rules.&lt;ref&gt;Fulke, "Of these partes in the fyrst kynd of playng"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pieces===
There are four types of pieces, which are Rounds, Triangles, Squares, and Pyramids.
* '''Rounds''': Rounds move one square in any of the four diagonals.
* '''Triangles''': Triangles can move exactly two squares vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.
* '''Squares''': Squares can move exactly three squares vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.
* '''Pyramids''': Pyramids are not actually one piece, but more than one piece put together. The White Pyramid is made of a "36" Square, a "25" Square, a "16" Triangle, a "9" Triangle, a "4" Round, and a "1" Round, which totals up to the Pyramid's value of 91. The Black Pyramid is made up of a "64" Square, a "49" Square, a "36" Triangle, a "25" Triangle, and a "16" Round, which adds up to the Pyramid's value of 190. These irregular values make it hard for them to be captured by most of the capturing methods listed below, except for '''Siege'''. Pyramids can move like a Round, a Triangle, or a Square, as long as they still contain the respective piece, which makes them very valuable.

===Capturing===
There were a variety of capture methods. Pieces do not land on another piece to capture it, but instead remain in their square and remove the other. If a piece is captured, it changes sides.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;

* '''Meeting''': If a piece could capture another piece with the same value by landing on it, the piece stays in its location and the opponent's piece is taken from the board.
* '''Assault''': If a piece with a small value, multiplied by the number of vacant spaces between it and another larger piece is equal to the larger piece, the larger piece is captured.
* '''Ambuscade''': If two pieces' sum is equal to an enemy piece that is placed between the two (i.e. the enemy piece is within a move of both attacking pieces), the enemy piece is captured and removed from the board.
* '''Siege''': If a piece is surrounded on all four sides, it is removed.

===Victory===
There were also a variety of victory conditions for determining when a game would end and who the winner was. There were common victories, and proper victories, which were recommended for more skilled players. Proper victories required placing pieces in linear arrangements in the opponent's side of the board, with the numbers formed by the arrangement following various types of numerical progression. The types of progression required — arithmetic, geometric and harmonic — suggest a connection with the mathematical work of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]].
* '''Common Victories''':
** '''De Corpore''' ([[Latin]]: "by body"): If a player captures a certain number of pieces set by both players, they win the game.
** '''De Bonis''' ("by goods"): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, he wins the game.
** '''De Lite''' ("by lawsuit"): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, and the number of digits in his captured pieces' values are less than a number set by both players, they win the game.
** '''De Honore''' ("by honour"): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, and the number of pieces he captured are less than a certain number set by both players, they win the game.
** '''De Honore Liteque''' ("by honour and lawsuit"): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, the number of digits in his captured pieces' values are less than a number set by both players, and the number of pieces he captured are less than a certain number set by both players, they win the game.
* '''Proper Victories''':
** '''Victoria Magna''' ("great victory"): This occurs when three pieces that are arranged are in an [[arithmetic progression]].
** '''Victoria Major''' ("greater victory"): This occurs when four pieces that are arranged have three pieces that are in a certain progression, and another three pieces that are in another type of progression.
** '''Victoria Excellentissima''' ("most excellent victory"): This occurs when four pieces that are arranged have all three types of mathematical progressions in three different groups.

==Popularity==
At its peak, Rithmomachy rivalled chess for popularity in Europe.  The game virtually disappeared from the 17th century until the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was rediscovered by historians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20756">In [[mathematics]], '''Ruffini's rule''' is a practical way for paper-and-pencil computation of the [[Euclidean division]] of a [[polynomial]] by a a [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]] of the form {{mvar|''x'' – ''r''}}. It was described by [[Paolo Ruffini]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cajori | first1 = Florian | authorlink1 = Florian Cajori | year = 1911 | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 389–444 | url = http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183421253 | title = Horner's method of approximation anticipated by Ruffini | format = PDF | doi = 10.1090/s0002-9904-1911-02072-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruffini's rule is a special case of [[synthetic division]] when the divisor is a linear factor.

==Algorithm==

The rule establishes a method for dividing the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0&lt;/math&gt;
by the binomial
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x)=x-r&lt;/math&gt;
to obtain the quotient polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;R(x)=b_{n-1}x^{n-1}+b_{n-2}x^{n-2}+\cdots+b_1x+b_0&lt;/math&gt;;

The algorithm is in fact the [[polynomial long division|long division]] of ''P''(''x'') by ''Q''(''x'').

To divide ''P''(''x'') by ''Q''(''x''):

# Take the coefficients of ''P''(''x'') and write them down in order. Then write ''r'' at the bottom left edge, just over the line:
#:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c c c c|c}
 &amp; a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \dots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0\\
r &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
\hline
 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
# Pass the leftmost coefficient (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) to the bottom, just under the line:
#:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c c c c|c}
 &amp; a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \dots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0\\
r &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
\hline
 &amp; a_n &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
 &amp; =b_{n-1} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
# Multiply the rightmost number under the line by ''r'' and write it over the line and one position to the right:
#:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c c c c|c}
 &amp; a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \dots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0\\
r &amp; &amp; b_{n-1} \cdot r &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
\hline
 &amp; a_n &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
 &amp; =b_{n-1} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
# Add the two values just placed in the same column
#:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c c c c|c}
 &amp; a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \dots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0\\
r &amp; &amp; b_{n-1}\cdot r &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
\hline
 &amp; a_n &amp; b_{n-1}\cdot r+a_{n-1} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
 &amp; =b_{n-1} &amp; =b_{n-2} &amp; &amp; &amp;
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
# Repeat steps 3 and 4 until no numbers remain
#:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c c c c|c}
 &amp; a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \dots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0 \\
r &amp; &amp; b_{n-1}\cdot r &amp; \dots &amp; b_1\cdot r &amp; b_0 \cdot r \\
\hline
 &amp; a_n &amp; b_{n-1} \cdot r+a_{n-1} &amp; \dots &amp; b_1 \cdot r+a_1 &amp; a_0+b_0 \cdot r \\
 &amp; =b_{n-1} &amp; =b_{n-2} &amp; \dots &amp; =b_0 &amp; =R \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The ''b'' values are the coefficients of the result (''R''(''x'')) polynomial, the degree of which is one less than that of ''P''(''x''). The final value obtained, ''s'', is the remainder.  As shown in the [[polynomial remainder theorem]], this remainder is equal to ''P''(''r''), the value of the polynomial at ''r''.

==Uses of the rule==

Ruffini's rule has many practical applications; most of them rely on simple division (as demonstrated below) or the common extensions given still further below.

===Polynomial division by ''x'' &amp;minus; ''r''===
A worked example of polynomial division, as described above.

Let:
&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formulae rendered as PNG instead of HTML to ensure consistency of representation. Please don't remove it.--&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=2x^3+3x^2-4\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x)=x+1.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We want to divide ''P''(''x'') by ''Q''(''x'') using Ruffini's rule. The main problem is that ''Q''(''x'') is not a binomial of the form ''x'' &amp;minus; ''r'', but rather ''x'' + ''r''. We must rewrite ''Q''(''x'') in this way:
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x)=x+1=x-(-1).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Now we apply the algorithm:

1. Write down the coefficients and ''r''. Note that, as ''P''(''x'') didn't contain a coefficient for ''x'', we've written 0:
     |     2     3     0     -4
     |                                    
  -1 |                                    
 ----|----------------------------
     |                                    
     |

2. Pass the first coefficient down:
     |     2     3     0     -4
     |                                    
  -1 |                                    
 ----|----------------------------
     |     2                              
     |

3. Multiply the last obtained value by ''r'':
     |     2     3     0     -4
     |                                    
  -1 |          -2                         
 ----|----------------------------
     |     2                              
     |

4. Add the values:
     |     2     3     0     -4
     |
  -1 |          -2
 ----|----------------------------
     |     2     1
     |

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we've finished:
     |     2     3     0     -4
     |
  -1 |          -2    -1      1
 ----|----------------------------
     |     2     1    -1     -3
     |{result coefficients}{remainder}

&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formulae rendered as PNG instead of HTML to ensure consistency of representation. Please don't remove it.--&gt;

So, if ''original number'' = ''divisor'' &amp;times; ''quotient'' + ''remainder'', then
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=Q(x)R(x)+s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;R(x) = 2x^2+x-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=-3; \quad \Rightarrow 2x^3+3x^2-4 = (2x^2+x-1)(x+1) - 3\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Polynomial root-finding===

The [[rational root theorem]] tells us that for a polynomial {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} all of whose coefficients (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; through ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[integer]]s, the real [[rational number|rational]] roots are always of the form ''p''/''q'', where ''p'' is an integer divisor of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q'' is an integer divisor of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus if our polynomial is

&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formula rendered as PNG instead of HTML to ensure consistency of representation. Please don't remove it.--&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=x^3+2x^2-x-2=0\,\!,&lt;/math&gt;

then the possible rational roots are all the integer divisors of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;minus;2):
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Possible roots:}\left\{+1, -1, +2, -2\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

(This example is simple because the polynomial is [[monic polynomial|monic]] (i.e. ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1); for non-monic polynomials the set of possible roots will include some fractions, but only a finite number of them since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; only have a finite number of integer divisors each.) In any case, for monic polynomials, every rational root is an integer, and so every integer root is just a divisor of the [[constant term]] (i.e. ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). It can be shown that this remains true for non-monic polynomials, i.e. ''to find the integer roots of any polynomials with integer coefficients, it suffices to check the divisors of the constant term''.

So, setting ''r'' equal to each of these possible roots in turn, we will test-divide the polynomial by ({{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r''}}). If the resulting quotient has no remainder, we have found a root.

You can choose one of the following three methods: they will all yield the same results, with the exception that only through the second method and the third method (when applying Ruffini's rule to obtain a factorization) can you discover that a given root is repeated. (Neither method will discover irrational or complex roots.)

====Method 1====

We try to divide ''P''(''x'') by the binomial (''x'' &amp;minus; each possible root). If the remainder is 0, the selected number is a root (and vice versa):
     |    +1    +2    -1     -2                      |    +1    +2    -1    -2
     |                                               |
  +1 |          +1    +3     +2                   -1 |          -1    -1    +2
 ----|----------------------------               ----|---------------------------
     |    +1    +3    +2      0                      |    +1    +1    -2     0

     |    +1    +2    -1     -2                      |    +1    +2    -1    -2
     |                                               |
  +2 |          +2    +8    +14                   -2 |          -2     0    +2
 ----|----------------------------               ----|---------------------------
     |    +1    +4    +7    +12                      |    +1     0    -1     0
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
x_1=+1\\
x_2=-1\\
x_3=-2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====

We start just as in Method 1 until we find a valid root. Then, instead of restarting the process with the other possible roots, we continue testing the possible roots against the result of the Ruffini on the valid root we've just found until we only have a coefficient remaining (remember that roots can be repeated: if you get stuck, try each valid root twice):
     |    +1    +2    -1    -2                      |    +1    +2    -1    -2
     |                                              |
  -1 |          -1    -1    +2                   -1 |          -1    -1    +2
 ----|---------------------------               ----|---------------------------
     |    +1    +1    -2   | 0                      |    +1    +1    -2   | 0
     |                                              |
  +2 |          +2    +6                         +1 |          +1    +2
 -------------------------                      -------------------------
     |    +1    +3   |+4                            |    +1    +2   | 0
                                                    |
                                                 -2 |          -2
                                                -------------------
                                                    |    +1   | 0
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
x_1=-1\\
x_2=+1\\
x_3=-2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

====Method 3====
*Determine the set of the possible integer or rational roots of the polynomial according to the [[rational root theorem]].
*For each possible root ''r'', instead of performing the division ''P''(''x'')/(''x''–''r''), apply the [[polynomial remainder theorem]], which states that the remainder of this division is ''P''(''r''), i.e. the polynomial evaluated for ''x'' = ''r''.

Thus, for each ''r'' in our set, ''r'' is actually a root of the polynomial if and only if ''P''(''r'')=0

This shows that finding ''integer and rational'' roots of a polynomial neither requires any division nor the application of Ruffini's rule.

However, once a valid root has been found, call it ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:
you can apply Ruffini's rule to determine
:''Q''(''x'')=''P''(''x'')/(''x''–''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).
This allows you to partially factorize the polynomial as
:''P''(''x'')=(''x''–''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)·''Q''(''x'')

Any additional (rational) root of the polynomial is also a root of ''Q''(''x'') and, of course, is still to be found among the possible roots determined earlier which have not yet been checked (any value already determined ''not'' to be a root of ''P''(''x'') is not a root of ''Q''(''x'') either; more formally, ''P''(''r'')≠0 → ''Q''(''r'')≠0 ).

Thus, you can proceed evaluating ''Q''(''r'') instead of ''P''(''r''), and (as long as you can find another root, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dividing ''Q''(''r'') by (''x''–''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Even if you're only searching for roots, this allows you to evaluate polynomials of successively smaller degree, as the factorization proceeds.

If, as is often the case, you are also factorizing a polynomial of degree ''n'', then:

*if you have found ''p''=''n'' rational solutions you end up with a complete factorization (see below) into ''p''=''n'' linear factors;
*if you have found ''p''&lt;''n'' rational solutions you end up with a partial factorization (see below) into ''p'' linear factors and another non-linear factor of degree ''n''–''p'', which, in turn, may have irrational or complex roots.

===== Examples =====

======Finding roots without applying Ruffini's Rule======

:{{math|1=''P''(''x'')=''x''³+2''x''²–''x''–2}}

Possible roots = {1, –1, 2, -2}

*''P''(1) = 0 → ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
*''P''(-1) = 0 → ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
*''P''(2) = 12 → 2 is not a root of the polynomial
and the remainder of {{math|1=(''x''³+2''x''²-''x''-2)/(''x''-2)}} is 12
*''P''(-2) = 0 → ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -2

======Finding roots applying Ruffini's Rule and obtaining a (complete) factorization======

:{{math|1=''P''(''x'') = ''x''³+2''x''²-''x''-2}}

Possible roots = {1, -1, 2, -2}

*''P''(1) = 0 → ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1

Then, applying Ruffini's Rule:

:{{math|1=(''x''³+2''x''²-''x''-2)/(''x''-1) = (''x''²+3''x''+2)}}
:{{math|1=''x''³+2''x''²-''x''-2 = (''x''-1)(''x''²+3''x''+2)}}

Here, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=-1 and {{math|1=''Q''(''x'') = ''x''²+3''x''+2}}

*''Q''(-1) = 0 → ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -1

Again, applying Ruffini's Rule:

:{{math|1=(''x''²+3''x''+2)/(''x''+1) = (''x''+2)}}
:{{math|1=''x''³+2''x''²-''x''-2 = (''x''-1)(''x''²+3''x''+2) = (''x''-1)(''x''+1)(''x''+2)}}

As it was possible to completely factorize the polynomial, it's clear that the last root is -2 (the previous procedure would have given the same result, with a final quotient of 1).

===Polynomial factoring===
Having used the "''p''/''q''" result above (or, to be fair, any other means) to find all the real rational roots of a particular polynomial, it is but a trivial step further to partially [[factorization|factor]] that polynomial using those roots. As is well-known, each linear factor (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'') which divides a given polynomial corresponds with a root ''r'', and ''vice versa''.

So if
&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formulae rendered as PNG instead of HTML to ensure consistency of representation. Please don't remove it.--&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is our polynomial; and
:&lt;math&gt;R=\left\{\mbox{roots of }P(x)\in\mathbb{Q}\right\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the roots we have found, then consider the product
:&lt;math&gt;R(x)=a_n{\prod (x-r)} \mbox{ for all } r\in R. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], ''R''(''x'') should be equal to ''P''(''x''), if all the roots of ''P''(''x'') are rational. But since we have been using a method which finds only rational roots, it is very likely that ''R''(''x'') is not equal to ''P''(''x''); it is very likely that ''P''(''x'') has some irrational or complex roots not in ''R''. So consider

:&lt;math&gt;S(x)=\frac{P(x)}{R(x)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which can be calculated using [[polynomial long division]].

If ''S''(''x'') = 1, then we know ''R''(''x'') = ''P''(''x'') and we are done. Otherwise, ''S''(''x'') will itself be a polynomial; this is another factor of ''P''(''x'') which has no real rational roots. So write out the right-hand-side of the following equation in full:

:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=R(x) \cdot S(x).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We can call this a ''complete factorization'' of ''P''(''x'') over '''Q''' (the rationals) if ''S''(''x'') = 1. Otherwise, we only have a ''partial factorization'' of ''P''(''x'') over '''Q''', which may or may not be further factorable over the rationals; but which will certainly be further factorable over the reals or at worst the complex plane. (Note: by a "complete factorization" of ''P''(''x'') over '''Q''', we mean a factorization as a product of polynomials with rational coefficients, such that each factor is irreducible over '''Q''', where "irreducible over '''Q'''" means that the factor cannot be written as the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients and smaller degree.)

====Example 1: no remainder====
Let
&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formulae rendered as PNG instead of HTML to ensure consistency of representation. Please don't remove it.--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=x^3+2x^2-x-2.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the methods described above, the rational roots of ''P''(''x'') are:
:&lt;math&gt;R=\left\{+1, -1, -2\right\}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the product of (''x'' &amp;minus; each root) is
:&lt;math&gt;R(x)=1(x-1)(x+1)(x+2).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And ''P''(''x'')/''R''(''x''):
:&lt;math&gt;S(x)=1.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the factored polynomial is ''P''(''x'') = ''R''(''x'') &amp;middot; 1 = ''R''(''x''):
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=(x-1)(x+1)(x+2).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2: with remainder====
Let
&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formulae rendered as PNG instead of HTML to ensure consistency of representation. Please don't remove it.--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=2x^4-3x^3+x^2-2x-8.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the methods described above, the rational roots of ''P''(''x'') are:
:&lt;math&gt;R=\left\{-1, +2\right\}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the product of (''x'' &amp;minus; each root) is
:&lt;math&gt;R(x)=(x+1)(x-2).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And ''P''(''x'')/''R''(''x'')
:&lt;math&gt;S(x)=2x^2-x+4.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;S(x){\ne}1&lt;/math&gt;, the factored polynomial is ''P''(''x'') = ''R''(''x'') &amp;middot; ''S''(''x''):
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=(x+1)(x-2)(2x^2-x+4).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Factoring over the complexes====
To completely factor a given polynomial over '''C''', the complex numbers, we must know all of its roots (and that could include irrational and/or complex numbers). For example, consider the polynomial above:
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=2x^4-3x^3+x^2-2x-8.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Extracting its rational roots and factoring it, we end with:
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=(x+1)(x-2)(2x^2-x+4).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

But that is not completely factored over '''C'''. If we need to factor our polynomial to a product of linear factors, we must deal with that quadratic factor

:&lt;math&gt;{2x^2-x+4}=0.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The easiest way is to use [[quadratic formula]], which gives us
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{(-1)^2-4\cdot 2\cdot 4}}{2\cdot 2}=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{-31}}{4}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and the solutions
:&lt;math&gt;x_1=\frac{1+\sqrt{-31}}{4}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_2=\frac{1-\sqrt{-31}}{4}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

So the completely factored polynomial over '''C''' will be:
:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=2(x+1)(x-2)\left(x-\frac{1+i\sqrt{31}}{4}\right)\left(x-\frac{1-i\sqrt{31}}{4}\right).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, it should be noted that we cannot in every case expect things to be so easy; the quadratic formula's analogue for fourth-order polynomials is very messy and no such analogue exists for 5th-or-higher order polynomials. See [[Galois theory]] for a theoretical explanation of why this is so, and see [[numerical analysis]] for ways to ''approximate'' roots of polynomials numerically.

====Limitations====

It is entirely possible that, when looking for a given polynomial's roots, we might obtain a messy higher-order polynomial for S(x) which is further factorable over the ''rationals'' even before considering irrational or complex factorings. Consider the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;9''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;6. Using Ruffini's method we will find only one root (''x'' = 3); factoring it out gives us ''P''(''x'') = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3).

As explained above, if our assignment was to "factor into irreducibles over '''C'''" we know that would have to find some way to dissect the quartic and look for its irrational and/or complex roots. But if we were asked to "factor into irreducibles over '''Q'''", we might think we are done; but it is important to realize that this might not necessarily be the case.

For in this instance the quartic is actually factorable as the product of two quadratics (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2). These, at last, are irreducible over the rationals (and, indeed, the reals as well in this example); so now we are done; ''P''(''x'') = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3). In this instance it is in fact easy to factor our quartic by treating it as a [[Quartic equation#Biquadratic equations|biquadratic equation]]; but finding such factorings of a higher degree polynomial can be very difficult.

==History==

This method was invented by [[Paolo Ruffini]]. He took part in a competition organised by the Italian Scientific Society (of Forty). The question to be answered was a method to find the roots of any polynomial. Five submissions were received. In 1804 Ruffini's was awarded the first place and the method was published. Ruffini published refinements of the method in 1807 and 1813. 

Horner's method was published in 1819 and in a refined version in 1845.

==Background==
The prize is for recent achievements in the fields of [[astronomy]], [[Biology|life science]] and [[medicine]], and [[Mathematics|mathematical sciences]]; it is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; Nominations are submitted by invited individuals beginning each year in September. The award winners are then announced in the summer, and receive the prize at the ceremony in early autumn. The winners receive a medal and a certificate. The front of the medal bears a portrait of Shaw as well as the [[English language|English]] and the [[Traditional Chinese]] name of the prize; the back bears the year, the category, the name of the winner and a Chinese quotation of philosopher [[Xun Zi]] (制天命而用之, which means "Grasp the law of nature and make use of it").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=2&amp;twoid=11 | title = Medal |publisher = shawprize.org|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the winner receives a sum of money, which is worth [[United States Dollar|US$]]1.2&amp;nbsp;million from 1 October 2015.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.shawprize.org/en/pdf/Rules_of_Procedures.pdf | title = Rules of Procedures|publisher = shawprize.org|accessdate=10 December 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, 28 prizes have been awarded to 48&amp;nbsp;individuals. The inaugural winner for the Astronomy award was Canadian [[Jim Peebles]]; he was honoured for his contributions to [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Two inaugural prizes were awarded for the Life Science and Medicine category: Americans [[Stanley Norman Cohen]], [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Yuet Wai Kan|Yuet-Wai Kan]] jointly won one of the prizes for their works pertaining to [[DNA]] while British physiologist [[Richard Doll|Sir Richard Doll]] won the other for his contribution to [[cancer]] [[epidemiology]]. [[Shiing-Shen Chern]] of China won the inaugural Mathematical Sciences award for his work on [[differential geometry]].

Of note, seven of the [[Nobel laureates]]—[[Jules Hoffmann]], [[Bruce Beutler]], [[Saul Perlmutter]], [[Adam Riess]], [[Shinya Yamanaka]], [[Robert Lefkowitz]] and [[Brian Schmidt]]—were previous laureates of the Shaw Prize.

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[singularity theory]] the '''splitting lemma''' is a useful result due to [[René Thom]] which provides a way of simplifying the local expression of a function usually applied in a neighbourhood of a degenerate [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]. 

==Formal statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f:(\mathbb{R}^n,\, 0) \;\to\; (\mathbb{R},\, 0)&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth function germ, with a critical point at 0 (so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (\partial f/\partial x_i)(0) \;=\; 0,\;(i = 1,\, \dots,\, n)&lt;/math&gt;). Let ''V'' be a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that the restriction ''f|V'' is [[critical point (mathematics)|non-degenerate]], and write ''B'' for the Hessian matrix of this restriction.  Let ''W'' be any complementary subspace to ''V''.  Then there is a change of coordinates &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Phi(x,\, y)&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Phi(x,\, y) \;=\; (\phi(x,\, y),\, y)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x \,\in\, V,\; y \,\in\, W&lt;/math&gt;, and a smooth function ''h'' on ''W'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;f\circ\Phi(x,y) = \textstyle\frac12 x^TBx + h(y).&lt;/math&gt;

This result is often referred to as the parametrized [[Morse lemma]], which can be seen by viewing ''y'' as the parameter. It is the ''gradient version'' of the [[implicit function theorem]].

==Extensions==
There are extensions to infinite dimensions, to complex analytic functions, to functions invariant under the action of a compact group, . . .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">In [[applied mathematics]], '''Strichartz estimates''' are a family of inequalities for linear [[dispersive partial differential equation]]s.  These inequalities establish size and decay of solutions in [[mixed norm]] [[Lp space|Lebesgue spaces]].  They were first noted by [[Robert Strichartz]] and arose out of contentions to the Fourier restriction problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=R.S. Strichartz|title=Restriction of Fourier Transform to Quadratic Surfaces and Decay of Solutions of Wave Equations|journal=Duke Math. J.|volume=44|year=1977|pages=705–713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Consider the linear [[Schrödinger equation]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; with ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  Then the solution for initial data &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;e^{it\Delta/2}u_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Let ''q'' and ''r'' be real numbers satisfying &lt;math&gt;2\leq q, r \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{q}+\frac{d}{r}=\frac{d}{2}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;(q,r,d)\neq(2,\infty,2)&lt;/math&gt;.  

In this case the homogeneous Strichartz estimates take the form:&lt;ref name=tao2006&gt;{{citation|author=Tao, Terence|title=Nonlinear dispersive equations: Local and global analysis|series=CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics|volume=106|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8218-4143-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\|e^{it\Delta/2} u_0\|_{L^q_tL^r_x}\leq C_{d,q,r} \|u_0\|_2.&lt;/math&gt; 
Further suppose that &lt;math&gt;\tilde q, \tilde r&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the same restrictions as &lt;math&gt;q, r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde q', \tilde r'&lt;/math&gt; are their dual exponents, then the dual homogeneous Strichartz estimates take the form:&lt;ref name=tao2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \int_\mathbb{R} e^{-is\Delta/2}F(s)\,ds\right\|_{L^2_x}\leq C_{d,\tilde q, \tilde r}\|F\|_{L^{\tilde q'}_tL^{\tilde r'}_x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates are:&lt;ref name=tao2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \int_{s&lt;t} e^{-i(t-s)\Delta/2}F(s)\,ds\right\|_{L^q_tL^r_x}\leq C_{d, q,  r, \tilde q, \tilde r}\|F\|_{L^{\tilde q'}_tL^{\tilde r'}_x}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1858">In [[order theory]], a [[subset]] ''A'' of a [[partially ordered set]] ''X'' is a '''strong downwards antichain''' if it is an [[antichain]] in which no two distinct elements have a common lower bound, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in A \; [x \neq y \rightarrow \neg\exists z \in X \; [ z \leq x \land z \leq y]]. &lt;/math&gt;

In the case where ''X'' is ordered by inclusion, this is simply a family of pairwise disjoint sets.

A '''strong upwards antichain''' ''B'' is a subset of ''X'' in which no two distinct elements have a common upper bound. Authors will often omit the "upwards" and "downwards" term and merely refer to strong antichains. Unfortunately, there is no common convention as to which version is called a strong antichain. In the context of [[Forcing_(mathematics)|forcing]], authors will sometimes also omit the "strong" term and merely refer to antichains. To resolve ambiguities in this case, the weaker type of antichain is called a '''weak antichain'''.

If ''(X,≤)'' is a partial order and there exist distinct ''x,y &amp;isin; X'' such that {''x,y''} is a strong antichain, then ''(X,≤)'' cannot be a [[Lattice_(order)|lattice]] (or even a [[Semilattice|meet semilattice]]), since by definition, every two elements in a lattice (or meet semilattice) must have a common lower bound. Thus lattices have only trivial strong antichains (i.e., strong antichains of cardinality 1 or less).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5915">In the branch of mathematics known as [[universal algebra]] (and in its applications), a '''subdirectly irreducible algebra''' is an algebra that cannot be factored as a [[subdirect product]] of "simpler" algebras. Subdirectly irreducible algebras play a somewhat analogous role in algebra to [[prime number|primes]] in [[number theory]].

==Definition==
A [[universal algebra]] ''A'' is said to be subdirectly irreducible when ''A'' has more than one element, and when any [[Subdirect product|subdirect representation]] of ''A'' includes (as a factor) an algebra [[isomorphic]] to ''A'', with the isomorphism being given by the projection map.

==Examples==
* The two-element chain, as either a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], a [[Heyting algebra]], a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], or a [[semilattice]], is subdirectly irreducible. In fact, a [[distributive lattice]] is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it has exactly two elements.
* Any finite chain with two or more elements, as a [[Heyting algebra]], is subdirectly irreducible.  (This is not the case for chains of three or more elements as either lattices or semilattices, which are subdirectly reducible to the two-element chain.  The difference with Heyting algebras is that ''a'' → ''b'' need not be comparable with ''a'' under the lattice order even when ''b'' is.)
* Any finite [[cyclic group]] of order a power of a prime (i.e. any finite [[p-group|''p''-group]]) is subdirectly irreducible.  (One weakness of the analogy between subdirect irreducibles and prime numbers is that the integers are subdirectly representable by any infinite family of nonisomorphic prime-power cyclic groups, e.g. just those of order a Mersenne prime assuming there are infinitely many.) In fact, an [[abelian group]] is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite ''p''-group or isomorphic to a [[Prüfer group]] (an infinite but countable ''p''-group, which is the [[direct limit]] of its finite ''p''-subgroups).
* A vector space is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it has dimension one.

==Properties==
The '''subdirect representation theorem''' of [[universal algebra]] states that every algebra is subdirectly representable by its subdirectly irreducible [[quotient]]s.  An equivalent definition of "subdirect irreducible" therefore is any algebra ''A'' that is not subdirectly representable by those of its quotients not isomorphic to ''A''.  (This is not quite the same thing as "by its proper quotients" because a proper quotient of ''A'' may be isomorphic to ''A'', for example the quotient of the semilattice ('''Z''', min) obtained by identifying just the two elements 3 and 4.)

An immediate corollary is that any [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]], as a class closed under homomorphisms, subalgebras, and direct products, is determined by its subdirectly irreducible members, since every algebra ''A'' in the variety can be constructed as a subalgebra of a suitable direct product of the subdirectly irreducible quotients of ''A'', all of which belong to the variety because ''A'' does.  For this reason one often studies not the variety itself but just its subdirect irreducibles.

An algebra ''A'' is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it contains two elements that are identified by every proper quotient, equivalently, if and only if its lattice '''Con''' ''A'' of [[congruence relation|congruence]]s has a least nonidentity element.  That is, any subdirect irreducible must contain a specific pair of elements witnessing its irreducibility in this way.  Given such a witness (''a'',''b'') to subdirect irreducibility we say that the subdirect irreducible is (''a'',''b'')-irreducible.

{{anchor|JonssonsLemma}}Given any class ''C'' of similar algebras, '''Jónsson's Lemma''' (due to [[Bjarni Jónsson]]) states that if the variety HSP(''C'') generated by ''C'' is [[congruence-distributive variety|congruence-distributive]], its subdirect irreducibles are in HSP&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;(''C''), that is, they are quotients of subalgebras of [[ultraproduct]]s of members of ''C''. (If ''C'' is a finite set of finite algebras, the ultraproduct operation is redundant.)

==Applications==
A necessary and sufficient condition for a Heyting algebra to be subdirectly irreducible is for there to be a greatest element strictly below 1.  The witnessing pair is that element and 1, and identifying any other pair ''a'', ''b'' of elements identifies both ''a''→''b'' and ''b''→''a'' with 1 thereby collapsing everything above those two implications to 1.  Hence every finite chain of two or more elements as a Heyting algebra is subdirectly irreducible.

By [[#JonssonsLemma|Jónsson's Lemma]], subdirectly irreducible algebras of a congruence-distributive variety generated by a finite set of finite algebras are no larger than the generating algebras, since the quotients and subalgebras of an algebra ''A'' are never larger than ''A'' itself.  For example, the subdirect irreducibles in the variety generated by a finite linearly ordered Heyting algebra ''H'' must be just the nondegenerate quotients of ''H'', namely all smaller linearly ordered nondegenerate Heyting algebras. The conditions cannot be dropped in general: for example, the variety of all Heyting algebras is generated by the set of its finite subdirectly irreducible algebras, but there exist subdirectly irreducible Heyting algebras of arbitrary (infinite) cardinality. There also exists a single finite algebra generating a (non-congruence-distributive) variety with arbitrarily large subdirect irreducibles.&lt;ref&gt;R. McKenzie, ''The residual bounds of finite algebras'', Int. J. Algebra Comput. 6 (1996), 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sun Zhiwei''' ({{zh|c=孙智伟|p=Sūn Zhìwěi|w='''Sun Chih-wei'''}}, born  October 16, 1965) is a Chinese [[mathematician]], working primarily in [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], and [[group theory]]. He is a professor at [[Nanjing University]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Huai'an|Huai'an, Jiangsu]], Sun and his twin brother [[Sun Zhihong]] proved a theorem about what are now known as the [[Wall–Sun–Sun prime]]s that guided the search for counterexamples to [[Fermat's last theorem]].

In 2003, he presented a unified approach to three famous topics of [[Paul Erdős]] in combinatorial number theory: [[covering system]]s, [[restricted sumset]]s, and [[zero-sum problem]]s or EGZ Theorem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/era/2003-09-07/S1079-6762-03-00111-2/S1079-6762-03-00111-2.pdf Unification of zero-sum problems, subset sums and covers of &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He used [[q-series]] to prove that any natural number can be represented as a sum of an even [[Square number|square]] and two [[triangular number]]s. He conjectured, and proved with B.-K. Oh, that each positive integer can be represented as a sum of a square, an odd square and a triangular number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3750 Mixed sums of squares and triangular numbers (III)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he conjectured that any natural number can be written as the sum of two squares and a [[pentagonal number]], as the sum of a [[triangular number]], an even square and a [[pentagonal number]], and as the sum of a square, a [[pentagonal number]] and a [[hexagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0635 On universal sums of polygonal numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;
He also raised many open conjectures on congruences &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5665 Open conjectures on congruences]&lt;/ref&gt;
and posed over 100 conjectural series for powers of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5649 List of conjectural series for powers of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and other constants]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he published a paper &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X13000747 On functions taking only prime values], J. Number Theory 133(2013), 2794-2812&lt;/ref&gt; containing many conjectures on primes, one of which states that for any positive integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; there are consecutive primes &lt;math&gt;p_k,\ldots,p_n\ (k&lt;n)&lt;/math&gt; not exceeding &lt;math&gt;2m+2.2\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;m=p_n-p_{n-1}+...+(-1)^{n-k}p_k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th prime.

In the paper &lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2016.11.008 Refining Lagrange's four-square theorem], J. Number Theory 175(2017), 167-190&lt;/ref&gt;, he refined [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] in various ways and posed many related conjectures one of which is [[Sun's 1-3-5 conjecture]]&lt;ref&gt;http://oeis.org/A271518&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is the Editor-in-Chief of the [https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=7065 Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory].

'''Toniann Pitassi'''  is a  Canadian and American [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]] specializing in [[computational complexity theory]].

==Academic career==
A native of [[Pittsburgh]], Pitassi earned bachelor's and master's degrees at [[Pennsylvania State University]] before moving to the  [[University of Toronto]] for her doctoral studies; she earned her Ph.D. in 1992 from Toronto under the supervision of [[Stephen Cook]]. After postdoctoral studies at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and faculty positions at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[University of Arizona]], she returned to Toronto in 2001, and is now a professor in the [[University of Toronto Department of Computer Science]] and [[University of Toronto Department of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~toni/|title=Toniann Pitassi|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Toronto|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=80101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an invited speaker at [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Berlin in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/icm-plenary-and-invited-speakers?combine=Pitassi|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers|last=|first=|date=|website=International Mathematical Union|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the program chair for the 2012 [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cs.nyu.edu/~stoc2012/default.htm|title=STOC 2012 - 44th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|last=|first=|date=|website=[[New York University]], Computer Science Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September through December 2017, she was a Visiting Professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/toniann-pitassi|title=Toniann Pitassi|work=Institute for Advanced Study|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Pitassi's research has largely focused on [[proof complexity]], a branch of [[computational complexity theory]] that seeks [[upper and lower bounds]] on the lengths of [[mathematical proof]]s of [[Proposition|logical propositions]] within various formalized proof systems. The goal of this study is to use these bounds to understand both the [[time complexity]] of proof-finding procedures, and the relative strengths of different proof systems.

Research contributions that she has made in this area include exponential lower bounds for  [[Frege system|Frege proofs]] of the [[pigeonhole principle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pitassi|Beame|Impagliazzo|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; exponential lower bounds for the [[cutting-plane method]] applied to propositions derived from the [[maximum clique problem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bonet|Pitassi|Raz|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; exponential lower bounds for [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]] proofs of dense random [[3-satisfiability]] instances,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beame|Pitassi|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Beame|Karp|Pitassi|Saks|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and subexponential upper bounds for the same dense random instances using the [[Davis–Putnam algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beame|Karp|Pitassi|Saks|1998}}; {{harvtxt|Beame|Karp|Pitassi|Saks|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With Paul Beame, she also wrote a survey of proof complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beame|Pitassi|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torsten Carleman''' (8 July 1892, Visseltofta, [[Osby Municipality]] – 11 January 1949, [[Stockholm]]), born '''Tage Gillis Torsten Carleman''', was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mathematician]], known for his results in [[classical analysis]] and its applications. As the director of the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] for more than two decades, Carleman was the most influential mathematician in Sweden.

==Work==

The dissertation of Carleman under [[Erik Albert Holmgren]], as well as his work in the early 1920s, was devoted to [[singular integral equations]]. He developed the [[spectral theory]] of [[integral operator]]s with ''Carleman kernels'', that is, [[integral transform|kernels]] ''K''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') such that ''K''(''y'',&amp;nbsp;''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;''K''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;/span&gt; for [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), and 
:&lt;math&gt; \int | K(x, y) |^2 dy &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;
for almost every ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=0605488|last=Dieudonné|first=Jean|author-link=Jean Dieudonné|title=History of functional analysis|series=North-Holland Mathematics Studies|volume=49|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Co.|location=Amsterdam&amp;ndash;New York|year=1981|isbn=0-444-86148-3|pages=168&amp;ndash;171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=0028526|last=Ahiezer|first=N.

Nauk|volume=2|year=1947|issue=5(21)|pages=93&amp;ndash;132|url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/umn6983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1920s, Carleman developed the theory of [[quasi-analytic function]]s. He proved the necessary and sufficient condition for quasi-analyticity, now called the [[Denjoy–Carleman theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=0006354|last=Mandelbrojt|first=S.|author-link=Szolem Mandelbrojt|title=Analytic functions and classes of infinitely differentiable functions|journal=Rice Inst. Pamphlet|volume= 29|year=1942|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, he obtained a [[Carleman's condition|sufficient condition]] for the determinacy of the [[moment problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |mr=0184042 |first=N. I. |last=Akhiezer |author-link=Naum Akhiezer|title=The Classical Moment Problem and Some Related Questions in Analysis |publisher=Oliver &amp; Boyd |year=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the steps in the proof of the Denjoy–Carleman theorem in {{harvtxt|Carleman|1926}}, he introduced the [[Carleman inequality]]
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n\right)^{1/n} \le e \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n,&lt;/math&gt;
valid for any sequence of non-negative real numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=1820809|last1=Pečarić|first1=Josip|last2=Stolarsky|first2=Kenneth B.|title=Carleman's inequality: history and new generalizations|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume= 61|year=2001|issue=1&amp;ndash;2|pages=49&amp;ndash;62|doi=10.1007/s000100050160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, he established the ''[[Carleman formulae]]'' in [[complex analysis]], which reconstruct an [[analytic function]] in a domain from its values on a subset of the boundary. He also proved a generalisation of [[Jensen's formula]], now called the [[Jensen–Carleman formula]].&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=F.|authorlink=Fritz Carlson|title=Torsten Carleman|language=French|journal=Acta Math.|volume=82|year=1950|issue=1|pages=i&amp;ndash;vi|mr=1555457|doi=10.1007/BF02398273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, independently of [[John von Neumann]], he discovered the [[mean ergodic theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=1546100|doi=10.1215/S0012-7094-39-00501-6|zbl= 0021.23501|last=Wiener|first=N.|author-link=Norbert Wiener|title=The ergodic theorem|journal=Duke Math. J.|volume=5|year=1939|issue=1|pages=1&amp;ndash;18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he worked in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s, where he introduced the ''[[Carleman estimates]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=0934297|last=Kenig|first=Carlos E.|chapter=Carleman estimates, uniform Sobolev inequalities for second-order differential operators, and unique continuation theorems|title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. 1, 2 (Berkeley, Calif., 1986)|pages=948&amp;ndash;960|publisher=Amer. Math. Soc.|location=Providence, RI|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found a way to study the spectral asymptotics of [[Schrödinger operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=0510064|last=Clark|first=Colin|title=The asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for elliptic boundary value problems|journal=SIAM Rev.|volume=9|year=1967|pages=627&amp;ndash;646|doi=10.1137/1009105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, following the work of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Erik Ivar Fredholm]], and [[Bernard Koopman]], he devised the ''[[Carleman embedding]]'' (also called ''Carleman linearization''), a way to embed a finite-dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations {{frac|d'''u'''|d''t''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''P'''('''u''') for '''u''':&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', where the components of '''P'''  are polynomials in '''u''', into an infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=1178493|last1=Kowalski|first1=Krzysztof|last2=Steeb|first2=Willi-Hans|title=Nonlinear dynamical systems and Carleman linearization|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co., Inc|location=River Edge, NJ|year=1991|isbn=981-02-0587-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=1296251|last=Kowalski|first=K|title=Methods of Hilbert spaces in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co., Inc.|location=River Edge, NJ|year=1994|isbn=981-02-1753-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Carleman published a short proof of what is now called the [[Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sur une inégalité différentielle dans la théorie des fonctions analytiques|journal=[[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences]]|date=April 3, 1933|volume=196|pages=995–7|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3148d/f995.image.langFR|author=Torsten Carleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theorem states that the number of asymptotic values attained by an [[entire function]] of order ρ along curves in the [[complex plane]] going outwards toward infinite absolute value is less than or equal to 2ρ.

In 1935, Torsten Carleman introduced a generalisation of [[Fourier transform]], which foreshadowed the work of [[Mikio Sato]] on [[hyperfunction]]s;&lt;ref name=kiselman&gt;{{cite book|mr=2068535|last=Kiselman|first=Christer O.|chapter=Generalized Fourier transformations: The work of Bochner and Carleman viewed in the light of the theories of Schwartz and Sato|title=Microlocal analysis and complex Fourier analysis|pages=166&amp;ndash;185|publisher=World Sci. Publ.|location=River Edge, NJ|year=2002|url=http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/ws-p8-50x6-00.pdf|format=pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; his notes were published in {{harvtxt|Carleman|1944}}. He considered the functions ''f'' of at most polynomial growth, and showed that every such function can be decomposed as ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; are analytic in the upper and lower half planes, respectively, and that this representation is essentially unique. Then he defined the Fourier transform of  (''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;) as another such pair (''g''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;). Though conceptually different, the definition coincides with the one given later by [[Laurent Schwartz]] for [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]].&lt;ref name=kiselman/&gt; Carleman's definition gave rise to numerous extensions.&lt;ref name=kiselman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=1180762|last=Singh|first=U. N.|chapter=The Carleman-Fourier transform and its applications|title=Functional analysis and operator theory|pages=181&amp;ndash;214|series=Lecture Notes in Math.|volume=1511|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to [[mathematical physics]] in the 1930s, Carleman gave the first proof of global existence for [[Boltzmann's equation]] in the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases (his result applies to the space-homogeneous case).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mr=2509759|last=Cercignani|first=C.|author-link=Carlo Cercignani|title=134 years of Boltzmann equation.

Soc.|location=Zürich|year=2008|doi=10.4171/057-1/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were published posthumously in {{harvtxt|Carleman|1957}}.

Carleman supervised the Ph.D. theses of Ulf Hellsten, Karl Persson (Dagerholm), [[Åke Pleijel]] and (jointly with [[Fritz Carlson]]) of [[Hans Rådström]].

==Life==
Carleman was born in [[Visseltofta]] to Alma Linnéa Jungbeck and Karl Johan Carleman, a school teacher.&lt;ref name=carlson/&gt; He studied at [[Katedralskolan, Växjö|Växjö Cathedral School]], graduating in 1910.

He continued his studies at [[Uppsala University]], being one of the active members of the Uppsala Mathematical Society. Kjellberg recalls: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was a genius! My older friends in Uppsala used to tell me about the wonderful years they had had when Carleman was there. He was the most active speaker in the Uppsala Mathematical Society and a well-trained gymnast. When people left the seminar crossing the [[Fyris River]], he walked on his hands on the railing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=B.|last=Kjellberg|chapter=Mathematicians in Uppsala &amp;mdash; some recollections|language=Swedish|editor=A. Vretblad|title=Festschrift in honour of Lennart Carleson and Yngve Domar|series=Proc. Conf. at Dept. of Math.|publisher=Uppsala Univ.|location=Uppsala|year=1995|pages=87&amp;ndash;95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1917 he was docent at Uppsala University, and from 1923 &amp;mdash; a full professor at [[Lund University]]. In 1924 he was appointed professor at [[Stockholm University]]. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1926. From 1927, he was director of the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] and editor of [[Acta Mathematica]].&lt;ref name = carlson/&gt;

From  1929 to 1946 Carleman was married to Anna-Lisa Lemming (1885&amp;ndash;1954),&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Death Index, which is a Windows based digital data base, shows different dates (1940 and 1946) of their divorce; {{harvtxt|Maligranda|2003}} lists the year of divorce as 1940. Her original name was Anna Lovisa Lemming, born July 20, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt;  the half-sister &lt;ref&gt;Thus according to the [http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=2262 Swedish Church birth records]. Note that several sources, including  {{harvtxt|Maligranda|2003}}, state that she was the daughter of Eric Lemming.&lt;/ref&gt; of the athlete [[Eric Lemming]]  who won four golden medals and three bronze at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sok.se/5.e6c6d71083860e1fa80003820.html Webpage of the Swedish Olympic Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523213321/http://www.sok.se/5.e6c6d71083860e1fa80003820.html |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson remembers Carleman as: "secluded and taciturn, who looked at life and people with a bitter humour. In his heart, he was inclined to kindliness towards those around him, and strove to assist them swiftly."&lt;ref name=carlson/&gt; Towards the end of his life, he remarked to his students that "professors ought to be shot at the age of fifty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=1488153|last=Gårding|first=Lars|author-link=Lars Gårding|title=Mathematics and mathematicians.

During the last decades of his life, Carleman abused alcohol, according to [[Norbert&amp;nbsp;Wiener]]&lt;ref&gt;
"He died of drink&lt;!-- — not the social drinking which leads so often to ruin here—but the fiery, passionate dipsomania which is a common disease even in the very best circles of the Scandinavian countries --&gt;.... During meetings he was often a&amp;nbsp;bit&amp;nbsp;drunk, and afterwards in&amp;nbsp;Paris I saw him come to Mandelbrojt's apartment for an advance on the travel&amp;nbsp;money due&amp;nbsp;him, red-eyed, with a three-day beard." {{cite book|first=Norbert|last=Wiener|authorlink=Norbert Wiener|edition=later republished by MIT Press|mr=77455|title=I am a mathematician: The later life of a prodigy|publisher= Doubleday and&amp;nbsp;Co.|location=Garden City,&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Y.|pages=317–318|year=1956|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Z9jdTpzJB4X44QTZn8iaBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=a4jgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Norbert+Wiener%2C+Mandelbrojt%2C+Carleman&amp;q=Carleman%2C+drink#search_anchor|ref=harv}}

In [[mathematics]], tables of [[trigonometric function]]s are useful in a number of areas. Before the existence of [[pocket calculator]]s, '''trigonometric tables''' were essential for [[navigation]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. The calculation of [[mathematical table]]s was an important area of study, which led to the development of the [[history of computing|first mechanical computing devices]].

Modern computers and pocket calculators now generate trigonometric function values on demand, using special libraries of mathematical code. Often, these libraries use pre-calculated tables internally, and compute the required value by using an appropriate interpolation method. Interpolation of simple look-up tables of trigonometric functions is still used in [[computer graphics]], where only modest accuracy may be required and speed is often paramount.

Another important application of trigonometric tables and generation schemes is for [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms, where the same trigonometric function values (called ''twiddle factors'') must be evaluated many times in a given transform, especially in the common case where many transforms of the same size are computed. In this case, calling generic library routines every time is unacceptably slow. One option is to call the library routines once, to build up a table of those trigonometric values that will be needed, but this requires significant memory to store the table. The other possibility, since a regular sequence of values is required, is to use a recurrence formula to compute the trigonometric values on the fly. Significant research has been devoted to finding accurate, stable recurrence schemes in order to preserve the accuracy of the FFT (which is very sensitive to trigonometric errors).

== On-demand computation ==
[[File:Bernegger Manuale 137.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A page from a 1619 book of [[mathematical table]]s.]]

Modern computers and calculators use a variety of techniques to provide trigonometric function values on demand for arbitrary angles (Kantabutra, 1996). One common method, especially on higher-end processors with [[Floating point|floating-point]] units, is to combine a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function|rational]] [[approximation theory|approximation]] (such as [[Chebyshev approximation]], best uniform approximation, and [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]], and typically for higher or variable precisions, [[Taylor series|Taylor]] and [[Laurent series]]) with range reduction and a table lookup &amp;mdash; they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Maintaining precision while performing such interpolation is nontrivial, however; and methods like [[Gal's accurate tables]], Cody and Waite reduction, and Payne and Hanek reduction algorithms can be used for this purpose. On simpler devices that lack a [[hardware multiplier]], there is an algorithm called [[CORDIC]] (as well as related techniques) that is more efficient, since it uses only [[shift operator|shift]]s and additions. All of these methods are commonly implemented in [[computer hardware|hardware]] for performance reasons.

The particular polynomial used to approximate a trig function is generated ahead of time using some approximation of a [[minimax approximation algorithm]].

For [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|very high precision]] calculations, when series-expansion convergence becomes too slow, trigonometric functions can be approximated by the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], which itself approximates the trigonometric function by the ([[complex number|complex]]) [[elliptic integral]] (Brent, 1976).

Trigonometric functions of angles that are [[rational number|rational]] multiples of 2π are [[algebraic number]]s. The values for ''a/b·2π'' can be found by applying [[de Moivre's identity]] for ''n = a'' to a ''b&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[root of unity]], which is also a root of the polynomial ''x&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; - 1'' in the [[complex plane]].  For example, the cosine and sine of 2π&amp;nbsp;⋅&amp;nbsp;5/37 are the [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s, respectively, of the 5th power of the 37th root of unity cos(2π/37) + sin(2π/37)i, which is a root of the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]-37 polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. For this case, a root-finding algorithm such as [[Newton's method]] is much simpler than the arithmetic-geometric mean algorithms above while converging at a similar asymptotic rate. The latter algorithms are required for [[transcendental number|transcendental]] trigonometric constants, however.

== Half-angle and angle-addition formulas ==

Historically, the earliest method by which trigonometric tables were computed, and probably the most common until the advent of computers, was to repeatedly apply the half-angle and angle-addition [[Trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] starting from a known value (such as sin(π/2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, cos(π/2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). This method was used by the ancient astronomer [[Ptolemy]], who derived them in the ''[[Almagest]]'', a treatise on astronomy. In modern form, the identities he derived are stated as follows (with signs determined by the quadrant in which ''x'' lies;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}(1 + \cos x)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - \cos x)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x \pm y) = \sin(x) \cos(y) \pm \cos(x) \sin(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(x \pm y) = \cos(x) \cos(y) \mp \sin(x) \sin(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

These were used to construct [[Ptolemy's table of chords]], which was applied to astronomical problems.

Various other permutations on these identities are possible: for example, some early trigonometric tables used not sine and cosine, but sine and [[versine]]).

== A quick, but inaccurate, approximation ==

A quick, but inaccurate, algorithm for calculating a table of ''N'' approximations ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for [[sine|sin]](2[[Pi|&amp;pi;]]''n''/''N'') and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for [[cosine|cos]](2π''n''/''N'') is:

:''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
:''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''d'' &amp;times; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''d'' &amp;times; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
for ''n'' = 0,...,''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, where ''d'' = 2π/''N''.

This is simply the [[Numerical ordinary differential equations#Euler method|Euler method]] for integrating the [[differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;ds/dt = c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dc/dt = -s&lt;/math&gt;

with initial conditions ''s''(0) = 0 and ''c''(0) = 1, whose analytical solution is ''s'' = sin(''t'') and ''c'' = cos(''t'').

Unfortunately, this is not a useful algorithm for generating sine tables because it has a significant error, proportional to 1/''N''.

For example, for ''N'' = 256 the maximum error in the sine values is ~0.061 (''s''&lt;sub&gt;202&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;1.0368 instead of &amp;minus;0.9757). For ''N'' = 1024, the maximum error in the sine values is ~0.015 (''s''&lt;sub&gt;803&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;0.99321 instead of &amp;minus;0.97832), about 4 times smaller. If the sine and cosine values obtained were to be plotted, this algorithm would draw a logarithmic spiral rather than a circle.

== A better, but still imperfect, recurrence formula ==

A simple recurrence formula to generate trigonometric tables is based on [[Euler's formula]] and the relation:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(\theta + \Delta)} = e^{i\theta} \times e^{i\Delta\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the following recurrence to compute trigonometric values ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as above:

:''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
:''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
for ''n'' = 0, ..., ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, where ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = cos(2π/''N'') and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = sin(2π/''N''). These two starting trigonometric values are usually computed using existing library functions (but could also be found e.g. by employing [[Newton's method]] in the complex plane to solve for the primitive [[root of unity|root]] of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1).

This method would produce an ''exact'' table in exact arithmetic, but has errors in finite-precision [[floating-point]] arithmetic. In fact, the errors grow as O(ε&amp;nbsp;''N'') (in both the worst and average cases), where ε is the floating-point precision.

A significant improvement is to use the following modification to the above, a trick (due to Singleton, 1967) often used to generate trigonometric values for FFT implementations:

:''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
:''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;alpha;''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;beta; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(&amp;beta;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)

where α = 2&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(π/''N'') and β = sin(2π/''N''). The errors of this method are much smaller, O(ε&amp;nbsp;√''N'') on average and O(ε&amp;nbsp;''N'') in the worst case, but this is still large enough to substantially degrade the accuracy of FFTs of large sizes.
