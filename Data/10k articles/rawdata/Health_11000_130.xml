The '''Acid Survivors Foundation''' is a Bangladeshi Non-Government organisation dedicated to raising awareness and preventing [[acid attack]]s and providing survivors with medical and legal aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-52214|title=Acid survivors seek to start life anew|date=2008-08-28|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The Foundation was founded by Group of four concerned citizens namely i) Mr. Kazi Fazlur Rahman, former adviser to the caretaker president. ii) Dr. S. L. Sen, Plastic Surgeon. iii) Advocate Sigma Huda &amp; iv) Mr. Selim Ahmed on 12 May 1999 with substantial support from [[UNICEF]] and the [[Canadian International Development Agency]]. [[Nasreen Huq]] a commanding personality in the field of social reform and human rights in Bangladesh campaigned internationally for ASF. In 2005, [[Monira Rahman]] the Ex-Executive Director of ASF was awarded the Human Rights Award by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidsurvivors.org/Acid-Survivors-Foundation|title=Acid Survivors Foundation|website=www.acidsurvivors.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh's ASF has subsequently been used as a model organisation for the establishment of ASFs in Uganda, [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity|Cambodia]], and Pakistan, all of which are sustained by [[Acid Survivors Trust International]] (ASTI) also headed by Sir John Morrison.

==Notification and Referral Services (NRS)==

Upon its establishment the ASF worked in collaboration with [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] to develop a nationwide notification system to identify acid attacks within 24-hours. Within 48-hours the situation is to be investigated and the victim brought to the [[Acid Survivors Foundation#Acid Survivors Foundation Hospital|ASF hospital]] in Dhaka. A 24/7 hotline is also maintained, which allows attacks to be reported and victims to be transferred to the ASF hospital. The NRS also allows government agencies, NGOs, &amp; the media to stay informed.

== Acid Survivors Foundation Hospital ==

Acid attack victims require specialised treatments including reconstructive plastic surgery, [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]], and the application of pressure garments. Patients usually need specialised treatment for the eye, ear, nose, mouth, neck, and/or other body parts. Other injuries and health conditions including [[Bone fracture|fractures]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], pregnancy, etc. will affect the course of treatment procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-79103|title=Australian help to reintegrate acid survivors into society|date=2009-03-09|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon ASF's inception in 1999, the [[Dhaka Medical College Hospital|Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH)]], with its 8-bed burn unit, was the only hospital in Bangladesh that specialised in treating any form of burn injury. To partially rectify the situation, ASF, with the help of the [[British High Commission]] and [[British and Commonwealth Women's Association|British Women's Association]] started a 20-bed Burn Rehabilitation Center in November 1999, which has become known as informally as Thikana (meaning destination in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-52214|title=Acid survivors seek to start life anew|date=2008-08-28|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2003/07/20/d30720610285.htm|title=Acid Survivors Foundation in the forefront|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological support services==
The permanently damaging nature of acid attacks and the inefficiency of the Bangladesh justice system are a serious and sometimes permanent detriment to the psychological health of survivors and their families. This can result in the development of psychiatric conditions, including [[Post traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] and [[Suicide crisis|suicidal tendencies]], needingspecialized psychiatric care. However, DMCH is currently the only hospital in Bangladesh with a clinical psychology department.

Consequently, ASF provides bed-side and community psychological support to help victims and their families overcome the trauma of the attack. ASF currently has one clinical psychologist and two peer counselors at its hospital to provide counselling and psycho-therapeutic services. ASF also organises music and art therapy in its hospital to help patients express their emotions.

==Rehabilitation and reintegration==
Attacks will temporarily removes one's capacity for work or study. This capacity can be rebuilt following treatment through rehabilitation and reintegration techniques.

ASF statistics have shown that 46% of perpetrators are someone close to the victim. About 26% are husbands and 20% are other family members. Therefore, many victims of acid violence are unable to return to their families; however, some are compelled to regardless due to a lack of an income source.

The Department of Social Welfare and both National and District Acid Control Councils have funds that provide interest free loans to survivors. ASF is continuously working with its partners and survivors to ensure that these funds are effectively used for benefit of acid survivors. [[Microfinance|Microfinancing]] is often not an option as acid survivors fall into a high risk category for investment. They initially do not have a regular source of income and do not feel confident about repayment of loans.

===Rehabilitation strategy===
ASF works to rehabilitate its patients through the use of the following measures:

====Advocacy====
ASF advocates to ensure that survivors' legal rights are met. ASF's advocacy campaigns directly involve survivors as spokespersons for change. This allows campaigns to hold more clout and give survivors more self-confidence. ASF also lobbies with the government, NGOs, business organisations, and other agencies to provide rehabilitation support for survivors.

====Direct services from ASF====
To ensure that survivors are in a position to act as spokespersons, they will need to have secured livelihoods. As such, ASF compliments government efforts by providing rehabilitation support to survivors through social protection and other schemes, which enable survivors to establish a secured livelihood and successfully reintegration into mainstream society.

ASF also provides emergency financial support to victim's who are the sole breadwinner of their family and provides education support to encourage survivors to continue primary and secondary schooling.

==Legal support==
The effective prevention of acid violence can only be ensured if all perpetrators are brought to justice and the state can effectively control the illegal use of acid.

Prior to 2002 acid related offences were primarily dealt with using The Prevention of Oppression Against Women and Children Act of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apwld.org/pdf/prevention_act%2020.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130034010/http://www.apwld.org/pdf/prevention_act%2020.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-30  |title=Act No VIII of 2000 |website=Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law, and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASF along with other humans' rights organisations, social activists, and pressure groups advocated for the introduction of new laws to combat acid offences specifically. ASF, the newspaper [[Prothom Alo]], and BRAC on [[International Women's Day]] mobilised over 5000 people to march alongside 100 acid attack survivors as a campaign for new laws.

ASF's efforts have resulted in the creation of two laws on 17 April 2002: [[Acid throwing#Bangladesh 2|the Acid Crime Control Act (ACCA) and the Acid Control Act (ACA)]], making it the first country in the world to have specific laws against acid attacks.

ASF provides legal support for survivors by referring them to its legal partners including BRAC, Aino Salish Kendro (ASK), the Bangladesh National Women Lawyer's Association (BNWLA), and the Bangladesh Legal Aid Services and Trust (BLAST). ASF's case managers prepare case reports of each survivor as they are admitted in the ASF Hospital and then provide legal advice to both survivors and their family. While the legal partners pursue court cases for each survivor, ASF's case managers monitor the role of the police and public prosecutors to ensure the utmost concern is given.

==Advocating awareness==
Bangladesh has the highest reported incidence of acid violence in the world. In Bangladesh, acid violence is largely a gender-discriminatory crime against women. Since its inception, ASF has worked to create successful prevention campaigns which have led to significant reductions in acid attacks. ASF runs local and national prevention campaigns using radio, television, and print to bring the issue into public attention.

===ASF campaigns 2011===

| School and college || 42 || 9,325
|-
| Survivors' conference || 4 || 238
|-

|}

===School and college campaigns===
ASF has organised various school and college campaigns to motivate students into taking an active role in preventing of acid violence in their communities. The campaigns also help raise awareness as to the causes of acid violence, which will engender a change in attitude towards women and human relationships. The campaigns also work to sensitise youth to the social rehabilitation needs of victims and to encourage youth not to discriminate against students with scars and disfigurements. Students are also informed as to the proper procedure for dealing with acid attacks.

===Community meetings===
ASF's community meetings involve survivors' families, community leaders, and representatives of the local government with the purpose of making them aware of the consequences of acid violence as well as the psycho-social struggles of survivors. Plans to accelerate community acceptance of survivors, ensure social protection, and promote favourable environments for healing are also discussed.

==="Use water"===
ASF has taken great measures to raise awareness as to the importance of using water immediately after an attack. Information is given to do the following if any part of the body is exposed to acid or if acid is swallowed:
* Pour large amounts of water on the affected area for at least thirty minutes.
* Hold eyelids open and flush the area with water for at least thirty minutes if eyes are affected.
* Drink large amounts of water and vomit immediately if acid is swallowed.

==International support==

===United Kingdom===

====[[Department of International Development]]====
21 June 2011, British [[Minister of State for International Development|Minister of State for the Department of International Development]] [[Alan Duncan]] visits the ASF hospital and interacts with survivors. He also met with the Prime Minister to request the securing of a plot of land where the British Government would help ASF build an "ASF Burn Complex". The reduction in the number of acid related burn c[[File:Stephen OBrien visits survivors of acid attacks in Bangladesh (6395601343).jpg|thumb|[[Department for International Development|British Parliamentary Undersecretary of State in the Department of International Development]] [[Stephen O'Brien]] plays a game with victims of [[acid attacks]] at the ASF Hospital in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] on 18 November 2011]]
ases has been in proportion to increasing reports of kerosene and gas attacks. Bangladesh has a single 100-bed facility for treating all these cases, which ASF and the Department of International Development both agree is not sufficient.

====HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal====
1 March 2011, HRH Princess Anna visits ASF for the second time (the first being in 2000), where she witnessed the rehabilitation centre in action and interacted with some victims.

====English Cricket Team====
17 February 2011, the English Cricket Team visits ASF, where they interacted with victims.

'''Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency''' is a [[vasculitis]] syndrome.&lt;ref name="Meyts2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyts|first=Isabelle|last2=Aksentijevich|first2=Ivona|date=2018-06-27|title=Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2): Updates on the Phenotype, Genetics, Pathogenesis, and Treatment|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10875-018-0525-8|journal=Journal of Clinical Immunology|language=en|doi=10.1007/s10875-018-0525-8|issn=0271-9142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giannelou|first=Angeliki|last2=Zhou|first2=Qing|last3=Kastner|first3=Daniel L.|date=December 2014|title=When less is more: primary immunodeficiency with an autoinflammatory kick|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=14|issue=6|pages=491–500|doi=10.1097/ACI.0000000000000117|issn=1473-6322|pmc=4212813|pmid=25337682}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is due to mutations in the [[ADA2]] gene which encodes the adenosine deaminase 2 protein. The clinical features of this condition are protean and it may be easily missed.

==Genetics==

The ADA2 gene is located in the long arm of [[chromosome 22]] (22q11.1).

Over 60 pathogenic mutations have been recognised in ADA2. In all clinical cases to date both copies of the gene have been mutated implying a recessive inheritance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Epidemiology==

This is a rare condition with less than 200 cases reported.&lt;ref name="Hashem2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hashem|first=Hasan|last2=Kelly|first2=Susan J.|last3=Ganson|first3=Nancy J.|last4=Hershfield|first4=Michael S.|date=2017-10-05|title=Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2), an Inherited Cause of Polyarteritis Nodosa and a Mimic of Other Systemic Rheumatologic Disorders|journal=Current Rheumatology Reports|volume=19|issue=11|pages=70|doi=10.1007/s11926-017-0699-8|issn=1534-6307|pmid=28983775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical features==

The age of onset of symptoms is variable: 24% of reported patients present before 1 year of age. 77% present before the age 10 years. Adult onset has also been described. 5-10% die from this disease by the age of 30 years.

Like all vasculitis syndromes the features depend on which is organ is involved. Most commonly the gut, kidney and liver are affected.

It may affect the skin ([[livedo reticularis]] and [[livedo racemosa]]) or brain ([[stroke]]).&lt;ref name="Nanthapisal2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nanthapisal|first=Sira|last2=Murphy|first2=Claire|last3=Omoyinmi|first3=Ebun|last4=Hong|first4=Ying|last5=Standing|first5=Ariane|last6=Berg|first6=Stefan|last7=Ekelund|first7=Maria|last8=Jolles|first8=Stephen|last9=Harper|first9=Lorraine|date=September 2016|title=Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase Type 2: A Description of Phenotype and Genotype in Fifteen Cases|journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)|volume=68|issue=9|pages=2314–2322|doi=10.1002/art.39699|issn=2326-5205|pmid=27059682}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyarteritis nodosa]] in children is also known to occur.&lt;ref name="Caorsi2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caorsi|first=Roberta|last2=Penco|first2=Federica|last3=Schena|first3=Francesca|last4=Gattorno|first4=Marco|date=2016-09-08|title=Monogenic polyarteritis: the lesson of ADA2 deficiency|journal=Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal|volume=14|issue=1|pages=51|doi=10.1186/s12969-016-0111-7|issn=1546-0096|pmc=5015262|pmid=27609179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5152">'''The Anaphylaxis Campaign''' is a British charity that solely supports people at risk from [[Anaphylaxis|severe allergic reactions.]] For over 21 years, the charity has provided information and support to patients and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk The Anaphylaxis Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anaphylaxis Campaign was created to ensure a safe environment for all people with allergies by working with and educating the food industry, schools, pre-schools, colleges, health professionals and other key audiences. It focuses on medical facts, food labelling, risk reduction and allergen management.

The charity also trains patients, carers and healthcare professionals through its Allergy Wise online training.  They have a nationwide network of volunteer-led peer support groups for people whose lives are affected by the risk of an acute allergic reaction, and to help people with severe allergies to be more confidently in control of their lives. It actively campaigns to raise awareness of anaphylaxis with the general public and with the relevant authorities for better allergy care and treatments.

==Origins and key people==
The Campaign was established in 1994 following the deaths of four people from allergic reactions to nuts. Its founder and honorary vice-president, David Reading, was made [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 2005 New Year's Honours List for services to people with allergies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4136305.stm Work of unsung heroes is honoured, BBC News, 31 December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campaign's honorary president is [[William Frankland (immunologist)|William Frankland]], the pioneer immunologist, who turned 106 in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/about-us/honorary-president/a-life-in-allergy A life in allergy, Anaphylaxis Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympic swimmer [[Mark Foster (swimmer)|Mark Foster]] has been the Campaign's patron since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaguaracademyofsport.co.uk/the-academy/ambassadors/mark-foster.aspx Jaguar Academy of Sport profile of Mark Foster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516170114/http://www.jaguaracademyofsport.co.uk/the-academy/ambassadors/mark-foster.aspx |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His friend and fellow-athlete, [[Ross Baillie]] died following an anaphylactic reaction in 1999.

The chef Giorgio Locatelli is also a patron of the Anaphylaxis Campaign since 2013.

==National lobbying==
The Anaphylaxis Campaign is a founder member of the National Allergy Strategy Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasguk.org/AboutUs_Aims.html National Allergy Strategy Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128173703/http://www.nasguk.org/AboutUs_Aims.html |date=2010-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a coalition of charities, professional organisations and industry, that seeks to improve health services for allergy sufferers in the UK.

The charity has called for clearer guidelines and greater consistency on food labelling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/24/experts-warn-crying-wolf-nut-allergies Experts warn of 'crying wolf' over nut allergies, The Guardian, 24 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also lobbied to remove what it considers to be unnecessary 'may contain' labelling, arguing that food manufacturers should only use these labels when there is a genuine risk to allergy sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Food-Safety/May-contain-allergen-labels-will-be-more-consistent 'May contain' allergy labels will be more consistent, Food Manufacture, 5 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anaphylaxis Campaign has tried to raise awareness of the problems caused by inconsistency in how severe allergy is diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/16/health.healthandwellbeing Big rise in patients with deadline allergies, The Observer, 16 April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; To help improve awareness among frontline medical practitioners, it launched an online training programme, called AllergyWise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/living-with-anaphylaxis/allergywise-online-training AllergyWise online training, Anaphylaxis Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, accredited by the [[Royal College of Nursing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcn.org.uk/development/learning/accreditation/resources/elearning/resources/online_anaphylaxis_training_for_healthcare_professionals AllergyWise online training and resources for health care professionals, Royal College of Nursing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the charity held a national conference with the [[Food Standards Agency]], the UK government department, on 'Communicating the science of food allergy'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/fsaenews0311.pdf, Food Standards Agency e-newsletter, March 2011]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1467">'''CHIMES Society'''[http://chimes-society.org/] is an international academic collaboration whose objective is to establish new stroke treatments.

CHIMES is a Singaporean non-profit society founded by a group of key opinion leaders in stroke, Southeast Asia regional experts, and clinicians interested in implementing a research project on [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] efficacy on [[stroke]] recovery.

==Current research project==
CHIMES society has received a grant in 2007 from Singapore National Medical Research Council which has allowed the initiation of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [[clinical trial]] in October 2007. The trial includes 1,100 patients and aims at measuring the efficacy of [[NeuroAid]] in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome in patients with [[cerebral infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;This trial is currently recruiting patients and details can be found at the ClinicalTrials.gov database from NIH under reference NCT00554723.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior research projects==
Clinical studies were conducted in China from 1999 to 2001 and the results have been submitted for publication. Since publication is pending, further information will be provided here when the publication is released.

[[File:Septic tank EN.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a cesspit which is constructed like an underground holding tank]]
A '''cesspit''' (or '''cesspool''' or '''soak pit''' in some contexts), is a term with various meanings: it is used to describe either an underground holding tank (sealed at the bottom) or a soak pit (not sealed at the bottom).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised 2rEdition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for the temporary collection and storage of [[Human feces|feces]], excreta or fecal sludge as part of an on-site [[sanitation]] system and has some similarities with [[septic tank]]s or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the earth, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre diameter and 2–3 metres depth. Their appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well.

The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab and needing to be emptied frequently when it is used like an underground holding tank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other cases (if soil and [[groundwater]] conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a [[pit latrine]] or to a soak pit).

== Uses ==
[[File:Cess Pool in Slovakia.jpg|thumb|An empty, old cesspool in Slovakia]]
=== Holding tank ===
In the UK a cesspit is a sealed tank for the reception and temporary storage of [[sewage]]; in North America this is simply referred to as a "[[holding tank]]". Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently &amp;mdash; in many cases as often as weekly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be very high.

=== Infiltration systems ===
A cesspool was at one time{{when|date=April 2016}} built like a [[dry well]] lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as  composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow.

A [[biofilm]] forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or [[pit latrine]] which provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a very deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter [[groundwater]] with minimal biological cleansing, leading to [[groundwater pollution]] and undrinkable water supplies.  It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool.

Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with [[concrete masonry unit]]s (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated [[drain field]] piping ([[weeping tile]]) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover will often have a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides.

The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots which can eventually cause the system to fail.

== Regulations ==
Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal [[Sanitary sewer|sewage systems]] or [[septic tank]]s are encouraged or required.

In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a [[septic system]], requiring a holding tank instead.

=== United States ===
In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" or allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual [[water table]] or fail a [[percolation test]], an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead.

In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the "grandfather clause" and allow the property sale or transfer.

=== Europe ===
In France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, cesspits are forbidden.

== History ==
{{seealso|History of water supply and sanitation}}
===United States===
The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled "like a billion [[polecat]]s," according to [[H. L. Mencken]], and a [[Chicago]]an said in his city "the stink is enough to knock you down." Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by [[sewage]] as well as dumping of [[industrial waste]] accounted in large measures for the public health records and staggering mortality rates of the period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where [[chamber pot]]s were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing [[ammonia]], was removed.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9" /&gt; 
 
In 1846, French public hygienist [[Alphone Guérard]] estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200-250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris' cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris' sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== Accidents ===
In Suffolk County, on Long Island, [[New York (state)|New York]], most households still use cesspools for waste drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shovel Ready|date=2011-01-24|url=http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/098.html|author=[[John Derbyshire]]|journal=[[National Review]]|volume=63|issue=1|page=55|issn=0028-0038|department=The Straggler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cesspool collapses have occurred in this area, for example on December 8, 2009. Two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, subsequently leading to a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents that were standing over them have been reported, injuring a total of seven people, killing one in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192807,00.html|title=Man, Son, Neighbor Sucked Into N.Y.

On June 1, 2011, two teenagers from [[Farmingville, New York|Farmingville]] in [[Long Island, New York]], drowned after becoming overwhelmed by fumes and trapped in a backyard cesspool measuring 16-feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/02/us-fatal-cesspool-idUSTRE7516AP20110602|title=Two teens die after trapped in backyard cesspool on Long Island|date=|work=Reuters|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapsing cesspools were mostly due to older cesspools built with brick or [[cinder block]]. These structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are [[Precast concrete|cast concrete]] which dramatically decrease any risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without waste sewer systems use these new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction for storm water collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10939">A '''closed system drug transfer device''' or "CSTD" is a drug transfer device that mechanically prohibits the transfer of environmental contaminants into a system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system. Open versus closed systems are commonly applied in medical devices to maintain the sterility of a fluid pathway. CSTDs work by preventing the uncontrolled inflow and outflow of contaminants and drugs, preserving the quality of solution to be infused into a patient. Theoretically, CSTDs should enable complete protection to healthcare workers in managing hazardous drugs, but possibly due to improper handling or incomplete product design, contaminants can still be detected despite use of CSTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miyake|first=Tomohiro|last2=Iwamoto|first2=Takuya|last3=Tanimura|first3=Manabu|last4=Okuda|first4=Masahiro|date=2013-06-21|title=Impact of closed-system drug transfer device on exposure of environment and healthcare provider to cyclophosphamide in Japanese hospital|journal=SpringerPlus|volume=2|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-273|issn=2193-1801|pmc=3698436|pmid=23853750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
Hazardous drugs are often used for patients suffering from cancer.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2018 Gurusamy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurusamy|first1=Kurinchi Selvan|last2=Best|first2=Lawrence MJ|last3=Tanguay|first3=Cynthia|last4=Lennan|first4=Elaine|last5=Korva|first5=Mika|last6=Bussières|first6=Jean-François|date=27 March 2018|title=Closed-system drug-transfer devices plus safe handling of hazardous drugs versus safe handling alone for reducing exposure to infusional hazardous drugs in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012860.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[chemotherapy]] agents are routinely used in the treatment of cancer. However, chemotherapy can be dangerous to a person even if they don't have cancer, as chemotherapy often indiscriminately affects both healthy and cancerous cells.&lt;ref name="ACS Chemo"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Chemotherapy Drugs Work|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/chemotherapy/how-chemotherapy-drugs-work.html|website=www.cancer.org|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the healthcare worker tasked with preparing hazardous medications like chemotherapy, manipulation of these agents presents a substantial risk; for example, it may negatively affect their fertility, increase their risk of developing certain cancers themselves, or have unwelcome effects on fetuses.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2018 Gurusamy" /&gt; As an addition to standard safe handling practices, CSTDs are devices that are designed to additionally limit exposure of hazardous drugs to the personnel that manipulate them.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2018 Gurusamy" /&gt;

==Efficacy==
Investment and interests in CSTDs continue to grow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z6wrsj/closed_system?w=5|title=Closed System Drug Transfer Devices - Research and Markets|last=ltd|first=Research and Markets|website=www.researchandmarkets.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the past decade as concerns of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), together with increased awareness of drug risks have pushed the market to explore better options for handling hazardous materials. A [[Cochrane review]] found "no evidence for or against adding CSTD to safe handling of hazardous medicines" based on a review of 23 studies, but acknowledged that the studies did not use randomised controlled trials nor evaluate the value of treatment. CSTDs used in this study include PhaSeal, Tevadaptor and SpikeSwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gurusamy|first=Kurinchi Selvan|title=Closed‐system drug‐transfer devices plus safe handling of hazardous drugs versus safe handling alone for reducing exposure to infusional hazardous drugs in healthcare staff|date=2018-03-27|url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012860.pub2/full|work=The Cochrane Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd012860.pub2/full|access-date=2018-07-22|last2=Best|first2=Lawrence MJ|last3=Tanguay|first3=Cynthia|last4=Lennan|first4=Elaine|last5=Korva|first5=Mika|last6=Bussières|first6=Jean-François}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains that new solutions to increasing safety of handling hazardous drugs have to be developed. Conceptually, through operating in a closed system, CSTDs should significantly reduce risks to nurses. However, the robustness of product design and extent of proper usage by nurses affects the efficacy of the CSTD in achieving OSH.

==History==
The first [[FDA]]-approved CSTD was in 1998, called PhaSeal. Since that time, many other CSTD products have been developed in the United States.&lt;ref name="Massoomi CSTD Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Massoomi|first1=Fred|title=The Evolution of the CSTD : February 2015 : Oncology Safety - Pharmacy Purchasing &amp; Products Magazine|url=https://www.pppmag.com/article/1638/|website=www.pppmag.com|publisher=Ridgewood Medical Media LLC|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MD Anderson]] hospital was the first hospital in the United States to widely implement CSTD technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parks|first1=Liz|title=Are CSTDs at a Tipping Point in Nation's Hospitals?|work=Pharmacy Practice News|date=March 2014|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of a closed system drug transfer device was first published in an alert warning released by the American [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH). This warning was issued in relation to studies that showed a correlation between working with or near [[hazardous drugs]] in a health care environment and the increased risk of developing skin rashes, infertility, miscarriage and infant birth defects, as well as the possibility of developing leukemia and other forms of cancer. This NIOSH alert recommended that a closed system drug transfer device be used whenever hazardous drugs were to be handled.

===NIOSH===
NIOSH, in response to the need for a working model as to what a "closed system" and what a "closed system drug transfer device" was, provided the following definition:

*A closed system is a device that does not exchange unfiltered air or contaminants with the adjacent environment.&lt;ref name="NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web | author=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] | title=Preventing Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=September 2004 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-165/2004-165d.html | accessdate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed system definition originally referred to a [[biological safety cabinet]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bsc/bsc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and not to the drug containment devices. A drug containment device is one that is both airtight and leakproof.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;
*A closed system drug transfer device is a drug transfer device that mechanically prohibits the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt;

The NIOSH definition is the only definition that includes drug vapors.&lt;ref&gt;DHHS (NIOSH) Publication Number 2004–165, September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH considers the containment of vapor extremely important, such that in September 2015, NIOSH issued a Testing Protocol to assess the effectiveness of closed systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Regulations.gov|url = http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0003|website = www.regulations.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH developed and tested 5 CSTDs to assess its "closeness." 2 of the 5 CSTDs tested passed. This protocol is aimed as being a test standard for CSTDs to assess the "closeness" of each system.

===ISOPP===
ISOPP, the [[International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners]], splits the definition of a closed system into two different categories:

*The first defines "closed" in terms of microbiological contamination. This definition deals purely with introducing micro-organisms into a sterile product, and there is no consideration of the sterile product coming out of the vial contaminating the environment.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;ISOPP Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice Volume 13, 2007, pg 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The second category defines "closed" in relation to chemical contamination and refers to drug transfer devices that mechanically prohibit the transfer of environment contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapour concentrations outside the system. ISOPP, however, agree that the NIOSH definition is the most comprehensive and complete.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;

===NIOSH Vapor Containment Protocol Proposal Comment Period Developments===
In September 2015, the CDC issued a proposal for a testing protocol designed to test various CSTDs on the market today to help healthcare decision makers decipher between various systems available on the market today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0007&lt;/ref&gt; This protocol had an initial close date of November 2015 but was extended until March 2016. Findings from "Fred Massoomi's Response to Docket No. CDC-2015-0075, NIOSH-288" include:
*Testing performed under "Report on NIOSH's Vapor Containment Performance Protocol for CSTDs" showed that Equashield and PhaSeal systems had contamination below the 1ppm recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Comment CDC-2015-0075-0027 Attachment 2: https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0027&lt;/ref&gt;
*Testing performed under "5-FU leakage study" showed that Equashield CSTD passed the leakage testing.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Comment CDC-2015-0075-0027 Attachment 3: https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0027&lt;/ref&gt;
*Testing performed under "Testing of Tevadaptor Efficiency in Preventing Cyclophosphamide" showed that the Tevadaptor system FAILED the contain drug vapor within the system.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Comment CDC-2015-0075-0027 Attachment 1: https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-002

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1511">The term '''cohort effect''' is used in [[social science]] to describe variations in the characteristics of an area of study (such as the incidence of a characteristic or the age at onset) over time among individuals who are defined by some shared temporal experience or common life experience, such as year of birth, or year of exposure to radiation.

Cohort effects are important to [[epidemiologists]] searching for patterns in illnesses.  Certain illnesses may be socially affected via the [[Anticipation (genetics)|anticipation phenomenon]], and cohort effects can be an indicator of this sort of phenomenon.

Cohort effects are important to resource dependency and economics theorists when these groups affect structures of influence within their larger organizations. Cohorts in organizations are often defined by entry or birth date, and retain some common characteristic (size, cohesiveness, competition) that can affect the organization. For example, cohort effects are critical issues in school enrollment. 

In order to determine whether a cohort effect is present, a researcher may conduct a [[cohort study]].

Employees who work [[overtime]] hours experience numerous mental, physical, and social effects.  Significant effects include stress, lack of free time, poor work-life balance, and health risks.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2016/08/08/survey-too-much-work-too-much-stress/#6c33ed971bde|title=Survey: Too Much Work, Too Much Stress?|last=Strauss|first=Karsten|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acoem.org/LongWk.aspx|title=Press Releases {{!}} Long Work Hours Linked to Higher Cardiovascular Disease Risk|author1=Conway, S. |author2=Pompeii, L. |author3=Roberts, R. |author4=Follis, J. |author5=Gimeno, D. |date=March 8, 2016|website=www.acoem.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Employee performance levels could also be lowered.  Long work hours could lead to tiredness, fatigue, and lack of attentiveness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/184188.pdf|title=Evaluating the Effects of Fatigue on Police Patrol Officers: Final Report|author1=Vila, Bryan |author2=Kenney, Dennis |author3=Morrison, Gregory |author4=Reuland, Melissa |date=August 28, 2000|website=ncjrs.gov|publisher=NCJRS|access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, suggestions have been proposed for risk mitigation.

==Health and Safety==
The health and safety effects of overtime work vary widely and much remains unknown.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8829/46170e3cfc2eb435c4222bf5c85b199a6f90.pdf|title=OVERTIME AND EXTENDED WORK SHIFTS: Recent Findings on Illnesses, Injuries, and Health Behaviors|last=Caruso|first=Claire|date=April 2004|website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/oemed/62/9/588.full.pdf|title=The impact of overtime and long work hours on occupational injuries and illnesses: new evidence from the United States|last=Dembe|first=A|date=March 8, 2005|website=The BMJ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies have reported numerous adverse health effects, including increased alcohol and tobacco usage, decreased birthweight in offspring, and decreased cognitive functioning found both subjectively and objectively using specialized testing.  However, other studies have not established such relationships between overtime work and decreased health.  Work shifts lasting 9–12 hours, work shifts exceeding 12 hours, and work weeks exceeding 40 hours have each demonstrated—in some studies—varying levels of decreased cognitive testing performance and increased workplace injury.  Inconsistencies between studies may be secondary to numerous workplace and employee factors, which make it difficult for researchers to establish specific causal relationships.  A larger amount of data exist regarding the male workforce, whereas additional studies are needed to better assess impacts of overtime work and extended shifts on women.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  A survey about events between 1987 and 2000 found that in a cohort of 10,793 men and women, overtime work was associated with a 61% excess rate of injury compared to jobs without overtime.  Injury rate was directly proportional to length of the work shift and number of hours in the work week.  Study authors found excess injury risk not only associated with jobs that are more hazardous, but also with overall fatigue from working overtime and extended work shifts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Mental effects==
The mental effects on workers will vary based upon the work they do, the number of hours they work, and the individual working.  [[Groupon]] performed a study in July 2016 on the effects of work.  The results found that 38% work too much, 46% never had time to relax, and 60% of pollers have an unhealthy work-life balance.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;  While this research showed some trends concerning the effects, other research has been performed to test the satisfaction levels of employees.  A 2004 study of workers in [[Australia]] showed a trend that satisfaction levels decreased as the number of hours worked increased.  They also stated that these effects could be lessened for those who enjoyed working extensive hours.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceebi.curtin.edu.au/local/docs/B7_-_2004gray.pdf|title=Long Work Hours and the Wellbeing of Fathers and their Families|author1=Gray, Matthew|author2=Qu, Lixia|date=June 2004|website=curtin.edu|publisher=Australian Journal of Labour Economics|access-date=October 21, 2016|author3=Stanton, David|author4=Weston, Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of workers are more satisfied with their work-life balance.

In addition to working satisfaction, another Australian longitudinal [[cohort study]] revealed poorer mental health in workers with long working hours.  The authors conducted a 12-year [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] follow-up cohort consisting of 18,420 people and 90,637 observations.  With the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the [[SF-36|Short Form 36 (SF-36)]] measure, they noted a 48% increased probability regarding mental health decline in those workers working 49–59 hours per week, compared with those under standard working hours (that is, 35–40 hours per week).  The probability increased by 53% in those working more than 60 hours a week.  They also found a difference by gender; among those working 49–59 hours per week, the SF-36 scores are lower among female than male, indicating worse mental health among female workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milner|first=Allison|last2=Smith|first2=Peter|last3=LaMontagne|first3=A. D.|date=2015-08-01|title=Working hours and mental health in Australia: evidence from an Australian population-based cohort, 2001–2012|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/72/8/573|journal=Occup Environ Med|volume=72|issue=8|pages=573–579|doi=10.1136/oemed-2014-102791|issn=1351-0711|pmid=26101295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar gender differences were noted in other studies.  In follow-up to the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall study]], a research team conducted a [[prospective cohort study]] following 2,960 middle-age full-time workers consisting of 2,248 men and 712 women.  The results revealed a 267% increase in [[Depression (mood)|depression]] symptoms and a 284% increase in [[anxiety]] symptoms among those female workers working more than 55 hours per week, compared with those under standard working hours (35–40 hours per week). They also indicated a trend that for every 10-hour increase in weekly working hours, an associated 40% increase in depression symptoms and 31% increase in anxiety symptoms were noted.  Similar trends were not noted among male workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virtanen|first=M.|last2=Ferrie|first2=J. E.|last3=Singh-Manoux|first3=A.|last4=Shipley|first4=M.

She analyzed the relationship between working hours and depression.  Her results found that women had increased likelihood of experiencing depression as more hours were worked.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivt.crepuq.qc.ca/popactive/documentation2002_A/2000/pear2000012001s1a06.pdf|title=Long working hours and health|last=Shields|first=Margot|date=1997|website=|publisher=Health Reports|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suicidal ideation]] is another concern for overtime work.  Research conducted in South Korea recruited 67,471 samples, and the results revealed 30% higher suicidal ideation among workers having working hours more than 60 hours (31% increase in male workers and 33% increase in female workers).  There was also increased suicidal ideation noted among workers working for 51–60 hours per week in both males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Chang-Gyo|last2=Bae|first2=Kyu-Jung|last3=Kang|first3=Mo-Yeol|last4=Yoon|first4=Jin-Ha|date=2015|title=Is suicidal ideation linked to working hours and shift work in Korea?|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/57/3/57_14-0237-OA/_article|journal=Journal of Occupational Health|volume=57|issue=3|pages=222–229|doi=10.1539/joh.14-0237-OA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, mental effects related to overtime work include lower working satisfaction, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.  Among these, depression and anxiety are more predominant among female workers.  Some research has proposed probable reasons for the gender difference.  Female workers tend to take on more household responsibilities after work, which contributes to their mental stress.  Also, female workers have been reported as relative minorities within the working place; at times experiencing lower job control, bullying, discrimination, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berntsson|first=L.|last2=Lundberg|first2=U.|last3=Krantz|first3=G.|date=2006-12-01|title=Gender differences in work–home interplay and symptom perception among Swedish white-collar employees|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/60/12/1070|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1070–1076|doi=10.1136/jech.2005.042192|issn=0143-005X|pmid=17108304|pmc=2465494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hämmig|first=Oliver|last2=Bauer|first2=Georg|date=2009-04-01|title=Work-life imbalance and mental health among male and female employees in Switzerland|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-009-8031-7|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=54|issue=2|pages=88–95|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-8031-7|pmid=19242653|issn=1661-8556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaMontagne|first=Anthony|last2=Krnjacki|first2=Lauren|last3=Kavanagh|first3=Anne|last4=Bentley|first4=Rebecca|date=2011-09-01|title=Time trends in psychosocial working conditions in a representative sample of working Australians 2000–2008: evidence of narrowing disparities?|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/68/Suppl_1/A22.2|journal=Occup Environ Med|volume=68|issue=Suppl 1|pages=A22–A22|doi=10.1136/oemed-2011-100382.69|issn=1351-0711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical effects ==
Consecutive periods of working straight shifts, lack of breaks during the day, and consecutive days of working without a day off lead to decreased efficiency and productivity in workers.  A synopsis of the book "Tired Cops: The Importance of Managing Police Fatigue" by Bryan Vila analyzed how these effected police officers in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tired Cops: The Importance of Managing Police Fatigue|last=Vila|first=Bryan|publisher=Police Executive Research Forum; 1st edition|year=2000|isbn=1878734679|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The abnormal work and sleep schedules were leading causes of the limited efficiency of police officers.  This downturn in their effectiveness created unsafe environments for the communities around them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Long-term effects were researched by [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston|The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]].  They studied the link between overtime and the increased risk of [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disorder]] (CVD) events.  Their results included evidence that showed that for people who worked at least 10 years for each additional hour worked, starting from the 46th hour, his or her risk of a CVD event increased by 1%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In addition to these health risks, María Beniell, who received her Ph.D. in Economics from the [[CEMFI|Center for Monetary and Financial Studies]] (CEMFI), researched the correlation between working long hours and the likelihood of individuals smoking, drinking, having a high [[body mass index]] (BMI), and being less physically active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iza.org/conference_files/SUMS2012/berniell_m7629.pdf|title=The Effects of Working Hours on Health Status and Health Behaviors|last=Berniell|first=María|date=March 2012|website=iza.org|publisher=IZA|access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[long-term effects of alcohol consumption]] include increased on-the-job injuries and loss of productivity, family problems, risk of high blood pressure, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/alcohol/short-term-long-term-effects.html|title=Watch Truth About Drugs Documentary Video &amp; Learn About Substance Addiction. Get The Facts About Painkillers, Marijuana, Cocaine, Meth &amp; Other Illegal Drugs.|website=Foundation for a Drug-Free World|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Health effects of tobacco|effects of smoking,]] in addition to similarities of the effects of alcohol, include increased risk of [[heart attacks]], [[emphysema]], and a large amount of cancers.

Margot Shields' 1994-1997 study also analyzed the relationship between long hours and changes in weight, smoking, drinking, and exercising.  For men, longer hours were associated with unhealthy weight gain.  Increased smoking occurred for both men and women, and an increase in drinking existed for women.  No relationship could be drawn regarding changes in physical activity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivt.crepuq.qc.ca/popactive/documentation2002_A/2000/pear2000012001s1a06.pdf|title=Long working hours and health|last=Shields|first=Margot|date=1997|website=|publisher=Health Reports|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Osaka|Osaka, Japan]], researchers completed a 5-year study on the effects of long work hours on [[hypertension]] in 1999.  At the end of their study, they had surveyed 941 male Japanese white-collar workers.  They concluded that long work hours are negatively-associated with the risk for hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Long Working Hours and Risk for Hypertension in Japanese Male White Collar Workers|author1=Nakanishi, N. |author2=Yoshida, H. |author3=Nagano, K. |author4=Kawashimo, H. |author5=Nakamura, K. |author6=Tatara, K. |publisher=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|year=2001|isbn=|location=Japan|pages=316–322|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of one paper performed a mental analysis on four published cohort studies and nineteen unpublished studies looking at the effect of "long working hours" (defined by the authors as 55 or more hours per week) to look for an association of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type II Diabetes]] compared to a referent group of workers only working 35–40 hours per week.  They found that there was statistically-significant evidence for an association between longer working hours and development of Type II Diabetes, but only for individuals of low [[socioeconomic status]] such as manual laborers, when compared to other SES groups.  The lower SES group working longer hours had a 29% increased risk of developing Type II diabetes; even after adjusting for physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kivimaki|first=Mika; et al|date=Jan 2015|title=Long working hours, socioeconomic status, and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes; a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data from 222 120 individuals|url=|journal=The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=27–34|via=|pmid=25262544|pmc=4286814|doi=10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However another author commented that residual confounding might account for this higher risk in the lower SES group compared to the higher SES group.  They also postulated that sleep may be a mediator for this association, since inadequate sleep or sleep of poor quality / quantity can be a predictor of Type II diabetes.  The workers in the lower SES group may have less control over their schedule, and this may include disruptive schedules interfering with circadian rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buxton|first=Orfeu; et al|date=January 2015|title=Long working hours can be toxic|url=|journal=The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–4|via=|pmid=25262543|doi=10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One large-cale study using data from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working Population Consortium involving 85,494 workers from several European countries also looked at the effects of long work hours and the association with developing [[atrial fibrillation]].  These participants were free of atrial fibrillation at baseline.  Mean age was 43.4 years.  During follow up over 10 years, those working long hours (55 hours or more per week) were at 40% higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared to those working a standard 35-40 hour-week.  In their study, the investigators controlled for age, sex, SES, smoking, BMI, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.  The investigators also commented that this association between long working hours and atrial fibrillation appeared to be independent of classic risk factors of atrial fibrillation due to the similarities of the exposed group (long work hours) and the referent group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kivimaki|first=Mika, et al|date=July 2017|title=Long working hours as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation: a multi-cohort study|url=|journal=European Heart Journal|volume=38|issue=34|pages=2621–2628|via=|pmid=28911189|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehx324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Coronary artery disease|Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)]], a meta-analysis of four prospective studies published in 2012 found a 1.4-fold increased risk of CHD associated with long working hours.  The investigators also noted that this association was higher for men than women.  They hypothesized underlying mechanisms for this association may include longer exposure to stress, sleep deprivation, and / or dysregulation of the HPA axis causing an increase in cortisol production.  They also noted that this estimate might have been biased for several reasons.  One reason could have been if workers with underlying CHD reduced their working hours in the years before a CHD event.  A second reason could be due to confounding of SES.  A meta-analysis adjusting for these factors found the risk of a CHD event to be 1.13 instead.  Furthermore, the study authors also found a 1.3-times higher risk for those working long hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virtanen|first=Marianna; et al|date=Feb 2012|title=Long working hours and Coronary Heart Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=176|pages=586–596|via=|doi=10.1093/aje/kws139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kivimaki|first=Mika; et al|date=October 2015|title=Long working hours and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished data for 603,838 individuals|url=|journal=The Lancet|volume=386|pages=1739–1746|pmid=26298822|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60295-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social effects ==
Work-life balance is a major aspect of employees' lives.  Naturally, the more hours someone works, the less time they will have to spend with their family or other leisure activities.  In 2007, professors from [[Penn State Abington]] analyzed the tradeoff between working overtime and home and family life activities.  A major finding was that workers struggled to take time off for personal or family needs.  However, the additional income from working long hours could limit the actual impact of this loss of time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=988203|title=Overtime Work and Family Consequences|author1=Golden, Lonnie |author2=Wiens-Tuers, Barbara |date=April 2007|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, the impact of having a child exponentially increased the impact of working overtime.  Especially at a young age, it is very important in child development for the parents to be involved to provide care and positive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paa2010.princeton.edu/papers/100573|title=Work-Family Balance, Family Structure and Family-Friendly Employer Programs|author1=Lawton, Leora |author2=Tulkin, David |date=April 15, 2010|website=princeton.edu|publisher=|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this reason, work-life conflicts arise much more frequently for parents, as stress levels are heightened.  These effects are even worse for single parents.

== Mortality risk ==
"[[Karōshi|Karoshi]]" (translated as worked to death) is a concern in Japan.  A paper published in 2006 showed that over a quarter of Japan's workforce were working 50 hours or more per week with half of them working 60 hours or more per week.  The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare launched an investigation in 2002 to examine 300 cases of possible Karoshi (death from being over-worked) during a time frame between 2002 and 2005.  From their study, they recommended that employers offer a physician interview / guidance for any employee working over 100 hours overtime / month or if an employee requested a doctor's assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iwasaki|first=Kenji; et al|date=March 2006|title=Health Problems due to Long Working Hours in Japan: Working Hours, Worker's Compensation (Karoshi), and Preventive Measures|url=|journal=Industrial Health|volume=44|pages=537–540|via=|doi=10.2486/indhealth.44.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall research evidence has shown that long working hours increases mortality risk.  A UK census-based [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] study of 414,949 people aged 20–64 years, showed that [[overtime]] work increases mortality risk in men working for more than 55 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Reilly|first=Dermot|last2=Rosato|first2=Michael|date=December 2013|title=Worked to death? A census-based longitudinal study of the relationship between the numbers of hours spent working and mortality risk|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1820–1830|doi=10.1093/ije/dyt211|issn=1464-3685|pmid=24415615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors showed that mortality is higher in technical, semi-routine, or routine occupations (positions with high demand, low levels of control, or perceived imbalance between effort and reward).  The authors also demonstrated that increased mortality risk was mainly attributed to [[cardiovascular disease]].

Similar results were found in other studies.  A 30-year [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] study in Denmark of 5,249 employed Caucasian men aged 40–59 years showed that men working 41–45 hours per week had a 59% increased risk of mortality due to [[ischemic heart disease]] compared to men working less than 40 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtermann|first=Andreas|last2=Mortensen|first2=Ole Steen|last3=Burr|first3=Hermann|last4=Søgaard|first4=Karen|last5=Gyntelberg|first5=Finn|last6=Suadicani|first6=Poul|date=October 2010|title=Long work hours and physical fitness: 30-year risk of ischaemic heart disease and all-cause mortality among middle-aged Caucasian men|journal=Heart|volume=96|issue=20|pages=1638–1644|doi=10.1136/hrt.2010.197145|issn=1468-201X|pmid=20820054}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors also found that physical fitness played a significant role, where among men with low physical fitness, those working more than 45 hours per week had more than twice the risk of death by [[ischemic heart disease]] compared to men working less than 40 hours per week; while this increased risk was not seen among the fittest men.  Furthermore, a study based on data from the Swedish [[twin registry]] showed that there was an association between [[overtime]] work of more than 5 hours a week and increased mortality in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nylén|first=L.|last2=Voss|first2=M.|last3=Floderus|first3=B.|date=January 2001|title=Mortality among women and men relative to unemployment, part time work, overtime work, and extra work: a study based on data from the Swedish twin registry|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=58|issue=1|pages=52–57|doi=10.1136/oem.58.1.52|issn=1351-0711|pmc=1740025|pmid=11119635}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This association was also seen in men, but only in the first five years of follow-up.  In contrast, the authors showed that working less than five hours a week of overtime decreases the risk of mortality in men.

== Counter arguments ==
Other studies argue that there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between hours worked and short and long-term risks.  Their claims include comments about factors that alter the outcome of effects.  These include an individual's personality, occupation, and income.

They found links between increased CVD events and mental health disorders along with decreases in production as the number of hours worked increased.  However, they state that further research is necessary before definitive conclusions can be made, as factors of each individual have vast consequences on the effect of working overtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9wcte/reddit_whats_the_grossestnastiest_thing_thats/c0er6q4/|title=Health and safety problems associated with long working hours: a review of the current position|author1=Spurgeon, Anne|author2=Harrington, J.|date=1997|website=europepmc.org|publisher=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|access-date=October 21, 2016|author3=Cooper, Cary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, workers who work overtime when it is not mandatory find that there are very minimal effects on their fatigue levels.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Overtime Work and Family Consequences|author1=Golden, Lonnie|author2=Wiens-Tuers, Barbara|date=April 2007|ssrn=988203|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a Japanese study of 1,105 employees has demonstrated that longer working hours is associated with better health status in older employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=E.|last2=Takao|first2=S.|last3=Subramanian|first3=S. V.|last4=Doi|first4=H.|last5=Kawachi|first5=I.|date=September 2009|title=Work-based social networks and health status among Japanese employees|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=63|issue=9|pages=692–696|doi=10.1136/jech.2008.082453|issn=1470-2738|pmid=19286690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors of this study showed that overall health differed by age group, which reflects a generational difference with respect to their attitudes toward work.  Among older workers, longer work hours might be beneficial as work-based social networks offer a structured environment, social support, and companionship.

== Risk mitigation ==
While a definitive conclusion could not be made, suggestions exist to minimize the potential risks of long working hours.  Creation of the work schedule should be managed properly to avoid multiple consecutive shifts, long periods of working without rest, and balanced breaks during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_Folkard/publication/7209546_Modeling_the_impact_of_the_components_of_long_work_hours_on_injuries_and_accidents/links/0912f50accc870ea25000000.pdf|title=Modeling the impact of the components of long work hours on injuries and "accidents"|author1=Folkard, Simon |author2=Lombardi, David |date=November 2006|website=researchgate.net|publisher=ResearchGate|access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For families with children, it is very important for that employees can manage their schedule for family or personal needs.  This will help alleviate stress, provide flexible work hours throughout the year, and avoid many work-life conflicts.

In 1981, Jay Kim and Anthony Campagna, researchers from [[Ohio State University]], studied the effects [[Flextime]].  Flextime allows workers to change their start and end work time.  They first analyzed a wide range of studies done on flextime.  Then they separated 353 employees into two groups: one that allowed flextime, and one that did not (control group).  Their study found that flextime largely reduced unpaid absences for employees. They also found a general increase in worker performance.  Flextime could impact coordinating schedules and meetings, as employee work schedules may vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Campagna | first2 = A.

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

'''Familial dysautonomia''' ('''FD'''), sometimes called '''Riley–Day syndrome'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pediatriconcall.com/fordoctor/CaseReports/hsan.asp pediatriconcall.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430174854/http://www.pediatriconcall.com/fordoctor/casereports/hsan.asp |date=2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''[[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]] type III''' ('''HSAN-III'''), is a disorder of the [[autonomic nervous system]] which affects the development and survival of [[Sensory nervous system|sensory]], [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and some [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] [[neurons]] in the autonomic and sensory [[nervous system]] resulting in variable symptoms, including [[Pain#Insensitivity to pain|insensitivity to pain]], inability to produce tears, poor growth and labile blood pressure (episodic hypertension and postural hypotension). People with FD have frequent vomiting crises, [[pneumonia]], problems with speech and movement, [[difficulty swallowing]], inappropriate perception of heat, pain and taste as well as unstable blood pressure and [[gastrointestinal dysmotility]]. FD does not affect intelligence.

Originally reported by Drs. Conrad Milton Riley (1913&amp;ndash;2005) and Richard Lawrence Day (1905&amp;ndash;1989) in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Riley CM, Day RL, Greely D, Langford WS | title=Central autonomic dysfunction with defective lacrimation | journal=Pediatrics | year=1949 | pages=468–77 | volume=3 |issue=4 |pmid=18118947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies ([[HSAN]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Axelrod FB | title=Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Familial dysautonomia and other HSANs | series=12 | journal=Clin Auton Res | year=2002 | pages=I2–14 | issue=7 | volume=Suppl 1 | pmid=12102459 | doi=10.1007/s102860200014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All HSAN are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons. The disorders are believed to be genetically distinct from each other.

==Signs and symptoms==

The most distinctive clinical feature is the absence of overflow tears with emotional crying after age 7 months. This symptom can manifest less dramatically as persistent bilateral eye irritation. There is also a high prevalence of breech presentation. Other symptoms include weak or absent suck and poor tone, poor suck and misdirected swallowing, and red blotching of skin.

Symptoms in an older child with familial dysautonomia might include:

# Delayed speech and walking
# Unsteady gait
# Spinal curvature
# [[Corneal abrasion]]
# Less perception in pain or temperature with [[nervous system]].
# Poor growth
# Erratic or unstable [[blood pressure]].
# Red puffy hands
# Dysautonomia crisis: a constellation of symptoms in response to physical and emotional stress; usually accompanied by [[vomiting]], increased heart rate, increase in [[blood pressure]], [[sweating]], [[drooling]], blotching of the skin and a negative change in personality.

==Cause==

Familial dysautonomia is the result of mutations in [[IKBKAP]] gene on [[chromosome 9]], which encodes for the [[IKAP protein]] (IkB kinase complex-associated protein). There have been three mutations in IKBKAP identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in [[intron]] 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T→C in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking [[exon]] 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded by exons 20-37. Another less common mutation is a G→C conversion resulting in one amino acid mutation in 696, where [[Proline]] substitutes normal [[Arginine]]. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes familial dysautonomia.

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

===Clinical diagnosis===
[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|200px|thumb|[[Autosomal recessive]] inheritance]]

A clinical diagnosis of FD is supported by a constellation of criteria:
*No fungiform papillae on the tongue
*Decreased deep tendon reflexes
*Lack of an axon flare following intradermal histamine
*No overflow tears with emotional crying

===Genetic testing===
Genetic testing is performed on a small sample of blood from the tested individual. The [[DNA]] is examined with a designed probe specific to the known mutations. The accuracy of the test is above 99%. Dr. [[Anat Blumenfeld]] of the Hadasah Medical center in Jerusalem identified chromosome number 9 as the responsible chromosome.

===Prenatal testing===

Familial dysautonomia is inherited in an autosomal [[recessive]] pattern, which means 2 copies of the gene in each cell are altered. If both parents are shown to be carriers by genetic testing, there is a 25% chance that the child will have FD. For pregnancies at increased risk for FD, [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] or prenatal diagnosis by [[amniocentesis]] (at 15–17 weeks) or [[chorionic villus sampling]] (at 10–14 weeks) is possible.

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure for FD and death occurs in 50% of the affected individuals by age 30. There are only two treatment centers, one at [[New York University Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.nyu.edu/fd/ Dysautonomia Treatment and Evaluation Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114010103/http://www.med.nyu.edu/fd/ |date=2006-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one at the [[Sheba Medical Center]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.sheba.co.il/ Sheba Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt; One is being planned for the San Francisco area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/2528/ |title=San Francisco To Get a Genetics Center - Forward.com |accessdate=2007-11-02 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival rate and quality of life have increased since the mid-1980s mostly due to a greater understanding of the most dangerous symptoms. At present, FD patients can be expected to function independently if treatment is begun early and major disabilities avoided.

A major issue has been aspiration pneumonia, where food or regurgitated stomach content would be aspirated into the lungs causing infections. [[Nissen fundoplication|Fundoplications]] (by preventing regurgitation) and gastrostomy tubes (to provide nonoral nutrition) have reduced the frequency of hospitalization.

Other issues which can be treated include FD crises, [[scoliosis]], and various eye conditions due to limited or no tears.

An FD crisis is the body's loss of control of various [[autonomic nervous system]] functions including blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. Both short-term and chronic periodic high or low blood pressure have consequences and medication is used to stabilize blood pressure.

===Treatment of manifestations===
[[Image:Kyphoscoliosis hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy III.jpg|thumb|[[Kyphoscoliosis]] in a 10-year-old girl with HSANIII]]

Although the FD-causing gene has been identified and it seems to have tissue specific expression, there is no definitive treatment at present.
Treatment of FD remains preventative, symptomatic and supportive. FD does not express itself in a consistent manner. The type and severity of symptoms displayed vary among patients and even at different ages on the same patients. So patients should have specialized individual treatment plans. Medications are used to control vomiting, eye dryness, and [[blood pressure]]. There are some commonly needed treatments including:

# Artificial tears: using eye drops containing artificial tear solutions (methylcellulose)
# Feeding: Maintenance of adequate nutrition, avoidance of aspiration; thickened formula and different shaped nipples are used for baby.
# Daily chest [[physiotherapy]] (nebulization, [[bronchodilators]], and postural drainage): for Chronic lung disease from recurrent aspiration [[pneumonia]]
# Special drug management of autonomic manifestations such as vomiting: intravenous or rectal [[diazepam]] (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg q3h) and rectal chloral hydrate (30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg q6h)
# Protecting the child from injury (coping with decreased taste, temperature and pain perception)
# Combating [[orthostatic hypotension]]: hydration, leg exercise, frequent small meals, a high-salt diet, and drugs such as [[fludrocortisone]].
# Treatment of orthopedic problems (tibial torsion and spinal curvature)
# Compensating for labile blood pressures

There is no cure for Familial Dysautonomia.

==Prognosis==

The outlook for patients with FD depends on the particular diagnostic category. Patients with chronic, progressive, generalized [[dysautonomia]] in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term [[prognosis]]. Death can occur from [[pneumonia]], acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest in such patients.&lt;!--   (There needs to be a transition here to interventions re:  eye care.  This comment below has nothing to do with prognosis, but supportive care.) --&gt;

Parents and patients should generally be educated regarding daily eye care and early warning signs of corneal problems as well as the use of punctal cautery. This education has resulted in decreased corneal scarring and need for more aggressive surgical measures such as [[tarsorrhaphy]], conjunctival flaps, and [[corneal transplant]]s.

==Epidemiology==
Familial dysautonomia is seen almost exclusively in [[Ashkenazi]] Jews and is inherited in an autosomal [[recessive]] fashion. Both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. The carrier frequency in Jewish individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) ancestry is about 1/30, while the carrier frequency in non-Jewish individuals is unknown. If both parents are carriers, there is a one in four, or 25%, chance with each pregnancy for an affected child. [[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] is recommended for families who may be carriers of familial dysautonomia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Worldwide, there have been approximately 600 diagnoses recorded since discovery of the disease, with approximately 350 of them still living.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familialdysautonomia.org/history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In January 2001, researchers at [[Fordham University]] and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] simultaneously reported finding the genetic mutation that causes FD, a discovery that opens the door to many diagnostic and treatment possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SL, Coli R, Daly IW, Kichula EA, Rork MJ, Volpi SA, Ekstein J, Rubin BY | title=Familial dysautonomia is caused by mutations of the IKAP gene | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2001 | pages=753–8 | volume=68 | issue=3 | pmid=11179021 | doi=10.1086/318808 | pmc=1274486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Slaugenhaupt SA, Blumenfeld A, Gill SP, Leyne M, Mull J, Cuajungco MP, Liebert CB, Chadwick B, Idelson M, Reznik L, Robbins C, Makalowska I, Brownstein M, Krappmann D, Scheidereit C, Maayan C, Axelrod FB, Gusella JF | title=Tissue-specific expression of a splicing mutation in the IKBKAP gene causes familial dysautonomia | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2001 | pages=598–605 | volume=68 | issue=3 | pmid=11179008 | doi=10.1086/318810 | pmc=1274473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite that it probably would not happen in the near future, some expect that stem-cell therapy will result. Eventually, treatment could be given in utero.{{Citation needed|reason="some expect" is inappropriate without a source, although both sentences should be sourced, otherwise they are speculation and should be deleted.|date=July 2010}}

While that may be years ahead, genetic screening became available around April 2001, enabling Ashkenazi Jews to find out if they are carriers. Screening organization [[Dor Yeshorim]] offers to test as part of its panel, which also includes [[Tay-Sachs disease]] and [[cystic fibrosis]].

In the meantime, more research into treatments is being funded by the foundations that exist. These foundations are organized and run by parents of those with FD. There is no governmental support beyond recognizing those diagnosed with FD as eligible for certain programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familialdysautonomia.org/resguide/chapter4.htm Benefits for people with FD] - from [[Dysautonomia foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food extrusion''' is a form of [[extrusion]] used in [[food processing]]. It is a process by which a set of mixed ingredients are forced through an opening in a perforated plate or [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] with a design specific to the food, and is then cut to a specified size by blades. The machine which forces the mix through the die is an '''extruder''', and the mix is known as the '''extrudate'''. The extruder consists of a large, rotating screw tightly fitting within a stationary barrel, at the end of which is the die.

Extrusion enables [[mass production]] of food via a continuous, efficient system that ensures uniformity of the final product. Food products manufactured using extrusion usually have a high starch content. These include some [[pasta]], [[bread]]s ([[crouton]]s, [[bread stick]]s, and [[flat bread]]s), many [[breakfast cereal]]s and ready-to-eat [[snack]]s, [[confectionery]], pre-made [[cookie dough]], some [[baby food]]s, [[Soy protein#Flours|full-fat soy]], [[textured vegetable protein]], some [[beverage]]s, and dry and semi-moist [[pet food]]s.

==Process==
[[File:DEMACO 1,000 lbs-hr Short Goods Pasta Press, 1958.jpg|thumb|right|A non-vacuum short goods pasta extruder from 1958]]
In the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients are added depending on the target product; these may be liquid [[sugar]], [[fat]]s, [[dye]]s, [[meat]]s or water. [[Steam]] is injected to start the cooking process, and the preconditioned mix (extrudate) is then passed through an extruder. The extruder consists of a large, rotating screw tightly fitting within a stationary barrel, at the end of which is the die.&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|last=Harper|first=J.M.|title=Food extrusion|year=1978|volume=11|issue=2|pages=155–215|pmid=378548|doi=10.1080/10408397909527262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extruder's rotating screw forces the extrudate toward the die, through which it then passes. The amount of time the extrudate is in the extruder is the '''residence time'''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The extruded product usually puffs and changes texture as it is extruded because of the reduction of forces and release of moisture and heat.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; The extent to which it does so is known as the '''expansion ratio'''. The extrudate is cut to the desired length by blades at the output of the extruder, which rotate about the die openings at a specific speed. The product is then cooled and dried, becoming rigid while maintaining porosity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the [[pressure]] generated (10–20&amp;nbsp;bar). The process can induce both [[protein denaturation]] and [[starch gelatinization]] under some conditions.

Many food extrusion processes involve a high temperature over a short time.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; Important factors of the extrusion process are the composition of the extrudate, screw length and rotating speed, barrel temperature and moisture, die shape, and rotating speed of the blades. These are controlled based on the desired product to ensure uniformity of the output.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Moisture is the most important of these factors, and affects the mix [[viscosity]], acting to plasticize the extrudate. Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and product temperature, and increase bulk density. This will also reduce the pressure at the die. Most extrusion processes for food processing maintain a moisture level below 40%, that is low to intermediate moisture. High-moisture extrusion is known as '''wet extrusion''', but it was not used much before the introduction of twin screw extruders (TSE), which have a more efficient conveying capability. The most important [[rheometry|rheological]] factor in the wet extrusion of high-starch extrudate is temperature.&lt;ref name="akdogan"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|last=Akdogan|first=Hülya|title=High moisture food extrusion|date=June 1999|volume=34|issue=3|pages=195–207|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2621.1999.00256.x|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1236532|type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of salt in the extrudate may determine the colour and texture of some extruded products. The expansion ratio and airiness of the product depend on the salt [[concentration]] in the extrudate, possibly as a result of a chemical reaction between the salt and the starches in the extrudate. Colour changes as a result of salt concentration may be caused by "the ability of salt to change the water activity of the extrudate and thus change the rate of browning reactions". Salt is also used to distribute minor ingredients, such as [[food colouring|food colours]] and [[Seasoning|flavours]], after extrusion; these are more evenly distributed over the product's surface after being mixed with salt.&lt;ref name="strategies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States|editor1=Jane E Henney |editor2=Christine L Taylor |editor3=Caitlin S Boon |publisher=National Academies Press, National Academy of Sciences|year=2010|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|isbn=978-0-309-14805-4|pmid=21210559|author1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake |last2=Henney |first2=J.

==History==
The first extruder was designed to manufacture [[sausage]]s in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="karwe"&gt;{{cite book|title=Food Engineering|volume=3|chapter=Food extrusion|last=Karwe|first=Mukund V.|publisher=Oxford Eolss Publishers Co Ltd.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84826-946-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packaged dry pasta and [[breakfast cereal]]s have been produced via extrusion since the 1930s,&lt;ref name="akdogan"/&gt; and the method was applied to pet food production since the 1950s (first extruded dog food in 1957 - Purina Dog Chow and first extruded cat food - Purina Friskies in 1962).&lt;ref name="karwe" /&gt; It has also been incorporated into [[kitchen appliance]]s, such as [[meat grinder]]s, [[herb grinder]]s, [[coffee grinder]]s, and some types of pasta makers. A similar functional process occurs when using [[pastry bag]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Effects==
Extrusion enables mass production of food via a continuous, efficient system that ensures uniformity of the final product. This is achieved by controlling various aspects of the extrusion process. It has also enabled the production of new processed food products and "revolutionized many conventional snack manufacturing processes".&lt;ref name="riaz"/&gt;
The extrusion process results in "chemical reactions that occur within the extruder barrel and at the die".&lt;ref name="camire"&gt;{{Cite book|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|last=Camire|first=M.E.|title=Chemical changes during extrusion cooking. Recent advances.|year=1998|volume=434|pages=109–121|pmid=9598195|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-1925-0_11|isbn=978-1-4899-1927-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrusion has the following effects:&lt;ref name="PMID 707920"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annales de la Nutrition et de l'Alimentation|title=Effect of the extrusion process on the availability of proteins|authors=Beaufrand MJ, de la Guérivière JF, Monnier C, Poullain B.|pmid=707920|volume=32|issue=2–3|year=1978|pages=353–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guy&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy, Robin|title=Extrusion Cooking: Technologies and Applications|location=Cambridge|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=2001|pages=111–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="riaz82"&gt;Riaz, page 82.&lt;!-- "Extrusion cooking has been defined as "the process by which moistened, expansile, starchy, and/or proteinaceous materials are plasticized in a tube by a combination of moisture, pressure, heat and mechanical shear. This results in elevated product temperatures within the tube, gelatinization of starchy components, denaturization of proteins, the stretching or restructuring of tractile components, and the exothermic expansion of the extrudate" --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Destruction of certain naturally occurring [[toxin]]s
* Reduction of [[microorganism]]s in the final product
* Slight increase of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]]-[[bioavailability]]
* Creation of [[Insulin resistance|insulin-desensitizing]] starches (a potential risk-factor for developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]])&lt;ref name="PMID 707920"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guy"/&gt;
* Loss of [[lysine]], an [[essential amino acid]] necessary for developmental growth and nitrogen management
* Simplification of complex [[starch]]es, increasing rates of [[tooth decay]]
* Increase of [[glycemic index]] of the [[processed food]], as the "extrusion process significantly increased the availability of carbohydrates for digestion"&lt;ref name="brenner2" /&gt;
* Destruction of [[Vitamin A]] ([[beta-carotene]])
* [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturation]]&lt;!-- this does not refer to [[denaturation (food)]] --&gt; of [[protein]]s.

The material of which an extrusion die is made can affect the final product. Compared to [[stainless steel]] dies, a pasta machine with [[bronze]] dies produces a rougher surface. This is considered to give an improved taste, as it better retains pasta sauces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/products/pasta/production.htm |title=The industrial production of pasta |work=Food-Info.Net |publisher=Wageningen University }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bronze die" pasta is labelled as such on retail packages, to indicate a premium product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napolina.com/text_only/ingredients.html |publisher=Napolina Ltd. |title=Ingredients |quote=Napolina's pasta range also includes a premium bronze die pasta which is extruded through bronze dies to create a rough, porous surface. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623130220/http://www.napolina.com/text_only/ingredients.html |archivedate=June 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of "extrusion cooking on nutritional quality are ambiguous",&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|title=Nutritional aspects of food extrusion: a review|authors=Shivendra Singh, Shirani Gamlath, Lara Wakeling|date=10 May 2007|volume=12|issue = 8|pages=916–929|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01309.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as extrusion may change carbohydrates, dietary fibre, the protein and amino acid profile, vitamins, and mineral content of the extrudate in a manner that is beneficial or harmful.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;

High-temperature extrusion for a short duration "minimizes losses in vitamins and amino acids".&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; Extrusion enables mass production of some food, and will "denature antinutritional factors",&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; such as destroying [[toxin]]s or killing [[microorganism]]s. It may also improve "protein quality and digestibility",&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; and affects the product's shape, texture, colour, and flavour.&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt;

It may also cause the fragmentation of proteins, [[starch]]es, and [[non-starch polysaccharide]]s to create "reactive molecules that may form new linkages not found in nature".&lt;ref name="camire" /&gt; This includes [[Maillard reaction]]s which reduce the nutritional value of the proteins.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt; Vitamins with heat [[lability]] may be destroyed.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt; {{As of|1998}}, little is known about the stability or bioavailability of [[phytochemical]]s involved in extrusion.&lt;ref name="camire" /&gt;&lt;!-- is this still the case? --&gt; Nutritional quality has been found to improve with moderate conditions (short duration, high moisture, low temperature), whereas a negative effect on nutritional quality of the extrudate occurs with a high temperature (at least 200&amp;nbsp;°C), low moisture (less than 15%), or improper components in the mix.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;

A 2012 research paper indicates that use of non-traditional cereal flours, such as [[amaranth]], [[buckwheat]] or [[millet]], may be used to reduce the [[glycemic index]] of breakfast cereals produced by extrusion.&lt;ref name="brenner"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Starch - Stärke|title=Amaranth, millet and buckwheat flours affect the physical properties of extruded breakfast cereals and modulates their potential glycaemic impact|last=Brennan|first=Margaret A.|last2=Menard|first2=Carine|last3=Roudaut|first3=Gaëlle|last4=Brennan|first4=Charles S.|date=19 January 2012|volume=64|issue=5|pages=392–398|doi=10.1002/star.201100150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extrudate using these cereal flours exhibits a higher bulk and product density, had a similar expansion ratio, and had "a significant reduction in readily digestible carbohydrates and slowly digestible carbohydrates".&lt;ref name="brenner" /&gt; A 2008 paper states that replacing 5% to 15% of the [[wheat flour]] and white flour with [[dietary fibre]] in the extrudate breakfast cereal mix significantly reduces "the rate and extent of carbohydrate [[hydrolysis]] of the extruded products",&lt;ref name="brenner2"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|title=Effect of inclusion of soluble and insoluble fibres into extruded breakfast cereal products made with reverse screw configuration|last=Brennan|first=Margaret A.|last2=Monro|first2=John A.|last3=Brennan|first3=Charles S.|date=December 2008|volume=43|issue=12|pages=2278–2288|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01867.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which increased the level of slowly digested carbohydrates and reduced the level of quickly digested carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="brenner2" /&gt;

==Products==
Extrusion has enabled the production of new processed food products and "revolutionized many conventional snack manufacturing processes".&lt;ref name="riaz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Extruders in Food Applications|last=Riaz|first=Mian N.|year=2000|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566767798 |page= 193 |quote=Extrusion has provided a means of manufacturing new and novel products and has revolutionized many conventional snack manufacturing processes.

[[File:Cheese puffs.jpg|thumb|Cheese curls made using an extruder]]
The various types of food products manufactured by extrusion typically have a high starch content.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt;  ''Directly expanded'' types include [[breakfast cereal]]s and corn curls, and are made in high temperature, low moisture conditions under [[Shear rate|high shear]]. ''Unexpanded'' products include [[pasta]], which is produced at intermediate moisture (about 40%) and low temperature. ''Texturized'' products include [[meat analogue]]s, which are made using plant proteins ("textured vegetable protein") and a long die to "impart a fibrous, meat-like structure to the extrudate",&lt;ref name="karwe" /&gt; and [[fish paste]].&lt;ref name="HandH"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Food Processing|last1=Heldman|first1=Dennis R.|last2=Hartel|first2=Richard W.|publisher=Springer|year=1997|isbn=9780834212695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- pg 255 --&gt; Confectionery made via extrusion includes [[chewing gum]], [[liquorice]], and [[toffee]].&lt;ref name="HandH" /&gt;

Some [[processed cheese]]s and cheese analogues are also made by extrusion. Processed cheeses extruded with low moisture and temperature "might be better suited for manufacturing using extrusion technology" than those at high moisture or temperature. Lower moisture cheeses are firmer and chewier, and [[cheddar cheese]] with low moisture and an extrusion temperature of 80&amp;nbsp;°C was preferred by subjects in a study to other extruded cheddar cheese produced under different conditions.&lt;ref name="jsfa"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|title=Physical and sensory characteristics of processed cheeses manufactured by extrusion technology|authors=Koushik Adhikari1, Andrea Cole, Ingolf Grün, Hildegarde Heymann, Fu-Hung Hsieh, and Harold Huff|date=June 2009|volume=89|issue=9|pages=1428–1433|doi=10.1002/jsfa.3608}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extrudate mean residence time of about 100 seconds can produce "processed cheeses or cheese analogues of varying texture (spreadable to sliceable)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|title=Continuous emulsification and gelation of dairy ingredients by HTST extrusion cooking: production of processed cheeses|last=Zuber|first=F.|last2=Mégard|first2=D.|last3=Cheftel|first3=J.C.|date=December 1987|volume=22|issue=6|pages=607–626|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1987.tb00529.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guy Ray Pelton.jpg|thumb|Guy Ray Pelton, Congressman from New York]]

'''Guy Ray Pelton''' (August 3, 1824 – July 24, 1890) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] to the thirty-fourth Congress from [[New York (state)|New York]].  Born in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], he was the second son of Joseph Kneeland Pelton and his wife Harriet Ray. He attended the public schools and Sedgwick Institution in Great Barrington, Mass., the Connecticut Literary Institute in [[Suffield, Connecticut]], and [[Oberlin College]].  He studied law at Kinderhook, N.Y.  He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] and commenced practice in New York City in 1851 with his older brother, Timothy Dwight Pelton, in the law firm of G.R. &amp; T.D. Pelton, at 167 Broadway.  He was a member of the [[Union League Club]].

A [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], Pelton was elected as an [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|Opposition Party]] candidate to the [[34th United States Congress|Thirty-fourth]] Congress (March 4, 1855 – March 3, 1857) from New York City.  During that time he served on the Committee of Commerce.  He declined a second nomination for reelection in 1856 to the [[35th United States Congress|Thirty-fifth]] Congress.

On July 24, 1890, on his way home to Massachusetts from Alaska with his second wife, Angelina Scoville Pelton, Pelton died in [[Yellowstone National Park]], Wyoming, while climbing Mary Mountain.  He was interred in Mahaiwe Cemetery, [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].

The '''Ice Bucket Challenge''', sometimes called the '''ALS Ice Bucket Challenge''', is an activity involving the dumping of a bucket of ice and water over a person's head, either by another person or self-administered, to promote awareness of the disease [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS, also known as [[motor neuron disease]] and in the US as [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease) and encourage donations to research.

The challenge encourages nominated participants to be filmed having a bucket of ice water poured on their heads and then nominating others to do the same. A common stipulation is that nominated participants have 24 hours to comply or forfeit by way of a charitable financial donation.&lt;ref name=nj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/chris_christie_gets_in_on_ice_bucket_challenge_dares_cory_booker.html|title=Governor Chris Christie gets in on 'Ice Bucket Challenge', dares Cory Booker|work=Nj.com|date=August 13, 2014|accessdate=August 13, 2014|author=Arco, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2015, a group of ALS organizations in the [[United States]], including the [[ALS Association]], [[Les Turner ALS Foundation]], and [[ALS Therapy Development Institute]], re-introduced the Ice Bucket Challenge for 2015 to raise further funds with the intention of establishing it as an annual occurrence.&lt;ref name=everyaug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nys/buffalo/news/2015/08/1/buffalo-als-walk-ice-bucket.html|title=Buffalo Welcomes Return of Ice Bucket Challenge at ALS Walk|date=1 August 2015|work=TWC News|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, people performed the challenge again in the summers of 2016,&lt;ref name="adammarshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torontosun16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buffalo2016" /&gt; 2017&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="police" /&gt; and 2018.&lt;ref name=Skorea /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Atlanta Falcons Take the Ice Bucket Challenge.ogv|thumb|left|[[Atlanta Falcons]] players, coaches, and staff take the Ice Bucket Challenge]]
The origins of the idea of dumping cold water on one's head to raise money for charity are unclear and have been attributed to multiple sources.&lt;ref name="tfn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Graham|date=26 August 2014|title=Cold war: charity defends itself against ice-bucket challenge criticism|url=http://thirdforcenews.org.uk/funding-and-finance/news/cold-war-charity-defends-itself-against-ice-bucket-criticism|newspaper=Third Force News|location=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly accepted origin credits Pete Frates, a [[Boston College Eagles baseball#Annual ALS Awareness Game|Boston College]] alumnus who was diagnosed with ALS in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Eleanor|date=15 August 2014|title=Meet The Guy Who Made ALS 'Ice Bucket Challenge' Go Viral|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/pete-frates-ice-bucket-challenge-_n_5683074.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|location=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|date=5 September 2014|title=How Pete Frates Found His Calling And Launched The Ice Bucket Challenge|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/09/05/how-pete-frates-found-his-calling-and-launched-the-ice-bucket-challenge/|newspaper=Forbes|location=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat Quinn, a friend of Frates who was diagnosed with ALS in 2013, is also credited with creating the challenge.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday168&gt;{{cite news|last=Cary|first=Billy|date=16 August 2014|title=Reaction overwhelms Ice Bucket Challenge creator|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/18/ice-bucket-challenge-creator/14265219/|newspaper=USA Today|location=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another friend of Frates, Corey Griffin, has been credited as a "co-founder" of the challenge.&lt;ref name="bost_Core"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Corey Griffin, 27; left his mark in everything from friendship to philanthropy – The Boston Globe | last = Marquard | first = Bryan | work = [[Boston Globe]] | date = 20 August 2014 | accessdate = 2015-08-14 | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2014/08/19/corey-griffin-left-his-mark-everything-from-friendship-philanthropy/ahbexfXQNqgIbaWTJ3nEtN/story.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-2013 to early 2014, a challenge of unknown origin often called the "Cold Water Challenge" became popular on social media in areas of the [[Northern United States]]. The task usually involved the option of either donating money to cancer research or having to jump into cold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Perez, Iris|url=http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25487940/dnr-dont-rise--cold-water-challenge|title=DNR: Don't rise 'Cold Water Challenge'|work=[[KMSP-TV|MyFox Twin Cities]]|publisher=[[Fox Television Stations]]|date=2014-06-25|accessdate=2014-08-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085635/http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25487940/dnr-dont-rise--cold-water-challenge|archivedate=2014-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the Ice Bucket Challenge was begun by professional golfers as means to support various pet charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reddy|first=Sumathi|date=14 August 2014|title=How the Ice-Bucket Challenge Got Its Start|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-ice-bucket-challenge-got-its-start-1408049557|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|location=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reddy|first=Sumathi|date=18 August 2014|title=Ice-bucket challenge a social media hit with even Zuckerberg joining in|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au//business/wall-street-journal/icebucket-challenge-a-social-media-hit-with-even-zuckerberg-joining-in/story-fnay3ubk-1227027976210?nk=04bba152cf0bc837985017ba9d014572|newspaper=The Australian Business Journal (The Wall Street Journal)|location=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of the challenge, which took place in [[Salem, Indiana]], as early as May 15, 2014, involved dousing participants with cold water and then donating to a charity, for example a local child diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raycomgroup.worldnow.com/story/25530813/people-take-the-plunge-to-support-7-year-old-with-brain-tumor?clienttype=generic&amp;mobilecgbypass |title=People take the plunge to support 7-year-old with brain tumor |date=May 15, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |first=Janelle |last=MacDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another version, the Auckland Division of the Cancer Society of New Zealand was the beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancersocietyauckland.org.nz/newsandmedia|title=The Ice Water Challenge|publisher=Cancersocietyauckland.org.nz|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with similar challenges, it was usually filmed so footage can be shared online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Gobal Ice Bucket Challenge helps change lives|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1408/S00515/gobal-ice-bucket-challenge-helps-change-lives.htm|location=|publisher=Scoop- New Zealand News|agency=Motor Neuron Disease Association NZ|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydayhero.co.nz/event/icebucketchallenge|title=Ice Bucket Challenge|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014|website=Everydayhero.co.nz|publisher=Auckland Northland Cancer Society|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Fallen Firefighters Foundation]] popularized the "Cold Water Challenge" in early 2014 to raise funds as an unsanctioned spin-off of the [[polar bear plunge|polar plunge]] most widely used by [[Special Olympics]] as a fundraiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/08/16/chilly-challenge.html|title='Ice bucket challenge' charity fundraiser gains momentum|publisher=Dispatch.com|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2014, the [[Washington Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey|Washington Township, New Jersey]], fire department posted a video on [[YouTube]] participating in the "Cold Water Challenge" with fire hoses. Participating members of the department were subsequently punished for using fire department equipment without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/washington-township-times/index.ssf/2014/06/cold_water_challenge_video_lan.html|title='Cold water challenge' video lands Washington Township firefighters in hot water after video posted online|publisher=nj.com|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifting focus to ALS===
The challenge first received increased media attention in the [[United States]] on June 30, 2014, when personalities of the [[Golf Channel]] program ''Morning Drive'' televised the social-media phenomenon, and performed a live, on-air Ice Bucket Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfchannel.com/media/gary-williams-takes-ice-bucket-challenge|title=Gary Williams Takes Ice Bucket Challenge|work=Golfchannel.com|publisher=[[NBC Sports Group]]|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the challenge was brought to mainstream audiences when television anchor [[Matt Lauer]] did the Ice Bucket Challenge on July 15, 2014, on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' at [[Greg Norman]]'s challenge.&lt;ref name="mashable"&gt;{{cite web|author= Kelly, Samantha Murphy|title=Ice Bucket Challenge Wasn't Originally About ALS|url=http://mashable.com/2014/08/15/ice-bucket-challenge-not-als/|website=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014|date=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="syracuse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herbert|first1=Geoff|title=Who started the Ice Bucket Challenge?

On the same day, golfer Chris Kennedy did the challenge, then challenged his cousin Jeanette Senerchia of [[Pelham, New York]], whose husband, Anthony, had ALS for 11 years.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Kennedy's challenge was the first documented instance of the challenge being connected with ALS.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Invented the Ice Bucket Challenge?: A search for the fundraising phenomenon's cold, soaked patient zero|author=Levin, Josh |work=Slate|date=August 22, 2014|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/08/who_invented_the_ice_bucket_challenge_a_slate_investigation.single.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the challenge was not connected directly with ALS.&lt;ref name="timeorigins"/&gt; Participants would donate to a charity of their choice.&lt;ref name="timeorigins"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Sifferlin|first=Alexandra|date=18 August 2014|title=Here's How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Actually Started|url=http://time.com/3136507/als-ice-bucket-challenge-started/|magazine=Time Magazine|location=|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Quinn, who was friends on Facebook with the Senerchias, encouraged his friends to take the challenge, and soon after, Pete Frates began posting about the challenge on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1900335/ice-bucket-challenge-origin|title=Who Invented The Ice Bucket Challenge?|work=mtv.com|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2014|author=Kaufman, Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frates was awarded the [[Stephen Heywood|Stephen Heywood Patients Today Award]] in 2012 for his fundraising and advocacy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHdVDZMEhi4|title=Peter Frates (2012 Stephen Heywood Patients Today Honoree)|date=November 19, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2014|author=ALSTDI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frates' [[Boston College]] and sporting connections became an initial focus of the challenge and strengthened its focus on ALS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/15/stricken-with-als-pete-frates-closely-linked-ice-bucket-challenge-shows-will-live/m2Abeu4SIGROfg0aBlCTCM/story.html?p1=Article_Related|title=Stricken with ALS, Pete Frates shows the will to live|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2014|author=English, Bella}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Quinn and Frates did the challenge in support of the [[ALS Therapy Development Institute]].

===The Challenge's success===
The Ice Bucket Challenge was a successful campaign. Its combination of competitiveness, social media pressure, online narcissism, and low barriers to entry led to more than 2.4 million tagged videos circulating [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;Adeyeri, Eb (August 27, 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/aug/27/ice-bucket-challenge-lessons-marketing "Ice bucket challenge: what are the lessons for marketers?"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though 40–50% of the new donors were likely to make one-time gifts only,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clairification.com/2014/08/20/create-ice-bucket-type-challenge-nonprofit-formula-success/|title=How to Create an Ice Bucket-type Challenge for Your Nonprofit: A Formula for Success - Clairification|date=2014-08-20|work=Clairification|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Challenge instigated large numbers of people, videos, and donations. The challenge also benefited from a unique balance of mass interest and individual identification.&lt;ref&gt;Stenovec, Timothy (August 19, 2014). [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/ice-bucket-challenge_n_5692307.html "The Reasons The Ice Bucket Challenge Went Viral"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In using social media as its platform, it accessed many people worldwide; in having its participants individually identify potential candidates – calling them out by "tagging" them – it felt personal. Furthermore, the videos were often entertaining. The average participants kept their videos under a minute,{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} requiring limited commitment from any viewers. Another concept the Challenge benefited from was its ripple effect, inspiring features for articles, such as ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s "10 More of the Best Celebrity Takes on the Ice Bucket Challenge."&lt;ref&gt;Cresci, Elena (August 21, 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/10-more-of-the-best-celebrity-takes-on-the-ice-bucket-challenge-als "10 more of the best celebrity takes on the ice bucket challenge"]. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its marketing success, critics suggested that the ease of repeating the challenge's spiel do not increase awareness of what the disease actually does and who it is so harmful to.

The success of the challenge prompted the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], which also raises funds to combat ALS, to discontinue its long-running annual telethon, the ''[[MDA Show of Strength]]'', after the 2014 edition, stating that the Ice Bucket Challenge prompted the MDA to reevaluate how it can connect with the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mda.org/media/press-releases/mda-telethon-ends-historic-run-urgent-fight-families-continues "MDA Telethon Ends Historic Run, Urgent Fight for Families Continues,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503211311/http://www.mda.org/media/press-releases/mda-telethon-ends-historic-run-urgent-fight-families-continues |date=2015-05-03 }} press release from Muscular Dystrophy Association (5/1/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Frates published a book about the Ice Bucket Challenge detailing his own experience with ALS as well as his involvement in the social movement. Half of the proceeds will go to the Frates family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.necn.com/news/new-england/New-Book-On-Pete-Frates-and-The-Ice-Bucket-Challenge-442709503.html|title=New Book Published Pete Frates and The Ice Bucket Challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revivals===

====2015====
On August 1, 2015, a group of ALS organizations in the United States, including the ALS Association, relaunched the Ice Bucket Challenge for 2015. The group said they intended to rerun the campaign "this August, and every August, until there's a cure (for ALS)."&lt;ref name=everyaug /&gt;  "We have to finish what started last summer: every August until there's a cure," said Barb Newhouse, President and CEO of the ALS Association.&lt;ref name=mlb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-als-ice-bucket-challenge-is-back-this-august-300121752.html|title=The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Is Back This August|author=The ALS Association|date=30 July 2015|work=prnewswire.com|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 campaign received the support of [[Major League Baseball]], with each club due to organise its own branch of the Challenge and then nominate another franchise, along with two other local organizations or personalities, to participate in the Challenge.

==Impact==

===Awareness===
In mid-2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on social media, particularly in the [[United States]], with people, celebrities, politicians and athletes posting videos of themselves online and on TV participating in the event.&lt;ref name=nj/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbslocal"/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', people shared more than 1.2 million videos on [[Facebook]] between June 1 and August 13 and mentioned the phenomenon more than 2.2 million times on [[Twitter]] between July 29 and August 17.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title='Ice Bucket Challenge' Has Raised Millions for ALS Association|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/business/ice-bucket-challenge-has-raised-millions-for-als-association.html?_r=1|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014|date=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the challenge generated more than 70,000 tweets per day with hashtags such as #IceBucketChallenge, #ALSIceBucketChallenge, and #StrikeOutALS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/08/15/facebook-million-icebucketchallenge-videos-posted/24D8bnxFlrMce5BRTixAEM/story.html|title=Facebook: 1.2 million #IceBucketChallenge videos posted - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mashable]] called the phenomenon "the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]] of the summer".&lt;ref name="mashable"/&gt;

Prior to the challenge, public awareness of the disease [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) was relatively limited; the [[ALS Association]] stated that prior to the challenge going viral only half of Americans had heard of the disease,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; often referred to as "Lou Gehrig's disease", after the famous baseball player [[Lou Gehrig]], who publicly revealed his diagnosis in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/about-als/|title=What is ALS?|publisher=ALS Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on social media, public awareness and charitable donations to ALS charities soared. Hits to the [[English Wikipedia]]'s article on [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] grew from an average of 163,300 views per month to 2.89 million views in August 2014, and similar increases occurred in the [[Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish]] and [[German Wikipedia|German]] Wikipedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2014/09/08/ice-bucket-challenge-als-wikipedia-page-views-increase-18-fold-infographic/|title=Ice Bucket Challenge: ALS Wikipedia Page Views Increase 18-Fold|publisher=''Forbes'' |first=Niall |last=McCarthy|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donations===
Within weeks of the challenge going viral, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the ALS Association had received $41.8 million in donations from more than 739,000 new donors from July 29 until August 21, more than double the $19.4 million the association received during the year that ended January 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title='Ice Bucket Challenge' Donations for A.L.S.

In July 2015, the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' reported on the [[ALS Association]]'s summary of how the funds raised through the Ice Bucket Challenge were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge-spending.html|title = ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Commitments|publisher = [[ALS Association]]|accessdate = July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-bucket-challenge-als-research-impact_55a699a7e4b0c5f0322c0ae5|title = Here's The Actual Impact All Those Buckets Of Ice Had On ALS Research|last = Erbentraut|first = Joseph|date = July 16, 2015|accessdate = July 18, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By percentage, 67% of all funds (about $77 million) went to research, 20% to patient and community services, 9% to public and professional education, 2% to additional fundraising, and 2% to external processing fees.&lt;ref name="ALSA stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Putting your dollars to work|url=http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ibc-progress.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|website=ALSA|publisher=The ALSA Association|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
On July 25, 2016, the ALS Association announced that, thanks in part to donations from the Ice Bucket Challenge, the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]] has identified a third gene that is a cause for the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Fawzy, Farida | year=2016 | title= Ice Bucket Challenge's 2nd anniversary celebrates its gene discovery| work= | publisher=[[CNN]]| url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/27/health/als-ice-bucket-challenge-funds-breakthrough/index.html| accessdate= 1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Project MinE]], a global [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] effort to identify genetic drivers of ALS, received $1 million from the challenge, allowing them to broaden the scope of their research to include new sources in new parts of the world. Having identified the link between the gene, [[NEK1]], and ALS will allow for a new targeted gene for therapy development, as well as focused drug development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2016 | title=

===Influences===
Several other challenges have been created and publicised as a result of the publicity of the Ice Bucket Challenge. The My Tree Challenge is an activity launched in [[Kerala]] which consists of planting a tree sapling and challenging others to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prakash|first1=Asha|title=Mammootty takes up Fahadh's Tree challenge, challenges Shah RuKh, Vijay and Suriya|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Entertainment/Malayalam/Movies/News/Mammootty-takes-up-Fahadhs-Tree-challenge-challenges-Shah-RuKh-Vijay-and-Suriya/articleshow/41349174.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The My Tree Challenge was preceded by a Book List Challenge, started by Facebook users, where users post a list of books that they have read and liked the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shorewal|first=Aditi|title=The Book List Challenge on Facebook: Which Are Your Top 10?|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/offbeat/the-book-list-challenge-on-facebook-which-are-your-top-10-584532|newspaper=NDTV|location=|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rice Bucket Challenge]], that started in India in late August 2014 and later spread to other South Asian nations, was also partly a response to the Ice Bucket Challenge's wastefulness of water.&lt;ref name="qz-rbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/254910/india-adapts-the-ice-bucket-challenge-to-suit-local-conditions-meet-the-rice-bucket-challenge/|title = The story behind India's rice bucket challenge|last = Madhok|first = Diksha|date = August 25, 2014|accessdate = September 13, 2014|publisher = ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpo-rbc"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/26/india-rice-bucket-challenge_n_5710481.html|title = 'Rice Bucket Challenge' Reminds World How Scarce Clean Water Is In India|last = Rao|first = Mallika|date = August 26, 2014|accessdate = September 13, 2014|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Pie In The Eye Challenge" challenges the nominated person to receive a [[Pieing|pie in the face]].&lt;ref name="dailyrecord.co.uk"&gt;Jolly, Lynn (September 9, 2014).

==Criticism==

A number of criticisms arose relating to the campaign, accusing it of being self-congratulatory,&lt;ref name="tfn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Michael|title=The celebrity ice-bucket challenge leaves me cold|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11045083/Celebrity-ice-bucket-challenge-why-it-leaves-me-cold.html|work=The Telegraph|date=August 14, 2014|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing primarily on fun rather than donating money to charity, and substituting a trivial activity for more genuine involvement in charitable activities.&lt;ref name=vice&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/read/dumping-a-bucket-of-ice-on-your-head-does-not-make-you-a-philanthropist-813|last = Pardes|first = Arielle|title = Dumping a bucket of ice on your head does not make you a philanthropist|publisher = ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = |website =VICE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Willard Foxton described the challenge as "a middle-class [[wet T-shirt contest]] for armchair clicktivists",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foxton|first=Willard|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/willardfoxton2/100014135/the-ice-bucket-challenge-a-middle-class-wet-t-shirt-contest-for-armchair-clicktivists|title=The Ice Bucket Challenge – a middle-class wet-T-shirt contest for armchair clicktivists|publisher=Blogs.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard Magazine]]'' said that "it has become less about raising funds and all about showing off your star-pulling power".&lt;ref name="esm"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Get Over It|publisher=[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard Magazine]]|page=3|date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2014, it was reported that the ALS Association had filed an application to trademark the term "ice bucket challenge",&lt;ref name="F20140828"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/08/28/als-association-trademark-ice-bucket-challenge/|title=ALS Association looks to trademark the term 'ice bucket challenge'|work=Fortune|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW20140829"&gt;Vizard, Sarah (August 29, 2014).

===Importance of the cause===
[[William MacAskill]], Vice-President of [[Giving What We Can]], an organization that advocates for people to engage in more [[effective altruism]], was critical of the Ice Bucket Challenge, citing two chief objections.&lt;ref name=quartz/&gt; First, he claimed that the Ice Bucket Challenge resulted in "funding cannibalism": "for every $1 we raise, 50¢ would have been donated anyway".&lt;ref name=quartz/&gt; Relatedly, MacAskill claimed that the challenge encouraged [[moral licensing]], whereby people who engage in one act they consider good may feel more licensed to engage in bad behavior.&lt;ref name=quartz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/249649/the-cold-hard-truth-about-the-ice-bucket-challenge/|last = MacAskill|first = William|title=Comment: The cold, hard truth about the ice bucket challenge|date = August 15, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014|publisher = ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MacAskill, William|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/08/18/comment-cold-hard-truth-about-ice-bucket-challenge|title=Comment: The cold, hard truth about the ice bucket challenge|publisher=Sbs.com.au|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill's piece met with considerable critical push-back, and he published a follow-up a few days later suggesting an Ice Bucket Challenge for causes he considered more important and cost-effective to support. Citing research from [[GiveWell]], MacAskill gave the example of donating to the [[Against Malaria Foundation]] to end [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/250845/this-week-lets-dump-a-few-ice-buckets-to-wipe-out-malaria-too/|title = This week, let's dump a few ice buckets to wipe out malaria too|last = MacAskill|first = William|date = August 18, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014|publisher = ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill's pieces were cited in ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2014/08/18/ok-the-ice-bucket-challenge-worked-now-where-will-the-dollars-go/|title = OK, The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Worked.

[[Julia Belluz]] at [[Vox Media|Vox.com]] wrote a piece with similar criticisms, linking to MacAskill's piece. Belluz noted that funding for diseases was often not proportional to the number of deaths caused by the diseases. She also noted that donating to developing world health causes could provide much greater [[Health economics|healthcare value]] than donating for the treatment of rare diseases, an observation that is common in the [[effective altruism]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/8/20/6040435/als-ice-bucket-challenge-and-why-we-give-to-charity-donate|title = The truth about the Ice Bucket Challenge: Viral memes shouldn't dictate our charitable giving|last = Belluz|first = Julia|authorlink=Julia Belluz |publisher = [[Vox Media#Vox.com|Vox.com]]|date = August 20, 2014|accessdate = September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[BBC]]'s ''More or Less'' podcast, economist [[Tim Harford]] discussed the Ice Bucket Challenge and how to select the best charities, referencing work by [[GiveWell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/moreorless/moreorless_20140905-1730a.mp3|title = To ice or not to ice?|last = Harford|first = Tim|authorlink = Tim Harford|date = September 5, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014|publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He himself participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge, donating to the [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timharford.com/2014/09/in-which-i-take-the-ice-bucket-challenge-the-nerdy-way/|title = In which I take the ice-bucket challenge the nerdy way…|last = Harford|first = Tim|date = September 5, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Carter and Keith Moore wrote an article for the [[BBC News]] drawing on the arguments made in the podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29087531|title = Icy logic: Choosing a charity with your head and your heart|date = September 6, 2014|accessdate = September 12, 2014|publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|last = Carter|first = Ben|last2 = Moore|first2 = Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of donated funds===
Retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Lance Storm]] declined the challenge despite being nominated twice, and posted a note on his official website stating that most of the money that is donated goes towards promotional and advertising of the ALS Association while the remaining amount (at most 25% of what is donated) "is going into the pockets of Big Pharma", which is already doing ALS research and is therefore inflating their already-high profits. Storm went on to comment that it would be better to actually help someone with ALS and donate money directly to ALS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stormwrestling.com/083114.html|title=ALSA Ice Bucket Challenge|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingnewssource.com/news/35898/Lance-Storm-Shares-His-Thoughts-On-The-ALS-Ice/|title=Lance Storm Shares His Thoughts On The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ALS Association responded to similar criticisms by saying that 79% of their annual budget went toward programs in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsa.org/news/archive/debunks-article.html |title=The ALS Association Debunks Fake News Article that Went Viral |date=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[pro-life movement]], such as [[Lila Rose]] of [[Live Action (organization)|Live Action]], criticised donations to the ALS Association, because it uses [[embryonic stem cell]]s in its ALS research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/2014/08/critics_throw_cold_water_on_the_ice_bucket_challenge|title=Critics throw cold water on the Ice Bucket Challenge|publisher=worldmag.com|first=Courtney|last=Crandell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related organisations such as the [[Family Research Council]] suggested that people participating in the Ice Bucket Challenge instead donate money to Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center, [[Mayo Clinic]], and the [[John Paul II Medical Research Institute]], all three of which run [[clinical trial]]s with [[adult stem cell]]s, rather than embryonic ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2014/08/23/pro-lifers-gone-cold-als-ice-bucket-challenge/|title=Why Some Pro-Lifers Go Cold on ALS Ice Bucket Challenge|last=Harkness|first=Kelsey|date=23 August 2014|work=The Daily Signal|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frcblog.com/2014/08/send-your-ice-bucket-challenge-donation-ethical-research/|title=Send Your Ice Bucket Challenge Donation to Ethical, Successful Adult Stem Cell Research|last=Prentice|first=David|date=21 August 2014|publisher=[[Family Research Council]]|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archdiocese of Cincinnati]], with its 113 [[Christian school|schools]] also recommended individuals participating in the Ice Bucket Challenge to donate to such groups, but not to the ALS Association "saying the group's funding of embryonic stem cell research is 'in direct conflict with Catholic teaching'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/08/21/4086135_ohio-catholic-diocese-discourages.html?sp=/99/102/114/&amp;rh=1|title=Ohio diocese discourages ALS ice bucket challenge|last=Myers|first=Amanda Lee|date=21 August 2014|work=News Observer|accessdate=25 August 2014|location=Cincinnati|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825144831/http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/08/21/4086135_ohio-catholic-diocese-discourages.html?sp=%2F99%2F102%2F114%2F&amp;rh=1|archivedate=25 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PETA]] criticized the ALS Association's Ice Bucket Challenge, saying that money raised through the fundraiser would be used to fund "archaic and painful tests on animals."&lt;ref name="PETA challenges"/&gt; [[Russell Simmons]],&lt;ref name="PETA challenges"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bedard|first1=Paul|title=PETA challenges ALS 'ice bucket challenge' over animal testing|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/peta-challenges-als-ice-bucket-challenge-over-animal-testing/article/2552632|accessdate=29 January 2015|publisher=Washington Examiner|date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pamela Anderson]],&lt;ref name="Pamela Anderson Declines"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|title=Pamela Anderson Declines Ice Bucket Challenge, Citing ALS Animal Testing|url=http://www.people.com/article/pamela-anderson-ice-bucket-challenge|accessdate=29 January 2015|publisher=People|date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1700952/grimes-rejects-ice-bucket-challenge-because-als-association-tests-on-animals/news/ | title=Grimes Rejects Ice Bucket Challenge Because ALS Association Tests On Animals | publisher=Stereogum | date=24 August 2014 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | first=James | last=Rettig | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129184253/http://www.stereogum.com/1700952/grimes-rejects-ice-bucket-challenge-because-als-association-tests-on-animals/news/ | archivedate=29 January 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Mitchell|title=Grimes Declines Ice Bucket Challenge Over ALS Association's Animal Testing Policy|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6229174/grimes-declines-ice-bucket-challenge-over-als-associations-animal-testing|accessdate=29 January 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other celebrities, also criticized the ALS Association's fundraiser for its support of animal testing. Anderson wrote on her [[Facebook]] page, "Trying to cure human diseases by relying on outdated and ineffective animal experiments isn't only cruel – it's a grave disservice to people who desperately need cures."&lt;ref name="Pamela Anderson Declines"/&gt;

===Focus on the stunt rather than donations===
American stunt performer and TV personality [[Steve-O]] questioned the campaign, suggesting that celebrities' videos generally forgot to share donation information for ALS charities, and that the initial $15 million in funds was insignificant, given the star power of the celebrities participating. He noted that, of the videos he viewed, only [[Charlie Sheen]] and [[Bill Gates]] mentioned that the point is to donate money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve-O takes aim at stars over ice bucket challenge|url=http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/celebs/steve-o-takes-aim-at-stars-over-ice-bucket-challenge-1|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=MSN|publisher=Microsoft|date=August 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820224752/http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/celebs/steve-o-takes-aim-at-stars-over-ice-bucket-challenge-1 |archivedate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar criticism was made by Jacob Davidson in ''[[Time Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://time.com/3107510/ice-bucket-challenge-als-we-need-to-do-better/|title = We Need To Do Better Than the Ice Bucket Challenge|last = Davidson|first = Jacob|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014|publisher = ''[[Time Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Arielle Pardes in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; More and more charities seem to be competing with one another to see which charity receives the most donations.

On August 22, 2014, Dr. Brian O'Neill, a physician at the [[Detroit Medical Center]], warned that the challenge may have adverse health effects on participants, including potentially inducing a [[vagal response]] which might, for example, lead to unconsciousness in people taking blood pressure medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/08/22/doctor-explains-potential-dangers-of-als-ice-bucket-challenge|title=Doctor Explains Potential Dangers of ALS "Ice Bucket Challenge"|work=[[CBS Detroit]]|date=August 23, 2014|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of participants have sustained injuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jernigan, Joy|url=http://www.today.com/health/ouch-ice-bucket-fails-leave-some-bruised-battered-or-worse-1D80088361|title=Ouch!

==="Michael's Story" poster===
"Michael's Story" was a campaign poster from the UK MND Association's summer 2015 "Last Summer" first anniversary campaign which featured Michael Smith. He had not taken part in the Ice Bucket Challenge and was subsequently diagnosed with motor neurone disease.  This caused controversy, with some critics saying that the poster was implying that Smith had deserved his illness for his previous non-participation. The claims were strongly refuted by the Association and by Smith himself.&lt;ref name=michaelsmith&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/motor-neurone-disease-charitys-poster-criticised-for-its-threatening-tone-10290395.html|title=Motor neurone disease charity's poster criticised for its 'threatening|author=Kunal Dutta|date=1 June 2015|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waste of water ===
[[File:California Drought Status Oct 21 2014.png|thumb|Drought in California in 2014.]]
Meteorologist [[Jason Samenow]] estimated that during the peak of the movement's popularity in 2014, the equivalent of 5,000,000 gallons of water would have been used for the challenge. This calculation assumes that the average of one 4-gallon bucket of water was used per video for the 1.2 million challenge videos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/business/ice-bucket-challenge-has-raised-millions-for-als-association.html|title='Ice Bucket Challenge' Has Raised Millions for ALS Association|last=Steel|first=Emily|date=2014-08-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were posted during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/08/18/how-much-water-has-been-used-in-the-ice-bucket-challenge/|title=How much water has been used in the Ice Bucket Challenge?|last=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1526386|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] (CA) declared [[California]] to be in a [[Droughts in California|drought state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18368|title=Office of Governor Edmund G.

To prevent wasting water by using drinkable water, many performed the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge by using natural water sources. [[Carole King]] performed the challenge using creek water that was immediately returned to the creek,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheCaroleKing|title=Carole King Takes the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge|date=2014-08-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxJ2uiZ9bzE&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Killer Clown, a YouTube personality, performed the challenge using rainwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DM Pranks' Killer Clowns|title=Killer Clown ALS Ice Bucket Challenge! #IceBucketChallenge #strikeoutals|date=2014-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1aWL8PyPNg&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms in California, some Californians performed the challenge by using dirt instead of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=C Dub|title=Dirt Bucket Challenge!!!|date=2014-08-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ17lxFMg2g&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ALS organizations, such as the ALS Therapy Development Institute, has published guidelines for the Ice Bucket Challenge to minimize water usage by alternatives, like "filling the bucket with socks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.als.net/icebucketchallenge/#water-conservation|website=ALS Therapy Development Institute|title=ALS Therapy Development Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Dunning Boice Jr.''' is an American radiation epidemiologist and health physicist. He served for over 27 years in the [[US Public Health Service]] where he developed and became the first chief of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch at the [[National Cancer Institute]]. Boice's "seminal discoveries and over 440 publications have been used to formulate public health measures to reduce population exposure to radiation and prevent radiation-associated diseases."&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. [https://www.nrc.gov/public-involve/conference-symposia/ric/past/2013/docs/bios/bio1-805.html John D. Boice, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the President of the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP), Bethesda, Maryland, and Professor of Medicine at [[Vanderbilt University School of Medicine]].

== Life ==
Boice was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in December 1945. His father, John Dunning Boice Sr., served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. His mother, Irene, was the daughter of a Pennsylvania coal miner. His father's career necessitated frequent moves for the family during Boice's childhood including three years in France. The family settled in [[El Paso, Texas]] when he was fourteen. After graduating from [[Bel Air High School (El Paso, Texas)|Bel Air High School]] in the city, he enrolled at Texas Western College (now [[University of Texas at El Paso]]) graduating in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics. He went on to receive a master's degree from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in nuclear engineering in 1968 and the following year was commissioned as an officer in the [[US Public Health Service]].&lt;ref name = "Nova" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NCRP" /&gt;

During his early years with the Public Health Service, he continued his post-graduate studies at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], receiving a second master's degree in medical physics in 1974 and his Doctor of Science degree in epidemiology in 1977. His doctoral thesis was entitled ''Breast cancer and other malignancies following repeated fluoroscopic chest examinations''. He went on to develop the Radiation Epidemiology Branch at the [[National Cancer Institute]] and became its first director in 1984. Boice retired from the Public Health Service in 1996 with the rank of Captain and became Scientific Director of the International Epidemiology Institute, a biomedical research organization founded in 1994. Since 2000, he has been Professor of Medicine at [[Vanderbilt University]]. Since 2012 he has served as President of the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]].&lt;ref name="NCRP"&gt;Brent, John L. (2009).

The '''Lac de Chambon''' (''Chambon Lake'') is an artificial [[lake]] on the [[Creuse River]], [[France]], created by the [[Eguzon dam]], a [[hydroelectric dam]]. Beaches have been created around the lake, the largest in the Centre Region. There is a sailing school on the lake near [[Eguzon]]. [[Canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s and [[pedalo]]s can be hired in season. The lake is also very popular with [[waterski]]ers and anglers.

It is not to be confused with [[Lac Chambon]] in the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] department or [[Lac du Chambon]] in the [[Isère]] department.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1477">'''Local Optical Committees''' are statutory bodies established within the British [[National Health Service]] to represent the interests of community optometrists and opticians.   There are 78 Local Optical Committees in England.  They are supported by the Local Optical Committee Support Unit which provides a link to the national bodies the [[Association of British Dispensing Opticians]], the [[Association of Optometrists]] and  the [[Federation of (Ophthalmic and Dispensing) Opticians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.locsu.co.uk/about-us/|website=Local Optical Committee Support Unit|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local committees are descended from the Ophthalmic Services Committees established by  clause 41 of the [[National Health Service Act 1946]].  A Joint Council of Qualified Opticians was established as part of the National Health Insurance Scheme in 1923. The  Ophthalmic Benefit Approved Committee was established in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE OPTICAL PROFESSION|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/the-sma-and-the-foundation-of-the-national-health-service-dr-leslie-hilliard-1980/memorandum-concerning-the-optical-profession/|accessdate=27 October 2016|publisher=Socialist Medical Association|date=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Longerakvatnet''' or '''Longeraksvatnet''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Bygland]] in [[Aust-Agder]] county, [[Norway]].  It has a small [[dam]] on the southwest side to regulate the water level for [[hydro-electric power]] generation at a plant located down the hill.  The lake discharges into the Longeraksåni river which flows into the [[Byglandsfjorden]] near the village of [[Longerak]].  The {{convert|3.4|km2|adj=on}} lake is located about {{convert|6|km}} southeast of the village of [[Lauvdal]] and about {{convert|10|km}} northeast of the village of [[Byglandsfjord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Aust-Agder/Bygland/Longeraksvatnet/|title=Longeraksvatnet|publisher=yr.no|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pharmaceutics]], '''micromixing''' is a process in which ingredient particles rearrange to form a [[mixture|blend]].  Development of [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s requires understanding how the ingredients blend with each other and how the blending progresses through different stages.  It is also important to establish in a scientific manner when the blending is considered complete, establishing the margins of blending performance, so that in production the blending is complete before the blending process stops.

==Optimal blending==
In order to achieve optimal [[Mixing (process engineering)|blending]], the micromixing process must be studied to determine mixing parameters such as blending time, blending speed, type and size of blender.  When blending is performed too long, overblending may occur, with particles re-aggregating, resulting in segregation of the previously ideal blend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osorio|first1=Juan G.|last2=Stuessy|first2=Gina|last3=Kemeny|first3=Gabor J.|last4=Muzzio|first4=Fernando J.|title=Characterization of pharmaceutical powder blends using in situ near-infrared chemical imaging|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|date=April 2014|volume=108|pages=244–257|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2013.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Formulation [[scientist]]s and [[Chemical technologist|technologist]]s need tools to select ingredients for new formulations.  [[Tablet (pharmacy)|Tablet]]s contain multiple ingredients beyond the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) such as fillers, tableting agents, [[Excipient|disintegrant]]s, and [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] enhancers or agents that slow down and control absorption.  Choice of materials is important to assure the flow characteristics, potency, and absorption of specific formulations.  In addition, proper particle size grades of the ingredients must be selected to produce an optimum blend for capsule filling.

==Methods==
In order to study the rate and uniformity of blending, destructive analytical methods, such as [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] followed by [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] [[Separation process|separation]] and detection are often used.  These methods require samples to be pulled from the blend, followed by time consuming laboratory analysis.  In production, such analysis delays may lengthen time required for production formulation development.

==Hyperspectral imaging==
Near-[[infrared]] [[hyperspectral imaging]] can show the distribution of ingredients in pharmaceutical tablets.  In addition to [[Medical laboratory|laboratory analysis]], imaging of near line pull-samples has been used to indicate whether the mixing endpoint has been achieved.  However, such [[measurement]]s were performed once blending was completed, and therefore, did not yield information about the progression of micromixing during the blending process.&lt;ref&gt;Micromixing Analysis for Formulation Developers, Gabor J Kemeny, Gina Stuessy, Natalie Crothers; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) Annual Meeting and Exposition, October 2011, Washington, DC ([http://www.middletonspectral.com/media/1580/micromixing-poster-2011-low-res.pdf poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416234531/http://www.middletonspectral.com/media/1580/micromixing-poster-2011-low-res.pdf |date=2015-04-16 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miroslav Šmíd''', Ing. (1952, [[Police nad Metují]], [[Czechoslovakia]] – 11 September 1993, Lost Arrow, [[Yosemite National Park]], [[United States|USA]]) was a Czech [[Rock climbing|rock climber]], [[Solo climbing|solo climber]], mountaineer, mountain cinematographer and photographer.&lt;ref name="denik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nachodsky.denik.cz/kultura_region/cesty-a-navraty-horolezce-miroslava-smida20080911.html|title=Cesty a návraty horolezce Miroslava Šmída|last=Fetters|first=Aleš |date=11 September 2008|publisher=[[Deník]]|language=Czech|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also organized climbing and cultural events. In 1981 he founded The International Festival of Mountaineering Films ({{lang-cs|Mezinárodní horolezecký filmový festival}}) in [[Teplice nad Metují]]. He also wrote several books.

== Life and climbing career ==
He started climbing in the Ostaš climbing area  and continued in [[Adršpach-Teplice Rocks]], where he climbed a number of famous first ascents. In the [[High Tatras]], [[Slovakia]], he completed 230 ascents (80 of which were in winter and 25 first ascents, including a solo ascent of the Poslední dostih route on Veľká Javorová veža in 1976). In [[Scotland]] he completed the first winter ascent of the Glover’s Chimney route on [[Ben Nevis]] in 1981. He also completed several solo climbs in [[Caucasus]]. He tried to make his solo climbs a secret as they were not approved of by the Socialist Party officials who lead the country at that time. When the solo ascents were revealed, it was very difficult to settle the disagreement. Still, Šmíd received an honor for his sport activities despite the solo climbing controversy.

Miroslav Šmíd climbed in various mountain areas and made a number of important ascents: the [[Alps]] (first ascent in the north face of [[Eiger]] in winter in 1978), the [[Dolomites]] (north face of Cima Grande in 1975), [[Norway]] ([[Trollryggen]] in winter 1976), [[Caucasus]] (solo winter ascent of Donguz Orun 1983), [[Pamir Mountains]] (solo ascent of [[Peak Korzhenevskaya]] in 1977 and first ascent in 1979), [[Fann Mountains]], [[Andes]] (first ascent of Yerupajá Sur, solo climb, 1980) [[Yosemite]] (solo ascent of Dihedral Wall on [[El Capitan]] 1978), [[Patagonia]] ([[Fitz Roy]] and [[Cerro Torre]], 1990) and [[Alaska]] ([[Mount McKinley]] 1989, 1991 and 1993) He ascended [[Mount Kenya]] in [[Africa]] in 1986. He also participated in expeditions to the [[Himalayas]] ([[Lhotse Shar]], [[Dhaulagiri]] 1984, [[Mount Everest]] 1987) He also undertook demanding solo ascents (e.g. [[Ama Dablam]] in 1986).

Šmíd was allured by everything adventurous, and he also became a pioneer of mountain [[paragliding]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. His well-known descent from the Bzeduch Mountain in the [[Caucasus]] mountain range resulted in serious injury (broken pelvis) after landing on a [[moraine]].

Šmíd died on 11 September 1993 during unclear circumstances while solo climbing on the Lost Arrow in [[Yosemite National Park]]. Apparently he fell just below the top while he climbed unbelayed. All his equipment was found on the last ledge below the top. The body was found at the bottom of the gorge, between the massifs and the spire, by one of his friends. On the basis of the identification of the denture, it was proclaimed to be Šmíd’s body.

'''“Mowgli syndrome”''' is a term used by [[Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty]] in her 1995 book ''Other Peoples’ Myths: The Cave of Echoes'' to describe mythological figures who succeed in bridging the animal and human worlds to become one with nature, a human animal, only to become trapped between the two worlds, not completely animal yet not entirely human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">[[File:Nickel titanium (NiTi) rotary file.jpg|thumb|500px|Nickel titanium (NiTi) rotary file used in dentistry]]

A '''nickel titanium''' ('''NiTi''') '''rotary file''' is an engine-driven tapered and pointed [[endodontic]] instrument made of [[nickel titanium]] alloy with cutting edges used to mechanically shape and prepare the root canals during [[endodontic therapy]] or to remove the root canal obturating material while performing retreatment. The first NiTi file was introduced to the market in 1991. [[Superelasticity]] and [[shape memory]] are the properties that make Niti files very flexible. The high flexibility of Niti files makes them superior to [[stainless steel]] files for the purpose of rotary [[root canal]] preparation. The use of NiTi rotary files in dentistry is a common practice.

==Components==

The main components of a rotary NiTi file are tip size, taper, flutes, helix angle and measuring stop. There can be other features such as redial lands and measuring lines incorporated in some designs.

*Tip size – The tips size is the diameter of the tip of a file (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) which is presented in 100th of a millimeter. Sometimes the instruments are named in a system according to what their tip sizes are numbered.The sizes range from 10–100.
*Taper – The taper of a file refers to the gradual increase in diameter along its working surface. NiTi rotary files usually have a higher taper compared to the taper of standard traditional hand files which is 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm/mm (ISO taper of endodontic files, taper 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm/mm indicates 20 microns increase in diameter for every 1&amp;nbsp;mm gain in the length of a file). Their taper commonly ranges from 0.02 to 0.12&amp;nbsp;mm/mm. Different systems are sometimes classified according to their taper which can be constant or variable.
*Flutes – Flutes are the grooves on the working side of the files which can be produced either by twisting or grinding a wire. Flutes provide cutting edges and also space for debris collection. Therefore, their presence turns a wire into a shaping instrument which both cuts the tooth structure and acts as an [[auger (drill)|auger]]. The depth, width, number, arrangement and the direction of the flutes play an important role on the behavior of a file.
*Helix angle – Helix angle is an angle between the cutting edge and the long access of a file. Helix angle plays an important role in debris collection and it also determines the direction of rotation. Helix angle can be constant or accelerating (changes along the length of a file). Accelerating helix angles decreases the screw in effect when most of the working surface of a file is engaged and it can decrease the torsion stress on a file.
*Measuring stop – Measuring stop is a piece of rubber that an operator can use to mark certain desired length on a file while using it. Measuring stops are referred to as stoppers and they can also be color coded corresponding to the size and number of a file.
*Radial land – The radial land is the peripheral portion of a rotary instrument that is flat and smooth designed to center the instrument in the central space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/aae/endodonticglossary/index.php Eleazer, P. D., Glickman, G. N., McClanahan, S. B., Webb, T. D., &amp; Justman, B. C. (2012). Glossary of Endodontic terms.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation of NiTi files==

Separation of Niti rotary files happens due to torsional failure, cyclic fatigue or the combination of both in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Plotino, G., Grande, N. M., Cordaro, M., Testarelli, L., &amp; Gambarini, G. (2009). A review of cyclic fatigue testing of nickel-titanium rotary instruments. Journal of endodontics, 35(11), 1469-1476&lt;/ref&gt;

*Torsional failure – Torsional failure happens when the tip of a file is locked but its shank is being rotated either manually or by a handpiece to the point that exceeds the elastic limit of the alloy.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, B., Zelada, G., Varela, P., Bahillo, J. G., Magán, F., Ahn, S., &amp; Rodriguez, C. (2003). Factors influencing the fracture of nickel‐titanium rotary instruments. International Endodontic Journal, 36(4), 262-266.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cyclic fatigue – Cyclic fatigue occurs when a file rotates contentiously while it is under flexion in curved root canals. Constant compression and tension occurring on both sides of a file causes spread of defects and cracks which fatigues the file and causes separation.&lt;ref&gt;McSpadden, J. T. "Mastering endodontic instrumentation." Chattanooga, TN: Cloudland Institute (2007): 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that the decision to discard a rotary file after being used with regard to prevention of file separation is dependent on operator's skills and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Parashos, Peter, Ian Gordon, and Harold H. Messer. "Factors influencing defects of rotary nickel-titanium endodontic instruments after clinical use." Journal of endodontics 30.10 (2004): 722-725.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmacoeconomics''' refers to the scientific discipline that compares the value of one pharmaceutical drug or drug therapy to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mueller|first=C|author2=Shur, C. |author3=O'Connell, J. |title=Prescription Drug Spending: The Impact of Age and Chronic Disease Status.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=1997|volume=87|issue=10|pages=1626–29|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.10.1626|pmc=1381124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2165/11537580-000000000-00000|pmid=20513161|pages=609–613|title=Time for Cooperation in Health Economics among the Modelling Community|journal=PharmacoEconomics|volume=28|issue=8|year=2010|last1=Arnold|first1=Renée J.G.|last2=Ekins|first2=Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sub-discipline of [[health economics]]. A pharmacoeconomic study evaluates the cost (expressed in monetary terms) and effects (expressed in terms of monetary value, efficacy or enhanced [[quality of life]]) of a pharmaceutical product. Pharmacoeconomic studies serve to guide optimal healthcare resource allocation, in a standardized and scientifically grounded manner.

== Economic evaluation ==
Pharmacoeconomics centers on the [[economic evaluation]] of [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]], and can use [[cost-minimization analysis]], [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or [[cost-utility analysis]]. [[Quality-adjusted life year]]s have become the dominant outcome of interest in pharmacoeconomic evaluations, and many studies employ a cost-per-QALY analysis. Economic evaluations are carried out alongside [[randomized controlled trial]]s and using methods of decision-analytic modeling. Pharmacoeconomics is a useful method of economic evaluation of various treatment options. As more expensive drugs are being developed and licensed it has become imperative especially in context of developing countries where resources are scarce to apply the principles of pharmacoeconomics for various drugs and treatment options so that maximum improvement in quality of life can be achieved in minimum cost.&lt;ref&gt;Deepak Bhosle, Asif sayyed*, Shaikh Huzaif, Alimuddin Shaikh, Vasundhara Bhople, Ayman Ali Khan.PHARMACOECONOMICS IN INDIAN CONTEXT.

== In policy ==
In 1993, [[Australia]] became the first nation to use pharmacoeconomic analysis as part of the process for deciding whether new drugs should be subsidized by the [[Federation of Australia|Federal Government]]. The [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee]] (PBAC) advises Federal Government ministers on whether new drugs should be placed on a list for of drugs that consumers can then purchase from pharmacies at a subsidized price. Since 1993, this approach to evaluating costs and benefits is used in Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the UK.

'''Phlebitis''' or '''venitis''' is the [[inflammation]] of a [[vein]], usually in the [[human leg|leg]]s. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with [[thrombosis]] and is then called [[thrombophlebitis]] or superficial thrombophlebitis. Unlike [[deep vein thrombosis]], the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to [[Pulmonary embolism|break up and be transported in pieces to the lung]] is very low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/106/17/2170|title=Diseases of the Veins|first=Joshua A.|last=Beckman|date=22 October 2002|publisher=|journal=Circulation|volume=106|issue=17|pages=2170–2172|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=circ.ahajournals.org|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000036740.75461.80|pmid=12390942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
* Localized [[erythema|redness]] and swelling
* Pain or burning along the length of the vein 
* Vein being hard and cord-like&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/phlebitis/page3_em.htm |title=Phlebitis Symptoms |author=Benjamin Wedro |publisher=emedicinehealth |accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is usually a slow onset of a tender red area along the superficial veins on the skin. A long, thin red area may be seen as the inflammation follows a superficial vein. This area may feel hard, warm, and tender. The skin around the vein may be itchy and swollen. The area may begin to throb or burn. Symptoms may be worse when the leg is lowered, especially when first getting out of bed in the morning. A low-grade fever may occur. Sometimes phlebitis may occur where a peripheral intravenous line was started. The surrounding area may be sore and tender along the vein.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/phlebitis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Phlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/phlebitis/page2_em.htm#phlebitis_causes|title=Phlebitis Causes |author=Benjamin Wedro|publisher=emedicinehealth |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as [[desomorphine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chealth.canoe.ca/condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=190|title=Blood Clots - Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis - Canoe.com|author=|date=|website=canoe.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in [[thromboangiitis obliterans]] (Buerger's disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/superficial-thrombophlebitis-of-the-lower-extremity?source=search_result&amp;search=superficial+nodular+phlebitis&amp;selectedTitle=1~150|title=UpToDate|author=|date=|website=www.uptodate.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatment usually consists of [[NSAID]]s, such as [[ibuprofen]] and local compression (e.g., by [[compression stockings]] or a [[Dressing (medical)|compress]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/phlebitis/page6_em.htm|title=Phlebitis Treatment |author=Benjamin Wedro |publisher=emedicinehealth |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the phlebitis is associated with local bacterial infection, [[antibiotics]] may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/phlebitis/page7_em.htm|title=Phlebitis Medical Treatment |author=Benjamin Wedro |publisher=emedicinehealth |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For acute infusion superficial thrombophlebitis, not enough evidence exists as of 2015 to determine treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Nisio|first1=M|last2=Peinemann|first2=F|last3=Porreca|first3=E|last4=Rutjes|first4=AW|title=Treatment for superficial infusion thrombophlebitis of the upper extremity.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=20 November 2015|volume=11|pages=CD011015|pmid=26588711|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011015.pub2|url=http://boris.unibe.ch/77437/1/DiNisio%20CochraneSystRev%202015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Phlebitis was first described by the Scottish surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] in 1784.

The '''Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act''' is a 1970 [[Law of the United States|federal law]] in the [[United States]] designed to limit the practice of [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. As approved by the [[United States Congress]], the act required a stronger [[Tobacco packaging warning messages|health warning]] on [[cigarette]] packages, saying ''"Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined that Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health"''. It also banned [[tobacco advertising|cigarette advertisements]] on American [[radio]] and [[television]].&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobaccodocuments.org/atc/71066088.html |title=Tobaccodocuments.org - Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 |accessdate=2007-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305012949/http://tobaccodocuments.org/atc/71066088.html |archivedate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act was one of the major [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] resulting from the [[Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States|1964 report]] by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], [[Luther Terry]]. The report found that [[lung cancer]] and [[chronic bronchitis]] are causally related to cigarette smoking.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | title=History of the Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health | url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/history.htm | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | accessdate=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070503170753/http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress previously passed the [[Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act]] in 1965; requiring that all cigarette packages sold in the United States carry a health warning.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLM"&gt;{{cite web | title=The 1964 Report on Smoking and Health | url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/Views/Exhibit/narrative/smoking.html | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after a recommendation by the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act amended the 1965 law so that the warnings are made in the name of the Surgeon General.&lt;ref name="NLM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="druglibrary"&gt;{{cite web | title=History of Tobacco Regulation | url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/nc/nc2b.htm | publisher=druglibrary.org | accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advocates of the cigarette advertising ban was the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. The FCC argued that since the topic of smoking is controversial, numerous TV and radio stations continued to break the [[Fairness Doctrine]] when airing these commercials because they did not give equal time to the opposing viewpoint that smoking is dangerous.&lt;ref name="druglibrary"/&gt;

The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act was introduced into Congress in 1969, but it was not until April 1, 1970 when [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] signed it into law. The actual cigarette advertising ban did not come into force until January 2, 1971, as per a compromise that allowed broadcasters to air these commercials during their telecasts of [[college football]] [[bowl game]]s on [[New Year's Day]].&lt;ref name="druglibrary"/&gt; The last cigarette ad on U.S. television, advertising [[Virginia Slims]], was carried on the last possible legal minute at 11:59 p.m ET/PT, 10:59 p.m. CT/MT that evening on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvparty.com/vaultcomcig.html|title=Cigarette Advertising on TV|last=Ingram|first=Billy|publisher=TVParty|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
In 1981, the FTC reported that the health warning labels as mandated by the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act had little effect on American smoking habits. Congress therefore passed the [[Comprehensive Smoking Education Act]] of 1984, requiring more specific health warnings.&lt;ref name="CDC2000 labels"&gt;{{cite web | title=2000 Surgeon General's Report—Reducing Tobacco Use:diljfoig use protection| url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2000/highlights/highlight_labels.htm | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | accessdate=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427165525/http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2000/highlights/highlight_labels.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco industry has begun to use a variety of other marketing tools and strategies to influence people and attract new customers.&lt;ref name="CDC2000 ads"&gt;{{cite web | title=2000 Surgeon General's Report—Reducing Tobacco Use: Tobacco Advertising and Promotion | url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2000/highlights/highlight_advertising.htm | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | accessdate=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427164350/http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2000/highlights/highlight_advertising.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ads targeted to [[adolescent]]s affect their perceptions on the image and function of smoking.&lt;ref name="CDC1994"&gt;{{cite web | title=1994 Surgeon General's Report—Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: Major Conclusions | url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_1994/chapter1_intro.htm | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | accessdate=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305015544/http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_1994/chapter1_intro.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] published a study showing that more children aged 5 and 6 years old, could recognize [[Camel cigarettes]]' [[Joe Camel]] mascot than [[Mickey Mouse]] or [[Fred Flintstone]].&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;Fischer PM, Schwartz MP, Richards JW Jr, Goldstein AO, Rojas TH.

The only lawsuit that followed was from a broadcaster in an effort to keep tobacco advertising on television and radio.

Many [[religions|religious traditions]] have taken a stance on [[abortion]], and these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/religion/religion.shtml BBC "Religion and Ethics"] Be aware that these BBC pages do not cover all Protestant, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Patheos Public Square Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014915/http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html |date=2011-10-05 }} Including Buddhist, Muslim, Mormon, and Pagan perspectives in addition to Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, and Jewish perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
Abortion, for the purpose of eliminating an unwanted child, and permanent sterilization are generally forbidden to [[Bahá'ís]] unless there is some medical reason for it. At present, Bahá'ís are encouraged to decide based on their own conscience in light of general guidance found in Bahá'í writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Bahá'u'lláh | author2 =Abdu'l-Bahá |author3=Shoghi Effendi |author4=Universal House of Justice |editor-last =Hornby| editor-first = Helen| title =Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File | publisher =New Delhi: Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year =1983 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=2#n1154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{main article|Buddhism and abortion}}
There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism]." ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditional sources, including some Buddhist monastic codes, hold that life begins at conception, and that abortion, which would then involve the deliberate destruction of life, should be rejected.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, Peter. Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 311–20&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating the issue is the Buddhist belief that "life is a continuum with no discernible starting point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html Buddhism and Abortion on Patheos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301172029/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html |date=2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is no official or preferred viewpoint regarding abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Buddhism and abortion on BBC Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative", but there are exceptions. He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date= 28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title= New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate= 31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks and nuns must be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the "moral stigma" associated with an abortion grows with the development of the foetus.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions&amp;nbsp;– and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries&amp;nbsp;– recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{main article|Abortion and Christianity|Catholic Church and abortion}}
There is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion, and no explicit prohibition of abortion in either the "Old Testament" or "New Testament" books of the [[Christian Bible]].

==Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hinduism and abortion}}
Classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] writes, "When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society." The BBC goes on to state, "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to [[Sex-selective abortion|abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies]], which is called 'female foeticide'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC] "Hinduism and abortion"&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at imminent risk or when the foetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and [[Brahma Kumaris]] believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1: Dilemmas of Life and Death: Hindu Ethics in a North American Context | Date: 1995 | Author: Crawford, S.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Islam and abortion}}
Although there are different opinions among Islamic scholars about when life begins, and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days - the point at which, in Islam, a foetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible.&lt;ref name=PewForum&gt;The Pew Forum. September 30, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 ''Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion''], Retrieved on April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools of [[Sharia|Muslim law]] permit abortion in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, whereas others only allow it in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. The further along the pregnancy has progressed, the greater the wrong. The Qur'an does not specifically mention abortion, but it skirts the issue by condemning intentional murder. All schools accept abortion as a means to save the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - Religions - Islam: Abortion|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox Jewish teaching allows abortion if necessary to safeguard the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml Judaism and Abortion], BBC (2005-02-08).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bank, Richard.

In Judaism, views on abortion draw primarily upon the legal and ethical teachings of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]], the case-by-case decisions of [[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]], and other rabbinic literature. Generally speaking, Orthodox Jews oppose abortion after the 40th day,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Yevomot 69a states that prior to the 40th day, a foetus is "considered to be mere water"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grodzenski, Achiezer Vol. 3, 65:14&lt;/ref&gt; with health-related exceptions, and reform Jews tend to allow greater latitude for abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Articles published by the [[Schlesinger institute]] on [[Judaism and abortion|abortion in Judaism]]: articles [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/jmeResults.asp?title=abortion&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in English] and [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/AsiaResults.asp?title=&amp;keywords=20&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in Hebrew], and the [http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/tora/subject18.asp entry on abortion] from the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; There are rulings that often appear conflicting on the matter.

The Hebrew Bible has a few references to abortion; Exodus 21:22-25 addresses [[miscarriage]] by way of another's actions, which it describes as a non-capital offense punishable through a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|21:22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isser, Stanley.

==Sikhism==
Although the [[Sikh]] code of conduct does not deal directly with abortion (or indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that [[Sex-selective abortion|female foetuses are being aborted]] because of the cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Unitarian Universalism==
The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, "...&lt;nowiki&gt;[the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml Right to Choose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904064958/http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml |date=2009-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

==Wicca==
Although views differ, most Wiccans consider abortion to be a spiritual decision that should be free from interference by the state or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America: Volume 1 - Page 811, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosanna Capolingua''' (born 1959)&lt;Ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Capolingua%2C%20Rosanna%2C%201959-%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 Showing 1 - 1 of 1 Results for author:"Capolingua, Rosanna, 1959-"]&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian doctor and former federal president of the [[Australian Medical Association]] (AMA).  She served as president from 2007 to 2009.

==Background==
A graduate of the [[University of Western Australia]], she was AMA (Western Australia) State President for two years and served on the Executive of the Federal AMA for four years. Dr. Capolingua is also Chair of the Federal AMA’s Ethics and Medico-Legal Committee and the AMA Publishing Company.

She currently works as a general practitioner in Western Australia. She occasionally writes newspaper columns for ''[[The West Australian]]''.

Capolingua was once a member of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23897930-5006789,00.html Doctors' boss was in the Libs - The Australian: 21 June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capolingua was for a long time a board member of Healthway, a government-funded health promotion organisation, and served as its chairman for a period of time. She resigned from the role in February 2015 after a Public Sector Commission report found that she and other board members had misused privileges for their own personal benefit, including tickets to sports events provided by Healthway-sponsored teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-24/wa-healthways-chair-rosanna-capolingua-steps-down/6252984 Healthway chair Capolingua steps down after watchdog alleges misuse of perks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capolingua sued The West Australian for defamation following her resignation from the Healthway board. The case was settled, with The West Australian conceding that the statements made of Capolingua were defamatory. 

Bob Cronin, the group editor-in-chief of West Australian News-papers, stated that, "The articles were published in circumstances where Dr Capolingua was (and still is) barred by statutory confidentiality obligations from disclosing information she obtained by reason of her role as Chair of Healthway, which prevented her from giving details of what went on at Healthway.”

“The West accepts that Dr Capolingua was instrumental in initiating the Public Sector Commission review into Healthway’s access to and use of tickets, and took action to address inappropriate inclusion of tickets in sponsorship agreements and ensuring Healthway’s practices complied with Public Sector guidelines,” Mr Cronin said.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/legal-action-vindicates-dr-capolingua-ng-ya-127079&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Dr. Capolingua is a member of the:

* Medical Board of Western Australia, Professional Services Review Committee
* Board of MercyCare
* Director of General Practice Liaison at [[St John of God Subiaco Hospital|SJOG Hospital]], [[Subiaco, Western Australia|Subiaco]].

'''Self-esteem''', in regards to [[communication]], is the evaluative element of the perception of oneself.  It is one’s perception of [[self-appraisal]], [[self-worth]], [[attractiveness]], and [[social competence]].

== Influences on self-esteem ==
There are three primary influences on self-esteem:  [[reflected appraisal]], [[social comparison]], and contingencies of self-worth.  Reflected appraisal refers to messages you receive from others that assess your self-concept.  For example, we are not able to believe that we are smart if the ones who are important in our lives tell us that we are slow or dumb.  Social comparison is evaluating ourselves by comparing our own abilities, attributes, and accomplishments to those of other people.  When we surround ourselves with others whom we perceive to be superior to us, our self-esteem tends to diminish, while when we surround ourselves with others whom we perceive to be not as talented as us, our self-esteem tends to inflate.  Lastly, contingencies of self-worth is how our  self-esteem is influenced by what is perceived as most important to us feeling good about ourselves.  For example, one person's self-esteem could be highly contingent on doing well in academics and having a lot of friends whereas another person's self-esteem could be highly contingent on their performance in athletics and adherence to moral standards.

== Protecting our self-esteem ==
Individuals protect their self-esteem by exercising a [[self-serving bias]], which is the tendency to attribute successful behavior to oneself but to assign external circumstances to one's unsuccessful behavior.  For example, a football wide-receiver will give himself all of the credit for a miraculous catch but will blame the quarterback for a dropped one.  The tendency to emphasize one's accomplishments and downplay one's failures is common.  People will be unlikely to learn new skills or gain knowledge unless they become mindful of this tendency.

== Optimal self-esteem ==
Optimal self-esteem comes from an individual achieving significant accomplishments without expecting a reward.  It is the unconscious effort to please others without expecting anything in return.  This is unlikely to occur when one places oneself at the mercy of other people's appraisals.  Optimal self-esteem develops, paradoxically, when one concentrates on accomplishing one's goals and dreams, rather than acting in order to build self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|title=In the Company of Others:  an introduction to communication|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533630-6|pages=45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smith–Magenis Syndrome''' ('''SMS''') has features including [[intellectual disability]], facial abnormalities, difficulty sleeping, and numerous behavioral problems such as self-harm. Smith–Magenis syndrome affects an estimated between 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 25,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/smith-magenis-syndrome |title=Smith-Magenis syndrome |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2016-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[microdeletion syndrome]] characterized by an abnormality in the short (p) arm of [[chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]] and is sometimes called the 17p- syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bi|first1=W|last2=Yan|first2=J|last3=Stankiewicz|first3=P|last4=Park|first4=SS|last5=Walz|first5=K|last6=Boerkoel|first6=CF|last7=Potocki|first7=L|last8=Shaffer|first8=LG|last9=Devriendt|first9=K|last10=Nowaczyk|first10=MJ|last11=Inoue|first11=K|last12=Lupski|first12=JR|title=Genes in a refined Smith-Magenis syndrome critical deletion interval on chromosome 17p11.2 and the syntenic region of the mouse.|journal=Genome Research|date=May 2002|volume=12|issue=5|pages=713–28|doi=10.1101/gr.73702|pmid=11997338|pmc=186594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Facial features of children with Smith–Magenis syndrome include a broad and square face, deep-set eyes, large cheeks, and a prominent jaw, as well as a flat nose bridge (in the young child, as the child ages it become more ski-jump shaped). Eyes tend to be deep-set and appear close together there is also a slant upwards.  Eyebrows are heavy with lateral extension. The mouth is the most noticeable feature, both upper and lower lips are full, the mouth is wide.  The mouth curves downwards and the upper lip curves outwards, due to a fleshy [[philtrum]]. These facial features become more noticeable as the individual ages, as [[mandibular|Mandible]] growth outstrips that of the maxilla leading to a clear midface [[hypoplasia]]. There is also a mild [[brachycephaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Allanson JE, Greenberg F, Smith ACM |title=The face of Smith-Magenis syndrome: a subjective and objective study |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |date=1999 |volume=36 |page=394-397 |url=https://jmg.bmj.com/content/36/5/394 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disrupted sleep patterns are characteristic of Smith–Magenis syndrome, typically beginning early in life. Affected people may be very sleepy during the day, but have trouble falling asleep and awaken several times each night, due to an inverted [[circadian rhythm]] of [[melatonin]].&lt;ref name="pmid11445803"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=De Leersnyder H, De Blois MC, Claustrat B, etal |title=Inversion of the circadian rhythm of melatonin in the Smith-Magenis syndrome |journal=J Pediatr |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=111–116 |year=2001 |pmid=11445803 |doi=10.1067/mpd.2001.115018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with Smith–Magenis syndrome have engaging personalities, but all also have a lot of behavioral problems. These behavioral problems include frequent temper tantrums, meltdowns and outbursts, aggression, anger, fidgeting, compulsive behavior, anxiety, impulsiveness, and difficulty paying attention. Self-harm, including biting, hitting, head banging, and skin picking, is very common. Repetitive self-hugging is a behavioral trait that may be unique to Smith–Magenis syndrome. People with this condition may also compulsively lick their fingers and flip pages of books and magazines (a behavior known as "lick and flip"), as well as possessing an impressive ability to recall a wide range of small details about people or subject-specific trivia.

Other symptoms can include short stature, abnormal curvature of the spine ([[scoliosis]]), reduced sensitivity to [[pain]] and [[temperature]], and a hoarse voice. Some people with this disorder have ear abnormalities that lead to hearing loss. Affected individuals may have eye abnormalities that cause nearsightedness ([[myopia]]), [[strabismus]], and other problems with vision. Heart and kidney defects also have been reported in people with Smith–Magenis syndrome, though they are less common.

==Genetics==
Smith–Magenis syndrome is a chromosomal condition related to [[low copy repeats]] of specific segments of [[chromosome 17]].&lt;ref name="pmid15148657"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=CJ|last2=Withers|first2=MA|last3=Lupski|first3=JR|title=Uncommon deletions of the Smith-Magenis syndrome region can be recurrent when alternate low-copy repeats act as homologous recombination substrates.|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=July 2004|volume=75|issue=1|pages=75–81|doi=10.1086/422016|pmid=15148657|pmc=1182010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people with SMS have a deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 17 (17p11.2). Although this region contains multiple genes, recently researchers discovered that the loss of one particular gene the retinoic acid induced 1 or ''[[RAI1]]'' is responsible for most of the characteristic features of this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Girirajan S, Vlangos CN, Szomju BB, etal |title=Genotype-phenotype correlation in Smith–Magenis syndrome: evidence that multiple genes in 17p11.2 contribute to the clinical spectrum |journal=Genet. Med. |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=417–27 |year=2006 |pmid=16845274 |doi=10.1097/01.gim.0000228215.32110.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsea|first1=SH|last2=Girirajan|first2=S|title=Smith-Magenis syndrome.|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=April 2008|volume=16|issue=4|pages=412–21|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5202009|pmid=18231123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, other genes within the chromosome 17 contribute to the variability and severity of the clinical features.  The loss of other genes in the deleted region may help explain why the features of Smith–Magenis syndrome vary among affected individuals. A small percentage of people with Smith–Magenis syndrome have a mutation in the ''RAI1'' gene instead of a chromosomal deletion.

These deletions and mutations lead to the production of an abnormal or nonfunctional version of the ''RAI1'' protein. ''RAI1'' is a [[transcription factor]] that regulates the expression of multiple genes, including several that are involved in controlling circadian rhythm, such as ''CLOCK''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Williams SR, Zies D, Mullegama SV, etal | title=Smith-Magenis syndrome results in disruption of CLOCK gene transcription and reveals an integral role for RAI1 in the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=941–949 |year=2012 |pmid=22578325 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.04.013 |pmc=3370274}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The groups led by James Lupski (Baylor College of Medicine) and Sarah Elsea (Virginia Commonwealth University) are in the process of studying the exact function of this gene in relation to Smith Magenis Syndrome.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

SMS is typically not inherited. This condition usually results from a genetic change that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. People with Smith–Magenis syndrome most often have no history of the condition in their family.

==Diagnosis==
SMS is usually confirmed by blood tests called chromosome ([[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]]) analysis and utilize a technique called FISH ([[fluorescent in situ hybridization]]). The characteristic  micro-deletion was sometimes overlooked in a standard FISH test, leading to a number of people with the symptoms of SMS with negative results.

The recent development of the FISH for 17p11.2 deletion test has allowed more accurate detection of this deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lupski|first1=James R.|last2=Potocki|first2=Lorraine|last3=Chen|first3=Ken-Shiung|last4=Park|first4=Sung-Sup|last5=Osterholm|first5=Doreen E.|last6=Withers|first6=Marjorie A.|last7=Kimonis|first7=Virginia|last8=Summers|first8=Anne M.|last9=Meschino|first9=Wendy S.|last10=Anyane-Yeboa|first10=Kwame|last11=Kashork|first11=Catherine D.|last12=Shaffer|first12=Lisa G.|journal=Nature Genetics| title=Molecular mechanism for duplication 17p11.2— the homologous recombination reciprocal of the Smith-Magenis microdeletion |date=1 January 2000|volume=24|issue=1|pages=84–87|doi=10.1038/71743|pmid=10615134}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further testing is required for variations of Smith–Magenis syndrome that are caused by a mutation of the ''RAI1'' gene as opposed to a deletion.

Children with SMS are often given psychiatric diagnoses such as [[autism]], [[attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[attention deficit disorder]] (ADD) and/or [[mood disorders]].

==Treatment==
Treatment for Smith–Magenis syndrome relies on managing its symptoms. Children with SMS often require several forms of support, including [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]] and [[speech therapy]]. Support is often required throughout an affected person's lifetime.

Medication is often used to address some symptoms. [[Melatonin]] supplements and [[trazodone]] are commonly used to regulate sleep disturbances. In combination with exogenous melatonin, blockade of endogenous melatonin production during the day by the adrenergic antagonist [[acebutolol]] can increase concentration, improve sleep and sleep timing and aid in improvement of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = De Leersnyder | first = H. |date= September 2006 | title = Inverted rhythm of melatonin secretion in Smith–Magenis syndrome: from symptoms to treatment | journal = Trends Endocrinol.

==Eponym==
The eponym Smith–Magenis refers to two scientists who described the condition in 1986, namely, Ann C. M. Smith, a [[genetic counselor]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[R. Ellen Magenis]], a pediatrician, medical geneticist and cytogeneticist at the [[Oregon Health Sciences University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2425619"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Smith AC, McGavran L, Robinson J, etal |title=Interstitial deletion of (17)(p11.2p11.2) in nine patients |journal=Am.

'''Stomatitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the mouth and lips.&lt;ref name="Zaoutis 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaoutis|first=[edited by] Jeffrey M. Bergelson, Samir S. Shah, Theoklis E.|title=Pediatric infectious diseases|year=2008|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780323076333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9rT3TcDYNAC&amp;pg=PT361&amp;dq=stomatitis+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=stomatitis%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to any inflammatory process affecting the [[mucous membrane]]s of the mouth and lips, with or without [[oral ulceration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael G. Stewart, Samuel Selesnick (editors)|title=Differential diagnosis in otolaryngology – head and neck surgery|publisher=Thieme|location=New York|isbn=9781604062793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-rSREngtBUC&amp;pg=PT151&amp;dq=stomatitis+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=stomatitis%20definition&amp;f=false|chapter=35|date=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its widest meaning, stomatitis can have a multitude of different causes and appearances. Common causes include infections, nutritional deficiencies, allergic reactions, radiotherapy, and many others.

When inflammation of the gums and the mouth generally presents itself, sometimes the term ''gingivostomatitis'' is used, though this is also sometimes used as a synonym for [[herpetic gingivostomatitis]].

The term is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''stoma'' ({{lang|grc|στόμα}}), meaning "mouth", and the suffix ''-itis'' ({{lang|grc|-ῖτις}}), meaning "inflammation".

==Causes==

===Nutritional deficiency===
[[Malnutrition]] (improper dietary intake) or [[malabsorption]] (poor absorption of nutrients into the body) can lead to [[nutrition disorder|nutritional deficiency states]], several of which can lead to stomatitis. For example, deficiencies of [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[vitamin B2]] (riboflavin),&lt;ref name=Yamada2009 /&gt;{{rp|490}} [[vitamin B3]] (niacin), [[vitamin B6]] (pyridoxine), [[vitamin B9]] (folic acid) or [[vitamin B12]] (cobalamine) may all manifest as stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. Many disorders which cause malabsorption can cause deficiencies, which in turn causes stomatitis. Examples include [[tropical sprue]].&lt;ref name=Yamada2009 &gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Yamada T, Alpers DH |title=Textbook of gastroenterology|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-6911-0|edition=5th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Aphthous stomatitis===
{{main article|Aphthous stomatitis}}
Aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the recurrent appearance of mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals. The cause is not completely understood, but it is thought that the condition represents a [[T cell]] mediated immune response which is triggered by a variety of factors. The individual ulcers (aphthae) recur periodically and heal completely, although in the more severe forms new ulcers may appear in other parts of the mouth before the old ones have finished healing. Aphthous stomatitis is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa, and is thought to affect about 20% of the general population to some degree.&lt;ref name="Neville 2002"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CM, Bouquot JE |title=Oral &amp; maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B.

=== Angular stomatitis ===

{{main article|Angular cheilitis}}

Inflammation of the corners (angles) of the lips is termed angular stomatitis or angular cheilitis. In children a frequent cause is repeated lip-licking, and in adults it may be a sign of underlying [[iron deficiency anemia]], or [[vitamin B]] deficiencies (''e.g.'', B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[riboflavin]], B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-[[folate]], or [[vitamin B12|B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]-[[cobalamin]], which in turn may be evidence of poor diets or malnutrition such as [[celiac disease]]).

Also, angular cheilitis can be caused by a patient's jaws at rest being 'overclosed' due to [[edentulous]]ness or [[tooth wear]], causing the jaws to come to rest closer together than if the complete/unaffected [[dentition]] were present. This causes skin folds around the angle of the mouth which are kept moist by saliva, which in turn favours infection; mostly by ''Candida albicans'' or similar species. Treatment usually involves the administration of topical [[nystatin]] or similar [[antifungal medication|antifungal]] agents. Another treatment can be to correct the jaw relationship with dental treatment (''e.g.'', [[denture]]s or [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] adjustment).

===Denture-related stomatitis===
{{main article|Denture-related stomatitis}}
This is a common condition present in [[denture]] wearers. It appears as reddened but painless mucosa beneath the denture. 90% of cases are associated with [[Candida (fungus)|''Candida'' species]], and it is the most common form of [[oral candidiasis]]. Treatment is by [[antifungal medication]] and improved dental hygiene, such as not wearing the denture during sleep.

===Allergic contact stomatitis===
Allergic contact stomatitis (also termed "allergic gingivostomatitis" or "allergic contact gingivostomatitis")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanerva|first=L.|author2=Alanko, K. |author3=Estlander, T. |title=Allergic contact gingivostomatitis from a temporary crown made of methacrylates and epoxy diacrylates|journal=Allergy|date=1 December 1999|volume=54|issue=12|pages=1316–1321|doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.1999.00074.x|pmid=10688437}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[type IV hypersensitivity|type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity]] reaction that occurs in susceptible [[atopy|atopic]] individuals when [[allergen]]s penetrate the skin or [[mucosa]].&lt;ref name=Glick2003&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Greenberg MS, Glick M |title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis &amp; treatment|year=2003|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton, Ont.|isbn=1550091867|pages=60, 61|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allergens, which may be different for different individuals, combine with [[epithelial]]-derived [[protein]]s, forming [[hapten]]s which bind with [[Langerhans cell]]s in the mucosa, which in turn present the antigen on their surface to [[T lymphocyte]]s, sensitizing them to that antigen and causing them to produce many specific [[clone (cell biology)|clone]]s. The second time that specific antigen is encountered, an inflammatory reaction is triggered at the site of exposure.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; Allergic contact stomatitis is less common than [[allergic contact dermatitis]] because the mouth is coated in saliva, which washes away antigens and acts as a barrier.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; The oral mucosa is also more vascular (has a better blood supply) than skin, meaning that any antigens are more quickly removed from the area by the circulation.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; Finally, there is substantially less [[keratin]] in [[oral mucosa]], meaning that there is less likelihood that haptens will form.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt;

Allergic contact stomatitis appears as non-specific inflammation, so it may be mistaken for chronic physical irritation.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; There may be burning or soreness of the mouth and ulceration.&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; Chronic exposure to the allergen may result in a [[lichen planus|lichenoid lesion]].&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt; [[Plasma cell gingivitis]] may also occur, which may be accompanied by [[glossitis]] and [[cheilitis]].&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt;

[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|180px |[[Patch test]]]]
Allergens that may cause allergic contact stomatitis in some individuals include [[cinnamaldehyde]], [[Balsam of Peru]], [[peppermint]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[gold]], [[pyrophosphate]]s, [[zinc citrate]], free [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]] monomer, [[nickel]], [[fluoride]], and [[sodium lauryl sulfate]].&lt;ref name=Glick2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrreTHuo54wC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=balsam+of+peru+allergy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m18XU46XMI7QkQfTvYGIDw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=balsam%20of%20peru%20allergy&amp;f=false |title=Biocompatibility of Dental Materials |author1=Gottfried Schmalz |author2=Dorthe Arenholt Bindslev |publisher= Springer|date= 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDWlWR5UbqQC&amp;pg=PT530&amp;dq=%22balsam+of+peru%22+allergy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UGoXU_CfL5TLkAelvYCQCg&amp;ved=0CIIBEOgBMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22balsam%20of%20peru%22%20allergy&amp;f=false |title=Clinical Dermatology |author=Thomas P.

===Migratory stomatitis===

{{main article|Geographic tongue}}

Migratory stomatitis (or geographic stomatitis) is an atypical presentation of a condition which normally presents on the tongue, termed geographic tongue. Geographic tongue is so named because there are [[atrophy|atrophic]], [[erythema]]tous areas of [[depapillation]] that migrate over time, giving a map-like appearance.

In migratory stomatitis, other mucosal sites in the mouth, such as the ventral surface (undersurface) of the tongue, buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, soft palate, or floor of mouth may be afflicted with identical lesions, usually in addition to the tongue.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Treister NS, Bruch JM |title=Clinical oral medicine and pathology|year=2010|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60327-519-4|pages=20, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from not being restricted to the tongue, migratory stomatitis is an identical condition in every regard to geographic tongue. Another synonym for geographic tongue which uses the term stomatitis is "stomatitis areata migrans".

===Herpetic gingivostomatitis===
[[File:Stomatitis herpetica.jpg|thumbnail|right|Herpetic stomatitis (herpetic gingivostomatitis)]]
{{main article|Herpetic gingivostomatitis}}
This is inflammation of the mouth caused by [[herpes simplex virus]].

===Irradiation and chemotherapy===
Stomatitis may also be caused by chemotherapy, or radiation therapy of the oropharyngeal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LngD6RFXY_AC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=cause+%22stomatitis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TQQrU9jUEJCvkAfAjoGwBw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cause%20%22stomatitis%22&amp;f=false |title=Principles and Practice of Palliative Care and Supportive Oncology |publisher= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[mucositis]]'' is sometimes used synonymously with stomatitis, however the former usually refers to mucosal reactions to [[radiotherapy]] or [[chemotherapy]], and may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and not just in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeppetella|first=Giovambattista|title=Palliative care in clinical practice|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=9781447128434|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8mJLlnuNcMC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=stomatitis+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=stomatitis%20definition&amp;f=false|date=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis===
{{Hatnote|See [[Necrotizing periodontal diseases]]}}
The term ''necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis'' is sometimes used as a synonym of the necrotizing periodontal disease more commonly termed [[necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]], or a more severe form (also termed necrotizing stomatitis). The term ''necrotizing gingivostomatitis'' is also sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horning|first=GM|title=Necotizing gingivostomatitis: NUG to noma.|journal=Compendium of continuing education in dentistry (Jamesburg, N.J. : 1995)|date=October 1996|volume=17|issue=10|pages=951–4, 956, 957–8 passim; quiz 964|pmid=9533316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palate appears dry and cracked, and white from [[keratosis]]. The minor [[salivary gland]]s appear as small, red and swollen bumps. It is not a [[premalignant condition]], and the appearance reverses if the smoking is stopped.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2008"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

===Chronic ulcerative stomatitis===
Chronic ulcerative stomatitis is a recently discovered condition with specific immunopathologic features.&lt;ref name="Solomon 2008" /&gt; It is characterized by [[Mouth ulcer#Definition|erosions]] and [[oral ulceration|ulceration]]s which relapse and remit. Lesions are located on the buccal mucosa (inside of the cheeks) or on the [[gingiva]] (gums).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fourie 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fourie J, van Heerden WF, McEachen SC, van Zyl A |title=Chronic ulcerative stomatitis: a distinct clinical entity?|journal=SADJ : journal of the South African Dental Association = tydskrif van die Suid-Afrikaanse Tandheelkundige Vereniging|date=April 2011|volume=66|issue=3|pages=119–21|pmid=21874892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition resembles [[Lichen planus#Oral lichen planus|Oral lichen planus]] when biopsied.

The diagnosis is made with [[Immunofluorescence]] techniques, which shows circulating and tissue-bound [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] (particulate stratified squamous-epithelium-specific antinuclear antibody) to DeltaNp63alpha protein, a normal component of the [[epithelium]].

'''''Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Raj Patel]].  It was published in 2008 by [[Melville House Publishing]].  ''Stuffed and Starved'' looks at the inequities of the world food system from the beginning to the end of the conventional [[food supply|food chain]], from producers to manufacturers and distributors to consumers.

According to [[Naomi Klein]], ''Stuffed and Starved'' is "One of the most dazzling books I have read in a very long time. The product of a brilliant mind, and a gift to a world hungering for justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizinemag.com/calendar/details/4-last-sunday-raj-patel-author-of-qstuffed-and-starvedq.html Citizine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129075307/http://www.citizinemag.com/calendar/details/4-last-sunday-raj-patel-author-of-qstuffed-and-starvedq.html |date=2009-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thwaites based the novel on a story he heard from an old man while crossing the Atlantic in 1933. However, he changed the tragic ending to a more optimistic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110576101 |title=Began to sell. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=19 August 1979 |accessdate=2 November 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

A Sydney surgeon is sent to jail. When he gets out, finding himself a social outcast, he goes to work in the African jungle. Although he only works among the native Africans, his reputation as a miracle worker in cases of paralysis spreads far and wide. 

==Adaptation==

'''''The Mad Doctor in Harley Street''''' is a 1938 novel by F. J. Thwaites. A sequel to ''The Mad Doctor'', it describes the doctor's efforts to get his cure recognised by the medical establishment in London. A contemporary review says that the novel "bubbles over with sentimentalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41005907 |title=Brief Reviews of New Books. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=2 July 1938 |accessdate=1 November 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">The '''United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union''' was enacted by [[Jimmy Carter]] in January 1980 in response to the [[Soviet Union]]’s [[Soviet–Afghan War|invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979. It remained in effect until [[Ronald Reagan]] ended it in 1981 upon taking the office of president. American farmers felt the brunt of the sanctions, while its effects upon the Soviet Union were inconclusive.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} During the presidential election campaign of 1980, Republican nominee Ronald Reagan promised to end the embargo while incumbent Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was not willing to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Oki, Kazuhisa. U.S. FOOD EXPORT CONTROLS POLICY: THREE CASES FROM 1973 TO 1981. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan was met by the United States with numerous economic sanctions including the grain embargo. In addition, the United States led a boycott of the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]] which were hosted in Moscow.

== Effect of embargo on the Soviet Union ==
The effect of the embargo on the Soviet Union was minimal as they were able to receive grain from other sources. These sources included most of South America such as Venezuela and Brazil. These crops were cheaper than the American grain as the labor cost was much cheaper. The Soviet Union still received grain from the United States with regard to the grain agreement in 1975 between the two countries. The agreement said that the United States was required to send 8 million tons of grain to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Marcia Zarley. "Russian Grain Embargo in Retrospect." DTN Progressive Farmer. N.p., 21 Mar. 2014. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The embargo was a blessing in disguise for the Soviets as they were able to see that they didn’t need the United States’ grain. Instead, they could cultivate their own in Ukraine and import the grain from South America. Even after the embargo was lifted the Soviets still relied on the grain from Ukraine and South America and reduced their interaction with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Luttrell, Clifton B. The Russian Grain Embargo: Dubious Success. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect the embargo had on the United States ==
The effects of the embargo on the United States were numerous. The embargo had no affect on price https://www.macrotrends.net/2534/wheat-prices-historical-chart-data .  According this wheat price chart the price was $4.39 in Jan 1980 and $5 in Jan 1981 with highs of $5.38 in Nov 1980.   (${{Inflation|US|4|1981|r=2}}) per bushel in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Luttrell, Clifton B. The Russian Grain Embargo: Dubious Success. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The embargo had a direct effect on the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&amp;dat=19801105&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|title= Reagan in a landslide|date=5 November 1980|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kneeland, Douglas E. "FARMERS ASK REAGAN TO KEEP VOW TO LIFT GRAIN EMBARGO." The New York Times. The New York Times, 24 Jan. 1981. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In several states farmers who were part of the farm strike movement circled their tractors around local state [[United States Department of Agriculture]] offices to protest the USDA enforcement of the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;Paarlberg, Robert L. ""Lessons of the Grain Embargo"" N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Soviets receiving more grain from their second highest importer, [[Argentina]].

== Key figures of the 1980 grain embargo ==
The main figure of the 1980 grain embargo was Jimmy Carter. The grain embargo was his way of using food as a weapon. Carter believed that if he could cut out the Soviets grain imports, then they wouldn’t be able to feed their livestock or people, hoping that the people in the country would lead to unrest against the war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Luttrell, Clifton B. The Russian Grain Embargo: Dubious Success. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key figure in the grain embargo was the Farm Bureau. At first, they supported the embargo as they saw it as a way for farmers to sell more of their grain to Americans. As a result, grain prices dropped and farmers became angered with the legislation and decided to protest against the embargo. When Jimmy Carter lost their support it was the end for the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Marcia Zarley. "Russian Grain Embargo in Retrospect." DTN Progressive Farmer. N.p., 21 Mar. 2014. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Ronald Reagan took power with the support of the Farm Bureau and ended the embargo. Another key figure of the 1980 Grain Embargo was the farm strike movement. The farm strike movement was a group of farmers who protested the embargo through peaceful means such as the incidents with encircling the USDA headquarters in few states with their tractors. Their actions brought attention to the demands of the farmers for the embargo to be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;Paarlberg, Robert L. ""Lessons of the Grain Embargo"" N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''V C Kulandaiswamy''' (14 July 1929 – 10 December 2016) was an Indian academic and author. He obtained his Master of Technology degree from [[IIT Kharagpur]] and obtained a Ph.D in hydrology and water resources from the [[University of Illinois]] at Urbana-Champaign (United States).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/25/stories/2008062559170300.htm  KSOU VC criticises remarks of Kulandaiswamy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/09/stories/2010010954670600.htm  12,000 completion certificates pending with varsity: V-C ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/12/25/stories/2009122551300200.htm  Association of private managements welcomes bid to upgrade colleges ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2009/11/29/stories/2009112960481100.htm  China, India powerhouses for growth: Zhang Yan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kulandaiswamy created an eponymous mathematical model for the rainfall-runoff relationship based on a general equation developed by him. Kulandaiswamy was a member of the UNESCO planning group (1978) for the preparation of the second six-year plan (1981–86) of the International Hydraulic Programme (IHP). He has authored more than 60 research reports and papers in the field of hydrology. He has authored six volumes of poems and seven of prose essays which earned him the Thiruvalluvar Award by Tamil Nadu government in 1999. He has received the Padma Bhushan (2002) and Padma Shri (1992), awarded by the President of India.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for reform of Tamil script to make learning Tamil easier. He won the Sahitya Akademi Award (1988) for his book Vaazhum Valluvam. He died on 10 December 2016 after a short illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Distinguished-educationist-V.-C.-Kulandaiswamy-passes-away/article16791426.ece|title=Distinguished educationist V.

The UK '''Vaccination Acts''' of 1840, 1853, 1867 and 1898 were a series of legislative Acts passed by the [[Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]] regarding the [[vaccination]] policy of the country.

==Provisions==

===The 1840 Act===
*Made [[variolation]] illegal.
*Provided optional vaccination free of charge.

In general, the disadvantages of variolation are the same as those of vaccination, but added to them is the general agreement that variolation was always more dangerous than vaccination.

Vaccination was first made compulsory in 1853, and the provisions were made more stringent in 1867, 1871, and 1874.

===The 1853 Act===
By the Act it was required:
*That every child, whose health permits, shall be vaccinated within three, or in case of orphanage within four months of birth, by the public vaccinator of the district, or by some other medical practitioner.
*That notice of this requirement, and information as to the local arrangements for public vaccination, shall, whenever a birth is registered, be given by the registrar of births to the parents or guardians of the child.
*That every medical practitioner who, whether in public or private practice, successfully vaccinates a child shall send to the local registrar of births a certificate that he has done so ; and the registrar shall keep a minute of all the notices given, and an account of all the certificates thus received.
*That parents or guardians who, without sufficient reason, after having duly received the registrar's notice of the requirement of Vaccination, either omit to have a child duly vaccinated, or, this being done, omit to have it inspected as to the results of Vaccination, shall be liable to a penalty of £1; and all penalties shall be recoverable under Jervis's Act, and shall be paid toward the local poor-rate.

===The 1867 Act===
The '''Vaccination Act 1867''' (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 84) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It consolidated and updated the existing laws relating to [[vaccination]], and was repealed by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]].

The [[Board of guardians|poor-law guardians]] were to control vaccination districts formed out of the parishes, and pay vaccinators from 1''s'' to 3''s'' per child vaccinated in the district (the amount paid varied with how far they had to travel).

Within seven days of the birth of a child being registered, the registrar was to deliver a notice of vaccination; if the child was not presented to be vaccinated within three months, or brought for inspection afterwards, the parents or guardians were liable to a summary conviction and fine of 20''s''.

The Act also provided that any person who produced or attempted to inoculate another with [[smallpox]] could be imprisoned for a month.

===The 1871 Act===
In 1871 another Act was passed appointing a Vaccination Officer, also authorising a defendant to appear in a court of law by any member of his family, or any other person authorised by him. This act also confirmed the principal of compulsion, which evidently sparked hostility and opposition to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Dale|title=Leicester and the anti-vaccination movement 1853-59|journal=Leicestershire Archaeological and History Society|date=1967|volume=43|issue=7|page=36&lt;!--|pages=35-43--&gt;|url=https://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/RossPagesfromvolumeXLIIIsm-7.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1873 Act===
Made vaccination compulsory. Records of the reasoning for this are not widely available. However it is apparent that soon after this there was considerable resistance to the compulsion, and this grew.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence of this act available elsewhere|date=April 2014}}

===The 1889 Royal Commission===
issued 6 Reports between 1892 and 1896. Its recommendations, including the abolition of cumulative penalties and the use of safer vaccine were incorporated into the 1898 Vaccination Act.[http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref5885.html]

===The 1898 and 1907 Acts===
In 1898 a new vaccination law was passed, in some respects modifying, but not superseding, previous Acts, giving conditional exemption of conscientious objectors, (and substituting calf lymph for humanised lymph).  It removed cumulative penalties and introduced a conscience clause, allowing parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe to obtain a certificate of exemption.

The Vaccination Act of 1898 purported to give liberty of non-vaccination, but this liberty was not really obtained. Parents applying for a certificate of exemption had to satisfy two magistrates, or one stipendiary, of their conscientious objections. Some stipendiaries, and many of the magistrates, refused to be satisfied, and imposed delays. Unless the exemption was obtained before the child was four months old, it was too late. The consequence was that in the year 1906, only about 40,000 exemptions were obtained in England and Wales. In the year 1907 the Government recognised that the magistrates had practically declined to carry out the law of 1898, and, consequently, a new law—the Vaccination Act, 1907 (''[[7 Edw. VII]]'') was passed. Under this law the parent escaped penalties for the non-vaccination of his child if within four months from the birth he made a statutory declaration that he confidently believed that vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child, and within seven days thereafter delivered, or sent by post, the declaration to the Vaccination Officer of the district.

It is the duty of all Magistrates to sign a Statutory Declaration when asked to do so, and the Magistrate's Clerk is entitled to a fee of 1s. Most of the liberal-minded magistrates will witness the Declaration at their own house, or any other convenient place. Some, however, refuse to do that except in the law court. A Statutory Declaration may also be witnessed by a Commissioner for Oaths, and some other officials.

==Background==
The computer technology that allows development [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[virtual reality|virtual]] environments consists of both [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]. The current popular, technical, and scientific interest in virtual environments is inspired, in large part, by the advent and availability of increasingly powerful and affordable visually oriented, interactive, graphical display systems and techniques lacking only sense and sensibility.

The term "virtualized reality" (VR) was coined and introduced in a paper by Kanade. The traditional virtual reality world is typically constructed using simplistic, artificially created [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) models. VR starts with the real-world scene and virtualizes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanade|first=T.|author2= P.J. Narayanan and P.W. Rander| title=IEEE Workshop on  Representation of Visual Scenes, 1995, Proceedings |chapter=Virtualized Reality: Concepts and Early Results|pages=69–76|doi=10.1109/WVRS.1995.476854|isbn=978-0-8186-7122-7|publisher=Los Alamitos, Calif. : IEEE Computer Society Press, c1995.|year=1995|citeseerx=10.1.1.187.7689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual reality is a practical, affordable technology for the practice of [[clinical medicine]], and modern, high-fidelity virtual reality systems have practical applications in areas ranging from [[psychiatry]] to [[surgical planning]] and [[telemedicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bergeron | first = B. | year = 2003 | title = Virtual reality applications in clinical medicine | journal = Journal of Medical Practice Management | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 211–5 | pmid = 12661483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through VR's capacity to allow the creation and control of dynamic 3-dimensional, ecologically valid stimulus environments within which behavioral response can be recorded and measured, it offers clinical assessment and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] options not available with traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schultheis | first = Maria T. |author2=Albert A.

==Application==
The value of VR systems for the investigation and rehabilitation of cognitive and perceptual impairments and current and potential applications of VR technology address six [[neurorehabilitation]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trepagnier | first = Cheryl C. |date=January 1999 | title = Virtual environments for the investigation and rehabilitation of cognitive and perceptual impairments | journal = NeuroRehabilitation | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 | url = http://iospress.metapress.com/link.asp?id=k3w4811mjpgulujd | accessdate = 2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean researchers developed and assessed the value of a new rehabilitation training system to improve [[Equilibrioception|postural balance control]] by combining virtual reality technology with an unfixed [[bicycle]].

Tracy and Lathan investigated the relationship between [[Motor skill|motor task]]s and participants' [[Spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial abilities]] by training participants within a VR based simulator and then observing their ability to transfer training from the simulator to the real world. The study demonstrated that subjects with lower spatial abilities achieved significant positive transfer from a simulator based training task to a similar real world robotic operation task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Tracey | first = M.

Many cases have applied virtual reality technology to [[telemedicine]] and [[telerehabilitation]] service development. Because telemedicine focuses principally on transmitting medical information, VR has potential to enhance the practice. State of the art of VR-based telemedicine applications is used in remote or augmented surgery as well as in surgical training, both of which are critically dependent on [[eye–hand coordination]]. Recently, however, different researchers have tried to use virtual environments in medical visualization and for assessment and rehabilitation in neuropsychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Riva | first = Giuseppe |author2=Luciano Gamberini  | year = 2000 | title = Virtual reality in telemedicine | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-Health | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 327–40 | doi =10.1089/153056200750040183 | pmid = 11110636 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.3.8473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitold Alfonsovich Polonsky''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Витольд Альфонсович Полонский; 1879 – 5 January 1919) was a [[Russians|Russian]] silent film actor.

==Biography==
Polonsky took drama courses in the Moscow theatre school, graduating in 1907.

He acted in the [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)]] until 1916. He was one of the most popular actors in pre-Revolutionary Russian cinema. His first role was that of Prince Andrey Bolkonsky in the 1915 film Natasha Rostova.
He played several hero-lover roles including Boris in ''The Brothers Boris and Gleb''; Boris in ''Irina Kirsanova''; Evgeny in ''The Song of Tumultuous Love''; Andrey Bargov in ''After Death''; Vladislav Zaritsky in ''Shadows of Sin'' (all 1915); Prince Baratynsky in ''A Life for a Life'' (1916); Lanin in ''By The Fireplace'' (1917) and Prince Mirsky in ''Evening Sacrifice''.

Polonsky was married twice. His first wife was the Maly Theatre actress [[Vera Pashennaya|Vera Nikolaevna Pashennaya]] (1887–1962), who became a National Artist of the USSR, a State Laureate and Lenin Prize winner. They had one daughter, Irina Polonskaya.&lt;ref name="kino-teatr.ru"&gt;http://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/m/sov/3421/bio/&lt;/ref&gt;

His second wife was Maly Theatre actress Olga Gladkova. They had one daughter, Veronika Polonskaya, who also became an actress.&lt;ref name="kino-teatr.ru"/&gt;

In the summer of 1918, the film director [[Pyotr Chardynin]] and the Moscow cinema entrepreneur Dmitry Kharitonov requested the State Commissar for Education, [[Lunacharsky]], to aid a group of cinema workers to travel to Odessa to film. They received a permit, and the group travelled to Odessa. Polonsky was part of the group along with [[Vera Kholodnaya]] and [[Ivan Mozzukhin]]. In November 1918, however, Odessa was occupied by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] forces.  A few months later, in January 1919, Polonsky died from [[food poisoning]].&lt;ref name="kino-teatr.ru"/&gt;

'''Water resources management (WRM)''' functions in [[Argentina]] are handled by multiple institutions operating at the national, provincial, and river basin level, with a variety of functions and jurisdictions. On the national level, the ''National Institute for Water and the Environment (INA)'' and the ''National Water and Sanitation Utility (AySA)'' are charged with the duties of researching, water resources preservation, developing services, and implementing water projects.

Connectivity to water in urban settings is quite good in Argentina, but rural communities lag far behind that of less developed nations. This problem is made worse by one of the highest levels of per capita usage in the world at around 500 L/day.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt; Large rivers and [[aquifers]] represent the main source of drinking water supplies and they are facing serious water pollution problems from industrial effluents, [[urbanization]], and harmful agriculture practices.

Many other challenges persist throughout the country and most are regionally focused with varying degrees because Argentina is divided into many different climatic regions. Some of the critical issues are identified as an inadequate regulatory and institutional framework, inter-sectoral conflict, limited capacity in water management at the central and provincial levels, and high risk for flooding in urban and rural areas.

==Water management history and recent developments==
Towards the end of the 19th Century and throughout most of the 20th Century, the Argentinean Government was the primary investor in the country’s hydraulic infrastructure development.  Primarily focused on developing irrigation infrastructure, the first irrigation development project started in 1909 and continued throughout the 20th Century. Beginning in the early 1990s, Argentina began reforming many of its public sectors with a move to privatization of urban water services in the city of Buenos Aires. Subsequently, all the larger cities and numerous intermediate sized populations also began to incorporate private operators to improve operational efficiency and increase return on investments. This moderately recent Argentine model for management of the water supply sector still needs adjustments in the optimization of the state's regulatory function, incentive schemes, and the expansion of coverage. Even so, significant benefits have been obtained in terms of the quality of water, services rendered, a substantial increase with investments into the water sector, and improvements in the population's quality of life.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt;

==Water management challenges==
Significant water resources management challenges were identified by the water community of Argentina during the Second National Water Resources Meeting held in Buenos Aires (May 18–20, 2004) and are listed here: (i) incomplete/outdated legal and regulatory framework; (ii) limited capacity in water management at the central and provincial levels coupled with outdated procedures for water resources planning; (iii) lack of an integrated national water resources information system and deficient water resources monitoring network; (iv) serious water pollution problems (surface and groundwater); (v) high risk for flooding in urban and rural areas; (vi) lack of appropriate incentives for conservation and efficient use of the resource base and for reducing pollution.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Some of these challenges are addressed in more detail below.

===Water Quality===
Water pollution from industrial effluents is a considerable challenge and the risk of continued contamination is very likely. The Government of Argentina (GoA) has a particular focus on the Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin in Buenos Aires where at least 50 industries are discharging ~95% of the total load of contaminants into the Parana river.&lt;ref name="Matanza"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/0,,menuPK:115635~pagePK:64020917~piPK:64021009~theSitePK:40941,00.html

|publisher=World Bank
|year=2008
|pages=
|accessdate= 12-14-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution and overuse of the aquifer in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] have become a problem where agriculture and industrial runoff and mismanagement of irrigation water has deteriorated the first levels of the aquifer. This has led to over pumping and exploitation of deeper wells that reach the second and third layers of water. Older wells have been abandoned without being properly sealed posing a risk of '''vertical filtration''' (e.g. contaminated water from higher levels filters down to lower levels) into deeper water tables where farmers are pumping from. Abandoned wells also result in fields becoming stagnant and barren creating an economic loss for the region.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt;

Problems with water quality in lakes and reservoirs in Argentina have increased due to agricultural activities, [[deforestation]], logging, animal production, mining activities, urban run-off, and the discharge of untreated sewage. As a result of these activities, many lakes and reservoirs are receiving high quantities of nutrients and are suffering from [[eutrophication]]. The increasing occurrence of algal blooms is the evidence of this growing occurrence. [[Algal blooms]] occur especially in reservoirs and ponds, and are spread over at least twelve provinces of Argentina. Specifically, fifteen aquatic environments were identified at high risk of poisoning by eutrophication.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= 01-22-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water pollution typically occurs due to the discharge of effluent into water systems, improper landfill techniques, flooding of urban areas resulting in pollution from urban run-off, and agricultural practices. For example, the cities [[La Rioja, Argentina|La Rioja]] and [[San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca|Catamarca]] have constraints on expansion of freshwater supplies forcing the residents to use only water they have available even if it is contaminated.&lt;ref name="Connier"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina: A State-of-the-Environment Report |url=http://clt.astate.edu/electronicjournal/Articles/argentina_submitted.pdf |author=Connior, M.B. |publisher=Department of Biological Sciences-Arkansas State University |year=2007 |pages=32–34 |format= |accessdate=2010-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613193113/http://clt.astate.edu/electronicjournal/Articles/argentina_submitted.pdf |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of piped water and sewage can exacerbate the water pollution problem through excessive contamination from excrements. For example, communities having 5,000-10,000 residents and urban centers with 200,000-500,000 residents have 90% and 60% of those respective residents that lack connection to sewers.&lt;ref name="Connier"/&gt;

===Lack of good management===
Mismanagement of water in the Puelches [[aquifer]] of Buenos Aires is a real problem. During the 1980s, this aquifer was [[over-exploited]] resulting in saline intrusion from the [[Atlantic ocean]] causing the city to use water from the Plata river. Over time, the Puelches aquifer has recharged but is not being used and now the water level of the aquifer is reaching 1 m below the surface in many areas. This inverse phenomenon has resulted in waterlogged basements and storage units, flooded tunnels, the weakening of foundations, and the saturation of household septic tanks.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt; In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], urbanization and the lack of proper treatment facilities around the [[San Roque Lake]], caused an alarming increase in [[cyanobacteria]] and thrihalomethanes have been detected in treatment plants at above-normal levels. This lake is the cities main source of drinking water, and is at continued risk of elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus and further outbreaks.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt;

===Flooding and stormwater===
Flooding is the major natural hazard in Argentina. According to 1998 statistics of Swiss-Re, Argentina ranks 18th in the world in potential flood losses, in excess of US$3 billion in 1998. In Buenos Aires, flooding occurs on average about twice per year. These floods are due to the condition of the drainage network, and strong winds from the southeast, (''sudestadas''), which produce a rise of the Rio de la Plata high above its average.&lt;ref name="Hilda"&gt;{{cite web

|pages= 32–44
|accessdate= 12-14-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional challenges===
Water resources management functions are handled by multiple institutions operating at the national, provincial, and river basin level, with a variety of functions and jurisdictions. This has given rise to inter-sectoral and inter-jurisdictional conflicts (particularly between competing uses such as irrigation, hydropower and environment), poor planning and budget programming, and limited technical capacity and knowledge exchange.

==Water resource base==

===Surface and groundwater resources===
Annual rainfall averages ~600&amp;nbsp;mm which equates to 1,668&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; however, about 83% of this precipitation is lost through [[evapotranspiration]] and [[evaporation]]. Subsequently, internal renewable water resources are reduced to about 276&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Runoff is also significant and is estimated at 814&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year, of which 538&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; comes from contributions originating in basins from Paraguay and Uruguay.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; These statistics are general for the entire country; however, Argentina is a large country encompassing 2.7 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with weather patterns and climates that vary greatly. For example, the eastern edges of the Andes mountains are dry and [[water scarcity]] and droughts are an ongoing issue. In the greater Buenos Aires which is a lowland area, water pollution from industrial effluents, stormwater and flooding, and groundwater management are the major concerns. Down in the sparsely populated Patagonia region where there is ample quantities of high quality water, water resources management has fewer challenges.

'''Major rivers of Argentina''':
Important rivers of Argentina in terms of length and quantity of water conveyed and discharged include the Parana, Uruguay, and the Negro rivers. The two largest rivers, the [[Paraná River]] and the [[Uruguay River]] originate in Brazil. The Uruguay River runs north to south and forms a border with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. The Parana River together with the Uruguay river form the [[Río de la Plata estuary]]. Only a few of the Argentine rivers such as the [[Futaleufú River]] flow to the Pacific, while the majority of rivers originate on eastern slopes of the Andes and run towards the Atlantic ocean. Argentina is home to at least three major [[endorheic basin]]s or closed water drainage basins e.g. water does not flow to the ocean. Both the northwest and southwest pampas basins in the [[Dry Pampas|dry pampas]] areas of Argentina and the '''Meseta Somuncura''' in the [[Patagonia]] region of Argentina are endorheic basins. Notable river basins under this classification include the Desaguadero River basin which has great hydroelectric and irrigation significance. In times of great precipitation, its waters can actually reach the sea. The Desaguadero River basin includes the following tributaries: Jáchal, Mendoza, Tunuyán, Diamante and Atuel.&lt;ref name="Closed Basin"&gt;{{cite web

===Storage capacity===
Total capacity of reservoirs in Argentina is estimated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) at around 186&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Of this quantity, 96% of total capacity is stored behind large dams. Of note, one of the largest reservoirs at approximately 1600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is stored behind the [[Yacyretá]]  dam and is located on the Parana river bordering Paraguay is used primarily for hydroelectric generation in Argentina.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web

==Water resources management by sector==

===Water coverage and usage===
''Excerpts and table below drawn from:'' {{main|Water supply and sanitation in Argentina}}
The water coverage situation in Argentina is generally viewed as unacceptable because per capita income in the country is the highest in Latin America. While Argentina has achieved very high levels of access to an [[improved water source]] in urban areas (98%), access in rural areas remains relatively low for a country of Argentina’s level of development (80% using a broad definition, 45% for house connections) In general, rural citizens receive deficient service compared to poorer countries.

Circumstances are exacerbated by irrational consumption and waste in most of Argentina's systems. Much of the waste is caused in large part by inadequate fees that do not accurately represent the value of water. The most evident indicator of over-consumption and waste is the average municipal use of nearly 500 liters/person/day or about 182 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt; ranking Argentina near the top, along with Costa Rica, of municipal water use in Latin America. Total water use including industrial, agriculture, and municipal is 774 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per person or about 4% of total annual renewable water resources on a per capita basis.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

===Irrigation===
Argentina has a long history with irrigation needs and usage. In 1909, the National Government enacted the National Law of irrigation number 6546 that prompted the creation of a large number of hydraulic works projects and the creation of new irrigation systems throughout Argentina.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Decades later, the introduction of pumping equipment on the national market in the 1950s spurned changes in the irrigation landscape. Advances in irrigation equipment led to an increase in irrigated surface area while ushering in a systematization of farming procedures such as; i) application of water, ii) preparation of land and soil, iii) gained efficiencies, iv) diversification of crops, v) and the introduction of spraying and localized irrigation techniques. This was all mostly due to the higher cost of water and the need to recover investments made by crop production while seeking higher profitability.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web
|title= Argentina: Water Resources Management Policy. Elements for Sustainable Development in the XXI Century

|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of irrigation in Argentina has been discontinuous over recent decades. According to data compiled by the National Directorate of Water Resources in Argentina, estimated total coverage in 1970 was about 1 million ha and only increased to approximately 1.2 million by 1988, and then up again to 2.1 million by 1995. This figure for irrigated surface area in 1995 represented almost 8% of the total cultivated area in the country. Actual potential for irrigated land is much higher at around 6.1 million ha if soil qualities and water resources are taken into account. Around 44% of the potential irrigated land is located in arid regions and 56% in located in more humid areas of the country. Water resources are the limiting factor in scaled development in the irrigation sector in Argentina. It has been estimated that as much as 95 million ha in Argentina have good soil but not enough water.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

===Stormwater drainage===
One of the most important sector-related issues affecting Argentina is the high cost related to the recurring flooding of highly urbanized and important metropolitan areas throughout the country. The magnitude of these flood-incurred costs ranks Argentina 1st in [[Latin America]] and 14th worldwide. Although flooding affects the entire country, flood and drainage concerns are more prevalent in four main geographic regions: i) Buenos Aires and the surrounding municipalities because its high level of [[urbanization]] (12.6 million inhabitants or 42% of total population), its economic importance, and its location on a flat and low-lying area; ii) urban centers within the Parana basin, a subtropical region with high annual rainfalls that often coincide with high river elevations; iii) Andes foothill provinces (Cuyo and Northwestern provinces) with their intense, short-lived rains and rapid snowmelts that produce flashfloods; iv) rainfalls of high intensity over limited area that are responsible for floods in Patagonia and the southern provinces.&lt;ref name="WBII"&gt;{{cite web

===Hydropower===
[[Image:Central vista externa en gris.jpg|thumb|280px|The Yacyretá Hydroelectric facility on the [[Parana River]].]]
Theoretically, hydroelectricity potential in Argentina has been estimated at 169,000 GWh per year while the feasible potential is closer to 130,000 GWh per year. Total installed hydro capacity is around 10,000 MW across 35 locations throughout the country. The average annual power generation in Argentina is 32,000 GWh per year representing about 25% of the feasible potential. Large bi-national hydro projects such as the [[Yacyretá]] and the [[Salto Grande Dam|Salto Grande]] substantially increase Argentina's total power generation.&lt;ref name="Devoto"/&gt;

During the early 1990s, Argentina began a thorough reform of its public sector, which included the restructuring and privatization of the electricity sector. Hydropower plants were no exception as the primary hydroelectric plants were grouped into “business units”. These units are national concessions with one to three power plants in each group. Notable exceptions to the privatization scheme because they are bi-national are again the Yacyretá and the Salto Grande power plants.&lt;ref name="Devoto"/&gt; Additionally, there were at least six hydroelectric power plants as of 2005 in the planning stages with a total power generation capacity of approximately 10,000 GHw per year.&lt;ref name="Devoto"/&gt;

==Legal and institutional framework==
[[File:Argentina-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|350px|A map of Argentina]]

===Legal framework===
Argentina’s federal structure is based on the duties assigned in article 121 of the National Constitution. According to article 121, the provinces hold power not already delegated to the Federal Government by this Constitution. The 1994 constitutional reform added article 124 of the charter and expressly stated that “provinces have original ownership of natural resources existing in their territory.”&lt;ref name="Abel"&gt;{{cite web

|format=
|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national Congress has the authority, through the Civil Code, to establish the following essential principles regarding the legal condition of waters: i) public ownership of surface and ground water as stated in Article 2340); and ii) the principle of special concession for water use as stated in articles 2341, 2342, and 2642. In addition to the Civil Code, Argentine Water Law includes commercial law, mining codes, federal laws on energy, navigation, transportation, ports system, jurisdiction over Argentine waters, Interprovincial Commerce, and toxic waste regulation. All of these regulations directly or indirectly contain provisions regarding water resources.&lt;ref name="Abel"/&gt;

The Electricity Regulatory Framework Law (N°24,065/92) created the '''National Electricity Regulatory Commission (ENRE)''' as an independent body that works within the scope of the Secretariat of State for Energy. ENRE was commissioned through Decree 570 in 1996 by the Secretariat of State for Energy to administer hydroelectric concession contracts.&lt;ref name="Devoto"&gt;{{cite web

===Institutional framework===
Various actions and measures have been developed in the country to institutionalize policy preparation and water resources administration at the national level. One of these was the creation in 1991 of the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment, whose name later changed in 1996 to the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development, overseen by the office of the President. The Under-Secretariat of Water Resources oversees the National Bureau of Water Policy, which is in charge of planning and executing national water policy, supervising compliance and coordinating plans, programs and projects related to water resources, and the National Bureau of Water Resources Administration, which is essentially responsible for proposing and executing policies, programs and projects related to public water works.&lt;ref name="Abel"/&gt;

==International agreements==
'''With Chile''' In 1991, an environmental treaty between Chile and Argentina was signed and within the treaty there is a "Protocolo de acuerdo" or framework agreement regarding shared water resources between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Parlamento"&gt;{{cite web

This agreement, while it has not yet become effective is still considered by the [[FAO]] to be a global framework on negotiating this kind of agreement.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In May 2009, representatives from Argentina and Chile met to formalize a request to their respective Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The request asks that the objectives of the 1991 protocol of shared water resources be complied with.&lt;ref name="Parlamento"/&gt; Objectives in Article I of the protocol state, "the parties shall agree that the actions and programs concerning the use of shared water resources be undertaken under the concept of integrated management of the watersheds."&lt;ref name="Parlamento"/&gt;

'''[[La Plata Basin|La Plata River Basin]]''' is shared by Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay have a framework for the sustainable management of Its water resources with respect to the hydrological effects of climatic variability and change. The "FREPLATA" project implemented between the countries aims to ensure the sustainable management of the exceptional biota of the la Plata River and its waterfronts with Argentina and Uruguay.  Another component of this is the Guaraní aquifer system project which promotes the protection of one of the largest semi-confined aquifers in the world that is shared amongst Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.&lt;ref name="OAS"&gt;{{cite web

'''The [[Guarani aquifer]]''' is shared also between Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay and constitutes one of the largest reservoirs of groundwater in the world. Current water storage is approximately 37.000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the aquifer has a natural recharge of 166&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year. The Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development
of the Guarani Aquifer System Project was developed to support the four countries to elaborate and implement a shared institutional, legal and technical framework to preserve and manage the Guarani Aquifer and was executed between 2003 and 2007.  Total project cost is US $26.7 million. The General Secretariat executed the project components in coordination with the four national agencies charged with executing the components. External support was provided by the [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), the World Bank (WB), the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the Netherlands and German Governments and the International Atomic Energy Agency.&lt;ref name="OAS Two"&gt;{{cite web

The World Bank's '''Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Project''' will help reduce the vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of structural and non-structural measures. The project consists of the following components: Component 1) aims at providing provincial institutions with flood risk management instruments that can assist with the implementation of specific institutional development activities. Component 2) will provide housing in safe areas for those families that may be resettled from the lands required for the works and for lower income families living in flood prone areas in their immediate proximity. Component 3) will finance works to protect important urban areas against flood effects. It will contain minor rehabilitation of existing schemes and would include fortification of flood defenses in geographic areas with strong economic activity and the greatest vulnerability to serious repeated flood damage. Component 4) Technical assistance would be provided for US$2.39 million (or 3.4 percent of project loan) to help implement the project.&lt;ref name="WB Urban Flood"&gt;{{cite web

'''The Inter-American Development Bank:''' In the mid-1990s, the government completed a comprehensive MR '''Environmental Management Plan (EMP)''' and received a US$250 million [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) loan to help finance implementation of the EMP objectives. Twelve years after the beginning of the project, the IDB only disbursed US$10 million, and is only now committing another US$90 million for urgent clean-up activities (the remaining balance having been long ago reallocated). The Government of Argentina (GoA) concluded that the lack of an adequate institutional and legal framework to coordinate the involvement of different government jurisdictions has been a major obstacle to implementing the EMP.&lt;ref name="Matanza"/&gt;

==Ramsar sites in Argentina==
There are many wetlands of Argentina that provide a range of functions. Wetlands are key areas for drinking water, sanitation, agriculture and food,  absorbing large water flows after heavy rainfall and glacial melt, and for providing water in periods of droughts. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands came into force in Argentina on September 4, 1992. and there 19 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance, with total surface area of 5,318,376 hectares (13 million acres).&lt;ref name="Ramsar"&gt;{{cite web

==Potential climate change impacts==
According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] Fourth Assessment report from 2007, Argentina will be impacted by climate change with differing affects depending on the region of Argentina in question. A declining trend in precipitation may be observed in south-west Argentina while expected increases in sea-level rise (SLR), extreme weather and climatic variability are very likely to affect coastal areas of the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. Stress on water availability and quality has been documented where lower precipitation and/or higher temperatures occur. For example, droughts related to [[La Niña]] create severe restrictions for water supply and irrigation demands in central western Argentina. Additionally, glaciers in Latin America have receded dramatically in the past decades, and many of them have disappeared completely. IPCC predicts this trend to continue and perhaps even worsen. The most affected sub-regions are the Peruvian Andes, southern Chile and Argentina up to latitude 25°S.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{cite web
