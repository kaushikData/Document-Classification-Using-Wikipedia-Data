{{Campaignbox Northern Ireland Troubles|state=collapsed}}

During 12–17 August 1969, intense political and [[sectarianism|sectarian]] rioting took place in [[Northern Ireland]]. There had been sporadic violence throughout the year arising out of the [[Northern Ireland civil-rights movement (1960s)|civil rights]] campaign, which was demanding an end to discrimination against [[Irish Catholic]]s. Civil rights marches were repeatedly attacked by both [[Ulster Protestant]] [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] and by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), a unionist and largely Protestant police force.

The disorder led to the [[Battle of the Bogside]] in Derry, a three-day riot in the [[Bogside]] district between the RUC and the nationalist/Catholic residents. In support of the Bogsiders, nationalists and Catholics launched protests elsewhere in Northern Ireland. Some of these led to attacks by loyalists working alongside the police. The most bloody rioting was in Belfast, where seven people were killed and hundreds more wounded. Scores of houses, most of them owned by Catholics, as well as businesses and factories were burned out. In addition, thousands of mostly Catholic families were driven from their homes. In certain areas, the RUC helped the loyalists and failed to protect Catholic areas. Events in Belfast have been viewed by some as a [[pogrom]] against the Catholic and nationalist minority.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Rona M. ''Northern Ireland: Society Under Siege''. Transaction Publishers, 1977. p.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tonge, Jonathan. ''Northern Ireland: Conflict and Change''. 2002. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Timothy. ''The Provisional IRA and the morality of terrorism''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009. p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Army]] was [[Operation Banner|deployed]] to restore order and state control, and [[peace lines]] began to be built to separate the two sides. The events of August 1969 are widely seen as the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as [[the Troubles]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Background==
[[Northern Ireland]] was destabilised throughout 1968 by sporadic rioting arising out of the [[civil disobedience]] campaign of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) and the police and loyalist reaction to it. The Civil Rights campaign was demanding an end to discrimination against [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]] in voting rights, housing and employment. NICRA was opposed by [[Ian Paisley]]'s [[Ulster Constitution Defence Committee]] (UCDC) and other [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] groups.

During the summer of 1969, before the riots broke out, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] (ICJ) published a highly critical report on the [[British government]]'s policy in Northern Ireland. ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that this report "criticised the Northern Ireland Government for [[police brutality]], [[religious discrimination]] [against Catholics] and [[gerrymandering]] in politics".&lt;ref name="rose160"&gt;Rose, Peter. ''How The Troubles Came to Northern Ireland''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. p.160&lt;/ref&gt; The ICJ secretary general said that laws and conditions in Northern Ireland had been cited by the South African government "to justify their own policies of discrimination" (see [[South Africa under apartheid]]).&lt;ref name="rose160"/&gt; ''The Times'' also reported that the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC), Northern Ireland's [[Auxiliary police|reserve police force]], was "regarded as the militant arm of the Protestant [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]".&lt;ref name="rose160"/&gt; The ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' reported that the ICJ had added Northern Ireland to the list of states/jurisdictions "where the protection of human rights is inadequately assured".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events leading up to the August riots===
The first major confrontation between civil rights activists and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) occurred in [[Derry]] on 5 October 1968, when a NICRA march was [[Club (weapon)|baton]]-charged by the RUC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/derry/chron.htm|title=The Derry March – Chronology of Events Surrounding the March|last=Melaugh|first=Martin|work=Conflict Archive on the INternet|publisher=University of Ulster|accessdate=11 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091005015113/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/derry/chron.htm| archivedate= 5 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disturbed by the prospect of major violence, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, [[Terence O'Neill]], promised reforms in return for a "truce", whereby no further demonstrations would be held.

In spite of these promises, in January 1969 [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]], a radical left-wing group, staged an anti-government march from Belfast to Derry. [[Ulster loyalist]]s, including off-duty policemen, attacked the marchers a number of times, most determinedly at [[Burntollet Bridge incident|Burntollet Bridge]] (about five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) outside Londonderry). The RUC were present but did not protect the marchers. This action, and the RUC's subsequent entry into the [[Bogside]], led to serious rioting in Derry.&lt;ref name="chron69"&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm Chronology of the conflict: 1969]. ''[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 1969, there were six bomb attacks on electricity and water infrastructure targets, causing blackouts and water shortages. At first the attacks were blamed on the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), but it later emerged that members of the loyalist [[Ulster Protestant Volunteers]] (UPV) and [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) had carried out the bombings in an attempt to implicate the IRA, destabilise the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Government]] and halt the reforms promised by Terence O'Neill.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt;

There was some movement on reform in Northern Ireland in the first half of 1969. On 23 April UUP Stormont MPs voted by 28 to 22 to introduce universal adult suffrage in local government elections in Northern Ireland at their parliamentary party meeting. The call for "[[one man, one vote]]" had been one of the key demands of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt; Five days later, Terence O'Neill resigned as UUP leader and Northern Ireland Prime Minister and was replaced in both roles by [[James Chichester-Clark]]. Chichester-Clark, despite having resigned in protest over the introduction of universal suffrage in local government, announced that he would continue the reforms begun by O'Neill.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt;

Street violence, however, continued to escalate. On 19 April there was serious rioting in the Bogside area of Derry following clashes between NICRA marchers against loyalists and the RUC. A Catholic, Samuel Devenny, was severely beaten by the RUC and later died of his injuries.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sutton69"&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1969.html Sutton Index of Deaths: 1969]. ''[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July, during the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]'s [[The Twelfth|Twelfth of July]] marches, there was serious rioting in Derry, Belfast and Dungiven, causing many families in Belfast to flee from their homes.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt; Another Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), died one day after being hit on the head with batons by RUC officers during disturbances in Dungiven.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt;

==Battle of the Bogside==
{{main|Battle of the Bogside}}

Sporadic violence took place throughout the rest of the year between Catholic nationalists, Protestant loyalists and the RUC, and intensified over the summer, during the [[Orange Order]]'s marching season. On 2 August, there was serious rioting in Belfast, when Protestant crowds from the [[Crumlin Road]] area tried to storm the Catholic Unity Flats. They were held back with difficulty by the police.

This unrest culminated in a pitched battle in Derry from 12–15 August. The [[Battle of the Bogside]] began when violence broke out around a loyalist [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] parade on 12 August. The RUC, in trying to disperse the nationalist crowd, drove them back into the nationalist [[Bogside]] area and then tried to enter the area themselves. The Bogside's inhabitants mobilised en masse to prevent them entering the area and a huge riot ensued between hundreds of RUC personnel and thousands of Bogsiders. On the second day of this confrontation, 13 August, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association appealed for demonstrations across Northern Ireland in support of the Bogside, in an effort to draw off police resources from the conflict there. When nationalists elsewhere in Northern Ireland carried out these demonstrations, severe inter-communal violence erupted between Catholics, Protestants and the police.

==Rioting in Belfast==
[[File:Belfast mural 3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A mural in Belfast commemorating the 1969 riots]]
Belfast saw by far the most intense violence of the August 1969 riots. Unlike Derry, where Catholic nationalists were a majority, in Belfast they were a minority and were also geographically divided and surrounded by Protestants and loyalists.&lt;ref name="nusight"&gt;[http://politico.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6316%3Athe-north-in-crisis&amp;catid=234%3Anusight-politics&amp;Itemid=761&amp;limitstart=4 "The North in Crisis: The Belfast Massacre"]. Politico.ie – ''Nusight'' archives. Originally published in ''Nusight'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, whereas in Derry the fighting was largely between nationalists and the RUC, in Belfast it also involved fighting between Catholics and Protestants, including exchanges of gunfire and widespread burning of homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon McCann, War and an Irish Town, p118&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 12 August, bands of Apprentice Boys arrived back in Belfast after taking part in the Derry march. They were met by Protestant pipe bands and a large crowd of supporters. They then marched to the Shankill Road waving Union Flags and singing "[[The Sash|The Sash My Father Wore]]" (a popular loyalist ballad).&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt;

According to journalists Patrick Bishop and Eamonn Mallie, "Both communities were in the grip of a mounting paranoia about the other's intentions. Catholics were convinced that they were about to become victims of a Protestant pogrom; Protestants that they were on the eve of an IRA insurrection".&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, The Provisional IRA, p103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wednesday 13 August===
The first disturbances in Northern Ireland's capital took place on the night of 13 August. Derry activists [[Eamonn McCann]] and Sean Keenan contacted Frank Gogarty of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to organise demonstrations in Belfast to draw off police from Derry.&lt;ref&gt;Mallie, Bishop, Provisional IRA, p103&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, Belfast IRA leader [[Billy McMillen]] ordered republicans to organise demonstrations, "in support of Derry".&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar, The Lost Revolution p126&lt;/ref&gt;

In protest at the RUC's actions in Derry, a group of 500 nationalists, including republicans, assembled at Divis flats and staged a rally outside [[Springfield Road, Belfast|Springfield Road]] RUC station, where they handed in a petition.&lt;ref name="swan281"&gt;Swan, Sean. ''Official Irish Republicanism, 1962 to 1972''. Lulu, 2008. p.281.&lt;/ref&gt;

After handing in the petition, the crowd of now 1,000–2,000 people, including IRA members such as [[Joe McCann]],&lt;ref name="Hanley, Millar, p126"&gt;Hanley, Millar, p126&lt;/ref&gt; began a protest march along the [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]] and Divis Street to the Hastings Street RUC base.&lt;ref name="swan281"/&gt; When they arrived, about 50 youths broke away from the march and attacked the RUC base with stones and [[petrol bomb]]s.&lt;ref name="swan281"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geraghty21"&gt;Geraghty, Tony. ''The Irish War: The hidden conflict between the IRA and British Intelligence''. JHU Press, 2000. p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The RUC responded by sending out riot police&lt;ref name="swan281"/&gt; and by driving [[Shorland armoured car]]s at the crowd.&lt;ref name="geraghty21"/&gt; Protesters pushed burning cars onto the road to stop the RUC from entering the nationalist area.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt;

At Leeson Street, roughly halfway between the clashes at Springfield and Hastings Street RUC bases, an RUC [[Humber armoured car]] was attacked with a hand grenade and rifle fire.&lt;ref name="geraghty21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; At the time, it was not known who had launched the attack, but it has since emerged that it was IRA members, acting under the orders of Billy McMillen. McMillen also authorised members of the Fianna (IRA youth wing) to petrol bomb the Springfield Road RUC base.&lt;ref name="Hanley, Millar, p126"/&gt; Shots were exchanged there between the IRA and RUC.&lt;ref name="geraghty21"/&gt;

In addition to the attacks on the RUC, the car dealership of Protestant Isaac Agnew, on the Falls Road, was destroyed. The nationalist crowd also burnt a Catholic-owned pub and betting shop.&lt;ref&gt;Both reference to Agnew's and the Catholic owned business from; Patrick Bishop, Eamonn Mallie, The Provisional IRA, page 106&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, loyalist crowds gathered on the [[Shankill Road]] but did not join in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar p126&lt;/ref&gt;

That night, barricades went up at the [[interface area]]s between Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods.

===Thursday 14 August and early hours of Friday 15 August===
On 14 August, many Catholics and Protestants living on the edge of their ghettos fled their homes for safety.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt;

The loyalists viewed the nationalist attacks of Wednesday night as an organised attempt by the IRA "to undermine the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom".&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

The IRA, contrary to loyalist belief, was responding to events rather than orchestrating them. Billy McMillen called up all available IRA members for "defensive duties" and sent parties out to Cupar Street, Divis Street and St Comgall's School on Dover Street. They amounted to 30 IRA volunteers, 12 women, 40 youths from the Fianna and 15–20 girls. Their arms consisted of one [[Thompson submachine gun]], one [[Sten submachine gun]], one [[Lee–Enfield rifle]] and six handguns. A "wee factory" was also set up in Leeson Street to make petrol bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar, p127&lt;/ref&gt; Their orders at the outset were to, "disperse people trying to burn houses, but under no circumstances to take life".&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p108&lt;/ref&gt;

====Falls–Shankill interface near Divis Tower====
That evening, a nationalist crowd marched to Hastings Street RUC station, which they began to attack with stones for a second night.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalist crowds (wielding petrol bombs, bricks, stones, sharpened poles and protective dustbin lids) gathered at neighbouring Dover and Percy Streets.&lt;ref name="hastings38"&gt;Hastings, Max. ''Going to the Wars''. Pan Macmillan, 2001. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; They were confronted by nationalists, who had hastily blocked their streets with barricades. Fighting broke out between the rival factions at about 11:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie p106-107&lt;/ref&gt; The RUC concentrated their efforts on the nationalist rioters, who they scattered with armoured cars.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt; Catholics claimed that USC officers had been seen giving guns to the loyalists,&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt; while journalists reported seeing pike-wielding loyalists standing among the RUC officers.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

From the nearby rooftop of Divis Tower flats, a group of nationalists would spend the rest of the night raining missiles on the RUC below.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt; A chain of people were passing stones and petrol bombs from the ground to the roof.&lt;ref name="hastings39"&gt;Hastings, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Loyalists began pushing into the Falls Road area along Percy Street, Beverly Street and Dover Street. The rioters contained a rowdy gang of loyalist football supporters who had returned from a match.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter (1999). ''Loyalists''. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.68 {{ISBN|0-7475-4519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Dover Street, the loyalist crowd was led by [[Ulster Unionist Party]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] [[John McQuade]].&lt;ref name="Hastings, p.40"&gt;Hastings, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; On Percy Street, a loyalist opened fire with a shotgun,&lt;ref name="hastings38"/&gt; and USC officers helped the loyalists to push back the nationalists.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; As they entered the nationalist ghetto, loyalists began burning Catholic homes and businesses on Percy Street, Beverly Street and Dover Street.

[[File:Divis tower falls road belfast.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Divis Tower]] came under heavy machine-gun fire from the RUC, killing two people]]
[[File:Divis Tower, Belfast, May 2011 (04).JPG|thumb|Memorial plaque to Patrick Rooney and Hugh McCabe]]

At the intersection of Dover and Divis Street, an IRA unit&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p109, Hanley, Millar, p127&lt;/ref&gt; opened fire on the crowd of RUC officers and loyalists, who were trying to enter the Catholic area. Protestant Herbert Roy (26) was killed&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt; and three officers were wounded.&lt;ref name="hastings39"/&gt; At this point, the RUC, believing they were facing an organised IRA uprising, deployed [[Shorland armoured car]]s mounted with [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine gun]]s,&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; whose .30 calibre bullets "tore through walls as if they were cardboard".&lt;ref name="coogan9192"&gt;Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The Troubles''. pp.91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the RUC coming under fire at Divis Street, three Shorland armoured cars were called to the scene. The Shorlands were immediately attacked with gunfire, an explosive device and petrol bombs. The RUC believed that the shots had come from nearby Divis Tower.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p.40"/&gt; Gunners inside the Shorlands returned fire with their heavy machine-guns. At least thirteen Divis Tower flats were hit by high-velocity gunfire. A nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney, was killed by machine-gun fire as he lay in bed in one of the flats. He was the first child to be killed in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;All of the Patrick Rooney incident from; McKittrick, David. ''Lost Lives''. Mainstream, 1999. p.34-36&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 01:00, not long after the shooting of Patrick Rooney, the RUC again opened fire on Divis Tower. The shots killed Hugh McCabe (20), a Catholic soldier who was 'on leave'.&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt; He and another had been on the roof of the Whitehall building (which was part of the Divis complex) and were pulling a wounded man to safety. The RUC claimed he was armed at the time and that gunfire was coming from the roof, but this was denied by many witnesses.&lt;ref name="lostlives38"&gt;McKittrick, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republican Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Belfast Central (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast Central]], [[Paddy Kennedy (politician)|Paddy Kennedy]], who was on the scene, phoned the RUC headquarters and appealed to Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs, [[Robert Porter (politician)|Robert Porter]], for the Shorlands to be withdrawn and the shooting to stop. Porter replied that this was impossible as, "the whole town is in rebellion". Porter told Kennedy that Donegall Street police station was under heavy machine-gun fire. In fact, it was undisturbed throughout the riots.&lt;ref&gt;All of the Kennedy/Porter exchange from, Bishop, Mallie, The Provisional IRA, p111&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the killing of Hugh McCabe, some 200 loyalists attacked Catholic Divis Street and began burning houses there.&lt;ref name="hastings45"&gt;Hastings, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; A unit of six IRA volunteers in St Comgall's School shot at them with a rifle, a thompson machine-gun and some pistols; keeping the attackers back and wounding eight of them.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p 112&lt;/ref&gt; An RUC Shorland then arrived and opened fire on the school.&lt;ref name="hastings45"/&gt; The IRA gunmen returned fire and managed to escape.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

====Falls–Shankill interface near Clonard Monastery====
West of St Comgall's, loyalists broke through the nationalist barricades on Conway Street and burned two-thirds of the houses.  Catholics claimed that the RUC held them back so that the loyalists could burn their homes.&lt;ref name="hastings45"/&gt; The Scarman Report found that RUC officers were on Conway Street when its houses were set alight, but "failed to take effective action".&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; Journalist Max Hastings wrote that loyalists on Conway Street had been begging the RUC to give them their guns.&lt;ref name="hastings45"/&gt;

====Ardoyne====
Rioting in Ardoyne, north of the city centre, began in the evening near Holy Cross Catholic church. Loyalists crossed over to the Catholic/nationalist side of Crumlin Road to attack Brookfield Street, Herbert Street, Butler Street and Hooker Street. These had been hastily blocked by nationalist barricades.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt; Loyalists reportedly threw petrol bombs at Catholics "over the heads of RUC officers",&lt;ref name="lostlives36"&gt;McKittrick, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; as RUC armoured cars were used to smash through the barricades.&lt;ref name="Bishop, Mallie, p113"&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p113&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA had little presence in Ardoyne and its defence was organised by a group of ex-servicemen armed with shotguns.&lt;ref name="Bishop, Mallie, p113"/&gt;

The nationalist gunmen fired the first shots at the RUC, who responded by firing machine-guns down the streets, killing two Catholic civilians (Samuel McLarnon, 27, and Michael Lynch, 28) and wounding ten more.&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lostlives34"&gt;McKittrick, David. ''Lost Lives''. Mainstream, 1999. p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friday 15 August===
The morning of 15 August saw many Catholic families in central Belfast flee to [[Andersonstown]] on the western fringes of the city, to escape the rioting. According to Bishop and Mallie, "Each side's perceptions of the other's intentions had become so warped that the Protestants believed the Catholics were clearing the decks for a further attempt at insurrection in the evening".&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p114&lt;/ref&gt;

At 04:30 on Friday 15 August, the Police Commissioner for Belfast asked for military aid.&lt;ref name="evelegh"&gt;Evelegh, Robin. ''Peace Keeping in a Democratic Society: The Lessons of Northern Ireland''. McGill-Queen's Press, 1978. pp.6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early hours of Friday, the RUC had withdrawn to its bases to defend them. The interface areas were thus left unpoliced for half a day until the British Army arrived.&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; The Deputy Police Commissioner had assumed that the British Army would be deployed by 10:00 or 11:00.&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; At 12:25 that afternoon, the Northern Ireland cabinet finally sent a request for military aid to the [[Home Office]] in London.&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; However, it would be another nine hours until the British Army arrived at the Falls/Shankill interface where it was needed. Many Catholics and nationalists felt that they had been left at the mercy of the loyalists by the forces of the state who were meant to protect them.&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt;

The IRA, which had limited manpower and weaponry at the start of the riots, was also exhausted and low on ammunition. Its Belfast commander, [[Billy McMillen]], and 19 other republicans were arrested by the RUC early on 15 August under the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar, p128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clonard Monastery 121091 shopped.jpg|thumb|There was fierce rioting in streets around Clonard Monastery (pictured), where hundreds of Catholic homes were burned]]

====Falls–Shankill interface near Clonard Monastery====
On 15 August, violence continued along the Falls/Shankill interface. Father PJ Egan of [[Clonard Monastery]] recalled that a large loyalist mob moved down Cupar Street at about 15:00 and was held back by nationalist youths.&lt;ref name="coogan101102"&gt;Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The Troubles''. pp.101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting began at about 15:45.&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; Egan claimed that himself and other priests at Clonard Monastery made at least four calls to the RUC for help, but none came.&lt;ref name="coogan101102"/&gt;

A small IRA party under [[Billy McKee]] was present and had two .22 rifles at their disposal. They exchanged shots with a loyalist sniper who was firing from a house on Cupar Street, but failed to dislodge him, or to halt the burning of Catholic houses in the area.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p116&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of the houses on Bombay Street were burned by the loyalists, and many others were burned on Kashmir Road and Cupar Street – the most extensive destruction of property during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie, p116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

A loyalist sniper shot dead Gerald McAuley (15), a member of the [[Fianna Éireann|Fianna]] (IRA's youth wing),&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt; as he helped people flee their homes on Bombay Street.&lt;ref name="coogan104"&gt;Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The Troubles''. p.104.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 18:30 the British Army's [[The Royal Regiment of Wales]] was deployed on the Falls Road.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; where they were greeted with subdued applause and cheering.&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt; However, despite pleas from locals, they did not move into the streets that were being attacked.&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; At about 21:35 that night, the soldiers finally took up positions at the blazing interface&lt;ref name="evelegh"/&gt; and blocked the streets with barbed-wire barricades. Father PJ Egan recalled that the soldiers called on the loyalists to surrender but they instead began shooting and throwing petrol bombs at the soldiers.&lt;ref name="coogan101102"/&gt; The soldiers could only fire back on the orders of an officer when life was directly threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The loyalists continued shooting and burned more Catholic-owned houses on Bombay Street,&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; but were stopped by soldiers using [[tear gas]].&lt;ref name="nusight"/&gt;

====Ardoyne====
Soldiers were not deployed in Ardoyne, and violence continued there on Friday night. Nationalists hijacked 50 buses from the local bus depot, set them on fire and used them as makeshift barricades to block access to Ardoyne. A Protestant civilian, David Linton (48), was shot dead by nationalist gunmen at the Palmer Street/Crumlin Road junction.&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt; Several Catholic-owned houses were set alight on Brookfield Street.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; The Scarman Report found that an RUC armoured vehicle was nearby when Brookfield Street was set alight, but made no move.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

===Saturday 16 August===
On the evening of 16 August the British Army was deployed on Crumlin Road. Thereafter, the violence died down into what the Scarman report called, "the quiet of exhaustion".&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

In aid of the Bogsiders, the NICRA executive decided to launch protests in towns across Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="scarman"&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/scarman.htm ''Violence and Civil Disturbances  in Northern Ireland in 1969 – Report of Tribunal of Inquiry'']. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scarman Report concluded that the spread of the disturbances "owed much to a deliberate decision by some minority groups to relieve police pressure on the rioters in Londonderry". It included the NICRA among these groups.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

On the evening of 11 August a riot erupted in [[Dungannon]] after a meeting of the NICRA. This was quelled after the RUC baton charged nationalist rioters down Irish Street. There were claims of police brutality.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

On 12 August, protesters attacked the RUC bases in [[Coalisland]], [[Strabane]] and [[Newry]].&lt;ref name="white72"&gt;White, Robert William. ''Provisional Irish Republicans: An oral and interpretive history''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993. p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August there were further riots in Dungannon, Coalisland, [[Dungiven]], [[Armagh]] and [[Newry]].&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; In Coalisland, USC officers opened fire on rioters without orders but were immediately ordered to stop.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

On 14 August riots continued in Dungannon, Armagh and Newry. In Dungannon and Armagh, USC officers again opened fire on rioters. They fired 24 shots on Armagh's Cathedral Road, killing Catholic civilian John Gallagher and wounding two others.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geraghty20"&gt;Geraghty, Tony. ''The Irish War: The hidden conflict between the IRA and British Intelligence''. JHU Press, 2000. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; In Newry, nationalist rioters surrounded the RUC station and attacked it with petrol bombs. In [[Crossmaglen]] on 17 August, the RUC station was attacked with petrol bombs and three hand grenades.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Reactions==
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
*On 13 August, [[Taoiseach]] [[Jack Lynch]] made a television address in which he stated that the [[Irish Defence Forces]] would set up "field hospitals" along the border. He went on to say:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is evident that the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont Government]] is no longer in control of the situation. Indeed the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont Governments. It is clear, also, that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*On 14 August, Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester-Clark stated in the House of Commons:&lt;blockquote&gt;This is not the agitation of a minority seeking by lawful means the assertion of political rights. It is the conspiracy of forces seeking to overthrow a Government democratically elected by a large majority. What the teenage hooligans seek beyond cheap kicks I do not know. But of this I am quite certain – they are being manipulated and encouraged by those who seek to discredit and overthrow this Government".&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*On 23 August [[Primacy of Ireland|Cardinal]] [[William Conway (cardinal)|William Conway]], together with the Bishops of Derry, Clogher, Dromore, Kilmore, and Down &amp; Connor, issued a statement which included the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact is that on Thursday and Friday of last week the Catholic districts of Falls and Ardoyne were invaded by mobs equipped with machine-guns and other firearms. A community which was virtually defenceless was swept by gunfire and streets of Catholic homes were systematically set on fire. We entirely reject the hypothesis that the origin of last week's tragedy was an armed insurrection.&lt;ref name="chron69"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effects==
The rioting petered out by Sunday, 17 August. By the end of the riots:

*8 people had been killed, including&lt;ref name="sutton69"/&gt;
**5 Catholics shot dead by the RUC
**2 Protestants shot dead by nationalist gunmen
**1 [[Fianna Éireann|Fianna]] member shot dead by loyalist gunmen
*750+ people had been injured&lt;ref name="coogan106"&gt;Coogan, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; – 133 (72 Catholics and 61 Protestants) of those injured suffered gunshot wounds&lt;ref name="coogan106"/&gt;
*150+ Catholic homes&lt;ref&gt;White, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; and 275+ businesses had been destroyed – 83% of all buildings destroyed were owned by Catholics&lt;ref name="coogan106"/&gt;

During July, August and September 1969, 1,820+ families had been forced to flee their homes, including&lt;ref name="coogan91"&gt;Coogan, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;
*1,505 Catholic families
*315 Protestant families

Catholics generally fled across [[Irish border|the border]] into the [[Republic of Ireland]], while Protestants generally fled to east Belfast.&lt;ref name="coogan91"/&gt; The Irish Defence Forces set up [[refugee camp]]s in the Republic – at one point the [[Gormanston Camp|Gormanston refugee camp]] held 6,000 refugees from Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="coogan91"/&gt;

===Long-term effects===
[[File:Belfast peaceline Bombay Street.jpg|thumb|250px|The modern "[[peace line]]" at Bombay Street in Belfast, seen from the Irish Catholic/nationalist side. This is the view from the back of a house.]]
The August riots were the most sustained violence that Northern Ireland had seen since the early 1920s. Many Protestants, loyalists and unionists believed the violence showed the true face of the Northern Ireland Catholic civil rights movement – as a front for the IRA and armed insurrection. They had mixed feelings regarding the deployment of British Army troops into Northern Ireland. Eddie Kinner, a resident of Dover Street who would later join the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), vividly recalled the troops marching down his street with fixed bayonets and steel helmets. He and his neighbours had felt at the time as if they were being invaded by their "own army".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics and nationalists, on the other hand, saw the riots (particularly in Belfast) as an assault on their community by loyalists and the forces of the state. The disturbances, taken together with the Battle of the Bogside, are often cited as the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. Violence escalated sharply in Northern Ireland after these events, with the formation of new paramilitary groups on either side, most notably the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] in December of that year. On the loyalist side, the UVF (formed in 1966) were galvanised by the August riots and in 1971, another paramilitary group, the [[Ulster Defence Association]] was founded out of a coalition of loyalist militants who had been active since August 1969. The largest of these were the [[Woodvale Defence Association]], led by [[Charles Harding Smith]], and the [[Shankill Defence Association]], led by [[John McKeague]], which had been responsible for what organisation there was of loyalist violence in the riots of August 1969. While the thousands of British Army troops sent to Northern Ireland were initially seen as a neutral force, they quickly got dragged into the street violence and by 1971 were devoting most of their attention to combatting republican paramilitaries.

===The Irish Republican Army===
The role of the IRA in the riots has long been disputed. At the time, the organisation was blamed by the Northern Ireland authorities for the violence. However, it was very badly prepared to defend nationalist areas of Belfast, having few weapons or fighters on the ground.

The Scarman Inquiry, set up by the British government to investigate the causes of the riots, concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;Undoubtedly there was an IRA influence at work in the DCDA ([[Derry Citizens' Defence Association]]) in Londonderry, in the Ardoyne and Falls Road areas of Belfast, and in Newry. But they did not start the riots, or plan them: indeed, the evidence is that the IRA was taken by surprise and did less than many of their supporters thought they should have done.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In nationalist areas, the IRA was reportedly blamed for having failed to protect areas like Bombay Street and Ardoyne from being burned out. A Catholic priest, Fr Gillespie, reported that in Ardoyne the IRA was being derided in graffiti as "I Ran Away".&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Mallie p118&lt;/ref&gt; However, IRA veterans of the time, who spoke to authors Brian Hanley and Scott Millar disputed this interpretation. One, Sean O'Hare, said, "I never saw it written on a wall. That wasn't the attitude. People fell in behind the IRA, stood behind them 100%. Another, Sean Curry recalled, "some people were a bit angry but most praised the people who did defend the area. They knew that if the men weren't there, the area wouldn't have been defended."&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar 136&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the IRA released a statement on 18 August, saying, it had been, "in action in Belfast and Derry" and "fully equipped units had been sent to the border". It had been, "reluctantly compelled into action by Orange murder gangs" and warned the British Army that if it, "was used to {{sic|supress}} the legitimate demands of the people they will have to take the consequences" and urged the Irish government to send the [[Irish Army]] over the border.&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar, p 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cathal Goulding]], the IRA Chief of Staff, sent small units from Dublin, Cork and Kerry to border counties of Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan, with orders to attack RUC posts in Northern Ireland and draw off pressure from Belfast and Derry. A total of 96 weapons and 12,000 rounds of ammunition were also sent to the North.&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar, p 130, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the poor state of IRA arms and military capability in August 1969 led to a bitter split in the IRA in Belfast. According to Hanley and Millar, "dissensions that pre-dated August [1969] had been given a powerful emotional focus".&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Millar, p 136&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1969, a group of IRA men led by [[Billy McKee]] and [[Joe Cahill]] stated that they would no longer be taking orders from the Dublin leadership of the IRA, or from Billy McMillen (their commander in Belfast) because they had not provided enough weapons or planning to defend nationalist areas. In December 1969, they broke away to form the [[Provisional IRA]] and vowed to defend areas from attack by loyalists and the RUC. The other wing of the IRA became known as the [[Official Irish Republican Army|Official IRA]]. Shortly after its formation, the Provisional IRA launched an [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|offensive campaign]] against the state of Northern Ireland.

===The RUC and USC===
The actions of the RUC in the August 1969 riots are perhaps the most contentious issue arising out of the disturbances. Nationalists argue that the RUC acted in a blatantly biased manner, helping loyalists who were assaulting Catholic neighbourhoods. There were also strong suggestions that police knew when loyalist attacks were to happen and seemed to disappear from some Catholic areas shortly before loyalist mobs attacked.&lt;ref name="coogan106"/&gt; This perception discredited the police in the eyes of many nationalists and later allowed the IRA to effectively take over policing in nationalist areas. In his study, ''From Civil Rights to Armalites'', nationalist author Niall Ó Dochartaigh argues that the actions of the RUC and USC were the key factor in the worsening of the conflict. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;From the outset, the response of the state and its forces of law and order to Catholic mobilisation was an issue capable of arousing far more anger and activism than the issues around which mobilisation had begun. Police behaviour and their interaction with loyalist protesters probably did more to politically mobilise large sections of the Catholic community than did any of the other grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republican-news.org/archive/1999/August19/18bom2.html|title=AN PHOBLACHT/REPUBLICAN NEWS|website=republican-news.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Scarman Inquiry found that the RUC were "seriously at fault" on at least six occasions during the rioting. Specifically, they criticised the RUC's use of Browning heavy machine-guns in built-up areas, their failure to stop Protestants from burning down Catholic homes, and their withdrawal from the streets long before the Army arrived. However, the Scarman Report concluded that, "Undoubtedly mistakes were made and certain individual officers acted wrongly on occasions. But the general case of a partisan force co-operating with Protestant crowds to attack Catholic people is devoid of substance, and we reject it utterly".&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt; The report argued that the RUC were under-strength, poorly led and that their conduct in the riots was explained by their perception that they were dealing with a co-ordinated IRA uprising. They pointed to the RUC's dispersal of loyalist rioters in Belfast on 2–4 August in support of the force's impartiality.

Of the B-Specials (Ulster Special Constabulary or USC), the Scarman Report said:&lt;blockquote&gt;There were grave objections, well understood by those in authority, to the use of the USC in communal disturbances. In 1969 the USC contained no Catholics but was a force drawn from the Protestant section of the community. Totally distrusted by the Catholics, who saw them as the strong arm of the Protestant ascendancy, they could not show themselves in a Catholic area without heightening tension. Moreover they were neither trained nor equipped for riot control duty.&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The report found that the Specials had fired on Catholic demonstrators in Dungiven, Coalisland, Dungannon and Armagh, causing casualties, which, "was a reckless and irresponsible thing to do". It found that USC officers had, on occasion, sided with loyalist mobs. There were reports that USC officers were spotted hiding among loyalist mobs, using coats to hide their uniforms.&lt;ref name="coogan106"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Scarman Report concluded, "there are no grounds for singling out mobilised USC as being guilty of misconduct".&lt;ref name="scarman"/&gt;

'''Algorithmic regulation''' is an alternative form of government where the advantages and usages of computer [[algorithms]] are applied to regulations and law enforcement. Written laws are not replaced but stressed to test its efficiency. It was coined by Tim O'Reilly, Founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media Inc. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes the "rules" aren't really even rules. Gordon Bruce, the former CIO of the city of Honolulu, explained to me that when he entered government from the private sector and tried to make changes, he was told, "That's against the law." His reply was "OK. Show me the law." "Well, it isn't really a law. It's a regulation." "OK. Show me the regulation." "Well, it isn't really a regulation. It's a policy that was put in place by Mr. Somebody twenty years ago." "Great. We can change that!"" 

[...]

Laws should specify goals, rights, outcomes, authorities, and limits. If specified broadly, those laws can stand the test of time.

Regulations, which specify how to execute those laws in much more detail, should be regarded in much the same way that programmers regard their code and algorithms, that is, as a constantly updated toolset to achieve the outcomes specified in the laws.

[...]

It's time for government to enter the age of big data. Algorithmic regulation is an idea whose time has come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/ Open Data and Algorithmic Regulation], Tim O'Reilly - Beyond Transparency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Algorithmic regulation is supposed to be a system of governance where more exact data collected from citizens via their smart devices and computers are used for more efficiency in organizing human life as a collective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tjm.org/2014/02/15/a-brief-exchange-with-tim-oreilly-about-algorithmic-regulation/ A brief exchange with Tim O'Reilly about "algorithmic regulation"], Tim McCormick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/20/rise-of-data-death-of-politics-evgeny-morozov-algorithmic-regulation The rise of data and the death of politics], Evgeny Morozov.

}}The '''Anti PowerPoint Party''' (APPP) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[political party]] dedicated to decreasing professional use of [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] and other [[presentation software]], which the party claims "causes national-economic damage amounting to 2.1 billion [[Swiss franc|CHF]]" and lowers the quality of a presentation in "95 % of the cases".&lt;ref name="cause"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anti-powerpoint-party.com/the-cause/ |title=The Cause |publisher=Anti PowerPoint Party |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party advocates [[flip chart]]s as an alternative to presentation software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20076872-71/swiss-political-party-tries-to-ban-powerpoint/ |title=Swiss political party tries to ban PowerPoint |first=Chris |last=Matyszczyk |work=[[CNET]] |date=July 5, 2011 | accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cherish Life Queensland''' (originally known as '''Queensland Right to Life''') is a non-denominational, non-party political [[pro-life]] organisation founded in [[Brisbane]] in 1970, before the emergence of similar organisations in other Australian states. CLQ is the state affiliate for the Federation of Right to Life Associations. Another pro-life group with a name similar to CLQ's original name, [[Right to Life Australia]] also operates in Queensland, but is not a Federation of RTL groups' affiliate and prefers a direct action approach to opposing abortion and euthanasia.

Cherish Life Queensland Inc/Queensland Right to Life has been funded by donation only since its inception in 1970.  The association was formed by a group of concerned conservative Christian women who saw what was happening in America in regards to the push for the legalisation of abortion and wanted to prevent its legalisation in their state. The Queensland Supreme Court decision ''[[R v Bayliss &amp; Cullen|R v Bayliss]]'' in 1986 ruled that health exceptions to the state's abortion ban were constitutional.

At the General Meeting on 21 June 2008, the members present voted for a change of name from "Queensland Right to Life" to "Cherish Life Queensland", which they believed would more accurately represent their opposition to embryonic stem cell research and to assisted suicide as well as to abortion.

Prior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] of 1560, '''Christmas in Scotland''', then called [[Yule]] (alternative spellings include Yhoill, Yuil, Ȝule and Ȝoull; see [[Yogh]]), was celebrated in a similar fashion to the rest of [[Catholic Europe]]. [[David Calderwood|Calderwood]] recorded that in 1545, a few months before his murder, [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] had "passed over the Christmasse dayes with games and feasting".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} However, the Reformation transformed attitudes to traditional [[Christian feasting days]], including Christmas, and led in practice to the abolition of festival days and other church holidays;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Ross (rector)|date=Autumn 1959|title=Reformation and Repression|journal=[[The Innes Review]]|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|volume=10|pages=338–381|issn=0020-157X|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/inr.1959.10.2.338|accessdate=1 December 2011|doi=10.3366/inr.1959.10.2.338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Christmas in Scotland: Christmas Around the World|publisher=World Book|year=2001|pages=23|isbn=978-0-7166-0860-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland|state]] being closely linked in Scotland during the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern Scotland|Early Modern period]].

A 1640 Act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] abolished the "Yule vacation and all observation thereof in time coming".

The first Act was partly [[repealed]] in 1686,&lt;ref name="RPSrepeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?a=fcf&amp;fn=jamesvii_trans&amp;id=id20103&amp;t=trans|title=Act for the Christmas vacation|work=The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707|publisher=University of St Andrews and National Archives of Scotland|language=|accessdate=4 December 2011|location=St Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Bishops in the Church of Scotland|Episcopalianism]] was briefly in ascendancy within the Kirk.

The second Act was partly repealed in 1712, by the [[Yule Vacance Act 1711]] of the [[Westminster parliament]].&lt;ref name="Cobbett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobbett|first=William|authorlink=William Cobbett|title=Cobbett's parliamentary history of England: from the Norman conquest, in 1066 to the year 1803|publisher=Bagshaw|year=1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clear}}

The 1640 Act stated (in [[Middle Scots]]):&lt;ref name="RPS1" /&gt;

* &lt;blockquote&gt;"... the kirke within this kingdome is now purged of all superstitious observatione of dayes... thairfor the saidis estatis have dischairged and simply dischairges the foirsaid Yule vacance and all observation thairof in tymecomeing, and rescindis and annullis all acts, statutis and warrandis and ordinances whatsoevir granted at any tyme heirtofoir for keiping of the said Yule vacance, with all custome of observatione thairof, and findis and declaires the samene to be extinct, voyd and of no force nor effect in tymecomeing."

[[Robert Jamieson (antiquary)|Robert Jamieson]] recorded the opinion of an English clergyman regarding the post-reformation suppression of Christmas:&lt;ref name="Napier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Napier|first=James|authorlink=James Napier (chemist)|title=Folklore, or, Superstitious beliefs in the west of Scotland within this century: with an appendix, shewing the probable relation of the modern festivals of Christmas, May Day, St. John's Day, and Halloween, to ancient sun and fire worship|publisher=Alex.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ministers of Scotland, in contempt of the holy-day observed by England, cause their wives and servants to spin in open sight of the people upon Yule day, and their affectionate auditors constrain their servants to yoke their plough on Yule day, in contempt of Christ's nativity. Which our Lord has not left unpunished, for their oxen ran wud, and brak their necks and lamed some ploughmen, which is notoriously known in some parts of Scotland."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-war period==
[[File:Clootie dumpling.jpg|thumb|200px|250px|[[Clootie dumpling]]]]
Christmas in Scotland was traditionally observed very quietly, because the [[Church of Scotland]] – a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church – for various reasons never placed much emphasis on the Christmas festival.

Christmas Day only became a [[public holiday]] in 1958, and [[Boxing Day]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="Houston"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houston|first=Rab|author2=Houston, Robert Allan |title=Scotland: a very short introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|series=Very short introductions|volume=197|pages=172|isbn=978-0-19-923079-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP8ahdq40P4C&amp;pg=PT169&amp;lpg=PT169&amp;dq=Christmas+public+holiday+1958+scotland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JCXaDYyP-4&amp;sig=TP4-xkRD_jvMFMifck3Iemk1nYI&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=CBTbTu-aF7P44QT4-dSFDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Christmas%20public%20holiday%201958%20scotland&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Year's Eve festivity, [[Hogmanay]], was by far the largest celebration in Scotland. The gift-giving, public holidays and feasting associated with mid-winter were traditionally held between 11 December and 6 January. However, since the 1980s, the fading of the Church's influence and the increased influences from the rest of the UK and elsewhere, Christmas and its related festivities are now nearly on a par with Hogmanay and "[[New Year's Day|Ne'erday]]". [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and other cities now have traditional German [[Christmas market]] from late November until Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghschristmas.com/event/Events/2794/ "Traditional German Christmas Market"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213034644/http://www.edinburghschristmas.com/event/Events/2794 |date=2011-12-13 }} Edinburgh's Christmas.

The council implemented a policy of equal representation for its participants. It was described by [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[René Viénet]] as "essentially an uninterrupted general assembly, deliberating day and night. No faction or private meetings ever existed outside the common debate." It was formed on the evening of May 17, by supporters of the [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne|Sorbonne Occupation Committee]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Rivkin represented former Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] in a lawsuit by [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], who said he was tortured while in custody; he also helped "craft legal strategy for the State of Texas as it fights federal proposals on health care and environmental regulation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/local/lawyer-representing-texas-in-environment-and-health-suits-1286848.html?printArticle=y]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Rivkin was awarded a [[Burton Awards for Legal Achievement|Burton Award for Legal Achievement]] for a [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] article he wrote with Lee A. Casey in February 2010 titled "Why the 'Don't ask, don't tell' policy is doomed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/12/AR2010021203790.html|title=David B.

==Early life and education==
Rivkin was born in the small village of Psov in the former [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name="dronline1101209"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rivkin |first=David |url=http://www.davidrivkin.com/david-rivkin-biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718192624/http://www.davidrivkin.com:80/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=54 |archive-date=July 18, 2009 |title=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natlrev102904"&gt;Rivkin, David. [http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzQ4ODAxZGFlMzZkMTNlYTM5ZDcwZTMxMTU4MmViMDM=#more "Culture of Life"], 'National Review Online, Oct 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and lived there during the first decade of his life. In 2004, he stated that he knew what it must have been like to live under the rule of [[Saddam Hussein]] in Iraq:

{{quote|I grew up in the Soviet Union, where the individual's interests were always subordinated to the whims of the state, and where the government was the law. Even so, my parents and grandparents endured much worse. They lived in [[Stalinism|Stalin's Russia]], and they knew real fear—not just occasionally, but every day—fear of the state and its agents. Indeed, many people during that era did not sleep well at night, waiting for the knock at the door, announcing that the security police had come to pick them up and cart them off to the [[Gulag]], or be shot.&lt;ref name="natlrev102904" /&gt;}}

After moving to the United States with his family, Rivkin earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]], and a Master of Arts degree in Soviet Affairs with high honors also from Georgetown University. In 1985, he received a Juris Doctor degree from [[Columbia Law School]].

==Public service==
Rivkin held a variety of legal and policy positions throughout the administrations of Republican Presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. He served as Legal Advisor to the Counsel to then President Reagan and as Deputy Director of the Office of Policy Development (OPD) for the [[United States Department of Justice]]. While at OPD, he worked on a wide variety of constitutional, domestic, and international issues, including judicial selection, legal policy, immigration and asylum matters, and intelligence oversight.&lt;ref name=fddcochair /&gt;&lt;ref name="federalistsoc"&gt;[http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/id.37/author.asp "Author bio: David B. Rivkin Jr."], The Federalist Society, 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He also handled the development and implementation of President Bush's de-regulatory initiatives, carried out from 1991 to 1992, which focused on a review of existing federal structures in an attempt to make them more cost-effective.&lt;ref name="bakerlaw" /&gt;

From 1990 to 1991, Rivkin was the Associate General Counsel of the [[United States Department of Energy]]. In this post he was responsible for developing and implementing national and international environmental and energy strategies. He also helped in the passing of the [[Clean Air Act (1990)]] and FERC Order 636, known as the Restructuring Rule, designed to allow more efficient use of the interstate natural gas transmission system by fundamentally changing the way pipeline companies conduct business.&lt;ref name="federalistsoc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngmajorleg/ferc636.html  "FERC Order 636: The Restructuring Rule"], U.S. Energy Information Administration, Official Statistics, 1992, retrieved 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During his term, national energy markets were deregulated.&lt;ref name=fddcochair /&gt;

==Legal career==
After serving as a [[Law clerk#United States|legal clerk]] and associate for several [[law firm]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Rivkin joined [[Hunton &amp; Williams]] and was promoted to partner. There his practice concentrated on international public law and litigation before the [[International Court of Justice]] and on policy advocacy on a wide range of international and domestic issues, including treaty implementation, multilateral and unilateral sanctions, [[corporate law]], environmental policy, and energy issues. Rivkin left the firm in December 1999 to join [[Baker Hostetler]], where he is a partner in the [[Washington, D.C.]] office. Rivkin represented foreign governments and corporate entities on legal, political, economic, military, and public relations matters and has worked on bilateral and multilateral foreign policy issues with Congress and various Executive Branch entities.&lt;ref name="bakerlaw"&gt;[http://www.bakerlaw.com/davidbrivkin/ "Find lawyers: David B. Rivkin"], "Baker Hostetler Law Firm, Counsel to Market Leaders", 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivkin is also a member of the [[District of Columbia Bar]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcbar.org/find_a_member/results.cfm "Find a member, David B.

=== ''Florida v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' ===
{{Main|Florida et al v. United States Department of Health and Human Services}}

Rivkin became lead outside counsel in the lawsuit filed by multiple state attorneys general seeking to nullify the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. The lawsuit was filed on March 23, 2010, hours after the law was signed by President Barack Obama, in United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida in [[Pensacola]]. In a ''Wall Street journal'' article, Rivkin called the law "in its design, the most profoundly unconstitutional statute in American history; in its execution, one of the most incompetent ones".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|last=Stassel|first=Kimberly A.|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704774604576035810749744494 |work=Wall Street Journal
|date=24 December 2010 |title=Congress's Monstrous Legal Legacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2011, [[Roger Vinson|Federal Judge Roger Vinson]] ruled in favor of the 26 state plaintiffs in the case and found the individual mandate unconstitutional. But, unlike the December ruling from a federal judge in Virginia, Vinson ruled that because there was no [[severability]] clause in the original legislation, the entire law must be declared void; "The act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker", he wrote in the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, Kevin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/us/01ruling.html Federal Judge Rules That Health Law Violates Constitution]", ''[[New York Times]]'', 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivkin immediately told media that the ruling meant the 26 states challenging the law must halt implementation of pieces that apply to the state plaintiffs and certain small businesses, since the [[National Federation of Independent Business]]es was also involved in the suit; but the federal government said it would continue to implement the law and appeal the case.&lt;ref&gt;Adamy, Janet, "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB20001424052748703439504576116361022463224 Judge Rejects Health Law]", "Wall Street Journal", 1 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this success, Rivkin's representation sent out a press release claiming to be the victim of a [[denial of service attacks|denial of service]] "cyberattack".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.officialwire.com/pr/breaking-obamacare-plaintiff-attorney-victim-of-cyberattack323351/ ObamaCare Plaintiff Attorney Victim of Cyberattack]", ''OfficialWire'', 14 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s, he addressed the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Iran-Contra Hearings" Law and National Security Intelligence Reports, October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election of [[Bill Clinton]], Rivkin wrote concerning healthcare reform and the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David B, Jr. [http://www.fff.org/freedom/0294f.asp "Health Care Reform vs. the Founders"], The Wall Street Journal, 29 September 1993, reprinted with permission in "Freedom Daily",  February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media and periodicals that have published Rivkin's works include the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[National Review]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Times]]'', the [[Heritage Foundation]], and the ''[[Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/archive/], retrieved 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[War on Terrorism]], which began after September 11, 2001, Rivkin wrote articles on the international law of armed conflict with which the issues of [[jus ad bellum]], also known as the accepted laws of war for which the [[Geneva Convention]] are often associated.&lt;ref name=fddcochair /&gt; Other recent topics include the use of military commissions,&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David B., Jr and Casey, Lee A.

Rivkin and his frequent coauthor, Lee Casey, questioned the constitutionality of government-run healthcare. First raising the issue of privacy,&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David B., Jr., and Casey, Lee A. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124562948992235831?hat_input=is+government+health+care+constitutional  Is Government Health Care Constitutional?], ''Wall Street Journal'' 2009 June 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivkin went on to question the constitutionality of Congressional legislation requiring all U.S. citizens to purchase health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David with Lee A. Casey,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/21/AR2009082103033.html "Illegal Health Reform"], ''The Washington Post'', 22 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David, with Lee A. Casey, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204518504574416623109362480 "Mandatory Insurance is Unconstitutional"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 18 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, Rivkin and Casey raised the issues of federal aggrandizement and judicial aggrandizement as dangers to the vertical separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution, and suggested a limited constitutional convention to limit the incursion of federal and judicial powers into the powers of the states.&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David B., Jr. with Casey, Lee A. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704304504574610120356499810 "The States Can Check Washington's Power"], ''The Wall Street Journal '', 21 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 12, 2011 editorial in the'' Wall Street Journal'', Rivkin addressed the runaway national debt problem by calling on Congress to reclaim its responsibility for issuing new U.S. debt: "Congress should promptly increase the debt ceiling, but with one key caveat: The increase can be used only for borrowing to service existing obligations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703730804576315253099387050?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=David B. | last1=Rivkin Jr | first2=Lee | last2=Casey | title=The Constitution and the Debt-Ceiling Debate | date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law and terrorism==

Rivkin has spoken out frequently against Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] and the Justice Department's handling of terrorist suspects such as [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], arguing that "trying them in federal civilian court is a mistake on many levels" and that "if the 'law of war' architecture is undermined here, U.S. forces and civilian officials will be exposed to criminal liability for their use of force [in other countries]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonexaminer.com/node/144116]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Rivkin wrote in several editorials that, according to the U.S. Constitution, President Barack Obama did not need approval from Congress to launch attacks in [[Libya]], writing that these "essentially punitive operations now underway against Muammar Gaddafi would not have required a declaration of war at the time the Constitution was adopted, and do not require such action today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/263104/libya-no-declaration-war-required-david-b-rivkin-jr|title=In Libya, No Declaration of War Required - National Review|date=25 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs''' (or, as an [[acronym]], '''DEFRA''') is the [[United Kingdom government department|government department]] responsible for [[environmental quality|environmental]] protection, food production and standards, [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and rural communities in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. [[Concordat]]s set out agreed frameworks for co operation, between it and the [[Scottish Government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/concord.htm|title=Concordat between MAFF and the Scottish Executive|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208211146/http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/concord.htm|archivedate=8 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welsh Government]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/walesconc.htm |title=Concordat between MAFF and the Cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223060317/http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/walesconc.htm |archivedate=23 February 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northern Ireland Executive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/fishconc.htm |title=Devolution: Subject specific Concordat between MAFF and the Scottish Executive on fisheries |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120045250/http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/fishconc.htm |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have devolved responsibilities for these matters in their respective nations. 

Defra also leads for Britain at the EU on agricultural, fisheries and environment matters and in other international negotiations on sustainable development and climate change, although a new [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] was created on 3 October 2008 to take over the last responsibility.

==Creation==
It was formed in June 2001, under the leadership of [[Margaret Beckett]], when the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] (MAFF) was merged with part of the [[DETR|Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions]] (DETR) and with a small part of the [[Home Office]]. 

The department was created after the perceived failure of MAFF, to deal adequately with [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|an outbreak]] of [[Foot and Mouth disease]]. The department had about 9,000 core personnel, {{As of|2008|alt=as of January 2008}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/deprep/2007/chapter11.pdf |title=Defra departmental report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627110838/http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/deprep/2007/chapter11.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The department's main building is Nobel House on [[Smith Square]], SW1.

In October 2008, the climate team at Defra was merged with the energy team from the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), to create the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]], then headed by [[Ed Miliband]].&lt;ref name="Marrying energy demand and supply"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7651795.stm|title= Marrying energy demand and supply|last=Harrabin  |first=Roger |date=3 October 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defra's overarching aim is sustainable development, which is defined as "development which enables all people throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life without compromising the quality of life of future generations." The Secretary of State wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister that he saw Defra’s mission as enabling a move toward what the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) has called "one planet living".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/pdf/milibandtopm-letter060711.pdf "My priorities for Defra"], David Miliband's letter to the Prime Minister, 11 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this overarching aim, Defra has five strategic priorities:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/5year-strategy/5year-strategy.pdf "Delivering the Essentials of Life: Defra’s Five Year Strategy"], Annex B&lt;/ref&gt;
* Climate change and energy.

The '''Empire State Pride Agenda''' ('''ESPA''') was a statewide political advocacy organization in [[New York (state)|New York]] that advocated for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) rights, including [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="congress"/&gt;  ESPA has since disbanded after an [[executive order]] was passed by Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] which protects the rights of transgender citizens as long as future governors uphold the law.&lt;ref name="disbanded"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/nyregion/empire-state-pride-agenda-to-disband-citing-fulfillment-of-its-mission.html | title=Empire State Pride Agenda to Disband, Citing Fulfillment of Its Mission | work=The New York Times | date=2015-12-12 | accessdate=2015-01-16 | author=McKinley, Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPA was founded in 1990 through the merger of the New York State Gay and Lesbian Lobby and the Friends and Advocates for Individual Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, Ronald E. and Jack Drescher, Handbook of LGBT Issues in Community Mental Health, Volume 8, Issues 3-4 of Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy, Psychology Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7890-2310-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7890-2310-0}}, pages 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Transitions", page 19, ''The Advocate'', April 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; ESPA was considered the leading gay political organization in the State of New York before it disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Angela Marie and Bay Buchanan, The extreme makeover of Hillary (Rodham) Clinton, Regnery Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59698-507-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59698-507-0}}, page 145-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2005, ESPA was the largest statewide lesbian and gay political advocacy and civil rights organization in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Hernandez, "Growing the Grass Roots", page 35-7, ''The Advocate'', July 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPA played a leading role in the late 1980s and early 1990s, along with groups representing other minorities, in surveying and consulting on a new districting process for the City Council of New York City; according to some, these efforts resulted in the most diverse City Council since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Robert W., Gay Politics, Urban Politics: Identity and Economics in the Urban Setting, Columbia University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-231-09662-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-231-09662-1}}, pages 222-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Dadey served as first executive director from 1991-1997.&lt;ref&gt;"Transitions", page 12, ''The Advocate'', September 30, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPA has been the driving force in negotiating New York City's comprehensive [[domestic partnership]] law, passing a statewide [[hate crime]]s law, repealing a 150-year-old consensual [[sodomy]] statute, and enacting local [[non-discrimination]] laws and policies in Buffalo, Ithaca, Nassau County, and Westchester County.&lt;ref name="congress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mucciaroni, pages 206-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, ESPA outlines legislative, electoral and organizing priorities for the state.&lt;ref&gt;Stryker et al, page 259-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ESPA received press attention when, approaching the end of [[Ross Levi|Ross D. Levi]]'s second year as executive director, it assigned his duties to his deputy Lynn Faria pending a long-term replacement.&lt;ref name="LeviOut"&gt;Celeste Katz, [http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/03/ross-levi-is-done-as-espa-executive-director "Ross Levi Is Done As ESPA Executive Director"], March 6, 2012, ''New York Daily News''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2010PR"&gt;[http://www.prideagenda.org/Press-and-Publications/Press-Releases/Press-Release/c/411.aspx "Press Release: Ross Levi named Executive Director of the Empire State Pride Agenda"], May 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPA was a member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref name="ebar111"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=5426 | title=Political Notebook: Equality Federation welcomes new executive director | work=Bay Area Reporter | date=2011-01-27 | accessdate=January 14, 2014 | author=Bajko, Matthew S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In June 1994, ESPA, along with the New York City chapter of the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], produced a full-page advertisement in ''The New York Times'' to counteract the "[[Christian right|religious right]]" portrayal of us as "a scary specter"; more than 1,000 gay and lesbian New Yorkers [[came out]] about their [[non-heterosexual]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;"Read About It", page 17, ''The Advocate'', July 12, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ESPA joined a network of liberal and progressive groups to counteract the "right-wing" [[Christian Right]]'s "stealth strategy" to getting people elected to local school boards by "hiding their opposition to critical thinking, bilingual programs, multicultural education, and ultimately to public schooling itself".&lt;ref&gt;Anner, pages 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, ESPA joined the [[Freedom to Marry Coalition]] (Marriage Project).&lt;ref&gt;John Gallagher, "The Great Gay Marriage Debate", pages 35-6, ''The Advocate'', February 20, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, ESPA helped educate advocates on how to push for [[hate-crimes]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Savage, "Taking It To The People: Activists Spread Clinton's Hate-Crimes Message to Middle America", pages 33-34, ''The Advocate'', December 9, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, ESPA launched "Pride in the Pulpit," a program to combat the use of religion to advance anti-LGBT amendments and legislation; in 2005, more than 450 non-LGBT religious leaders participated.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Wildman, "Faith-based Equality: What Would Jesus do, Indeed. Hundreds of straight Religious Leaders are Coming Out in Support of Gay Men and Lesbians-Both in Speaking to Their Congregations and Lobbying Lawmakers", ''The Advocate'', pages 37-8, September 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ESPA Co-Chair Jeff Soref was named a part of ''Out'' magazine's "Out 100" for his work with ESPA and his efforts to push for a rule change to provide gays and lesbians more representation at the 2000 convention of the [[Democratic National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to the Out 100", ''Out'', page, 54, January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, ESPA, together with a local [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]], convened the '''Dignity for All Students Coalition''', bringing fifty community groups together to work on anti-bullying and anti-discrimination legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Perrotti, page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPA was a strong advocate for a 2000 hate crimes law that provided enhanced criminal penalties for crimes motivated by hatred on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/07/11/2000-07-11_gov_signs_hate_crimes_law.html] New York Daily News, 7/11/2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 and 2002, ESPA worked to ensure that same-sex partners of [[September 11 attack]] victims received equal [[Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks|financial assistance]], as many same-sex partners of those who perished in the attacks were initially denied any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Mubarak Dahir, "Terrorism Aftermath: Sidelined Survivors? Already Grief-Stricken, Same Sex Partners of Terrorist Attack Victims May Have To Fight For Equal Benefits", ''The Advocate'', page 15, November 6, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crotty, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"September 11: No Respite For Surviving Partners", page 16, ''The Advocate'', April 16, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mubarak Dahir, "September 11: Are All Survivors Equal?", pages 26-9, ''The Advocate'', September 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2002, Governor George Pataki decreed that same-sex partners as well as unmarried partners of survivors would receive benefits equal to married partners, and on a national level, Senator Hillary Clinton called for coverage for those affected by the Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. attacks.&lt;ref&gt;"Equal Grief, Equal Benefits", page 16, ''The Advocate", November 20, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three bills that passed in 2002—each of which was advocated by ESPA—provided various benefits and protections to the surviving same-sex partners of individuals who perished in the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref name="nhftm.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhftm.org/news/Wash_blade_sept_11.htm |title=Washington Blade: Sept. 11 introduced US to gay families |publisher=Nhftm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prideagenda.org"&gt;[http://www.prideagenda.org/AboutUs/Accomplishments/tabid/57/Default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, ESPA executive director [[Matt Foreman (activist)|Matt Foreman]] was recognized by U.S. Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] for his work with ESPA since 1997.&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;U.S. Congressional Record, Proceedings and Debates of the 170th Congress, First Session, Volume 147, Part 17, page 24556, November 29, 2001 to December 10, 2001. United States Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreman served as executive director of ESPA from 1997 to 2003, when he departed to become executive director of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Tkaczyk, "Foreman at the Task Force", page 14, ''The Advocate, May 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, the New York State legislature passed [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] (SONDA) with ESPA being the "major lobbying muscle".&lt;ref name="Swan, page 107"&gt;Swan, page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  SONDA was criticized for not covering transgender individuals, but observers felt that the inclusion of gender identity as a protected category would make it impossible to pass the bill (which had first been introduced in 1971).&lt;ref name="Swan, page 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muscio, pages 257-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sycamore, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004 [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Alan van Capelle|Alan Van Capelle]] was named as the new executive director.&lt;ref&gt;"News of the Year: April", page 24, ''The Advocate'', January 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; SONDA was passed in December 2002, not covering transgender people but "laying the foundation for winning full equality" according to Foreman.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Whittington, "Equal Rights, At Long Last", page 16, ''The Advocate'', February 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, [[Carmen Vázquez]], formerly of LGBT Community Center of NYC, was appointed deputy executive director of ESPA.&lt;ref&gt;"Transitions", page 19, ''The Advocate'', October 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the annual ''Equality at Work'' awards honoring companies and individuals that work to create an "inclusive workspace that respects, welcomes and supports LGBT professionals" were launched.  The 2005 recipients were [[American Express]], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Michael Fishman, president of 32BJ SEIU, and James Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations.&lt;ref&gt;"I Have Pride In My Workplace", page 177, ''The Advocate'', June 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 recipients were [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Kodak]], and Kym Ward Gaffney at [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]].&lt;ref&gt;"Equality at Work Awards", page 11, ''The Advocate'', June 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPA helped pass an August 2004 law guaranteeing same-sex partners hospital visitation rights identical to those enjoyed by spouses and next-of-kin when caring for loved ones in hospitals and other facilities.&lt;ref name="prideagenda.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaycitynews.com/articles/2010/05/01/gay_city_news/news/doc4bc8ebaeb91c6557115339.txt ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, ESPA held its 13th Annual Fall Dinner with keynote speaker San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]]; the Fall Dinner benefited the '''Empire State Pride Agenda Foundation''', which is the non-partisan, 501(c)(3) research, education and advocacy arm of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advocate'', September 28, 2004,  No. 923, page 42, ISSN 0001-8996, Here Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The ESPA Foundation, in partnership with the New York State Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health and Human Services Network, "developed and utilized education, advocacy and community organizing strategies to overcome the barriers of political and cultural opposition, inadequate knowledge about the health care needs of the community, and [[heterocentric]] models of healthcare" to obtain governmental health and wellness funds targeted for LGBT health needs.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort resulted in $10.7 million in state funding for non-[[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] LGBT service needs, including primary care, preventative health needs, crime victim assistance, and support services for the state and for youth, seniors and people of color.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ESPA helped to pass legislation providing same-sex partners the same authority as spouses when making decisions regarding the burial of a deceased partner.&lt;ref name="nhftm.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prideagenda.org"/&gt;

In October 2005, ESPA joined the [[Lambda Legal|Lambda Legal Defense Fund]] and a coalition of anti-censorship groups to oppose a new zoning law that would shut down an estimated 149 adult-oriented bookstores, theaters and clubs including all of the businesses on [[Christopher Street]].&lt;ref&gt;During, page 357-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, same-sex marriage legislation passed the New York State Assembly by a vote of 85-61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spector |first=Joseph |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-05-12-ny-gaymarriage_N.htm |title=N.Y. Assembly passes same-sex marriage legislation |publisher=USA Today |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ESPA has been a leading supporter of same-sex marriage legislation in New York.

In 2008, the ESPA-supported Gender Expression Nondiscrimination Act passed the New York State Assembly for the first time.&lt;ref name="prideagenda.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=075&amp;sh=story&amp;story=27743 |title=New York State Assembly - Member Section |publisher=Assembly.state.ny.us |date=2008-06-03 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2009, ESPA-supported same-sex marriage legislation failed in the New York State Senate by a vote of 24-38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/108803/survey |title=POLITICS - All Boroughs |publisher=NY1 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211022653/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/108803/survey |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2010, a ''[[The New York Times]]'' blog&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/gay-rights-group-to-choose-a-new-leader/#more-173369 "Gay Rights Group to Choose a New Leader"], Jeremy W. Peters, "City Room", ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; reported that ESPA was "poised to select" [[Brian Ellner]] as its next executive director. It was later reported that Ellner's past affiliation with [[Michael Bloomberg]] had been criticized by some ESPA supporters; for whatever reason, he withdrew his name from consideration,&lt;ref name="Ellner-to-HRC"&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/former-bloomberg-aide-to-go-after-opponents-of-gay-marriage/ "Former Bloomberg Aide to Take On Opponents of Gay Marriage"], Michael Barbaro, "City Room", ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and on the 22nd ESPA instead announced appointing Ross D. Levi, an attorney, to the position. Levi had been a legislative assistant at the [[New York State Legislature]] starting in 1997 and part of ESPA's [[Albany, New York|Albany]] staff since before 2000, and since 2006 had held its title as Director of Public Policy &amp; Education.&lt;ref name="NYT-Fires"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/nyregion/new-yorks-marriage-battle-won-gay-rights-group-fires-its-director.html "Gay Rights Group Fires Chief, Central in Marriage Fight"], Kate Taylor, ''The New York Times'', March 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dinner"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWpYaGVGAVc "Ross Levi at Empire State Pride Agenda 2010 Fall Dinner"], video.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, another reporter reported (on the same NYT blog) Ellner's appointment to head the "Campaign for New York Marriage", financed by [[Human Rights Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Ellner-to-HRC"/&gt;

On April 20, 2011, [[New Yorkers United for Marriage]] was instituted as an alliance among ESPA, Marriage Equality New York, the [[Human Rights Campaign]], and [[Freedom to Marry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2011/04/gay-rights-advocates-unite-efforts-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage-in-new-york/ |title=Gay rights advocates unite efforts to legalize same-sex marriage in New York |publisher=LGBTQ Nation |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 6, 2012, report stated&lt;ref name="fires-Levi"&gt;[http://www.gaycitynews.com/articles/2012/03/06/gay_city_news/news/doc4f55a0d18916b866688972.txt "Pride Agenda Board Fires Ross Levi"], Paul  Schindler, March 06, 2012, ''Gay City News''&lt;/ref&gt; that Levi had been "fired" the preceding day. The ''Times'' credited that as the first report, and suggested that ESPA board members felt Human Rights Campaign's work under Ellner had caught attention to the detriment of ESPA's role.&lt;ref name="NYT-Fires"/&gt;

==Same-Sex Marriage Lobbying==

At the ESPA Fall Dinner held on October 22, 2009, then-Executive Director Alan Van Capelle publicly expressed great frustration that state senators supported by the group—some of whom Van Capelle mentioned by name—had not yet passed legislation on same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chelseanow.com/articles/2009/12/14/gay_city_news/news/doc4afb5d9d38c14698879493.txt%29  |accessdate=2010-12-04 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Gay City News, 12/14.2009&lt;/ref&gt;  At a “couldn’t-be-higher stakes” November 2010 meeting with Governor David Paterson and other elected officials who supported the same-sex marriage bill, Senate Democratic Leader John Sampson and Senator Jeff Klein “did not mince words in letting Van Capelle know they were upset by” his critical comments at the Fall Dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chelseanow.com/articles/2009/12/14/gay_city_news/news/doc4afb5d9d38c14698879493.txt%29 |accessdate=December 4, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPA was regarded as the driving force behind a failed December 2009 Senate vote on same-sex marriage legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/2009/politics/thousand-fathers-marriage-inequality] The Observer&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, Governor [[David Paterson]] was asked what would have to occur in order for same-sex marriage to be legalized in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Paterson responded, "Get rid of the lobbyists," and added that [[same-sex marriage]] lobbyists had “literally forced” a Senate vote prematurely in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/nyregion/02marriage.html] New York Times December 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26041">{{essay-like|date=February 2018}}The '''feminine beauty ideal''' is "the socially constructed notion that physical attractiveness is one of women's most important assets, and something all women should strive to achieve and maintain".&lt;ref&gt;Spade, J. Z., &amp; Valentine, C. G. (2008). The kaleidoscope of gender: Prisms, patterns, and possibilities. Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine beauty ideals are rooted in [[heteronormative]] beliefs, and heavily influence women of all [[sexual orientations]]. The feminine beauty ideal, which also includes [[female body shape]], varies from culture to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to conform to a certain definition of "beautiful" can have drastic psychological effects. These ideals have been correlated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, and low [[self-esteem]], starting from an [[adolescent]] age and continuing into adulthood.

==In fairy tales==
The feminine beauty ideal is portrayed in many children's [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="spade" /&gt; It has been common in the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales for physical attractiveness in female characters to be rewarded.&lt;ref name="bakersperry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker-Sperry | first1 = L. | last2 = Grauerholz | first2 = L. | year = 2003 | title = The pervasiveness and persistence of the feminine beauty ideal in children's fairy tales | url = | journal = Gender &amp; Society | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 711–726 | doi=10.1177/0891243203255605}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those fairy tales, "beauty is often associated with being white, economically privileged, and virtuous."&lt;ref name="bakersperry" /&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales usually involve a beautiful heroine. In the story ''[[Snow White]]'', the protagonist Snow White is described as being "white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood" and "as beautiful as the light of day."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, J. &amp; Grimm, W. (1857). Snow White. Berlin: Children's and Household Tales.&lt;/ref&gt; This fairy tale is defining beauty as being [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] with rosy cheeks and black hair. On the other hand, the [[antagonist]] of Brothers Grimm fairy tales is frequently described as ugly, relating beauty with goodness and ugliness with evil.&lt;ref name="bakersperry" /&gt; Ultimately, this correlation puts an emphasis on the virtue of being beautiful, as defined by fairy tales.

Starting almost 100 years after the Grimm Brothers wrote their fairy tales, the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] adapted these tales into animated feature films. About 40 percent of [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] made from 1937-2000 had "only dominant cultural themes portrayed."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towbin | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Haddock | first2 = S.A. | last3 = Zimmerman | first3 = T.S. | last4 = Lund | first4 = L.K. | last5 = Tanner | first5 = L.R. | year = 2004 | title = Images of gender, race, age, and sexual orientation in Disney feature-length animated films | url = | journal = Journal of Feminist Family Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 19–44 | doi=10.1300/j086v15n04_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the majority of characters are white, "the expectation [is] that all people are or should be like this."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other common traits of female Disney characters are thin bodies with impossible bodily proportions, long, flowing hair, and large round eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unrealistic anatomies of Disney princesses revealed|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/unrealistic-anatomies-disney-princesses-revealed-article-1.1365387|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constant emphasis on female beauty and what constitutes as being beautiful contributes to the overall feminine beauty ideal.

==In mass media==
[[Mass media]] is one of the most powerful tools for young girls and women to learn and also understand feminine beauty ideals. As mass media develops, the way people see feminine beauty ideals changes, as does how females view themselves. "The average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day," says Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University.&lt;ref&gt;Heubeck, Girls and Body Image: Media's Effect, How Parents Can Help. WebMD. Retrieved October 26, 2013, from http://www.webmd.com/beauty/style/helping-girls-with-body-image&lt;/ref&gt; In most advertisements, female models are typically homogeneous in appearance. "Girls today are swamped by [ultra-thin] ideals not only in the form of dolls but also in comics, cartoons, TV, and advertising along with all the associated merchandising."&lt;ref name="Dittmar"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.283| title = Does Barbie make girls want to be thin?

Images of women can be virtually manipulated creating an ideal that is not only rare but also nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Networked bodies and extended corporealities: Theorizing the relationship between the body, embodiment, and contemporary new media.|last = White|first = Michele|date = 2009|journal = Feminist Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopedia of Gender in the Media'' states that "the postproduction techniques of airbrushing and computer-generated modifications 'perfect' the beauty myth by removing any remaining blemishes or imperfections visible to the eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender in Media|last = Kosut|first = Mary|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc. 2012|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, Calif :|pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements for products "such as diets, cosmetics, and exercise gear [help] the media construct a dream world of hopes and high standards that incorporates the glorification of slenderness and weight loss."&lt;ref name="Groesz"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/eat.10005| title = The effect of experimental presentation of thin media images on body satisfaction: A meta-analytic review| journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders| volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16| year = 2002| last1 = Groesz | first1 = L. M.| last2 = Levine | first2 = M. P.| last3 = Murnen | first3 = S. K. | pmid=11835293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a focus on an ideal physical appearance, the feminine beauty ideal distracts from female competency by prioritizing and valuing superficial characteristics related to beauty and appearance. When physical beauty is idealized and featured in the media, it reduces women to sexualized objects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oppressive Beliefs at Play: Associations Among Beauty Ideals and Practices and Individual Differences in Sexism, Objectification of Others, and Media Exposure|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1471-6402|pages = 365–379|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01582.x|first = Viren|last = Swami|first2 = Rebecca|last2 = Coles|first3 = Emma|last3 = Wilson|first4 = Natalie|last4 = Salem|first5 = Karolina|last5 = Wyrozumska|first6 = Adrian|last6 = Furnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the message across mass media that one's body is inadequate apart from sex appeal and connects concepts of beauty and sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Perfection is achieved by celebrities through photoshopped images that hide every blemish or flaw while also editing body parts to create the "ideal" hourglass body type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://girlsempowermentnetwork.org/blog/media-today-unattainable-beauty-standards/|title=Media Today: Unattainable Beauty Standards|last1=Davis|first1=Cameron|website=Girls Empowerment Network|publisher=GENautsin|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dove Beauty and Confidence Report'' interviewed 10,500 females across thirteen countries and found that women's confidence in their body image is steadily declining - regardless of age or geographic location. Despite these findings, there is a strong desire to fight existing beauty ideals. In fact, 71% of women and 67% of girls want the media to do a better job of portraying different types of women. Studies done by [https://www.dove.com/us/en/home.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_ODWBRCTARIsAE2_EvXfV2z63MzYDd9MrsO8AxoJM9mClWpDH2KOzUlazhewmQVCyh8Y7cUaAnPBEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds Dove] reveal low self esteem impacts women and girls' ability to release their true potential. 85% of women and 79% of girls admit they opt out of important life activities when they do not feel confident in the way they look. More than half of women (69%) and girls (65%) allude to pressure from the media and advertisements to become the world's version of beautiful, which is a driving force of appearance anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-dove-research-finds-beauty-pressures-up-and-women-and-girls-calling-for-change-583743391.html|title=New Dove Research Finds Beauty Pressures Up, and Women and Girls Calling for Change|website=CISION PR Newswire|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done by Dove have also revealed the following statistics: "4% of women consider themselves beautiful, 11% of girls globally are comfortable with describing themselves as beautiful, 72% of girls feel pressure to be beautiful, 80% of women agree that every woman has something about her that is beautiful, but do not see their own beauty, and that 54% of women agree that when it comes to how they look, they are their own worst beauty critic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/about-dove/our-research.html|title=Our Research|website=Dove|publisher=Dove|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online space such as [[Instagram]] that is based on interactions through pictures creates a focus on one’s physical appearance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title=‘Strong is the new skinny’: A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=https://doi-org.echo.louisville.edu/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1003–1011|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|issn=1359-1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to evidence gathered from a study focusing on general Instagram use in young women, researchers suggest Instagram usage was positively correlated with women’s [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This same study also considered the effect of Instagram on the internalization of the Western beauty ideal for women, and the evidence gathered in the study agrees with the idea that Instagram use encourages women to internalize the societal beauty ideal of Western culture. Because users have the opportunity to shape and edit their photographs before sharing them, they can force them to adhere to the beauty ideal.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Viewing these carefully selected pictures shows the extent to which women internalize the Western beauty ideal.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In addition to researching the effects of general Instagram use, the study also researched the effects of "fitspiration" Instagram pages on young women's body image. “Fitspiration” pages aim to motivate the viewer through images of healthy eating and exercising.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Although these pages aim to be a positive way to promote a healthy lifestyle, they are also appearance-based and contain images of toned and skinny women.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fardouly|first=Jasmine|last2=Willburger|first2=Brydie K|last3=Vartanian|first3=Lenny R|date=February 2017|title=Instagram use and young women’s body image concerns and self-objectification: Testing mediational pathways|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1461444817694499|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1380–1395|doi=10.1177/1461444817694499|issn=1461-4448|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, there is a positive correlation to young women’s viewing "fitspiration" pages and a negative body image.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A case study conducted about Instagram use and the Western feminine beauty ideal focused on the specific account @effyourbeautystandards, a body-positive Instagram page created by feminist plus-size model Tessa Holliday.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=Sofia P.|last2=De Ridder|first2=Sander|date=2017-10-01|title=Representing diverse femininities on Instagram: A case study of the body-positive @effyourbeautystandards Instagram account|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/cjcs/2017/00000009/00000002/art00010;jsessionid=3d1f41r4fgcp.x-ic-live-01|journal=Catalan Journal of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=321–337|doi=10.1386/cjcs.9.2.321_1|issn=1757-1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her page, Holliday instructed women to share pictures of themselves on Instagram with the hashtag #effyourbeautystandards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Images posted with this hashtag would be selected by the account administrators and posted to the @effyourbeauutystandards page.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The evidence gathered in this case study suggested that while these selected pictures attempt to take an intersectional approach to the content women view on social media, they may still have an effect on how women view their bodies.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Psychological effects==
Feminine beauty ideals have shown correlations to many psychological disorders, including lowered self-esteem and eating disorders. Western cultural standards of beauty and attractiveness promote unhealthy and unattainable body ideals that motivate women to seek perfection.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since 1972, there has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of women in the United States who experience dissatisfaction with their bodies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E. | last2 = Cole | first2 = S. | last3 = Chelberg | first3 = M. B. | last4 = Alicke | first4 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Searching out the ideal: Awareness of ideal body standards predicts lower global self-esteem in women | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1080/15298868.2011.639549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that women's exposure to television, even for a very short time, can experience decreased mood and self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Renzetti, C. M., Curran, D. J., &amp; Maier, S. L. (2012). Women, men, and society (6th ed.). Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been consistently found that perceived appearance is the single strongest predictor of global self-esteem among young adults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Awareness of the ideal female shape is linked to increasingly negative self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through peer interaction and an environment of continual comparison to those portrayed in the media, women are often made to feel inadequate, and thus their self-esteem can decrease from their negative self-image. A negative body image can result in adverse psychosocial consequences, including depression, poor self-esteem, and diminished quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Morrow | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Hrabosky | first3 = J. I. | last4 = Perry | first4 = A. A. | year = 2004 | title = How has body image changed?

There is significant pressure for girls to conform to feminine beauty ideals, and, since thinness is prized as feminine, many women feel dissatisfied with their body shape. Body dissatisfaction has been found to be a precursor to serious psychological problems such as depression, social anxiety, and eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jefferson | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Stake | first2 = J. E. | year = 2009 | title = Appearance self-attitudes of African American and European American women: Media comparisons and internalization of beauty ideals | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 396–409 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine beauty ideal has influenced women, particularly younger women, to partake in extreme measures. Some of these extreme measures include  limiting their food intake, and participating in excessive physical activity to try to achieve what is considered the "ideal beauty standards". One aspect of the feminine beauty ideal includes having a thin waist, which is causing women to participate in these alarming behaviors. When trying to achieve these impossible standards, these dangerous practices are put into place. These practices can eventually lead to the woman developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. As achieving the "beauty ideal" becomes a more popular phenomenon, these eating disorders are becoming more prevalent, especially in young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazur|first=Allen|date=August 1986|title=U.S. Trends in Feminine Beauty and Overadaptation|url=http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/humans_web_04/beauty/feminine.pdf|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume= 22| issue =  3|pages= 281–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that magazine advertisements promoting dieting and thinness are far more prevalent in women's magazine than in men's magazine, and that female television characters are far more likely to be thin than male characters.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, L. A. (1992). Physical appearance and gender: Sociobiological and sociocultural perspectives. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating disorders stem from individual body dysmorphia, or an excessive preoccupation with perceived flaws in appearance.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fitts, M. &amp; O’Brien, J.

== Across cultures ==
There have been many ideas over time and across different cultures of what the feminine beauty "ideal" is for a woman's body image. How well a woman follows these beauty ideals can also influence her social status within her culture. Physically altering the body has been a custom in many areas of the world for a long time. For example, decorating the body with tattoos is a symbol of attractiveness and status in the Japanese culture. The art of irezumi, or covering a woman's back with tattoos, is still practiced today in Japan. In Burma, Padung girls from the age of about five years, have metal rings put around their necks. Additional rings are added to the girl's neck every two years. This practice is done to produce a giraffe like effect in women. This practice is dying out, but these women would eventually carry up to 24 rings around their necks. A neck with many rings was considered the "ideal" image of physical beauty in this culture. In Europe, the corset has been used over time to create a tiny waistline. In Europe, a tiny waistline was considered "ideal" for beauty. A practice in China involved a girl's feet being bound at age six to create the "ideal" image of feet. The girl's feet were bound to become 1/3 the original size, which crippled the woman, but also gave her a very high social status and was much admired. After the revolution of 1911, this practice of foot binding was ended. The idea of what is considered the "ideal" of beauty for women varies across different cultural ideals and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mo3shY_azw0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=evolution+of+the+feminine+beauty+ideal&amp;ots=Xt0gf13znd&amp;sig=mSwxpu4P7OktF5y8op7IC2mA1cE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title="The Feminine Ideal"|last=Thesander|first=Marianne|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=1997|isbn=1861890044|location=London|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple "ideals for women" in France as well as other various cultures. A more common ideal is for females to have the "three white things". These "things" or traits refer to skin, teeth, and hands. There are also the "three black things" including the color of the person's eyebrows and eyelashes. This leaves three other areas to embark on color including the cheeks, lips, and nails.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, L. l. (2016).

==Evolutionary perspectives==

Ideas of feminine beauty may have originated from features that correlate with fertility and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9938-z|title=Shape and Significance of Feminine Beauty: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=9–10|pages=723–731|year=2011|last1=Singh|first1=Devendra|last2=Singh|first2=Dorian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features include a figure where there is more fat distribution in the hip and thigh area, and vary between different cultures. Within Western cultures, having a smaller waist and bigger hips has a large influence. This differs in Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2093974|year=2007|author1=Singh|first1=D|title=Did the perils of abdominal obesity affect depiction of feminine beauty in the sixteenth to eighteenth century British literature?

The '''Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities''' ('''FCNM''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] of the [[Council of Europe]] aimed at protecting the [[minority rights|rights of minorities]].&lt;ref name=P8&gt;{{cite web
  | title = The Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came into effect in 1998 and by 2009 it had been ratified by 39 member states.

==History==
The Council of Europe first discussed according specific protection for national minorities in 1949, but it was not until 1990 that the Council of Europe made a firm commitment to protect these minority groups. Recommendation 1134 (1990) contained a list of principles which the Assembly considered necessary for this purpose. The Parliamentary Assembly did in the beginning call for adoption of a protocol to the [[ECHR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int//Mainf.asp?link=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/TA93/EREC1201.HTM RECOMMENDATION 1201 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework was signed on February 1995 by 22 member States of the [[Council of Europe]] and became active in 1998.&lt;ref name=P8 /&gt; By mid-2005, 43 member states had signed and 39 ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/minorities/etats-partie&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and criticism==
The broad aims of the convention are to ensure that the signatory states respect the rights of national minorities, undertaking to combat discrimination, promote equality, preserve and develop the culture and identity of national minorities, guarantee certain freedoms in relation to access to the media, [[minority language]]s and education and encourage the participation of national minorities in public life. Article 25 of the Framework Convention binds the member states to submit a report to the Council of Europe containing "full information on the legislative and other measures taken to give effect to the principles set out in this framework Convention" (Council of Europe, 1994, 7).

The convention has come under some criticism. First of all, not all member states of the Council of Europe have signed and ratified it. France and Turkey have done neither. Iceland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece have signed and have yet to ratify. Also, the provisions offer little new on already existing international treaties. Furthermore, they are hedged around with many phrases including 'as far as possible' (Art 10.2). The convention does not define "national minority" and several countries set their own definition of the term when they ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name=P8 /&gt; For example, the United Kingdom ratified the convention on the understanding that it would be applied with reference to "racial groups" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070306/text/70306w0015.htm Hansard – Andrew George – March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Since this excluded the [[Cornish people]], this resulted in pressure, including from [[Cornwall Council]], for the UK Government to recognise the Cornish as a national minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, it was announced by the [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], [[Danny Alexander]], that the UK Government would recognise the Cornish as a national minority under the FCNM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cornish people formally declared a national minority along with Scots, Welsh and Irish|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall however, Phillips (2002) has argued that because the FCNM is flexible it has allowed such a great number of states to ratify it so quickly. Therefore, it should not be considered a failure, but a start. Many authors agree with this arguing that it needs to be implemented in 'good faith' with the political will to support commitment to [[minority rights]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2323">The '''Freedom Defence Committee''' was a UK-based organisation set up on 3 March 1945 &lt;ref&gt;''Peace News'', 9 March 1945&lt;/ref&gt; to "uphold the essential liberty of individuals and organisations, and to defend those who are persecuted for exercising their rights to freedom of speech, writing and action."&lt;ref name="In Front of Your Nose"&gt;Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.).

'''Gonzalo Queipo de Llano y Sierra''', 1st Marquis of Queipo de Llano for one year, (5 February 1875 – 9 March 1951) was a Spanish military leader who rose to prominence during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[coup d'état]] and the subsequent [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[White Terror (Spain)|Spanish White Terror]].

==Biography==
A career Army man, de Llano was a [[brigadier general]] in 1923 when he began to speak out against the army and [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. Demoted, he served three years in prison but refused to stop criticizing even on his release, as a result of which he was dismissed altogether in 1928. In 1930, he became a revolutionary but on a failed attempt to overthrow King [[Alfonso XIII]], he fled to Portugal. He returned to his native land in 1931 after the departure of Alfonso XIII and assumed command of the 1st Military District of the [[Spanish Republican Army]]. He was later appointed by [[Niceto Alcalá Zamora]] to the Chief of the military staff of the President (Queipo's daughter was married to a son of Alcalá Zamora). Even as he rose in prominence, he remained critical of the shifting governments, joining in on a plot to overthrow the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] government in May, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War, 1931–1939''. Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1967. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Spanish Civil War, de Llano secured the capture of [[Seville]] with a force of at least 4,000 troops. There, he ordered mass killings.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution and Revenge''. Harper Perennial. London. 2006. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. 2012. ''The Spanish Holocaust''. Harper Press. London. p. 330–331.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was appointed the commander of the Nationalist Army of the South. His influence began to decline in February 1938, when [[Francisco Franco]] named himself Sole Head of the New State and appointed his brother-in-law [[Ramón Serrano Súñer]] Minister of the Interior and Propaganda.

The '''Granny Peace Brigade''' [GPB] is an active [[anti-war]] demonstration group in New York City made up of older women dedicated to the goal of peace with justice domestically and globally. The GPB frequently collaborates with [[Code Pink]], [[The Raging Grannies]] and [[Peace Action]] and is one of many local activist groups seeking a safe and peaceful world for all people, especially children.

== History ==
[[Image:2637790944 31d9be7752.jpg|thumb|The Granny Peace Brigade, Central Park, NYC, 2008.]]
The Grannies were initially formed when a group of women, members of seven groups [see below], approached military recruiters and demanded to be sent to Iraq in order to replace young people who were used as cannon fodder by the US military.  The Granny Peace Brigade name was adopted for identification purposes after the women decided to continue working together as a group.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''Hutu Power''' is a [[racist]] [[supremacist]] ideology propounded by [[Hutu]] extremists in [[Rwanda]]. It led to the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] against the [[Tutsi]]. Hutu Power political parties and movements included the ''[[Akazu]]'', the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] and its ''[[Impuzamugambi]]'' paramilitary militia, and the governing [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] and its ''[[Interahamwe]]'' paramilitary militia.

==Ideology==
[[Hassan Ngeze]] in 1990 created the ''[[Hutu Ten Commandments]]'' that served as the basis of Hutu Power ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnicity and sociopolitcal change in Africa and other developing countries: a constructive discourse in state building. Lexington Books, 2008. Pp. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Commandments'' called for the supremacy of Hutus in Rwanda, calling for exclusive Hutu leadership over Rwanda's public institutions and public life, complete segregation of Hutus from Tutsis, and complete exclusion of Tutsis from public institutions and public life.&lt;ref name="John A 1999 pp. 113"&gt;John A. Berry and Carol Pott Berry (eds.) (1999). ''Genocide in Rwanda: A Collective Memory'' (Washington, D.C.: Howard University Press) pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutu Power ideology reviled Tutsis as outsiders bent on restoring a Tutsi-dominated monarchy, and idealized all things Hutu.

The Commandments declared that any form of relationship between Hutus and Tutsi women was forbidden; and that any Hutu who "marries a Tutsi woman", "befriends a Tutsi woman", or "employs a Tutsi woman as a secretary or a concubine" was a traitor to the Hutu people.&lt;ref name="John A 1999 pp. 113"/&gt; It denounced Tutsis as dishonest in business whose "only aim is the supremacy of his [[ethnic group]]"; and declared that any Hutu who did business with a Tutsi was a traitor to the Hutu people.&lt;ref name="John A 1999 pp. 113"/&gt; The Commandments declared that "The Hutu should stop having mercy on the Tutsi" and referred to the Tutsis as "common Tutsi enemy".&lt;ref name="John A 1999 pp. 113"/&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The Rwandan kingdom was traditionally ruled by a Tutsi [[mwami]], or king; Historical evidence suggests that Hutu and [[Twa]] were included in government, although the Twa significantly less so than Hutu, who were more numerous. The Tutsi/Hutu divide has been referred to as a [[caste system]]. A Hutu could gain Tutsi status through marriage or through success. Tutsis, being primarily [[pastoralists]], had a more valuable place in Rwandan society than the agriculturalist Hutu, and the [[hunter-gatherer]] and [[Pottery|potter]] Twa.

The society created conceptions of social status based on the groups' traditional pursuits:  the Twa, working most directly with the earth (through pottery), were considered impure; the Hutu, still working with the ground but less so than the Twa, were in turn considered less pure than the above-ground Tutsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Christopher|title=''Sacrifice as Terror''|publisher=Berg Publishers|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Germany, and later Belgium, colonized the kingdom, they interpreted the local division of races or ethnicity through the [[Hamitic hypothesis]]. European authors such as [[John Hanning Speke]] wrote of the Tutsi as being of Hamitic origin, having constituted a Hamitic invasion from modern [[Ethiopia]], bringing civilization to the [[Negroid]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gourevitch|first=Philip|title=We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda'' |publisher=Picador|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the colonial administration favored the Tutsi at the expense of Hutu and Twa. In addition, they imposed a system of identity cards and ethnic classification in censuses, which reinforced an artificial ethnic division and contributed to tensions between groups. In reality, the Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa possessed little cultural or genetic distinction.

===Shift in Belgian colonial rule===
Toward the end of Belgian rule, the government began to favor the Hutu, who were organizing for more influence. More significantly, the Belgian administration feared the rise of [[Communism]] and a Pan-African socialist regime led by [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Léopoldville]]'s [[Patrice Lumumba]]. Then-Belgian High Resident [[Guillaume Logiest|Guy Logiest]] set up the first democratic elections in Rwanda to avoid more radical politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Rwanda.htm "Belgian residents"], ''Rwanda'', World Statesmen, accessed 15 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  As the majority population, the Hutu elected their candidates to most positions in the new government.

==Formation of Hutu Power==
The first elected president [[Grégoire Kayibanda]], an ethnic Hutu, used ethnic tensions to preserve his own power. Hutu radicals, working with his group (and later against it), adopted the Hamitic hypothesis, portraying the Tutsi as outsiders, invaders, and oppressors of Rwanda. Some Hutu radicals called for the Tutsi to be "sent back to [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]", a reference to their supposed homeland. This early concept of Hutu Power idealized a "pre-invasion" Rwanda: an ethnically pure territory dominated by the Hutu.

==Under Habyarimana==
In 1973, general and defense minister [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], an ethnic Hutu supported by more radical northern Rwandans, overthrew Kayibanda and had him and his wife killed. Many of his supporters were from his district in the north, descendants of Hutu kingdoms that had been semi-autonomous before the colonial period.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The resulting administration proved better for Tutsis, as government-sponsored violence was more sporadic than under Kayibanda.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

With economic conditions difficult, and threatened by the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) invasion, Habyarimana turned to inflaming ethnic tensions.

==Voices of Hutu Power==
Hutu Power acquired a variety of spokesmen. [[Hassan Ngeze]], an entrepreneur recruited by the government to combat the Tutsi publication ''[[Kanguka]]'', created and edited ''[[Kangura]]'', a radical Hutu Power newsletter.  He published the "[[Hutu Ten Commandments]]", which included the following:
*Hutu and Tutsi should not intermarry;
*the education system must be composed of a Hutu majority (reflecting the population); and
*the Rwandan armed forces should be exclusively Hutu.

''[[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]]'' broadcast radio shows suggesting the end to toleration of the Tutsi, repeating the Hutu Ten Commandments, and building support for the Hutu Power ideology. Two main voices of RTLM were announcers [[Valérie Bemeriki]] and [[Georges Ruggiu]]. The repetition of Hutu Ten Commandments was an attempt to incite and mobilize the population to commit genocide against the Tutsi, who were portrayed as threatening the social and political order achieved since independence, and as envisioned by the ''[[Akazu]]''.&lt;ref name="kakwenzire-75"&gt;Joan and Dixon Kamukama (2000).

"Hate Radio in Rwanda", in ''The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire'',  Howard Adelman and Astri Suhrke (eds).  London: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Politician [[Léon Mugesera]] gave a speech in November, 1992, allegedly stating, "Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck...Let them pack their bags, let them get going, so that no one will return here to talk and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc40/2005scc40.html Supreme Court of Canada - Decisions - ''Mugesera v.

==Mobilization for genocide==
During the attempted negotiations ([[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]]) between the Rwandan government and the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|RPF]], radical Hutus began alleging that Habyarimana was being manipulated by Tutsis and non-radical Hutus.  They maligned then-Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]].&lt;ref name="jones-146"&gt;Jones, Bruce (2000). "The Arusha Peace Process", in ''The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire'', Howard Adelman and Astri Suhrke (eds). London: Transaction Publishers. Page 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Following [[Habyarimana's assassination]], an act that at the time people speculated was done by Tutsi extremists, Hutu Power forces mobilized militia, most notably ''[[Interahamwe]]'', and mobs to carry out the mass killings of the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The Presidential Guard of the army killed Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana and several other leading moderate government officials.

==Aftermath==
The defeat of the government by the RPF ended the genocide, and the Hutu Power movement was defeated and suppressed.
Many Hutu Power spokesmen were arrested after the genocide, charged and put on trial. Ngeze was convicted and sentenced to 35 years imprisonment.  In 2005, Mugesera was deported from [[Canada]] to Rwanda to stand trial for his role in the killings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119959045332_19/?hub=TopStories CTV.ca | "Top court upholds Mugesera deportation order"], CTV Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sweden during World War II}}
A number of '''internment camps''' were operated by [[Sweden]] [[Sweden in World War II|during World War II]]. These camps were used for [[internment]] of, among others, suspected criminals, German refugees, anarchists and Swedish [[communist]]s.

Military personnel from both sides in the war, if they entered Sweden without prior agreement, were also often subject to internment.

The camps were claimed to have been a decision necessary in the ambition to keep Sweden out of the war. It was made by the then-ruling [[Third cabinet of Per Albin Hansson|grand coalition government]] under social democrat prime minister [[Per Albin Hansson]], which all included all parties in the [[Parliament of Sweden]], with the notable exception of the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Communist Party of Sweden]].

===Internees===
[[Internee]]s were commonly suspected criminals, German refugees, left-wing activists or anti-Nazis. They were imprisoned without trial and without being informed of the accusations made against them. Most of these were foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berglund |first=Tobias |last2=Sennerteg |first2=Niclas |title=Svenska koncentrationsläger i Tredje rikets skugga |trans-title=Swedish Concentration Camps in the Shadow of the Third Reich |year=2008 |publisher=[[Natur &amp; Kultur]] |location=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=9789127026957 |id={{LIBRIS|10654055}} |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, Tobias .

===Treatment===
Wardens were instructed to ensure humane treatment of internees.
All internees were forced to wear certain uniform and submit daily routines.
Internees in Smedsbo internment camp had a typical daily routine of being woken up at 7.15am, they were then escorted to the dining room where they were expected to have their breakfast in complete silence followed by working passes. They were not permitted to leave their working station at any time. Jobs like road building, repair duty and woodcutting were commonly adopted. With one break for lunch, work proceeded until 2.45pm, after which internees were more or less free for the rest of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berglund |first=Tobias |last2=Sennerteg |first2=Niclas |title=Svenska koncentrationsläger i Tredje rikets skugga |trans-title=Swedish Concentration Camps in the Shadow of the Third Reich |year=2008 |publisher=[[Natur &amp; Kultur]] |location=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=9789127026957 |id={{LIBRIS|10654055}} |pages=77-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internment of Allied air crews==
A number of [[Allies of World War II|Western Allied]] servicemen, primarily crew members of the aircraft damaged during bombing missions over Germany, found themselves on Swedish soil, and were interned by the Swedish authorities. 

Unlike civilian refugees from Germany, who were kept in internment camps, Allied airmen were placed in hotels and [[bed and breakfast]] establishments in the [[Falun]] area, and enjoyed relative freedom. They received their regular military pay from their home countries, which allowed them to be much better off than the local Swedish residents.&lt;ref&gt;Jöran Granberg, [Memories of the Framby Internment Camp in Falun Sweden, 1942-1944], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==“Disclosure”==
In 2008, Swedish journalist Niclas Sennerteg and researcher Tobias Berglund published ''Swedish Concentration Camps in the Shadow of the Third Reich'' (Swedish title: “Svenska koncentrationsläger i tredje rikets skugga”), where they claim to be exposing what the government had kept secret regarding the presence of Swedish concentration camps. After the discovery was brought to media and thus public attention, the use of the term concentration camp has been highly debated.

==Post-war use of Swedish internment camps==
After the war the internment camps were used to store foreigners that the [[Swedish government]] deemed dubious. However, details regarding much of this have still not been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berglund |first=Tobias |last2=Sennerteg |first2=Niclas |title=Svenska koncentrationsläger i Tredje rikets skugga |trans-title=Swedish Concentration Camps in the Shadow of the Third Reich |year=2008 |publisher=[[Natur &amp; Kultur]] |location=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=9789127026957 |id={{LIBRIS|10654055}} |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Den svenska staten använder sig av brutala tvångs- och våldsmetoder för att eftertryckligt trampa ned den utländska antifascisten som likt en vrakspillra efter den tyska demokratins skeppsbrott kastats upp på svensk strand" &lt;ref&gt;[[Arbetaren]], 21 mars 1940”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Translation:''
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Swedish government is using brutal methods to forcefully crush the foreign antifascists who like remnants after the shipwreck of the German democracy was washed upon Swedish shores.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Det svenska folket får inte tolerera att oskyldiga människor kastas i fängelse och kvarhålles där på obestämd tid.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=En skam för Sverige |newspaper=[[Ny Dag]] |date=15 December 1942 |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Translation:''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”The Swedish people must not tolerate the imprisonment of innocent people for an undetermined time.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10461">The '''Islamic Legion''' ([[Arabic]]: الفيلق الإسلامي ''al-Faylaq ul-'Islāmiyyu''&lt;ref name=prunier45&gt;G. Prunier, ''Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;) ({{aka}} Islamic Pan-African Legion) was a [[Libya]]n-sponsored [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arabist]] [[paramilitary]] force, created in 1972. The Legion was part of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s dream of creating the Great Islamic State of the [[Sahel]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Gaddafi, who had come to power in September 1969, was not only a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]], but an [[Arabs|Arab]] cultural [[supremacism|supremacist]].&lt;ref&gt;Prunier, Gérard, Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide, Cornell University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-4450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hostility to [[Chad]]'s government of [[President of Chad|President]] [[François Tombalbaye]] was at least partly inspired by Tombalbaye's [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] background. It also led Gaddafi to drive the [[Toubou]] of Libya, who were considered 'black', from [[Fezzan]] and across the Chadian border. Gaddafi supported the [[Sudan]]ese government of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], referring to it as an "Arab Nationalist Revolutionary Movement", and even offered to merge the two countries at a meeting in late 1971. Gaddafi's plans for the peaceful formation of an "[[Arab Union]]" were dashed when Nimeiry turned down his offer and negotiated the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] ending the [[First Sudanese Civil War]], fought with the Black, [[Animism|animist]] and Christian, [[South Sudan|South]].&lt;ref&gt;Prunier, pp. 43-45&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi's definition of "Arab" was broad, including the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], as well as the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] of Chad and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Flint and de Waal, ''Darfur: A Short History of a Long War'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Gaddafi created the Islamic Legion as a tool to unify and Arabize the region. The priority of the Legion was first Chad, and then Sudan. In [[Darfur]], a western province of Sudan, Gaddafi supported the creation of the Arab Gathering (Tajammu al-Arabi), which according to Gérard Prunier was "a militantly racist and pan-Arabist organization which stressed the 'Arab' character of the province."&lt;ref name=prunier45/&gt; The two organizations shared members and a source of support, and the distinction between the two is often ambiguous.

==The Legion==
This Islamic Legion was mostly composed of immigrants from poorer [[Sahel]]ian countries,&lt;ref name=Nolutshungu220&gt;S. Nolutshungu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; but also, according to a source, thousands of [[Pakistan]]is and some [[Bangladesh]]is who had been recruited since 1981 with the false promise of civilian jobs once in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;J. Thomson, ''Mercenaries, Pirates and Sovereigns'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the Legion's members were immigrants who had gone to Libya with no thought of fighting wars, and had been provided with inadequate military training and had sparse commitment. A French journalist{{who|date=December 2012}}, speaking of the Legion's forces in Chad, observed that they were "foreigners, Arabs or Africans, [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in spite of themselves, wretches who had come to Libya hoping for a civilian job, but found themselves signed up more or less by force to go and fight in an unknown desert."&lt;ref name=Nolutshungu220/&gt;

According to the Military Balance published by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], the force was organized into one armored, one infantry, and one paratroop/commando brigade. It had been supplied with [[T-54]] and T-55 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and [[EE-9]] armored cars. The Legion was reported to have been committed during the fighting in Chad in 1980 and was praised by Gaddafi for its success there. However, it was believed that many of the troops who fled the Chadian attacks of March 1987 were members of the Legion.

Gaddafi dispatched legionnaires to [[Uganda]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;J.-P. Azam et al., ''Conflict and Growth in Africa'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; but the Legion was to be mostly associated with the [[Chadian–Libyan conflict]], where already in 1980 7,000 legionnaires participated to the second battle of N'Djamena,&lt;ref&gt;G. Simons, ''Libya and the West'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; where its fighting record was most noted for its ineptitude.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wright, ''Libya'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; To this force [[Benin]]'s [[Marxism|Marxist]] regime is said to have provided legionnaires during the 1983 offensive in Chad.&lt;ref&gt;J. Markakis &amp; M. Waller, ''Military Marxist Regimes'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 1987 Libyan offensive into Chad, it maintained a force of 2,000 in Darfur. The nearly continuous cross-border raids that resulted greatly contributed to a separate ethnic conflict within Darfur that killed about 9,000 people between 1985 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Prunier, pp. 61-65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion was disbanded by Gaddafi following its defeats in Chad in 1987 and the Libyan retreat from that country. But its consequences in this region can still be felt. Some of the [[Janjaweed]] leaders were among those said to have been trained in Libya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =de Waal| first =Alex| title =Counter-Insurgency on the Cheap| journal = [[London Review of Books]]| volume =26| issue =15| date =2004-08-05| url =http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n15/waal01_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many [[Darfur]]i followers of the [[Umma Party (Sudan)|Umma Party]] were forced in exile in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGregor |first=Andrew |title=Terrorism and Violence in the Sudan: The Islamist Manipulation of Darfur |journal=Terrorism Monitor |volume=3 |issue=12 |date=2005-06-17 |publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]] |url=http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2369723 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AMcGregor+intitle%3ATerrorism+and+Violence+in+the+Sudan%3A+The+Islamist+Manipulation+of+Darfur&amp;as_publication=Terrorism+Monitor&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016211725/http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2369723 |archivedate=October 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion was also to leave a strong impact on the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] living in [[Mali]] and [[Niger]]. A series of severe [[drought]]s had brought many young Tuareg to migrate to Libya, where a number of them were recruited into the Legion, receiving an indoctrination that told them to reject their hereditary chiefs and to fight those governments that excluded the Tuareg from power. After the disbandment of the Legion, these men were to return to their countries and to play an important role in the Tuareg rebellions that erupted in the two countries in 1989&amp;ndash;90.&lt;ref&gt;J.-P. Azam et al., p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately prior to the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime, there were media reports that his hard-core of supporters included former members of the Islamic Legion who had been granted Libyan citizenship and remained in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afterwards==
In an effort to realize Gaddafi's vision of a united Arab military force, plans for the creation of an Arab Legion have been announced from time to time. The goal, according to the Libyan press, would be to assemble an army of 1 million men and women fighters to prepare for the great Arab battle--"the battle of liberating Palestine, of toppling the reactionary regimes, of annihilating the borders, gates, and barriers between the countries of the Arab homeland, and of creating the single Arab Jamahiriya from the ocean to the gulf." In March 1985, it was announced that the National Command of the Revolutionary Forces Command in the Arab Nation had been formed with Gaddafi at its head. A number of smaller radical Arab groups from Lebanon, Tunisia, Sudan, Iraq, the Persian Gulf states, and Jordan were represented at the inaugural meeting. Syrian Baath Party and radical Palestinian factions were also present. Each of these movements was expected to earmark 10 percent of its forces for service under the new command. As of April 1987, there was no information confirming the existence of such a militia.

The '''Jewish Social Democratic Party''' (in [[Yiddish]], ''Yidishe sotsial-demokratishe partey'', {{lang-pl|Żydowska Partia Socjal-Demokratyczna}}, abbreviated '''ŻPS''') was a [[political party]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and later also [[Bukovina]], established in a split from the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia]] (PPSD) in 1905. The party made its first public appearance on May 1, 1905, with separate [[May Day]] rallies in [[Kraków]], [[Lemberg]], [[Tarnów]] and [[Przemyśl]]. However, as the new party stressed that it was not a competitor of the existing Social Democratic parties, they later joined the PPSD celebrations.&lt;ref name="anu"&gt;Kuhn, Rick [http://auspsa.anu.edu.au/proceedings/2002/kuhn.pdf 'The tradition of Jewish anti-Zionism in the Galician socialist movement' &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720045128/http://auspsa.anu.edu.au/proceedings/2002/kuhn.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }} Resistance and class stream, Australasian Political Studies Association APSA50 Conference, Canberra, 2–4 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party, often nicknamed the 'Galician Bund', was influenced by the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in Russia and was opposed to Zionism.&lt;ref name="brenner"/&gt;

ŻPS held its founding congress in June 1905.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt; The second congress was held in 1906.&lt;ref name="brenner"&gt;Brenner, Michael/Penslar, Derek Jonathan. ''In search of Jewish community : Jewish identities in Germany and Austria, 1918-1933''. [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]: Indiana University press, c1998. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Its founding theoretician and secretary was [[Henryk Grossman]]. While the Party sought affiliation to the [[SPÖ|Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria]], this was refused. The ŻPS became the largest organisation of Jewish workers in Galicia.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;Kuhn, Rick ''Henryk Grossman and the Recovery of Marxism'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-252-07352-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial period of the existence of the party, it publish a monthtly titled ''Der yudisher sotsial-demokrat''. In October 1905 it was replaced by a weekly, ''Der sotsial-demokrat''. As of 1910, ''Der sotsial-demokrat'' had a circulation of 2000.&lt;ref name="j2"&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester. ''Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. pp. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 the Jewish Social Democracy in Galicia, the Jewish affiliate section of the PPSD, merged into the ŻPS.&lt;ref name="brenner"/&gt; The Jewish Social Democracy in Galicia had 377 members at the time of the merger.&lt;ref name="j2"/&gt; The strength of the party reached its peak when the [[Bund (Bukovina)|Bukovina Bundists]] merged into the party the following year. The united party took the name '''Jewish Social Democratic Party in Galicia and Bukovina'''.&lt;ref name="brenner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Bukowinabook/buk1_127.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, several prominent leaders of the erstwhile Jewish Social Democracy began returning to the PPSD. More devastating for the ŻPS, though, was the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Galicia and Bukovina became battlefield, and party activities ceased. The branch in [[Cracow]] was reconstructed in 1916, and in the fall of 1917 there was a conference of delegates from different local ŻPS branches. On 15, 1918 ''Der sotsial-demokrat'' reappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester. ''Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, its organisation in Poland merged with the [[Polish Bund]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joseph. ''Social and political history of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939''. [[Berlin]]/[[New York City]]: Mouton Publishers, 1983. p. 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kisman, Yusf 'Di yidishe sotsial-demokratishe bevegung in Galitsie un Bukovine', in G. Aronson, S. Dubnov-Erlikh, J. S. Herts, and others (eds) ''Di Geshikhte fun Bund drite band'', New York: Farlag Unser Tsait, pp. 337-480&lt;/ref&gt; In Bukovina, now part of [[Romania]], the remnants of the party continued to operate under the name 'Bund', and in 1922 they founded (along with Jewish socialists from Old Romania and [[Bessarabia]]) the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Bukowinabook/buk1_129.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The party had 2800 members in 1906, by 1908 the figure had risen to 3600 and by 1910 it claimed a membership of 4206.&lt;ref name="brenner"/&gt; At the time, the party had 80 branches in 32 different localities.&lt;ref name="j2"/&gt; In 1911, after the merger with the Bukovina Bund, the party had 4500 members.&lt;ref name="j3"&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester. ''Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for its organization in Galicia and Bukovina, the party also had presence (at warying times) in [[Vienna]], [[New York City]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Bielsk, Masovian Voivodeship|Bielsk]].&lt;ref name="j3"/&gt;

'''Erkki Johan Bäckman''' (born 18 May 1971) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] political activist, author and [[legal sociologist]]. In Russia he is also considered a [[human rights activist]]. He has been active in relation to Russian citizens' child custody rights abroad, and is regularly interviewed by the Russian media as a child custody expert. Bäckman has contentious views about Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine, and has been declared [[persona non grata]]&lt;ref name=banned/&gt; and denied entry into Estonia, and has been expelled from Moldova.

Bäckman's books have been the subject of intense debate about [[Finnish-Soviet Relations|Finnish-Soviet relations]] during the [[Cold War]], the war history of Finland and the Soviet Union, [[organized crime]] in [[Estonia]] and the [[Russian Mafia]], terrorism, and the [[history of Estonia]]. As a spokesman for the [[Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee]] he is against the [[Social integration|integration policies]] of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], claiming they are "[[Crime of apartheid|apartheid]] policies". On the whole, he does not recognize them as states. Bäckman supported Russia during the [[Ukrainian crisis]], and also claims to represent the separatist [[Donetsk People's Republic]] in Finland.&lt;ref name="yle-satakunta"&gt;{{cite web | title = SDP politician’s support of East-Ukrainian separatists raises eyebrows | url = http://yle.fi/uutiset/sdp_politicians_support_of_east-ukrainian_separatists_raises_eyebrows/7377804 | publisher = [[Yle]] | date = 26 July 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bäckman has a title of a [[docent]] in [[sociology of law]] and in criminology, and has previously taught courses on the sociology of law, criminology, and Russian studies in several Finnish universities. He has a background in music and became a public figure in the late 1980s then participating in EBU Young Soloists Competition.

== Bäckman and Russia ==

Bäckman is highly critical of the modern Finnish historiography of [[World War II]] and challenges the traditional Western account that Finland waged a separate [[Continuation War]] against the aggression of the USSR. According to Bäckman, the Finns participated in the [[Siege of Leningrad]] actively and asked [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to destroy the city. He speculates that Finland also planned an [[ethnic cleansing]] in [[Karelia]] in order to create a [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] [[superpower]], possibly stretching as far as [[the Urals]], or even to the river [[Yenisei]], which he claimed is proven by vast amounts of documents and in several Finnish history books by [[Helge Seppälä]], [[Osmo Hyytiä]] and Nikolai Baryshnikov.&lt;ref name="sptimes.ru"/&gt;

Bäckman accuses Finland of being the aggressor in World War II: that it allied with Hitler in attacking the USSR in 1941 ([[Continuation War]])&amp;mdash;omitting the original source conflict ([[Winter War]]); plotted territorial expansion and planned to conduct ethnic cleansing; and that, along with the Estonians and Germans, believed in its Aryan origins (a Nordic master race). He contends Finns are both anti-Semitic and Russophobic, Russophobia being a "racist political ideology"&amp;mdash;both per "several academic works by Finnish authors."&lt;ref&gt;Bäckman, J.

In 2002, Bäckman publicly accused the [[Foreign Ministry of Finland]] of [[Russophobia]] and racism. He claimed that the ministry was preparing a campaign to smear Russia and return the territories lost in the [[Paris Peace Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.gov.karelia.ru/Karelia/990/39.html йЮПЕКХЪ N 4 (16 ЪМБЮПЪ 2003): опнькне - мюярнъыее: вЕЛС МЮЯ СВХР ЦНПЭЙХИ НОШР...пЮГЦНБНПШ НА ЮЙРХБХГЮЖХХ ЮМРХПСЯЯЙХУ МЮЯРПНЕМХИ Б тХМКЪМДХХ, ЯЙНПЕЕ БЯЕЦН, ОПЕЯКЕДСЧР ВХЯРН ОНКХРХВЕЯЙХЕ ЖЕКХ].

In March 2002, during a military historical festival in [[Suojärvi]] in the [[Republic of Karelia]] which was dedicated to the 62nd anniversary of the end of the [[Winter War]], Bäckman made a sensational claim that the modern authorities of Finland propagated the idea that the Russian people are genetically inferior and expected Russia to collapse in about twenty years.&lt;ref name="politika-karelia.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.rep.ru/20Mar2002/society/01.html |date=* |title=РУССКИЕ ЛЮДИ ГЕНЕТИЧЕСКИ НЕПОЛНОЦЕННЫЕ? }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other participants at the festival considered that he unreasonably overestimated the extent of [[anti-Russian sentiment]] in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.rep.ru/10Apr2002/society/02.html |date=* |title=ВОЗМОЖНО, У ЙОХАНА БЭКМАНА НЕТ ЧУВСТВА ЮМОРА? }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bäckman's article "Finland without a mask" (the title alludes to a 1943 proclamation by [[Otto Wille Kuusinen]]), published in Russian in May 2002, the Finns in general consider themselves a superior nation, all Russian women prostitutes, and all Russian men thieves and bandits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whiteworld.ns-info.ru/rubriki/000108/006/02051703.htm RuWeb.Info - Белый Мир - Йохан Бэкман - Финляндия без маски].

In 2003, Johan Beckman Institute published the book ''Finland and the Siege of Leningrad 1941-1944'' by the Russian historian [[Nikolai Baryshnikov]]. The [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg legislature]] awarded Bäckman their ''Marshal Govorov Literature Prize'' (2003) for the book. Historian [[Timo Vihavainen]], a historian at the University of Helsinki described it as "a book built on [[Neo-Stalinism|Stalinist]] propaganda stereotypes". Vihavainen also said that Baryshnikov had misunderstood some of the language in Finnish archive documents.&lt;ref name="sptimes.ru"&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=9118 New Book on Siege Gets A Hot Finnish Response | The St. Petersburg Times | The leading English-language newspaper in St. Petersburg].

In his 2007 book ''Finland washed with Anna Politkovskaya's blood'' ({{lang-fi|Saatana saapuu Helsinkiin}}, Literally: ''Satan Arrives in Helsinki'', which alludes to ''Saatana saapuu Moskovaan'', the Finnish language title for ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' by [[Bulgakov]]) he supported the conspiracy theory that [[Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya|Anna Politkovskaya assassination]] was organized by as an attempt to smear the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name=den/&gt; Bäckman has hinted that Politkovskaya was depressed and ordered her own murder. According to Bäckman, Politkovskaya, a Russian writer and human rights activist, was an American agent. He also criticizes Finns' reaction to the murder. Bäckman accused Finnish [[Green League]] politician [[Heidi Hautala]] and the Finnish media of inciting hatred towards Russia and Vladimir Putin. Hautala, depicted on the book cover (''pictured''), saw this as a [[smear campaign]], but refused to take legal action, preferring to allow the book to speak for itself.&lt;ref name="hs-greemp"&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135225486579 Helsingin Sanomat: Book accuses media and Green MP of inciting anti-Russian sentiment (1 March 2007)].

He stated that Finland also needs organizations such as the pro-Kremlin [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] and [[Walking Together]].&lt;ref name="apn fsb"/&gt; According to Bäckman, the [[freedom of the press in Russia]] is considerably higher than in Finland, and Estonia is not free at all.&lt;ref name="apn fsb"/&gt;

===Bäckman in Russian media===

According to Finnish Academy chairman [[Arto Mustajoki]], Dr. Bäckman is five times more visible in the Russian media than previous Finnish premier [[Jyrki Katainen]] or previous president [[Tarja Halonen]]. According to Mustajoki, Russians treat Bäckman as "hero" because he defends Russian minorities in the Baltic States.&lt;ref&gt;Yliopisto No. 1/2013, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bäckman and Estonia ==

Bäckman's work has been published in Finland and Estonia. Many of his published opinions are provocative and some have been regarded as pro-Putin and [[Anti-Estonian sentiment|anti-Estonian]] by commentators in the Estonian press.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eesti Ekspress]] 23 February 2009 12:43: [http://www.ekspress.ee/2009/03/23/eesti-uudised/40505-raige-eesti-vastane-kampaania-kaib-kolmes-riigis-korraga Räige Eesti-vastane kampaania käib kolmes riigis korraga], edited by [[Askur Alas]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckman has stated that Estonia "does not exist" as a sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;[[ves.lv]] 6 March 2009 13:02: [http://www.ves.lv/article/72616 "Эстония?

According to Bäckman, the [[Estonians]] and [[Finns]] are actually one nation and the Republic of [[Estonia]] should be united with [[Finland]] where it could still have an autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |language=Estonian|first= |last= |title=Bäckman: Soome ja Eesti – üks rahvas – üks riik! |work= |page= |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2009 |quote= |url=http://www.eesti.ca/?op=article&amp;articleid=23557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bronze Soldier book===

In his highly controversial book about the Estonian [[Bronze Soldier]] ''Pronssisoturi: Viron patsaskiistan tausta ja sisältö'', published in Finnish in 2008, Bäckman disagrees with the integration policies of [[Estonia]]. In his opinion, Estonian integration policies that have seen some 147,000 Russian speakers receiving Estonian citizenship in the past decade are "[[apartheid]]" and represent a "criminal discrimination of Russians".&lt;ref name=den/&gt; In the ''Bronze Soldier'' he dismissed the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia]] as a "Nazi myth".&lt;ref name="hs.fi"&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/1135239739349 Helsingin yliopisto ei puutu Bäckmanin puheisiin - HS.fi - Kulttuuri].

In connection to the publication of the book in September 2008, Bäckman gave several interviews, including one in which he claimed Estonia will join Russia within a decade.&lt;ref name=den&gt;[http://www.dzd.ee/?SID=688cc57e4703df2db609bbc5da87b9e2&amp;n=17&amp;a=2790 Десять лет, которые потрясут Эстонию] [[Den' za Dnyom]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estland in zehn Jahren Teil der Russischen Föderation|publisher=[[Der Standard]]|url=http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1220457806736|date=11 September 2008|accessdate=13 September 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EP&gt;[http://epl.ee/?uudised=438161 Bäckman: Eesti on teel otse põrgusse] [[Eesti Päevaleht]] 11 August 2008 {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bb&gt;[http://www.balticbusinessnews.com/Default2.aspx?ref=topread&amp;ArticleID=becc1bf7-ae5f-44bf-b9c9-74824c98cd26 Finnish writer: Estonia to lose independence in 10 years] [[Baltic Business News]] 11 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=molodezh&gt;[http://www.moles.ee/08/Aug/15/11-1.php Эстония прямиком движется в ад] [[Molodezh Estonii]] 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckman also claimed that the "destruction" of the Bronze Soldier grave site and monument in April 2007 by the Estonian government was "the end of history of Estonia". He speculated that most of the Russian youth all over Russia, including children, &lt;!--as a result / at the time +ed (past tense)--&gt; hate Estonia and deny her the right to exist. Bäckman went on to predict that in ten years at most, the [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] would come to power in Russia, leading to an end of the Estonian statehood shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="den"/&gt;

After the publication of the book, Finnish and Estonian cultural figures, scholars, journalists and politicians, including [[Henrik Lax]], [[Lasse Lehtinen]] and [[Sofi Oksanen]], addressed the [[University of Helsinki]] in an [[open letter]] of protest, partly in relation to Bäckman teaching a course on "specialities of Estonian legal policy" in the Spring 2009 semester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/1135239710765 Avoin kirje vaatii Bäckmanin opetuksen tutkintaa Helsingin yliopistossa - HS.fi - Kulttuuri].

In March 2009 Bäckman, as part of the [[Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee]], arranged a series of protests in Helsinki attended by activists of the Russian [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]], and [[Nochnoy Dozor (pressure group)|Night Watch]] organizations, against what they called the "opening [of] a new anti-Russian front of information warfare on the territory of Finland by [the] Estonian embassy." In addition, [[Abdullah Tammi]] and his followers from the prospective [[Finnish Islamic Party]] participated. The protests were aimed against seminars, against a book about the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia]], and against films presented by the Estonian embassy in Finland, especially the film ''[[Soviet Story]]'' by [[Edvins Snore]].&lt;ref name="hs-handful"/&gt; In media commentaries for Swedish, Finnish and Russian press, television and radio, Bäckman claimed that the Soviet Union did not occupy Estonia, and belittled the significance of the [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]].&lt;ref name="hs-handful"/&gt;

===Estonian Internal Security Service and Bäckman===

The [[Estonian Internal Security Service|Estonian Internal Security Service (Kaitsepolitseiamet)]] official Andres Kahar said in the Estonian press that Bäckman is "a Russian propagandist" spreading disinformation similar to claims made in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloleht.ee/index.aspx?id=296973 |title=Kapo: milleks aidata Vene propagandamasinat? |author=Viivik, Allar |work=SL Õhtuleht |date=23 March 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2008 |language=et }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='backman+teinonen'&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = [[Eesti Ekspress]] | date= 18 March 2009 | url = http://www.ekspress.ee/2009/03/18/eesti-uudised/40449-yheskoos-eesti-vastu-antifashist-backman-ja-natsimeelne-teinonen | title = Üheskoos Eesti vastu: antifašist Bäckman ja natsimeelne Teinonen | author = Askur Alas|accessdate=31 March 2009 | language = et }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=1661|title=Eurasian Secret Services Daily Review|first=1 October 2008|work=Global Challenges Research|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the newspaper ''[[Eesti Ekspress]]'' reported a link between Bäckman and the Finnish neo-nazi [[Risto Teinonen]], alleging both of them are connected to the reputed former [[KGB]] agent [[Vladimir Ilyashevich]] residing in Estonia, all of whom are linked to the Russian historian [[Alexander Dyukov (historian)|Alexander Dyukov]]. In the assessment by [[Estonian Internal Security Service|Kaitsepolitseiamet]], Bäckman, Teinonen and Ilyashevich are working as a team with support from Moscow, attempting to undermine the names of many good people, the relations between Finland and Estonia, and the Republic of Estonia itself.&lt;ref name='backman+teinonen'/&gt;

Finnish counter-intelligence has not commented on Bäckman publicly. Regarding [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]]-demonstrations organised by Bäckman in Helsinki in March 2009, the Finnish security police spokesman replied they heard "rumours" about the demonstrations but would not comment on issues regarding free democratic activism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/53880-supo-nashien-helsingin-retkesta-”olemme-kuulleet-huhuja”&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Persona non grata'' status in Estonia===
On 26 April 2009, Bäckman was detained after his disembarkation from a ferry in the [[Tallinn Passenger Port]] and expelled from the country under an entry prohibition. The Estonian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that Johan Bäckman has been declared ''persona non grata'' in Estonia.&lt;ref name=banned&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Anti-Estonian+Johan+Bäckman+refused+entry+at+Port+of+Tallinn/1135245495868|title=Anti-Estonian Johan Bäckman refused entry at Port of Tallinn|date=27 April 2009|work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]]|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among reasons for expulsion, the [[Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs]] listed the first of all twelve statements by Bäckman in the Estonian press and in his blog, claiming Estonia is an "[[apartheid]]" regime that "falsifies" history.

== Bäckman and Finland ==

Bäckman has been a commentator of Finnish-Russian child custody and "grandmother cases". The Finnish Broadcasting Company [[Yle]], quoting [[Timo Vihavainen]], a professor of Russian history, speculated that this has happened due to fact that Bäckman's opinions match the interests of the Kremlin.&lt;ref name="yle-vihavainen"&gt;{{cite web | title = Professori: Kohudosenttiin suhtauduttava vakavasti | url = http://yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2010/06/professori_kohudosenttiin_suhtauduttava_vakavasti_1734417.html | publisher = [[Yle]] | date = 8 June 2010 | accessdate=8 June 2010 |  language = fi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bäckman claims that children that are being taken care of by Finnish child protection authorities are living in "concentration camps", and explains that "this is a certain system of political terror".  To explain why the rest of the world has not noticed this, he claims that "Children who get into these camps have special prohibitions for communications, they cannot tell us what is happening there."   He states that "I think that the juvenile justice system, the system of a mass removal of children, is genocide of children.".  He has not provided numbers for how many children are supposed to have been killed in this alleged "genocide", and has not revealed any sources for his information.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.pravda.ru/society/family/28-01-2014/126694-finland_juvenile_fascism-0/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bäckman and Moldova ==
In May 2014 Bäckman was expelled from [[Moldova]] and received five-year entry ban, as his activities were regarded as undermining Moldova's statehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=509704 |title=Finnish human rights activist Backman deported from Moldova, banned entry for five years |publisher=[[Interfax]] |date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214033/http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=509704 |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Bäckman regards the [[Taistolaisuus|Taistoists]] movement of the 1970s, the hardline pro-Soviet faction in the [[Communist Party of Finland]], as "the best thing that happened in the history of Finland". He has said: "We can thank the Taistoists for high-quality science, art and culture we enjoy today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hbl.fi/text/inrikes/2009/3/22/d25126.php |title=Han bjöd in 30 Putinunga |publisher=[[Hufvudstadsbladet]] |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2009 |last=Bruun |first=Staffan |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326042650/http://www.hbl.fi/text/inrikes/2009/3/22/d25126.php |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckman was an [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]] for [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Finland)|European Parliament election in 2009]] on the [[Workers Party of Finland]] list.

== Private life ==
Johan Bäckman is a son of ''Erkki Bäckman'' who was a [[Managing Director]] of [[Hartwall]] beverage company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/valismaa/johan-backmani-isa-teenis-mullu-17-miljonit-eurot.d?id=26733007|title=Johan Bäckmani isa teenis mullu 1,7 miljonit eurot|date=6 November 2009|work=[[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi]]|language=Estonian|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Bäckman has litigated over child custody against his Soviet-born ex-wife for years in which both parties have received sentences for [[libel]].&lt;ref name="hs-johanonkumma"&gt;

His wife is a [[Russian language]] and [[Russian literature|literature]] teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Грибанова |first1=Татьяна |year=2010 |script-title=ru:Йохан Бекман: Моё хобби - это Россия |journal=Аиф Тамбов |volume= |issue=32 (790) |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://tambov.aif.ru/issues/790/02_01 |accessdate=6 December 2010 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830121231/http://tambov.aif.ru/issues/790/02_01 |archivedate=30 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Helsingin Sanomat, Bäckman had been treated with caution in the Finnish public media because he is sensitive to what he considers to be journalistic libels. According to the newspaper he has won a court case two times, but equally self-convicted of libel in July 2009.&lt;ref Name="hs-johanonkumma"/&gt;
Bäckman wrote a letter to the editor saying he had won seven libel cases during past couple of years, not two, as the paper claimed. Bäckman wrote he won the cases against five persons, all of whom are female citizens of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Helsingin Sanomat 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bäckman has a child from the previous relationship with '''Jaana Niemi'''. Niemi was born in the Soviet Union with Finnish origins, but was brought up in Russian culture. The family also spoke Finnish. In 1990, Niemi, then age of 15, moved from the Soviet Union to Finland. Bäckman and Niemi's relationship lasted six months and ended in a confrontational way. A daughter was born in 2004. Soon after, Bäckman sued Jaana Niemi, her parents and friends dozens of times. Most of cases ended in pretrial investigations, but Bäckman run a few cases by himself in a court. The Finnish court [[Hovioikeus]] convicted Niemi once, and Bäckman was convicted twice. Niemi lives now in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hs.fi/sunnuntai/B%C3%A4ckmanin+ex-naisyst%C3%A4v%C3%A4n+perheen+piina+jatkunut+kahdeksan+vuotta/a1354342057842 |title= Bäckmanin ex-naisystävän perheen piina jatkunut kahdeksan vuotta |publisher=Helsingin Sanomat | date= 2 December 2012 |accessdate= |last= |first=| language = fi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao''' ('''KIM''') was a dedicated organization that sought to establish an independent state in [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]]. The group was led by an Afghan-trained cleric known as Humam Abdul Najid.&lt;ref name="chalk"&gt;{{cite web | last =Chalk | first =Peter | title =The Islamic State in the Philippines: A Looming Shadow in Southeast Asia? | url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-islamic-state-in-the-philippines-a-looming-shadow-in-southeast-asia | accessdate = May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sometimes described as an [[umbrella organization]] composed of the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], the [[Abu Sayyaf]], and members of other armed groups. According to the [[Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research]], the KIM had five founders; [[Zulkifli Abdhir]], who was killed on January 25, 2015 by [[Special Action Force]] officers during the raid that culminated in the [[Mamasapano clash]], Amir M, Amir Abtol Rahman, Amir Kuptu and Amir Humam Abdul Najid.

'''Khao-I-Dang Holding Center''' was a [[Khmer people|Cambodian]] [[refugee]] camp located 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Aranyaprathet]] in [[Prachinburi Province|Prachinburi]] (now [[Sa Kaeo Province|Sa Kaeo]]) Province of [[Thailand]]. The most enduring [[refugee camp]] on the Thai-Cambodian border, it was established in late 1979 and administered by the Thai Ministry of the Interior and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) -- unlike other camps on the border, which were administered by a coalition made up of [[UNICEF]], the [[World Food Program]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) (briefly) and, after 1982, the [[United Nations Border Relief Operation]] (UNBRO).

== Camp Construction ==
Situated on the sparsely wooded plains in eastern Thailand a few miles from the Cambodian border, the huge compound of [[bamboo]] and [[thatch]] houses was  opened on November 21, 1979 after the fall of the [[Khmer Rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandischool.com/public/1987/March/school-resource12767.asp Khao-I-Dang and the Conscience of the West - John Bowles]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the establishment of an emergency camp for refugees at [[Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp|Sa Kaeo]], the Thai Ministry of the Interior authorized [[Mark Malloch Brown]] of the UNHCR to build a second camp at the foot of Khao-I-Dang Mountain.

According to Martin Barber, Chief of UNHCR's Kampuchean Unit, "The site, covering an area of 2.3 square kilometers on a gently sloping hill, had good drainage. It opened...after just four days of preparatory work spent in establishing the overall design of the camp and developing the basic infrastructure (roads, [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/photos/kid/ChhanTouch/811620-R1-E002.jpg water tanks], and latrines) of the first "chunk".&lt;ref&gt;Barber M.

Millwood, N.Y.: Associated Faculty Press, 1987, p. 32 [https://www.amazon.com/Years-Horror-Days-Hope-Responding/dp/080469396X]&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was divided into sections of 10,000-12,000 people. Each section had space allocated for reasonable housing and for necessary services including supplementary feeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Cambodian-Emergency-Refugee-Health-Care-1979-1980.pdf Allegra DT, Nieburg P, Grabe M, Centers for Disease C.

== Camp population ==
On October 19, 1979 Thai Prime Minister [[Kriangsak Chomanan]] enacted an "open door" policy which permitted Cambodian refugees to cross the border safely and to reside in specific locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forcedmigration.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/9-open-door "Thailand's Open-Door Policy,"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shawcross&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shawcross|first1=William|title=The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust, and Modern Conscience'|date=1984|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|173}} Khao-I-Dang (known to aid agencies as KID) was intended  to serve as a temporary holding center for refugees who would either be repatriated to Cambodia or expatriated to third countries. On the first day 4,800 people arrived and by December 31 there were 84,800.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, in Levy and Susott, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Between November 1979 and the end of January 1980 an average of 1,600 refugees arrived in the camp each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forcedmigration.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/11-khao-i-dang "Khao-I-Dang"]&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand's open door policy was abruptly ended on January 24, 1980&lt;ref name=Shawcross /&gt;{{RP|251}} and KID was "closed" to new arrivals.

Originally planned to hold 300,000 refugees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Cambodian-Emergency-Refugee-Health-Care-1979-1980.pdf Allegra, Nieburg and Grabe, p. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; the population eventually reached 160,000 in March 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, L. and R. Brown, ''Rice, Rivalry, and Politics: Managing Cambodian Relief''. 1983, Notre Dame [Ind.]: University of Notre Dame Press, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as KID became the main holding center for refugees awaiting third country visas, [[illegal entry]] to the camp became highly sought after by refugees desperate to escape from Cambodia, and smuggling, theft and violence spiraled out of control.&lt;ref&gt;Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (U.S.), ''Seeking shelter: Cambodians in Thailand: a report on human rights''. 1987, New York: Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; In July and August 1980 UNHCR began transferring large numbers of refugees out of KID to Phanat Nikhom, Sa Kaeo II, Mairut, and Kap Choeng.&lt;ref&gt;Carney TM. ''Kampuchea, balance of survival''. Bangkok: Distributed in Asia by DD Books, 1981, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1982 the population had dropped to 40,134&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000123.htm "Surveillance of Health Status of Kampuchean Refugees at Khao-I-Dang Holding Center, Thailand." CDC: MMWR of Aug 12, 1983 / 32(31);412-5]&lt;/ref&gt; as refugees were [[refoulement|forcibly repatriated]], sent to third countries, or sent back to the border camps.&lt;ref name=Shawcross /&gt;

===Camp residents===
The presence at Khao-I-Dang of a large number of refugees with education and experience in administration, health, teaching, or technical skills reduced the language problems and allowed early involvement of refugees in all fields of activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Cambodian-Emergency-Refugee-Health-Care-1979-1980.pdf Grabe, Magnus, "Organization of Khao-I-Dang Center, November 1979-January 1980," in Allegra, Nieburg and Grabe, p. 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Cambodians recall spending some time at KID, including Dr [[Haing S. Ngor]] of [[The Killing Fields]], who (as a refugee) was employed in 1979 in the 400-bed ICRC hospital. The final scene in the movie was filmed at KID in 1983, in the surgical ward where Dr. Ngor had worked.&lt;ref&gt;Ngor, H. and R.

Water was brought in each day by trucks from supply areas 1–2&amp;nbsp;hours away (l0-15&amp;nbsp;liters/person/day in the camp and 50-60&amp;nbsp;liters/hospitalized patient/day).&lt;ref&gt;Grabe, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational and medical services were provided by Thai and international relief organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001493/149379eo.pdf Suenobu, Yumiko, "Management of education systems in zones of conflict-relief operations: a case-study in Thailand," 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; KID soon became the most serviced camp on the Thai-Cambodian border; indeed, it was probably the most elaborately serviced refugee camp in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:590 Rogge J, ''Return to Cambodia: the significance and implications of past, present, and future spontaneous repatriations''.

===Camp hospital===
ICRC chose KID for their first border [http://www.peshawar.ch/portfolio/portfolio-6.htm surgical hospital] where acute [[Physical trauma|trauma]] patients were cared for, at first mainly war wounded but later large numbers of [[landmine]] victims. Surgical equipment was donated from the [[France|French]] hospital ship ''L'Île de Lumière''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Cambodian-Emergency-Refugee-Health-Care-1979-1980.pdf Grabe, Magnus, "Surgery during Khmer Refugee Assistance Efforts in Thailand," in Allegra, Nieburg and Grabe, pp. 85-88.]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially two hospitals (A and B) were constructed with 900 beds each in 17 wards: four [[pediatric]] wards, including one intensive feeding center; two wards for [[gynecology]] and [[obstetrics]]; two surgical wards, including an admission and emergency center; one [[tuberculosis]] center; and eight general medicine wards, In addition, there was a surgical unit with two [http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/73404158/Hulton-Archive operating rooms] containing four operating tables, and a post-operative unit. There also were two hospital kitchens, a warehouse, a laboratory, and an [[x-ray]] room. Each ward housed 70-120 patients, and the maximal capacity of the entire facility was about 1,800 patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Cambodian-Emergency-Refugee-Health-Care-1979-1980.pdf Allegra, Nieburg and Grabe, p. 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:KID Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Interior of Khao-I-Dang Hospital Ward. Photo by Chhan Touch [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/photos/kid/ChhanTouch/811620-R1-E006.jpg].]]

The ICRC hospital began treating patients on November 27, 1979 and during its first 54&amp;nbsp;days of operation 521 surgeries were performed, 162 of these related to war injuries, including 22 amputations. Overall, 80% of operations were emergency surgery related to trauma, with the remainder performed to alleviate severe pain or bleeding. During the first two months an average of 9.5 operations per day were performed with a maximum of 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Cambodian-Emergency-Refugee-Health-Care-1979-1980.pdf Allegra, Nieburg and Grabe, pp. 87.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1980 Hospital B fell into disuse and was converted into smaller buildings for other purposes, some of which were destroyed [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/photos/kid/ChhanTouch/Untitled-92.jpg in a fire in 1981].&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Susott, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 1984, the medical teams working at KID ICRC Hospital consisted of four surgeons, four anaesthetists and 13 nurses sent by nine National [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross Societies]] ([[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]). The medical co-ordinator and the administrator of the hospital were sent by the [[New Zealand]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] Red Cross Societies respectively. Moreover, 120 Thai and Khmer medical staff assisted these teams in their work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RC_Jul-Aug-1984.pdf ''International Review of the Red Cross,'' July-August 1984, pp. 241-42.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]] visited Khao-I-Dang Hospital on August 6, 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19800806&amp;id=orUTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9Y8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4525,1186393 "UN Chief cuts short tour of flash points," ''New Straits Times,'' August 6, 1980, p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perez de Cuellar]] visited on January 27, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1828&amp;dat=19850128&amp;id=e0QoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GckEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1257,7388604 "UN Chief visits camps of refugees in Thailand," ''Anchorage Daily News,'' January 28, 1985, p.

== Camp closure ==
Khao-I-Dang's size steadily declined as its population was resettled in other countries. It eventually became a camp made up of persons who had been rejected for [[Refugee resettlement|resettlement]]; many had been rejected by more than one country. With the prospects of further resettlement diminishing, Thailand declared the camp closed at the end of December 1986. Relocations to border camps of the illegal camp residents began in March 1987. In response to international pressure, selection for resettlement of the residual population was extended again in 1988, after which Thai authorities officially decreed that all remaining refugees would be transferred to the border for [[repatriation]] to Cambodia. The residents of KID were vocal in opposition to what they felt was a [[non-refoulement|forced repatriation]] and held numerous demonstrations. By December 1989 camp population was 11,600.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:590 Rogge, p. 52.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The camp finally closed on 3 March 1993 during the [[UNTAC]] operation when all remaining residents were moved to [[Site Two Refugee Camp]] to await [[repatriation]] to Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/camps/Khao-I-Dang.html Khao-I-Dang - Thai / Cambodian Border Refugee Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; At the closing ceremony, then UNHCR [[Special Envoy]] [[Sérgio Vieira de Mello]] called KID a "powerful and tragic symbol" of the Cambodian exodus and the international humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0929636341 Braile, L.

==Zimbabwean farmers==
In 2001, neighbouring [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's government]] undertook aggressive land reform policies which included invasions of [[White people in Zimbabwe|farms owned by White Zimbabweans]]. Many of those farmers moved to Zambia and took up farming again. They produced [[maize]] and [[tobacco]] on large farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-07-06/news/0407060182_1_zambia-zimbabwe-tobacco Zimbabwe farmers set roots in Zambia] ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', 6 July, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Wyckaert''' (1923–1996) was a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] artist, born in 1923, in the city of Brussels. He is a neo-expressionistic, lyrical abstract painter, gouache designer and printmaker. He was educated at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts|Academy of Brussels]] (1940-47 and 1949-50) and in [[Sint-Joost-ten-Node]] and the Vrije Atelier of [[Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe]]. He debuted with wonderful expressionistic still life, reminiscent of Jean Brusselmans. Much early work dealt with stills of vegetables. Later Wyckaert became interested by [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]] and [[James Ensor]] and their ideas of [[Luminism (Impressionism)|luminism]].

In 1955 Wyckaert started to lyrically abstract interpret his environment, which contained noticeable influences of Eastern calligraphy. From this, he evolved to a dynamic abstract combination of attractive colors, which harmoniously shape a free interpretation of landscape. Although Wyckaert was already critically acclaimed, by receiving several honors such as the Jules Raeymaekers of the Royal Academy Award, an honorable mention by JPB (1957) and an honorable mention by [[Sao Paulo Art Biennial]] (1961), his true breakthrough began at the beginning of the 1970s. Around this time he started experimenting with gouache, printmaking and lithography.

Wyckaert was known for his pro-active involvement in several art movements such as being the Co-founder of Belgian art magazine ''De Meridiaan'' and ''Taptoe Brussels'' (1955). Also he was a  member of Présence (1949), the [[Situationist International]] (SI) and the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelbeta.net/2010/10/encobra-litaliaitcobra-litalia/?lang=en Letter ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054228/http://www.channelbeta.net/2010/10/encobra-litaliaitcobra-litalia/?lang=en |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and well known for his influence and intimate friendship with several [[CoBrA]]-members.

He was honored by the SI to read the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080820080547/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/ica.html ''Declaration in the Name of the Fourth SI Conference to the Institute of Contemporary Arts,''] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] on 28 September 1960.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elhajoui|title=Maurice Wyckaert – Galerie Van de Loo [1961]|url=https://situationnisteblog.wordpress.com/2018/03/24/maurice-wyckaert-galerie-van-de-loo-1961/|website=Situationniste Blog|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the city of Brussels started with art projects to enhance their underground, Wyckaert was appointed to decorate the [[Jacques Brel metro station]]. He has exhibited his work in several renowned museums from [[Rome]] to [[Sao Paulo]].

==Chief Editor of 'De Meridiaan'==
''De Meridiaan'', later published as '''De kunst-meridiaan''', was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[literature|literary]] [[magazine]] that published bimonthly in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] from 1951 until 1960. It was founded by Belgian artist Maurice Wyckaert, poet Clara Haesaert and her husband Gentil Haesaert. De Meridiaan was the main competitor of ''Tijd en Mens'', another literary magazine. Because of its success the magazine evolved from a basic regional magazine to a well-known international art magazine. In 1955 De Meridiaan founded ''Galerie Taptoe'', an artistic centrum, exhibition room and literary café in [[Brussels]].

A '''motion of no-confidence''', alternatively '''vote of no confidence''', or '''(unsuccessful) confidence motion''', is a statement or vote which states that a person(s) in a position of responsibility (government, managerial, etc.) is no longer deemed fit to hold that position, perhaps because they are inadequate in some respect, are failing to carry out obligations, or are making decisions that other members feel detrimental. As a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]], it demonstrates to the [[head of state]] that the elected parliament no longer has confidence in (one or more members of) the appointed [[Executive (government)|government]].

A censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion. Depending on the constitution of the body concerned, "No Confidence" may lead to dismissal of the [[Council of Ministers]] or other position-holder(s), whereas "Censure" is meant to show disapproval and does not result in the resignation of ministers. The censure motion can be against an individual minister or a group of ministers, but the no-confidence motion is directed against the entire [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Again, depending on the applicable rules, censure motions may need to state the reasons for the motion while no-confidence motions may not require reasons to be specified.

==Parliamentary systems==
There are a number of variations in this procedure in parliaments. In some countries a motion of no confidence can be directed at the government collectively or at any individual member, including the [[prime minister]]. In [[Spain]] it is presented by the prime minister after consultation. Sometimes motions of no confidence are proposed even though they have no likelihood of passage, simply to pressure a government or to embarrass its own critics, who may for political reasons decide not to vote against it.

In many [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], there are strict time limits for no confidence motions: they may only be allowed once every three, four or six months. Thus the timing of a motion of no confidence is a matter of political judgement; a motion of no confidence on a relatively trivial matter may prove counterproductive if a more important issue suddenly arises which actually warrants a motion of no confidence, because it cannot be proposed if one had been voted on recently. Sometimes, the government will choose to declare that one of its bills is a "motion of confidence" in order to prevent dissident members of their own party voting against it.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom}}
Traditionally, in the [[Westminster system]], the defeat of a [[supply bill]] (one that concerns the spending of money) is seen to automatically require the government to either resign or ask for a new election, much like a non-confidence vote.  A government in a Westminster system that cannot spend money is hamstrung, also called [[loss of supply]]. When the upper house of a Westminster system country has the right to refuse supply, such as in Australia during [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|the events of 1975]], the convention is in a grey area, as Westminster governments are not normally expected to maintain the confidence of the upper house.

Prior to 2011, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], a no-confidence motion generally first appeared as an [[early day motion]], although the vote on the [[Speech from the Throne]] also constituted a confidence motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m07.pdf |title=House of Commons Factsheet M7: Parliamentary Elections |publisher=House of Commons Information office |page=3 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], only a motion explicitly resolving "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government" is treated as a motion of no confidence.

===India===
In India, a motion of no confidence can be introduced only in the [[Lok Sabha]] (the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of India]]). The motion is admitted for discussion when a minimum of 50 members of the house support the motion.&lt;ref name="Current Lok Sabha hasn't seen trust vote, no-confidence motion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Current Lok Sabha hasn't seen trust vote, no-confidence motion|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-08-11/news/41295707_1_trust-vote-no-confidence-motion-no-confidence-motion|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=11 Aug 2013|quote=the move could not even take off as Banerjee's party failed to muster the support of even 506 members, the minimum required for bringing a no trust motion.|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the motion carries, the House debates and votes on the motion. If a majority of the members of the house vote in favour of the motion, the motion is passed and the Government is bound to vacate the office. [[Acharya Kripalani]] moved the first-ever no confidence motion on the floor of the Lok Sabha in August 1963, immediately after the disastrous [[Sino-Indian War|India–China War]].&lt;ref name="Procedure regarding motion of no-confidence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedure regarding motion of no-confidence|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rulep17.html|accessdate=9 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709234757/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rulep17.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rules of confidence|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rules-of-confidence/334634/0|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=12 July 2008|quote=What happens if the prime minister loses a motion of confidence? In such a case, he is obliged to resign}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, 27 no-confidence motions have been moved. Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] faced the most number of no-confidence motions – 15 times, followed by [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and [[P._V._Narasimha_Rao]] (thrice each), [[Morarji Desai]] (twice) and [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]], [[Rajiv Gandhi]],  [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Narendra Modi]] (once each). All the no-confidence motions have been defeated except when Prime Minister Morarji Desai resigned during the discussions on 12 July 1979 and most recently no-confidence motion against Narendra Modi's (BJP) government  was accepted by the lok sabha speaker, but was defeated..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History gives Congress a slight margin – 60:40|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/history-gives-congress-a-slight-margin-60-40/story-ykttDlla1f8TmOSpiWUuiJ.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=hindustantimes.com/|date=22 July 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LS to witness 26th no-confidence motion in its history|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/LS-to-witness-26th-no-confidence-motion-in-its-history/articleshow/134440.cms|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the anti-defection law, the vote of no-confidence has no relevance left in case the majority party has an absolute majority in the House. If the majority party (with an absolute majority in the House) issues a whip to party members to vote in favor of the Government, then it is impossible to remove the Government by a no-confidence motion. Hence the no-confidence exercise of House merely becomes the no-confidence exercise of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S|date=Jun 2017|title=Threatening Indian democratic system: Case of Anti-Defection Law|url=http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8546:threatening-indian-democratic-system-case-of-anti-defection-law&amp;catid=124:research&amp;Itemid=140|journal=The Voice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/costituzione_inglese.pdf Constitution of Italy]. Retrieved 3 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the government requires the support of both houses of [[Parliament]]. A vote of no confidence may be proposed if one tenth of the members of a single house sign the proposition and starting from three days before the appointed date, said vote can be brought into discussion. Following the case of [[Filippo Mancuso]] in 1995 and the subsequent [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] sentence in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giurcost.org/decisioni/1996/0007s-96.htm|title=Sentenza n. 7 del 1996|date=|accessdate=3 January 2015|publisher=giurcost.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to propose an individual vote of no confidence against a single [[Minister (government)|minister]] instead of the whole government.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="germanconst"&gt;[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf German Constitution Official English Translation] Article 67 - Vote of No Confidence&lt;/ref&gt; a vote of no confidence in the [[Chancellor of Germany|Federal Chancellor]] requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the [[President of Germany|Federal President]]. Thus, a motion of no confidence can only be brought forward if there is a positive majority for the new candidate (this variation is called a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]). The idea was to prevent crises of the state such as those found near the end of the German [[Weimar Republic]].  Frequently, Chancellors were turned out of office without their successors having enough parliamentary support to govern. Unlike the British system, the Chancellor does not have to resign in response to the failure of a vote of confidence, provided it has been initiated by them and not by the parliamentary opposition, but rather may ask the President to call general elections &amp;ndash; a request the President may or may not fulfill.

===Japan===
Article 69 of the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]] provides that "if the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] passes a non-confidence resolution, or rejects a confidence resolution, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] shall resign en masse, unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within ten (10) days."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Constitution of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In federal politics, a vote of no confidence takes down the government, and votes of no confidence may be asserted automatically if the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] rejects the government's budget. Provincial governments may also fall if a motion of no confidence is passed by the legislature or if the legislature fails to pass a confidence measure (e.g. the provincial budget).

In the [[consensus government]] system of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], in which the premier is chosen among and by a vote of the members of the non-partisan legislature, a vote of no confidence removes the premier and cabinet from office and permits the members to elect a new premier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2009/02/04/nwt-leg.html (CBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

In the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]], a motion of no-confidence requires a [[majority#Application in other voting requirements|majority of the members present]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to agree to it. The House of Representatives currently consists of 150 members; requiring 76 votes in favour of the motion when all members of the House are present. A straight vote of no confidence in a [[Australian Government|government]], or a motion or amendment censuring a government, has never been successful in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=AHoR/&gt; Despite this, on eight occasions governments have either resigned or advised a dissolution following their defeat on other questions before the House.&lt;ref name=AHoR/&gt; The last time a government resigned after being defeated in the House came in October 1941, when the House rejected the budget of [[Arthur Fadden]]'s minority government.

Specific motions of no confidence or [[censure|censure motion]]s against the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], ministers, the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Australian Senate|Senators]] and leaders of political parties have been moved and have been successful on some occasions. Motions of no confidence against the government may be passed in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], yet may have little or no impact in the House.&lt;ref name=AHoR&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter9&amp;section=07&amp;fullscreen=1 |title=Motions of no confidence and censure |work=House of Representatives Practice |edition=6th |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |location=Canberra |date= |accessdate=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
On 7 August 2017, Speaker [[Baleka Mbete]] announced that she would permit a motion of no confidence in [[Jacob Zuma]]'s government to proceed in the National Assembly via [[secret ballot]]. It was the eighth motion to be brought against Zuma in his presidency and the first to be held via secret ballot. After the vote was held the next day, the motion was defeated 198–177, with 25 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-zuma-survives-vote-of-no-confidence-20170808]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 20 [[ANC]] MPs voted in favor of the measure.

===Pakistan===
The [[Constitution of Pakistan]] has provision for a no-confidence motion in all constituents of the [[Electoral College (Pakistan)|Electoral College]] of the state. The motions can target speakers and deputy speakers of [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|provincial]] and [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan|national assemblies]], the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], [[List of current Pakistani chief ministers|chief ministers]] of provinces, as well as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]].&lt;ref name="CoP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch3.html|title=Part III: The Federation of Pakistan: Chapter 3: The Federal Government|last=|first=|date=|website=The Constitution of Pakistan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before it can be put for vote on the pertinent house's floor, it needs to have the backing of at least 20% of the elected members in all cases except those moved against speakers or deputy speakers, in which case there is no minimum support limit. After being put to vote, the motion is only deemed successful once passed by a majority.&lt;ref name="Pak"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/275417|title=Three speakers removed by opposition in past|last=|first=|date=19 December 2010|website=The News International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of history, the no-confidence has mostly been used in removing speakers and deputy speakers. Of the 11 times the motion has been invoked in the country's parliamentary history, 9 motions targeted these posts with 4 being effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/774105|title=BA passes no-confidence motion against Aslam Bhootani|last=|first=|date=26 December 2012|website=Dawn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pak" /&gt; An incumbent Prime Minister of Pakistan has only been subject to a no-confidence vote once, in November 1989, when [[Benazir Bhutto]] faced an ultimately unsuccessful motion moved by [[Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/02/world/bhutto-survives-as-no-confidence-vote-falls-short.html|title=Bhutto Survives as No-Confidence Vote Falls Short|last=Burns|first=John|date=2 November 1989|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is the case for a provincial chief minister, as the only instance of its use is the one moved against Chief Minister of [[List of Chief Ministers of Balochistan|Balochistan]], [[Sanaullah Zehri]] in January 2018, which was successful as Zehri resigned before the vote could take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1604243/1-pm-advises-cm-zehri-step-thwart-political-crisis-balochistan/|title=Balochistan CM Zehri quits to avoid no-trust vote|last=Zafar|first=Muhammad|date=9 January 2018|website=The Express Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semi-presidential systems==
In [[semi-presidential systems]], the legislature may occasionally pass motions of no confidence, which removes only the cabinet and prime minister, the legislature may also have the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] an executive or judicial officer, with another institution or the legislature removing the officer from their office.

===Russia===
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], the lower house of parliament (the [[State Duma]]) may by a [[majority|simple majority]] (i.e. at least 226 votes out of 450) pass a motion of no confidence against the [[Government of Russia]] as a whole. In this case, the matter goes for consideration of the [[President of Russia|President]], who may choose to dismiss the cabinet (which the President can do at any moment in time at his own discretion anyway) or just to ignore the Duma's decision. Should the Duma pass a second motion of no confidence against the same composition of the cabinet within three months, the President will be forced to make a concrete decision – to dismiss the government or to dissolve the Duma itself and call for new general elections. The State Duma may not be dissolved on these grounds if it was elected less than a year earlier, if it has already initiated impeachment proceedings against the President himself by bringing respective accusations, if less than six months is left until elections of the President, or if there is a state of emergency or martial law throughout the whole territory of Russian Federation. In the above-mentioned cases, the President would therefore be effectively forced to dismiss the Government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==History==
{{See also|List of prime ministers defeated by votes of no confidence}}
The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} when, following news of the [[Siege of Yorktown|British defeat at Yorktown]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]] the previous October, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] voted that they "can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers". [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] responded by asking [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to accept his resignation. This did not immediately create a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. During the early 19th century, however, attempts by prime ministers such as [[Robert Peel]] to govern in the absence of a parliamentary majority proved unsuccessful, and by the mid-19th century, the power of a motion of no confidence to break a government was firmly established in the UK.

In the United Kingdom, 11 prime ministers have been defeated through a no-confidence motion. There has been only [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|one]] (against [[James Callaghan]]) since 1925.

In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is a relatively rare event in two-party democracies. In almost all cases, [[party discipline]] is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence, and if faced with possible defections in the government party, the government is likely to change its policies rather than lose a vote of no confidence. The cases in which a motion of no confidence has passed are generally those in which the government party's slim majority has been eliminated by either [[by-election]]s or defections, such as the [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry]] in the UK which was carried by one vote, forcing a general election which was won by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

Motions of no confidence are far more common in multi-party systems in which a minority party must form a [[coalition government]]. This can mean that there have been many short-lived governments because the party structure allows small parties to defeat a government without means{{clarify|date=November 2015}} to create a government. This has widely been regarded as the cause of instability for the [[French Fourth Republic]] and the German [[Weimar Republic]]. More recent examples have been in [[Italy]] between the 1950s and 1990s, [[Israel]], and [[Politics of Japan|Japan]].

To deal with this situation, the French placed a greater degree of executive power in the office of its [[President of France|President]], who is immune from motions of no confidence, along with a [[Two-round system|two-round]] [[plurality voting system]] that makes easier the formation of stable [[majority government]]s.

In 2008, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], of the re-appointed minority government of Canada, requested that Governor-General Michaëlle Jean [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue Parliament]]. The request was granted, and it allowed the Prime Minister to delay a potential vote on the non-confidence motion presented by the opposition. (See [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]].) Three years later, in 2011, Harper's minority government was defeated by a motion of non-confidence declaring the government to be in [[contempt of Parliament]], leading to [[Canadian federal election, 2011|the election that year]].

In 2013, during the [[Euromaidan]] pro-EU riots, the opposition in [[Ukraine]] called for a motion of no confidence against the Cabinet of Ministers and pro-Russian, [[Euroskeptic]] Prime Minister [[Mykola Azarov]]. At least 226 votes were needed to gain a majority in the [[Verkhovna Rada]], Ukraine's parliament. However, it fell 40 votes short, and Azarov's government prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ukraine Government Survives No-Confidence Vote |last1=Marson |first1=James |last2=Bendavid |first2=Naftali |date=3 December 2013 |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304355104579235514281922206 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2018, the [[Rajoy government#Second Rajoy government (2016–2018)|Government]] of [[Mariano Rajoy]] was ousted after a motion of no confidence passed 180–169 following the sentence of the [[Gürtel case|Gürtel corruption scandal]] which involved the ruling party.

There are many '''motives for spying'''. [[Espionage]] usually carries heavy penalties, with spies often being regarded as [[treason|traitors]], so motivating factors for it must usually be quite strong.

There have been various attempts to explain why people become spies. One common theory is summed up by the acronym '''MICE''': '''M'''oney, '''I'''deology, '''C'''ompromise or '''C'''oercion (depending on source), and '''E'''go or '''E'''xtortion (depending on source). Another is the '''RASCLS''' framework:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burkett|first1=Randy|title=An Alternative Framework for Agent Recruitment: From MICE to RASCLS|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-57-no.-1-a/vol.-57-no.-1-a-pdfs/Burkett-MICE%20to%20RASCALS.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''R'''eciprocation, '''A'''uthority, '''S'''carcity, '''C'''ommitment and '''C'''onsistency, '''L'''iking, and '''S'''ocial Proof. Others have stressed the roles of disaffection, grudges, and personal links.

==Money==
For many spies, the primary motivation is the prospect of financial gain. Spies may seek to supplement their existing [[income]], or to remedy financial difficulties. Sometimes these spies are detected due to extravagant spending of the money they receive. [[John Anthony Walker]] is an example of a spy who worked for [[money]].

==Ideology, patriotism, or religion==
Some people become spies because of their beliefs. These can include political opinions, national allegiances, and cultural or religious beliefs. This was particularly true during the [[Cold War]], when many spies were motivated by their support for the ideologies of either the Western world or the [[Communism|Communist]] bloc. Examples of spies with ideological motivations include [[Kim Philby]] and [[Klaus Fuchs]] (communist), [[Fritz Kolbe]] and [[Juan Pujol (alias Garbo)|Juan Pujol]] (anti-Nazi), [[Nathan Hale]] (pro-American independence), [[Harriet Tubman]] (anti-slavery), and [[Ana Montes]] (pro-Cuban).

==Coercion==
Not all spies enter into service willingly; sometimes they are threatened into providing secret information.

Threats of injury or death are the most direct forms of coercion. For example, [[Mathilde Carré]], a member of the [[French Resistance]], was captured by the Nazis and threatened with torture unless she became a [[double agent]]. Threats may also be made against the target's family or friends—[[Svetlana Tumanova]] was told by the [[KGB]] that her family in the Soviet Union would be harmed if she did not cooperate; and [[Ronald Humphrey]] said that he had helped [[North Vietnam]] in order to obtain the release of his Vietnamese wife.

A more subtle form of coercion is [[blackmail]], where someone threatens to release compromising information about a person unless they provide them with secret information. A wide range of material can be used for blackmail, including evidence of [[extramarital affair]]s, [[homosexuality]], and undiscovered [[crime]]s. The spies [[John Vassall]] and Colonel [[Alfred Redl]] were threatened with revelations about their homosexuality. Sometimes, [[Honeypot (espionage)|traps of this sort]] may be laid to collect blackmail material; Vassall was almost certainly set up, as was [[Clayton J. Lonetree|Clayton Lonetree]], who was blackmailed after an affair with a Soviet agent. [[William G. Sebold|William Sebold]], a German-born American, was threatened by the [[Nazi]]s with revelations that he lied in order to immigrate. Sebold, however, quickly betrayed the Nazis, indicating a major problem with the use of coercion: The target, with no loyalty to their blackmailers, will turn on them when possible.

==Ego/Self-importance==
[[File:Robert Hanssen.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|[[Robert Hanssen]]'s spying was described by a U.S. Department of Justice's commission as "possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history"]]The roles of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[pride]] in motivating spies has occasionally been observed, but is often hard to demonstrate. In some situations, a person can be enticed to spy by the sense of importance or significance it gives them—they cease being a minor functionary, and have a substantial, albeit covert, effect. The target often gains a sense of superiority over his or her colleagues, whom he or she is outwitting. [[Robert Hanssen]] is an example of someone who, though paid handsomely, decided to spy due to [[wikt:arrogance|arrogance]].

==Excitement==
In rare cases a spy may be motivated by the excitement of tradecraft alone. It is possible, although hard to observe and demonstrate, that excitement and thrills play a part in some spies' decisions, and seems particularly likely if they are bored with their life. Excitement is seldom a spy's primary motivation, but may be a contributing factor. One notable example is [[Christopher Cooke]], who claimed to be fascinated with espionage, and who told investigators he specifically sought to involve himself in spycraft for that reason.

==Disaffection and grudges==
Some spies are motivated largely by personal, non-ideological hostility towards the country or organisation they are spying on. This may stem from some real or imagined wrong—a person may, for example, betray secrets to the enemy if they feel they have not received sufficient recognition or compensation, or that they have been treated badly. [[Liu Liankun]], a general in the [[People's Republic of China]], is believed to have begun spying for [[Taiwan]] after he was falsely accused of corruption and denied a promotion. Another case is that of [[Earl Edwin Pitts]], who, in defence of his espionage, cited various instances of alleged poor treatment by his employer, the FBI.

==Personal relations==
A spy may be motivated by personal connections and relationships. In some cases, secret information may be passed on due to a family connection, friendship, romantic link or sexual relationship. The spouses and friends of active spies may be drawn into the spy's activities; an example is Rosario Ames, wife of [[Aldrich Ames]].

==Sex==
{{see|Clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting#Love, honeypots and recruitment}}
Sexual [[Clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting#Love, honeypots, and recruitment|seduction]] is a well-established means of spy recruitment. For example, [[Katrina Leung]] was accused of using this method to gain access to secret [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] counterintelligence documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13245">A '''clerk''' is a senior official of many [[municipal government]]s in the English-speaking world.  In some communities, including most in the United States, the position is elected, but in many others, the clerk is appointed to their post.  In almost all cases, the actual title of the clerk reflects the type of municipality he or she works for, thus, instead of simply being known as the ''clerk'', the position is generally referred to as the '''town clerk''', '''township clerk''', '''city clerk''', '''village clerk''', '''borough clerk''', '''board secretary''', or '''county clerk'''.  Other titles also exist, such as '''recorder'''. The office has existed for centuries, though in some places it is now being merged with other positions.

The duties of a municipal clerk vary even more than their titles. Particularly in the United States, it is difficult to fully describe a clerk's duties, because there are hundreds of different jobs a clerk may fulfill.  In some U.S. states, there ''are'' provisions in the state constitutions delineating the clerk's duties,&lt;ref name="justia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2010/60/60.33.html |title=60.33 Duties of town clerk. :: Chapter 60.

==History==
The origins of the position of "clerk" are unclear.  In [[ancient Greece]] there were secretaries for each [[polis]] who read official documents publicly and at the opening of a meeting read public [[curse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeHPGhIfgrYC |title=Literacy and orality in ancient Greece - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early keepers of the archives were often called remembrancers, and before writing came into use, their memory was public record.  When the early colonists came to America, one of the first offices established was that of clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westerly.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={66DF58E6-9381-4FD9-B6DB-6B7EE81794FD} |title=TOWN CLERK - WESTERLY, Rhode Island |publisher=Westerly.govoffice.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colony at Plymouth appointed a person to act as a recorder.

==Australia==
In [[New South Wales]] state,  for over a century, the chief administrative officer of a city or borough was also legally designated the Town Clerk.  This continued until 1993, when the NSW Local Government Act 1993 was passed and the Officer became called the 'General Manager of the Local Council/Shire'.

==Canada==

Major Canadian city councils will have a city clerk as chief administrative officer:

* [[Toronto City Council#City Clerk of Toronto|City Clerk, Toronto]]
* City Clerk, Winnipeg
* City Clerk, Yellowknife
* City Clerk, Regina
* Common Clerk, Saint John
* City Clerk, Hamilton
* Municipal Clerk, Halifax
* City Clerk, Mississauga
* Waterloo, CAO
* City Clerk, Vancouver
* City Clerk, Vaughan
* Council Services Clerk, Whitehorse
* City Clerk, Montreal

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], for over a century, the chief administrative officer of a city or borough was also legally designated the Town Clerk.  This continued until the 1970s, when the city and [[county]] administrative procedures were largely merged and the [[Local Government Act 1974 (NZ)|Local Government Act 1974]] declared that every such person (along with his or her rural counterpart, the [[county clerk]]) should henceforth be [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] the "Chief Administrative Officer".

The [[Local Government Act 2002]] changed the title again, this time to Chief Executive.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the town clerk is the senior administrative officer of the city, borough or town, usually the most senior salaried employee of the council. In most [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] the town clerk has now been renamed the [[chief executive]], although the original name is retained in most smaller towns. The town clerks of the larger [[county borough]]s frequently received [[Knight Bachelor|knighthoods]], and the chief executives of large authorities sometimes still do. The equivalent officer in [[counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] and [[districts of England|districts]] was the clerk to the council (now also designated chief executive) and in (non-town) [[civil parish|parishes]] is the parish clerk, usually part-time, but still a paid official, whose main responsibility is the administration and minuting of parish council meetings and parish council finance.  The [[Town Clerk of London]] is an important executive position with a staff and significant budget.

On ceremonial occasions, the town clerk wears a gown of black silk ottoman/grosgrain of the lay pattern with panel sleeves and a flap collar. The gown is trimmed with rows of [[braid]] and tassels. This gown is similar to the gown of undergraduate [[fellow]] and gentleman-commoners in the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The town clerk also wears a [[wig]] similar to that of [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civicrobes.com/Pages/Robes/Civic/Civic.htm |title=Michaels Civic Robes |publisher=Civicrobes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winchelsea.com/gallery_corporation.html |title=Presentation to Malcolm Pratt, Town Clerk, 2009 |publisher=Winchelsea.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the clerk often serves as the official keeper of the municipal records, and as such, is sometimes described as the "historian" of the community.&lt;ref name="City Clerk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofcarlsbadnm.com/CityClerk.cfm |title=City Clerk |publisher=cityofcarlsbadnm.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the Clerk's Office is limited to just presenting the [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] and [[minutes]] for the legislative and committee meetings. Official meetings of municipalities can become a serious chore as the activity in the town increases with a larger population.  The task of assembling the agenda packets with supporting documents can take several days for a single meeting.  It becomes more complicated due to the input and iterative modification by numerous departments and agencies, both within and external to the organization. Software applications that can easily assemble agendas, minutes, and even automatically transcribe the meetings are now becoming more common. Often, these agendas and meeting minutes are downloadable by interested citizens by accessing the organization's website.

There are over 3,200 County Clerks and county equivalent court clerks in the United States. County Clerks can help genealogists and family researchers locate various physical documents including marriage (licenses), divorce, arrest, public, jail, judicial, probate, criminal, and court records.&lt;ref name=County-Clerks.com&gt;{{cite web|title=County Clerks|url=http://www.county-clerks.com|website=www.county-clerks.com|publisher=County-Clerks.com|accessdate=21 August 2014|ref=County-Clerks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerks may also be responsible for issuing licenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memun.org/SchoolsProject/Resources/officials/town_clerk.htm |title=Town Clerk, job description |publisher=Memun.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; overseeing local elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.milton.de.us/media/Town_Clerk.pdf |title=Milton, Delaware, Town Clerk job description |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining financial records,&lt;ref name="justia1"/&gt; serving as registrar of vital statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantny.com/departments/clerk.php |title=Town of Brant New York |publisher=Brantny.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasingly, for assuring the transparency of the municipality's conduct of business.&lt;ref name="City Clerk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Louise |first=Sarah |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/technology-for-transparency/Content?oid=1103071 |title=Technology for Transparency &amp;#124; Our Town |publisher=Chicago Reader |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
In [[California]], the City Clerk is the local official who administers democratic processes such as elections, access to city records, and all legislative actions ensuring transparency to the public.  The City Clerk acts as a compliance officer for federal, state, and local statutes including the Political Reform Act, the Brown Act, and the [[California Public Records Act|Public Records Act]].  The City Clerk manages public inquiries and relationships and arranges for ceremonial and official functions.

===Illinois===
In [[Illinois]], clerks may also exist on the ''[[Civil township|township]]'' level, which is a subdivision of the county.  Such clerks are sometimes required to serve more than one governmental unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dekalbtownship.com/board/clerks-duties/ |title=Clerk’s Duties :: DeKalb Township, Illinois |publisher=Dekalbtownship.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the often overlapping jurisdictions that exist in Illinois.

===Massachusetts===
In [[Massachusetts]], the Town Clerk is the chief election official of a [[New England town|town]] and the keeper of permanent and [[vital record]]s.  The duties of Town Clerks vary slightly in each community.  Massachusetts clerks who have been in office five or more years may be elected by special ballot initiative to a lifetime term with [[mandatory retirement]] at age 70, after which they may remain in office if they run for successive terms.

===New York===
[[New York state]] law provides for elected [[Town (New York)|Town]] and County Clerks who have separately defined responsibilities. (Under Article XIII, §13(a) of the [[New York Constitution]], the County Clerks within [[New York City]] are not elected, but instead "shall be appointed, and be subject to removal, by the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|appellate division of the supreme court]] in the judicial department in which the county is located."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of The State of New York, Article 13 - Public Officers|url=https://www.dos.ny.gov/info/constitution/article_13_public_officers.html|website=New York State Department of State|accessdate=5 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) For example, marriage licenses and dog licenses are issued by town clerks while business certificates and real property deeds are maintained by county clerks. Appointed historians are also required at each level. City clerks may administer elections but, outside cities, county election commissioners head the election apparatus.

===West Virginia===
[[West Virginia]] Code provides for an elected '''recorder''' in Class IV towns (those with fewer than 2,000 people) and in some larger municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.wvlegislature.gov/8-5-7/ |title=West Virginia Code §8-5-7. Certain officers; wards or election districts; residency and other requirements. |publisher=West Virginia Legislature |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By default, recorders act as [[Pro_tempore#Mayor_pro_tem|mayor pro tem]] of the municipal government in the absence of the actual mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.wvlegislature.gov/8-10-3/ |title=West Virginia Code §8-10-3. Powers and duties of recorder. |publisher=West Virginia Legislature |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recorders also serve as members of and secretary to the city or town [[City_council|council]], as well as [[recorder of deeds]], [[archivist]], and municipal supervisor of elections. In some smaller towns' governments, recorders additionally fill the role of financial officer. Many municipalities delegate some or all of these duties to an employee with the title of city or town clerk, while others may divide them between the recorder and the clerk. The recorder or clerk may even have authority by ordinance to issue warrants for arrest, although this power normally resides in a municipal judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.wvlegislature.gov/8-10-4/ |title=West Virginia Code §8-10-4.

{{update|date=November 2010}}
'''''New York State Restaurant Association v. New York City Board of Health''''' is a case decided by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit United States Court of Appeals]]. The case arose after New York City passed a law in January 2007 to become the first American city to require [[restaurant chains]] to state the number of [[calories]] in everything on their menus.  The [[National Restaurant Association|New York State Restaurant Association]] (NYSRA) sued, arguing infringement of commercial freedom of speech under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name = "econ"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NYSRA also argued that the [[Nutrition Labeling and Education Act]] (NLEA) of 1990&lt;ref name="law"&gt;21 U.S.C. §§ 301, et seq., ("NLEA")&lt;/ref&gt; and FDA regulations [[Wiktionary:preempt|preempted]] New York's calorie posting regulation.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Food Labeling |journal=American Medical Association |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/17845.html#New_York_Restaurant_Assoc |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AFood+Labeling&amp;as_publication=American+Medical+Association&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032508/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/17845.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Circuit rejected all of the Restaurant Association's claims and upheld the New York City law. Congressman [[Henry Waxman]], who was the NLEA's chief sponsor, joined an [[amicus brief]] in support of New York City's position and was represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group.&lt;ref name="wax"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9593">A '''PIK''', or '''payment in kind''', is a type of high-risk [[loan]] or [[bond (finance)|bond]] that allows borrowers to pay [[interest (finance)|interest]] with additional debt, rather than cash. That makes it an expensive, high-risk financing instrument since the size of the debt may increase quickly, leaving lenders with big losses if the borrower is unable to pay back the loan.&lt;ref name = ft/&gt;

==Types==
There are three types of PIKs, which are characterized by differences in interest repayment.&lt;ref name="debev"&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = David A. Brittenham | author2= Scott B. Selinger |title=Everything Old Is New Again: PIK Notes|journal=Debevoise &amp; Plimpton Insights|date=Winter 2014| volume=14|issue=1| url= https://www.debevoise.com/insights/publications/2014/03/everything-old-is-new-again-pik-notes|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===True PIKs===
True PIKs, also known as "mandatory" PIKs, establish the interest payment structure at the time of issuance. That is to say, there is "no variation from period to period other than as scheduled at the time of issuance". Interest is required to be paid solely in kind or through a combination of cash and in kind interest, and may shift to all cash at a given point in time, but all of this is predetermined and agreed upon at issuance.&lt;ref name = debev/&gt;

===PIK toggles===
PIK toggles, also known as "pay if you want", are slightly less risky than PIKs, as borrowers pay interest in cash and may "toggle" to payment in kind at the discretion of the borrower ("pay if you want").&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Sometimes, the borrower may also be able to PIK some portion of the interest (usually half) while paying the rest in cash; at times, only some of the interest may be paid in kind and the rest is cash-only. This also benefits borrowers, as they may opt for early payment of interest in cash, thereby minimizing the compounded payout at maturity.&lt;ref name="alpha"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Paul|title=This is nuts. PIK toggle edition|url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/09/08/2174362/this-is-nuts-pik-toggle-edition/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=FT Alphaville|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation often provides that if the PIK feature is activated, the interest rate is increased by 25, 50, or 75 [[basis points]].&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

The first company to try a PIK toggle was [[Neiman Marcus]] in late 2005.&lt;ref name="hyb"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a high yield bond?|url=http://www.highyieldbond.com/primer/#!piks|publisher=HighYieldBond.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingent PIK toggles===
This is a different type of PIK toggle, also known as "contingent cash pay" or "pay if you can", where borrowers pay interest in cash and only "toggle" to payment in kind under certain conditions; for example, if there is insufficient cash, usually determined by a [[cash flow]] trigger.&lt;ref name = debev/&gt;

==Uses==
PIKs are primarily used for [[leveraged buyouts]], dividend recapitalizations,&lt;ref name = tt/&gt; and, more rarely, to finance acquisitions.&lt;ref name = forbes/&gt;

===Leveraged buyouts===
In leveraged buyouts, PIKs is used if the purchase price of the target exceeds [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] levels up to which [[lenders]] are willing to provide a [[senior loan]], a [[second lien loan]], or a [[mezzanine loan]], or if there is no cash flow available to service a loan (i.e., due to [[dividend]] or [[merger]] restrictions). It is typically provided to the acquisition vehicle, either another company or a [[special purpose entity]] (SPE), and not to the target itself.

PIKs in leveraged buyouts typically carry a substantially higher interest and [[fee]] burden compared to senior loans, second lien loans, and [[Mezzanine capital|mezzanine loans]] of the same transaction. With [[yield (finance)|yield]] exceeding 20% per annum, the acquirer has to be very diligent in assessing whether the cost of a PIK does not exceed the [[internal rate of return]] of equity investment.

Before the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|credit crunch of 2008]], several leveraged buyouts have seen some secured second-lien term bank loans coming with PIK or, more frequently, PIK toggle features, in order to support the firm's ability to cover cash interest during the initial period after the leveraged buyouts. If the acquired company performs well, the PIK toggle feature allows the equity sponsor to avoid giving extraordinary returns to the PIK debt, which might happen if the debt were strictly PIK. The PIK toggle largely disappeared in the wake of the credit crunch, though in early 2013 there were signs of a tentative comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe’s CFOs Do the PIK Toggle Again|url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/europes-cfos-do-the-pik-toggle-again/|work=CFO Insight|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards mid-2013, PIK toggle loans returned in force as the high-yield bond market in the United States and, to some degree, Europe shifted into high gear.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Millar|first1=Luke|title=PIK Toggle Bonds Gain Traction In Europe's High Yield Mart|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/spleverage/2013/05/09/pik-toggle-bond-deals-gain-traction-in-europes-high-yield-mart|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Forbes|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One high-profile use of PIKs involved the [[Glazer ownership of Manchester United|controversial takeover]] of [[Manchester United Football Club]] by [[Malcolm Glazer]] in 2005. Glazer used PIK loans, which were sold to hedge funds, to fund the takeover, much to the displeasure of many of the club’s supporters,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/08/06/cccrisis106.xml&amp;CMP=ILC-mostviewedbox "Credit crisis one year on: Risky debt notes could be a losing game"]&lt;/ref&gt; because the burden of the debt was placed on the club itself, not the Glazers.

In January 2018, Irish entrepreneur [[Paul Coulson]] used a $350 million PIK bond to pay a dividend to a group of shareholders at the [[Ardagh Group]], for which Coulson is the largest shareholder and chairman. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' interpreted the use of a high-risk PIK bond to be indicative of "the level of risk that debt investors are willing to tolerate as they seek higher yields in hot credit markets".&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=Hot market greets ‘super PIK’ bonds sold by Irish billionaire|url=https://www.ft.com/content/985507cc-f7a8-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Financial Times|date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual because the PIK was raised by a newly formed holding company, with analysts and investors referring to the novel structure as a "SuperHoldCo PIK note" or "super PIK".&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

== Return and interest ==

PIKs are typically unsecured (i.e., not backed by a pledge of assets as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]) and/or are characterized by a deeply [[Subordinated debt|subordinated]] security structure (e.g., third lien).&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite news|title=PIK notes and loans|url=http://treasurytoday.com/2008/05/pik-notes-and-loans|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=TreasuryToday.com|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kwm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Understanding PIK|url=http://www.kwm.com/en/uk/knowledge/insights/pik-facilities-20151110|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=King &amp; Wood Mallesons|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maturities usually exceed five years and the PIK usually carries a detachable [[warrant (finance)|warrant]]—the right to purchase a certain number of shares of stock or bonds at a given price for a certain period of time—or another mechanism that allow the lender to share in the future success of the business. This makes it a [[hybrid security]].

PIK lenders, typically special funds, look for a certain minimum [[internal rate of return]], which can come from three major sources: arrangement fees, PIKs, and warrants (there are also minor sources, like [[ticking fees]]). The arrangement fee, which is usually payable up-front, contributes the least return and serves to cover administrative costs. PIKs accrue interest period after period, thus increasing the underlying principal (i.e., [[compound interest]]). The achieved selling price of the shares acquired under the warrant is also a part of the total return of the lender. Typically, refinancing PIK loans in the first years is either completely restricted or comes at a high premium (i.e. [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] protection) to meet the internal requirements of investing funds.&lt;ref name =tt/&gt;

Interest on PIKs is substantially higher than debt of higher priority, thus making the compound interest the dominating part of the repayable principal. In addition, PIK loans typically carry substantial [[refinancing risk]], meaning that the [[cash flow]] of the borrower in the repayment period will usually not suffice to repay all monies owed if the company does not perform excellently. By that definition, PIK lenders prefer borrowers with strong growth potential. Because of the flexibility of the loan, there are basically no limits to structures and borrowers. Plus, in most jurisdictions the accruing interest is tax deductible, providing the borrower with a substantial [[tax shield]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5311">{{About||the film|Pocket Listing (film)|the legal loophole|Pocket contract}}
A '''pocket listing''' or  '''hip pocket listing''' is a [[real estate]] industry term used in [[United States]] which denotes a property where a [[Real estate broker/agent|broker]] holds a signed [[listing agreement]] (or contract) with the seller, whether that be an "Exclusive Right to Sell" or "Exclusive Agency" agreement or contract, but where it is never advertised nor entered into a [[Multiple Listing Service|multiple listing system]] (MLS), or where advertising is limited for an agreed-upon period of time.  In Canada, this is referred to as an '''Exclusive Listing'''.

== Background ==
The reasons for a pocket listing may vary from the need for privacy or secrecy to discrimination, and some sellers may have their own reasons for not advertising a listing in conventional ways, including wanting to sell only to certain types of people. Several legitimate marketing strategies can also lead sellers to choose pocket listings. Pocket listings can be very appealing to buyers who seek exclusive opportunities. Other legitimate reasons for a seller to decide to do a pocket listing include the potential for a faster, smoother transaction when the listing agent has buyer clients who may be interested in the property. It can reduce the need for many showings to strangers.

Many full-time agents have knowledge of pocket listings in their own office or in other offices of their own company.  While many MLS systems may try to limit this type of listing by requiring execution of a written notice relative to the benefits of MLS publicity, they may encourage members to refrain from taking pocket listings.  There are some companies which list property as pocket listings for a short time before entering it into their MLS.  With the written agreement of the seller, this would allow the company to try to obtain both the listing side and the "selling" side of the commission, an industry term known as "both sides of the transaction".  The L.A. Loft Blog reports that up to 45% of transactions in Downtown Los Angeles since 2011 have been off-market, private listings such as pocket listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laloftblog.com/category/pocket-listings-2/ |title=Pocket Listings |date=October 19, 2014 |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |publisher=LAloftBlog.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A real estate company which is not a member of any MLS may have pocket listings, but may  still be willing  to cooperate with other real estate professionals in the sale of their listings.

A broker or agent having a Pocket Listing can sometimes imply that the property will be sold directly to a buyer by the seller's agent.

Some brokerages are starting to provide private pocket listing services for the public and investors that allow them to act as a dual-agent in the transaction. Most notably, Pocket Deed has recently opened to the public from Beta testing in the Portland, OR area that allows brokers to promote their pocket listings in a centralized location. They secure Pocket Listings by keeping the exact property address hidden and display the property location within a 1/2 mile radius of where the property is located. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jessica|first1=P|title=PocketDeed.com - Pocket Listings|url=https://pocketdeed.com|website=PocketDeed.com|publisher=PocketDeed.com|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price ranges ==
Pocket listings may be used for properties of any price. Pocket listings are not restricted to the most exclusive high-end homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homeqt.com/|title=Pocket Listings - Find homes that are not in the MLS - HomeQT|website=Pocket Listings from HomeQT|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with open listings ==
Pocket listings are not "Open Listings".  An open listing is an Agreement between a seller and a broker whereby the property is available for sale by any [[real estate]] professional who can advertise, show, or negotiate the sale, and whoever brings an acceptable offer would receive compensation.  

[[Real estate]] companies will typically require that a written agreement for an open listing be signed by the seller to ensure the payment of a commission. "For Sale By Owners" ([[FSBO]]s) often also offer open listings by signing an agreement to pay a broker who brings them an acceptable offer, but these will usually not be pocket listings.

== Comparison with Exclusive Right to Sell ==
In an "Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement", the broker normally agrees to cooperate with other brokers and to share a portion of the total real estate commission paid by the seller.  However, in a pocket listing situation, it is stated that the property shall not be placed in an MLS, and thus there is no agreement to work cooperatively with other brokers. 

An alternative form of Agreement might be "Exclusive Agency" where only the broker is given the right to sell the property, and no offer of compensation is ever made to another broker.  In that case, the property will never be entered into an MLS.

'''Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (RUEI)''' (also known as the '''Fox Report''')  was a committee established by the [[Whitlam Government]] in [[Australia]], which sought to explore the environmental concerns surrounding [[uranium mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (1976-1977)|url=http://www.atns.net.au/agreement.asp?EntityID=1726|publisher=ATNS|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium mining – Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, 1975–77|url=http://guides.naa.gov.au/records-about-northern-territory/part2/chapter14/14.2.aspx|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==
{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}
According to the [[National Archives of Australia]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inquiry found that if uranium mining was properly regulated and controlled, its hazards were not sufficient to prevent the development of the mines. The Inquiry recommended the establishment of a comprehensive system of environmental monitoring and research, overseen by a coordinating committee representing all the agencies involved, and chaired by a supervising scientist. It also recommended the granting of Aboriginal title to a substantial part of the region and the creation of a national park.&lt;ref name=NAA /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Rhythms of Resistance''', sometimes abbreviated to '''RoR''', is a network of [[percussion instrument|percussion]] bands that play at [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[direct action]]s that fall within the broad definition of '[[anti-capitalist]]'. Since RoR London was formed in 2000, similar groups have arisen around the world; while not all such bands use the Rhythms of Resistance name, they generally share the same [[ideology]], described on the RoR website:

# We are an activist anti-capitalist transnational network, using samba as a form of political action.
# We use tactical frivolity, inspired by carnival, to confront and critique systems of domination and directly support everybody struggling against exploitation, discrimination and oppression.

The RoR bands are often referred to as the "samba bands", although many bands incorporate instruments and rhythms from outside of the [[samba|samba genre]].

RoR has similarities to the [[Afro Bloc]] parading drum bands that emerged in the mid 1970s in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador da Bahia]] in [[Brazil]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Bands such as [[Ilê Aiyê]] and [[Olodum]] formed as a political expression of black awareness, resisting economic exclusion. Coming out of some impoverished urban communities, Afro blocs became a mobilising focus on picket lines and marches.

Rhythms of Resistance formed as part of the UK [[Earth First]] action against the [[International Monetary Fund]]/[[World Bank]] meeting in [[Prague]] in September 2000. A [[Pink and Silver]] [[carnival]] bloc, focused around a fifty-five piece band, detached itself from a march of 67,000 and outmaneuvered police resources defending the IMF annual summit. The protests also included a [[black bloc]] and a group from the Italian [[Ya Basta]] movement, and led to the shutting down of the summit.

Following this event, similar groups formed elsewhere making use of the same tactics. The [[RoR Amsterdam|Amsterdam band]] formed in for the Rising Tide Actions against the [[Cop6]] Climate Conference in November 2000 and joined together with ten drummers from Rhythms of Resistance to form a sixty-five piece band. Rhythms of Resistance groups can now be found across Europe and in North America.

'''Roelof (Roefie) Hueting''' (born December 16, 1929) is a Dutch [[economist]], former Head of the Department for Environmental Statistics of [[Statistics Netherlands]], pianist and leader of the Down Town Jazz Band, known for the developed of the concept of [[Sustainable National Income]] (SNI).

== Biography ==
Hueting was born in [[The Hague]], son of Bernardus Hueting and Elisabeth Hueting-Steinvoorte.&lt;ref&gt;''The Environment Encyclopedia and Directory 2001''. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 1 jan. 2001. p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he founded the Down Town Jazz Band, and earned his living as musician during his studies at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. Started in 1951, he received his MA in [[Economics]] in 1959.&lt;ref name ="EI 2001"&gt;Ekko Ierland, Jan van der Straaten, Herman R. J. Vollebergh (2001) ''Economic Growth and Valuation of the Environment: A Debate''. Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 he obtained his Ph.D. in economics (cum laude) at the [[University of Groningen]] with the thesis "New scarcity and economic growth: More welfare through less production?" under supervision of [[Jan Pen]].

In 1959 he started as assistant public accountant. From 1962 till 1969 he was labour market researcher at the Ministry of Social Affairs, and from 1965 till 1968 at the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning.&lt;ref name ="EI 2001"/&gt; After joining the [[Statistics Netherlands]] in 1969 he founded its Department of Environmental Statistics. Until his retirement in 1994 he chaired the Department for Environmental Statistics.

In 1991 he was decorated Officer of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]], and in 1994 awarded the United Nation [[Global 500 Roll of Honour|Global 500]] award.&lt;ref name ="EI 2001"/&gt;

== Work ==
Hueting developed the theoretical and practical framework of the [[Sustainable national income]] (SNI). Already in 1970 he published a collection of articles over the years 1967-1970 titled: “What is nature worth to us?”. He has analyzed the environment from the neoclassical point of view of [[scarcity]] and developed the concept of [[Sustainable National Income]] (SNI). The implication of the SNI is that the statistical measure of [[economic growth]] is revised.

=== Economics and the environment ===
The concept of sustainability was presented for the first time at The World Conservation Strategy, IUCN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iucn.org/en/about/&lt;/ref&gt; 1980: "This is the kind of development that provides real improvements in the quality of human life and at the same time conserves the vitality and diversity of the Earth. The goal is development that will be sustainable. Today it may seem visionary but it is attainable. To more and more people it also appears our only rational option". (UNEP, IUCN, WWF)

There are various possible descriptions of this area of research but a good one is provided as follows:

:"The increase in human numbers and economic activity has put Homo Sapiens in a position to influence nearly every flow of energy and matter on Earth. Explaining the extent and impacts of this influence is well beyond the theory and analytical tools of individual disciplines, such as economics or ecology. A new interdisciplinary approach is needed, one that unites the relevant aspects of different disciplines...

:The theory and tools necessary to understand the relation among human populations, natural resources, the environment, and economic growth are brought together in the discipline of ecological economics. Ecological economics emphasizes the flow of matter and energy among socioeconomic systems and their environment. The methods of ecological economics can be used to provide a more thorough understanding of economy-environment interactions than that offered by a traditional economic analysis"&lt;ref&gt;(Quoted from [http://web.centre.edu/enviro/environmental%20web2/new_page_32.htm Boston University])&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of ecological suicide are given by Jared Diamond in his book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]''.

[[Neoclassical economics]] finds opposition from [[ecological economics]], while that opposition would be less needed due to Hueting's more neoclassical analysis of the environment. The neoclassical SNI has different results than e.g. [[Robert Costanza]] et al. (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Costanza]] et al. (1997), "The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital", Nature 387:253-260.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that more discipline is required in this discipline.

'''Root Force''' is a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]], [[decentralized]], international [[direct action|direct-action]] campaign devoted to "[dismantling] the system that is killing and enslaving [the] planet and its people."&lt;ref&gt;"Root Force Mission Statement," http://www.rootforce.org/what-is-root-force/mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; Its slogan is "Demolishing [[Colonialism]] At Its Foundations."&lt;ref name="Root Force"&gt;[http://www.rootforce.org Root Force&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign Philosophy and Strategy==

Root Force describes itself as "a strategic campaign designed to exploit weak points in the [[global economy]] and hasten the system’s collapse. Root Force ... promotes anti-[[infrastructure]] analysis and action, based on the recognition that infrastructure expansion is a weak point of the system." &lt;ref&gt;"What is Root Force?" http://www.rootforce.org/what-is-root-force/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Root Force campaign incorporates analysis characteristic of the Latin American solidarity, [[radical environmentalism|radical environmental]] and [[anti-globalization movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.indymedia.org/news/2006/11/6603.php Root Force Road Show Comes To South Florida! Nov 14 - 15 : Miami IMC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to campaign literature, ills such as environmental destruction, war, and [[genocide]] against [[indigenous peoples]] are caused by a global system and cannot be eliminated without eliminating that system. As examples of the names given to this system, Root Force cites "'[[neoliberalism]],' '[[capitalism]],' 'the [[Sovereign state|state]]' or '[[civilization]].'"&lt;ref name="The Root Force Strategy"&gt;[http://www.rootforce.org/what-is-root-force/strategy/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign strategy is founded on the premise that the [[United States|US]] economy depends upon imports from [[Latin America]] to continue functioning, and that these imports depend upon "transportation, energy, and communications infrastructure.".&lt;ref&gt;"Root Force Mission Statement&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Root Force opposes infrastructure expansion projects such as the [[Plan Puebla Panama]] and the [[Initiative for the Integration of South American Infrastructure]].

Like other segments of the [[anti-globalization]] movement, it also directs criticism and encourages action against international financial institutions, including the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/136667/index.php DC Indymedia: IADB and other STRATEGIC TARGETS in DC against &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; and its destruction of Latin America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Earth First!'' 26:6 pp 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

An eight-page spread about Root Force was published in the September–October 2006 issue of the [[Earth First!]] Journal.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth First!'' 26:6 pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the campaign sought to interfere with the expansion of [[International trade|global trade]] [[infrastructure]] in [[Latin America]] by targeting the corporations involved in specific infrastructure projects: [[La Parota dam]] in [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]] and the [[Anillo Periférico]] highway in [[San Salvador, El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil "Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges", Indiana University, 2013, available at: http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/8833?show=full&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, a "Root Force Road Show" traveled the eastern US to publicize the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rochester.indymedia.org/newswire/display/19715/index.php Rochester IMC: Root Force Road Show Rolls into Rochester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a western road show in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;["Anarchists for Humanity: the Root Force Road Show" http://www.cityonahillpress.com/2007/05/03/anarchists-for-humanity-the-root-force-road-show/&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Root Force, along with [[Rising Tide North America]], Arizona [[Earth First!]] and a Florida group called Justicia Global, called for boycotts and protests of [[CompUSA]], [[Kmart]] and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] due to links between those companies and plans for [[La Parota dam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://azef.org/2007/02/08/activists-demand-that-compusa-sears-kmart-end-involvement-in-controversial-mexican-dam/ Arizona Earth First! » Blog Archive » Activists Demand that CompUSA, Sears, Kmart End Involvement in Controversial Mexican Dam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Root Force issued a statement titled "A Revised Strategy," &lt;ref&gt;[Root Force: A Revised Strategy http://www.rootforce.org/2008/02/10/a-revised-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt; saying that because the campaign had failed to generate [[direct action]] against [[La Parota dam]] or the Anillo Periférico to date, the group would be changing its focus to promoting anti-infrastructure analysis and action, providing resources for those fighting infrastructure, and facilitating connections between people and groups fighting infrastructure.

[[File:If You Talk Too Much This Man May Die mirror.jpg|right|thumb|Secrecy is sometimes considered of life or death importance. U.S. soldier at camp during [[World War II]].]]
'''Secrecy''' (also called '''clandestinity''' or '''furtiveness''') is the practice of hiding [[information]] from certain individuals or groups who do not have the "need to know", perhaps while sharing it with other individuals. That which is kept hidden is known as the secret.

Secrecy is often controversial, depending on the content or nature of the secret, the group or people keeping the secret, and the motivation for secrecy. Secrecy by government entities is often decried as excessive or in promotion of poor operation{{by whom|date=March 2015}}; excessive revelation of information on individuals can conflict with virtues of [[privacy]] and [[confidentiality]]. It is often contrasted with [[Transparency (social)|social transparency]].

== Definition ==
Secrecy can exist in a number of different ways, such as through [[obfuscation]], where secrets are hidden in plain sight behind for example [[Jargon|complex idiosyncratic language]] or [[steganography]]; encoding or [[encryption]] where mathematical and technical strategies are used to hide messages; and [[true secrecy]], where restrictions are put upon those who take part of the message, such as through [[Classified information|government security classification]].{{Cn|date=April 2018}}

Another classification proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948 reads there are three systems of secrecy within communication:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shannon|first=C.E.|date=1946–1948|title=Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems|url=http://www.ugr.es/~aquiran/cripto/museo/shannon1949.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# concealment systems, including such methods as invisible ink, concealing a message in an innocent text, or in a fake covering cryptogram, or other methods in which the existence of the message is concealed from the enemy
# privacy systems, for example speech inversion, in which special equipment is required to recover the message
# “true” secrecy systems where the meaning of the message is concealed by cipher , code, etc., although its existence is not hidden, and the enemy is assumed to have any special equipment necessary to intercept and record the transmitted signal

== Secrecy in sociology and zoology ==
{{Main|Sociological aspects of secrecy}}
[[Animal]]s conceal the location of their [[Burrow|den]] or [[nest]] from [[predation|predators]]. Squirrels bury nuts, hiding them, and they try to remember their locations later.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

[[Human]]s attempt to consciously conceal aspects of themselves from others due to [[shame]], or from [[fear]] of violence, rejection, harassment, loss of [[acceptance]], or loss of [[employment]]. Humans may also attempt to conceal aspects of their own [[Self (psychology)|self]] which they are not capable of incorporating psychologically into their [[Consciousness|conscious]] being.  [[Family|Families]] sometimes maintain "[[family secret]]s", obliging family members never to discuss disagreeable issues concerning the family with outsiders or sometimes even within the family. Many "family secrets" are maintained by using a mutually agreed-upon construct (an official family story) when speaking with outside members. Agreement to maintain the secret is often coerced through "shaming" and reference to family [[honor]].  The information may even be something as trivial as a [[recipe]].{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

Secrets are sometimes kept to provide the pleasure of surprise. This includes keeping secret about a [[party#Surprise party|surprise party]], not telling [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s of a story, and avoiding [[exposure (magic)|exposure]] of a magic trick.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

Keeping one's [[strategy]] '''secret''' is important in many aspects of [[game theory]].{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

=== Secret sharing (anthropology) ===
In [[anthropology]] ''secret sharing'' is one way for men and women to establish traditional relations with other men and women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A commonly used{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} narrative that describes this kind of behavior is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s short story "[[The Secret Sharer]]".{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

== Government secrecy ==
[[File:Burnbag Obama Biden.jpg|thumb|A [[burn bag]] and [[classified information|security classification]] stickers on a [[laptop computer]], between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] during updates on [[Operation Neptune Spear|Operation Geronimo]], a mission against [[Osama bin Laden]], in the [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room of the White House]], May 1, 2011.]]

[[Government]]s often attempt to conceal information from other governments and the public. These state secrets can include [[weapon]] designs, military plans, [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] [[negotiation]] tactics, and secrets obtained illicitly from others ("[[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]"). Most nations have some form of [[Official Secrets Act]] (the [[Espionage Act]] in the U.S.) and classify material according to the level of protection needed (hence the term "[[classified information]]"). An individual needs a [[security clearance]] for access and other protection methods, such as keeping documents in a [[safe]], are stipulated.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

Few people dispute the desirability of keeping [[Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information]] secret, but many believe government secrecy to be excessive and too often employed for political purposes.  Many countries have laws that attempt to limit government secrecy, such as the U.S. [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and [[sunshine law]]s. Government officials sometimes [[political leak|leak]] information they are supposed to keep secret. (''For a recent (2005) example, see [[Plame affair]].''){{Cn|date=December 2008}}

Secrecy in elections is a growing issue, particularly secrecy of vote counts on computerized vote counting machines.  While voting, citizens are acting in a unique sovereign or "owner" capacity (instead of being a subject of the laws, as is true outside of elections) in selecting their government servants.  It is argued that secrecy is impermissible as against the public in the area of elections where the government gets all of its power and taxing authority.  In any event, permissible secrecy varies significantly with the context involved.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

==Corporate secrecy==
Organizations, ranging from multi-national for profit [[corporation]]s to nonprofit [[charities]], keep secrets for [[competitive advantage]], to meet legal requirements, or, in some cases, to conceal nefarious behavior. New products under development, unique manufacturing techniques, or simply lists of customers are types of information protected by [[trade secret]] laws. The [[patent]] system encourages inventors to publish information in exchange for a limited time [[monopoly]] on its use, though patent applications are initially secret. [[Secret society|Secret societies]] use secrecy as a way to attract members by creating a sense of importance.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

[[Shell_corporation|Shell companies]] may be used to launder money from criminal activity, to finance terrorism, or to evade taxes. [[Register of beneficial ownership|Registers of beneficial ownership]] aim at fighting corporate secrecy in that sense.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

Other laws ''require'' organizations to keep certain information secret, such as [[medical record]]s ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] in the U.S.), or [[financial report]]s that are under preparation (to limit [[insider trading]]). Europe has particularly strict laws about [[database]] privacy.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

In many countries, [[neoliberal]] reforms of government have included expanding the outsourcing of government tasks and functions to private businesses with the aim of improving efficiency and effectiveness in government administration. However, among the criticisms of these reforms is the claim that the pervasive use of "[[Commercial-in-confidence]]" (or secrecy) clauses in contracts between government and private providers further limits public accountability of governments and prevents proper public scrutiny of the performance and probity of the private companies. Concerns have been raised that 'commercial-in-confidence' is open to abuse because it can be deliberately used to hide corporate or government maladministration and even corruption.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

== Technology secrecy ==
{{See also|Full disclosure (computer security)|Kerckhoffs' principle|security through obscurity}}
Preservation of secrets is one of the goals of [[information security]]. Techniques used include [[physical security]] and [[cryptography]]. The latter depends on the secrecy of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]]. Many believe that security technology can be more effective if it itself is not kept secret.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

[[Information hiding]] is a design principle in much [[software engineering]]. It is considered easier to verify software reliability if one can be sure that different parts of the program can only access (and therefore depend on) a known limited amount of information.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

== Military secrecy ==
{{See also|Military intelligence|Born secret}}
A military secret is information about martial affairs that is purposely not made available to the general public and hence to any enemy, in order to gain an advantage or to not reveal a weakness, to avoid [[embarrassment]], or to help in [[propaganda]] efforts. Most military secrets are tactical in nature, such as the strengths and weaknesses of [[weapon system]]s, [[military tactics|tactics]], training methods, plans, and the number and location of specific weapons.  Some secrets involve information in broader areas, such as secure communications, [[cryptography]], intelligence operations, and cooperation with third parties.{{Cn|date=December 2008}}

== Views on secrecy ==
{{wikiquote|Secrets}}
Excessive secrecy is often cited &lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, Geoffrey, and Tomasz Piotr Wisniewski. "Information asymmetry and power in a surveillance society." Information and Organization 24.4 (2014): 214-235.&lt;/ref&gt; as a source of much human conflict. One may have to [[lie]] in order to hold a secret, which might lead to [[psychology|psychological]] repercussions.{{Or|date=June 2010}} The alternative, declining to answer when asked something, may suggest the answer and may therefore not always be suitable for keeping a secret. Also, the other may insist that one answer the question.{{Synthesis-inline|date=June 2010}} Nearly 2500 years ago, [[Sophocles]] wrote, "Do nothing secretly; for Time sees and hears all things, and discloses all." And [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the [[Buddha]], once said "Three things cannot long stay hidden: the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the [[truth]]".

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''1970 South African general election''' was held on 22 April for the 166-seat [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]]. Parliament was dissolved on 2 March and the deadline for the submission of candidates was 13 March. This was the first time in South African history that the House elected was responsible entirely to [[White South African|white people]], as the seats of the four MPs elected separately by "qualified" [[Cape Coloured]] expired in the same year.

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) won another election, for the first time under the leadership of [[John Vorster]]. Several new representatives were elected, including [[Chris Heunis]], future Acting President and [[Pik Botha]], future [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] for 17 years, who made his maiden speech demanding that the government sign the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.litera.co.za/pikeng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001181359/http://www.litera.co.za/pikeng.htm |archivedate=1 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the NP lost some support in parliament for the first time since the [[South African general election, 1948|1948 election]], its number of seats being reduced by eight. This could be attributed to losing votes to the right-wing splinter [[Herstigte Nasionale Party]] (Reconstituted National Party). While it did not win any seats, the split in the nationalist voter base benefitted the main opposition [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] (UP) in some constituencies.

[[Helen Suzman]], [[member of parliament]] for [[Houghton Estate, Gauteng|Houghton]], retained her seat as the sole representative of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]].

==House of Assembly results ==
Elections were held in 155 of the 166 constituencies (11 members elected unopposed). There were 2 028 487 registered voters and 1 508 248 votes were cast (74.7% of voters in contested constituencies).&lt;ref&gt;IPU http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/SOUTH_AFRICA_1970_E.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Internal Revenue Code.jpg|thumb|300px|right| The [[Internal Revenue Code]] is the primary statutory basis of federal tax law in the United States. The Code of Federal Regulations is the Treasury Department's regulatory interpretation of the federal tax laws passed by Congress, which carry the weight of law if the interpretation is reasonable. Tax treaties and case law in U.S. Tax Court and other federal courts constitute the remainder of tax law in the United States.]]
{{Taxation|expanded=Policies}}
{{Taxation by country}}

'''Tax law''' or '''revenue law''' is an area of legal study which deals with the constitutional, common-law, statutory, [[tax treaty]], and regulatory rules that constitute the [[law]] applicable to [[tax]]ation.

==Major issues==
Primary taxation issues facing the governments world over include;
* [[income tax|Taxes on income]] and [[wealth tax|wealth (or estates)]].
* Taxation of [[capital gain]]s versus labor income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2551567|title = The Knowledge Tax|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2015|journal = University of Chicago Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecotax]]  (short for Ecological taxation) refers to taxes intended to promote environmentally friendly activities via economic incentives.
* Tax evasion and avoidance leading to reduced government revenue.
* Due to an Inefficient tax system in many underdeveloped countries, the majority of small businesses are not taxed.

== Education ==
{{globalize/North America|date=June 2015}}
In [[law school]]s, "tax law" is a sub-discipline and area of specialist study. [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]] require 30 semester credit hours of required courses, 60 hours or more of electives and a combined total of at least 90 credit hours completed. Law students must choose available courses on which to focus before graduation with the [[Juris Doctor|J.D. degree]] in the United States. This freedom allows law students to take many tax courses such as federal taxation, [[Estate tax|estate]] and [[gift tax]], and estates and successions before completing the [[Juris Doctor]] and taking the [[bar exam]] in a particular U.S. state.

[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M) programs are offered in Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Netherlands and an increasing number of countries. Many of these programs focus on domestic and [[international taxation]]. In the United States, most LL.M. programs require that the candidate be a graduate of an [[American Bar Association]]-[[School accreditation|accredited]] law school. In other countries a graduate [[law degree]] is sufficient for admission to LL.M. in Taxation law programs.

&lt;u&gt;The Master of Laws (LL.M)&lt;/u&gt; program is an advanced legal study.

'''General Requirements'''
* J.D. (Juris Doctor) or First degree in law. 
* An English proficiency test score for students with a native language besides English.

&lt;u&gt;The Juris Doctor (JD)&lt;/u&gt; program is offered by only a number of countries. These include, United States, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The courses vary in duration of years, curriculum and whether or not further training is required, depending on which country the program is in.

'''General Requirements'''
* A bachelor's degree.
* Law School Admission Test (LSAT) - Required for law school admission in United States, Canada and a growing number of countries.
* Credit requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">[[File:Ukrainian_Women's_Union.jpg|thumb|one of the local branches of the Ukrainian Women's Union]] The '''Ukrainian Women's Union''' ({{lang-uk|Союз українок}}) (1920–1938) was the most influential women's organization operating among Ukrainian women outside of [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Because they represented Ukrainian nationals living in other sovereign states, the organization solidified their struggle for gender recognition with one for nationalist aims. Formed in [[Lviv]] in 1920, the organization did not focus on traditional feminist issues of equality and political agency until after they had built up a base membership and helped improve the social and economic lives of the peasantry which made up the majority of their membership.

==History==
The Ukrainian Women's Union (UWU) was founded in 1920 by [[Milena Rudnytska]] along with {{ill|Olena Fedak Sheparovych|uk|Федак-Шепарович Олена}}, Iryna Sichynska, {{ill|Olga Tsipanovska|uk|Ціпановська Ольга}} and others, to organize women's journals, conferences, and cooperatives.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=472}} At the time, Ukrainians in the former province of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], which had been part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] were under Polish rule.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=83}} Though formed in what was technically [[Poland]], the organization strove to unite all Ukrainian women who were not living in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Unlike [[Westernization|Western-style]] feminist organizations, the UWU was not primarily made up of elites, nor did it focus on attainment of political agency for women.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=84}} Instead, the focus was on modernizing society through community initiatives and self-improvement programs. Between 1921 and 1930, their goal was to establish economic and cultural structures which could be used to improve the quality of life of all Ukrainians and bring their nationalist cause to the attention of international organizations. In December 1921, the UWU hosted a formal congress to formalize its organization and by 1930 had between 50,000 and 100,000 members. Specific numbers are difficult to attain because Polish authorities at the time prohibited Ukrainians from consolidating their membership into one organization.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=85}} Some 80 regional branches representing around 1,100 local organizations were formed.{{sfn|Чорновол|2007}} From 1931 to 1938, the goals turned more toward political feminism and economics rights-based advocacy.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=85}}

Leadership of the group understood feminist principals, but they did not pursue a feminist agenda until they had increased their membership and initiated economic and social reforms to improve the lives of Ukrainian families.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=85}} Many of the leaders were from women's clubs such as the temperance clubs and from the intelligentsia, such as teachers. Most of the membership was from the peasant class and the entire organization based its direction on work rather than theory. Leadership stressed the need for organized social activity to improve lives.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=86}} The UWU carried out activities like sponsoring art cooperatives which encouraged peasants to create goods, and then collected their [[handicrafts]], exhibited and sold them, fostering a market for their products.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=89}}

Politically, the group served as a [[nationalist]] organ, encouraging political unity for the betterment of all Ukrainians.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=89}} Because Ukrainian women lived in a non-sovereign state, it was imperative for them to forge their gender identity along the lines of national identity.{{snf|Smolyar|2006|p=408}} The UWU of [[Lviv]]'s leadership were actively involved with the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]], an organization designed to coordinate Ukrainian political responses in Poland. Rudnytska, as a member of the [[Polish Sejm]] worked to overcome issues such as suppression of [[Ukrainian language]] schools. To bring the case of Ukrainian nationalism to the international arena, the UWU joined such organizations as the [[International Council of Women]], the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] and the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. Speaking out against the [[Holodomor|1932–1933 famine]] and [[Nazi]] [[antifeminist]] policies, the UWU attempted to expand women's spheres in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=90}}{{sfn|Гавришко|2010}}

In 1934, the UWU in Galicia hosted another congress, ostensively to bolster Ukrainian native culture. The four-day event was attended by around 10,000 delegates and the focus was on active participation of women and their importance in the community affairs of Ukrainian society.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=92}}{{snf|Smolyar|2006|p=407}} In 1935, the UWU founded a journal, ''Zhinka'' (Woman) which was edited by Shaparovych and which spoke on education, equality, economic opportunity and training, motherhood, and other women's issues. They also produce articles on exercise and nutrition and public involvement to encourage women to develop a modern sensibility of citizenship.{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=91}} Though the UWU was criticized by Catholic intellectuals, liberals and radicals, the organization managed to maintain its autonomy and the support of peasant population until the outbreak of [[World War II]].{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=93}}{{snf|Smolyar|2006|p=407}} On 5 May 1938, the Polish police arrested all of the leadership in all branches of the UWU,{{sfn|Bohachevsky-Chomiak|1985|p=96}} thus ending the operations of the most influential Ukrainian women's organization.{{sfn|Smolyar|2006|p=407}}

The '''Western Block Party''' (WBP) was a political party in [[Canada]] founded in 2005 by [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]]. The party was registered on December 29, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered Political Parties and Parties Eligible for Registration|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=par&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e#WBP|publisher=Elections Canada|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deregistered on January 31, 2014.&lt;ref name=deregistered&gt;{{cite web|title=Deregistration of Western Block Party|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=med&amp;document=jan2814&amp;dir=pre&amp;lang=e|publisher=Elections Canada|accessdate=July 17, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==
The aim of the party was to promote the independence of [[Western Canada]] ([[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]]) from the rest of Canada.

==History==
The party's founding convention was held on November 20, 2005, in [[Sidney, British Columbia]]. Christie was unanimously confirmed as leader. A constitution was adopted and a full slate of officers were elected.

Western independence movements typically attract support from westerners who believe that western Canada does not get a fair deal within the Canadian confederation. The Western Block Party claim attracts members of differing economic views who are opposed to what they view as a corrupt federal government.

The party had four candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], including its leader, Doug Christie, who ran in the [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca]] in British Columbia; none were elected. In the 2008 election, the party unsuccessfully ran one candidate, Patricia O'Brien, in [[Saanich—Gulf Islands]]. In both these elections the party's total vote count was second fewest of all parties. The party ran four candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]], improving its standing only to third fewest due to a new party taking the second fewest standing.

Christie was also the leader of the [[Western Canada Concept Party of British Columbia]], a political party that promotes separation at the provincial political level in [[British Columbia]].

Christie was a lawyer in Canada who is well known for representing [[Ernst Zündel]], among others. The [[Western Canada Concept]] (WCC) and WBP are not affiliated with the [[Separation Party of Alberta]] (SPA) or the [[Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan]] (WIPS). Officials in these parties have distanced themselves from Christie. The WIPS is currently attempting to establish a separate federal party, which would be called the [[Western Canada Party]]. Christie died March 11, 2013;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The party was deregistered by Elections Canada in January 2014 for failing to declare at least 250 members.&lt;ref name=deregistered/&gt;

It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]] 
The '''World Charter for Prostitutes' Rights''' is a declaration of rights adopted in 1985 to protect the rights of [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamala Kempadoo, Jo Doezema |title=Global Sex Workers, pp. 19&amp;ndash;20|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-91828-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Hope Ditmore|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, p. 625|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=0-313-32968-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by the [[International Committee for Prostitutes’ Rights]] (ICPR).

==The charter==
The distinction between voluntary and [[forced prostitution]] was developed by the [[prostitutes' rights movement]] in response to [[feminists]] and others who saw all prostitution as abusive. The World Charter for Prostitutes' Rights calls for the decriminalisation of "all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Sex Workers |last=Kempadoo |first=Kamala |authorlink= |author2=Jo Doezema  |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=9780415918299 |pages=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiJztJAgUTMC&amp;dq=forced+prostitution&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Charter also states that prostitutes should be guaranteed "all human rights and civil liberties," including the freedom of speech, travel, immigration, work, marriage, and motherhood, and the right to unemployment insurance, health insurance and housing.&lt;ref name=Charter&gt;[http://www.walnet.org/csis/groups/icpr_charter.html] World Charter for Prostitutes' Rights&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the World Charter calls for protection of "work standards," including the abolition of laws which impose any systematic zoning of prostitution, and calls for prostitutes having the freedom to choose their place of work and residence, and to "provide their services under the conditions that are absolutely determined by themselves and no one else."&lt;ref name=Charter/&gt; The World Charter also calls for prostitutes to pay regular taxes "on the same basis as other independent contractors and employees," and to receive the same benefits for their taxes.&lt;ref name=Charter/&gt;

In an article announcing the adoption of the World Charter, the [[United Press International]] reported: "Women from the world's oldest profession, some wearing exotic masks to protect their identity, appealed Friday at the world's first international prostitutes' convention for society to stop treating them like criminals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prostitutes Appeal For Decriminalization|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=1986-02-16|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c9sOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1HwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6964,44854&amp;dq=world+charter+for+prostitutes+rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The text==

'''Laws'''&lt;ref name=CharterText&gt;International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights (ICPR), Amsterdam 1985, Published in Pheterson, G (ed.), A Vindication of the Rights of Whores. Seattle: Seal Press, 1989. (p.40)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decriminalize all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision.
* Decriminalize prostitution and regulate third parties according to standard business codes. It must be noted that existing standard business codes allow abuse of prostitutes. Therefore special clauses must be included to prevent the abuse and stigmatization of prostitutes (self-employed and others).
* Enforce criminal laws against fraud, coercion, violence, child sexual abuse, child labor, rape, racism everywhere and across national boundaries, whether or not in the context of prostitution.
* Eradicate laws that can be interpreted to deny freedom of association, or freedom to travel, to prostitutes within and between countries. Prostitutes have rights to a private life.

'''Human Rights'''
* Guarantee prostitutes all human rights and civil liberties, including the freedom of speech, travel, immigration, work, marriage, and motherhood and the right to unemployment insurance, health insurance and housing.
* Grant asylum to anyone denied human rights on the basis of a "crime of status," be it prostitution or homosexuality.

'''Working Conditions'''
* There should be no law which implies systematic zoning of prostitution. Prostitutes should have the freedom to choose their place of work and residence. It is essential that prostitutes can provide their services under the conditions that are absolutely determined by themselves and no one else.
* There should be a committee to insure the protection of the rights of the prostitutes and to whom prostitutes can address their complaints. This committee must be {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} prostitutes and other professionals like lawyers and supporters.
* There should be no law discriminating against prostitutes associating and working collectively in order to acquire a high degree of personal security.

'''Health'''
* All women and men should be educated to periodical health screening for sexually transmitted diseases. Since health checks have historically been used to control and stigmatize prostitutes, and since adult prostitutes are generally even more aware of sexual health than others, mandatory checks for prostitutes are unacceptable unless they are mandatory for all sexually active people.

'''Services'''
* Employment, counseling, legal, and housing services for runaway children should be funded in order to prevent child prostitution and to promote child well-being and opportunity.
* Prostitutes must have the same social benefits as all other citizens according to the different regulations in different countries.
* Shelters and services for working prostitutes and re-training programs for prostitutes wishing to leave the life should be funded.

'''Taxes'''
* No special taxes should be levied on prostitutes or prostitute businesses.
* Prostitutes should pay regular taxes on the same basis as other independent contractors and employees, and should receive the same benefits.

'''Public Opinion'''
* Support educational programs to change social attitudes which stigmatize and discriminate against prostitutes and ex-prostitutes of any race, gender or nationality.
* Develop educational programs which help the public to understand that the customer plays a crucial role in the prostitution phenomenon, this role being generally ignored. The customer, like the prostitute, should not, however, be criminalized or condemned on a moral basis.
* We are in solidarity with workers in the sex industry.

'''Organization'''
* Organizations of prostitutes and ex-prostitutes should be supported to further implementation of the above charter.

==Development of a human rights approach==
The World Charter emerged from the [[prostitutes' rights movement]] starting in the mid-1970s. It was established through the two World Whores Congresses held in [[Amsterdam]] (1985) and [[Brussels]] (1986) which epitomised a worldwide prostitutes' rights movement and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Sex Workers |last=Kempadoo |first=Kamala |authorlink= |author2=Jo Doezema  |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=9780415918299 |pages=19&amp;ndash;20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiJztJAgUTMC&amp;dq=forced+prostitution&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=World Notes Belgium|publisher=Time|date=2006-10-13|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962548,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter established a [[human rights]] based approach which has subsequently been further elaborated by the [[prostitutes' rights movement]].&lt;ref name=Carnegie/&gt;

In 1999, the ''Santa Monica Mirror'' commented on the popularization of the term "[[sex worker]]" as an alternative to "[[wiktionary:whore|whore]]" or "[[wiktionary:prostitute|prostitute]]" and credited the World Charter, among others, for having "articulated a global political movement seeking recognition and social change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Amalia Cabezos |title=Hookers in the House of the Lord |publisher=Santa Monica Mirror |date=July 28 – August 4, 1999 |url=http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080820101422/http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html |archivedate=August 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Carnegie Council published a report commenting on the results of the World Charter, fifteen years after its adoption.&lt;ref name=Carnegie&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Saunders|title=Fifteen Years after the World Charter for Prostitutes’ Rights|date=2000-08-06|publisher=Carnegie Council|url=http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_03/articles/629.html/:pf_printable}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that the human rights approach embodied in the World Charter had proved "extremely useful for advocates seeking to reduce discrimination against sex workers."&lt;ref name=Carnegie/&gt;  For example, human rights advocates in [[Australia]] utilized the language of human rights to resist “mandatory health tests” for sex workers and to require that information regarding health be kept confidential.&lt;ref name=Carnegie/&gt;  However, the report also found that efforts to define prostitution as a human rights abuse had led some governments to take action to abolish the sex industry.&lt;ref name=Carnegie/&gt;

And in 2003, a writer in the journal "Humanist" noted that the World Charter had become "a template used by human rights groups all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kimberly Klinger|title=Prostitution humanism and a woman's choice &amp;mdash; Perspectives on Prostitution|publisher=Humanist|date=Jan–Feb 2003|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_1_63/ai_96417149/pg_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The World Charter was initially met with scepticism and ridicule.  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported: "Just what were all those hookers doing in the hallowed halls of the European Parliament in Brussels last week? The moral outrage echoing in the corridors may have suggested that a re-creation of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] was being staged. Reason: about 125 prostitutes, including three men, were attending the Second World Whores Congress."&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;  The ''Philadelphia Daily News'' asked, "Does it contain a layoff clause?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Does It Contain A Layoff Clause?|publisher=Philadelphia Daily News|date=1985-02-15|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7cDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2977A98A83CD9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another writer referred to it derisively as "a Magna Carta for whores".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=House of ill repute|publisher=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=1996-03-06|url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/1996/03/06/Resources/Column.House.Of.Ill.Repute-2174331.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter remains controversial, as some [[feminists]] consider [[prostitution]] to be one of the most serious problems facing women, particularly in developing countries. In Jessica Spector's 2006 book ''Prostitution and Pornography'', [[Vednita Carter]] and Evelina Giobbe offer the following critique of the Charter:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pretending prostitution is a job like any other job would be laughable if it weren't so serious.  Leading marginalized prostituted women to believe that decriminalization would materially change anything substantive in their lives as prostitutes is dangerous and irresponsible.  There are no liberating clauses in the World Charter.  Pimps are not 'third party managers.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Spector (editor) |title=Prostitution and Pornography: Philosophical Debate about the Sex Industry, p. 35|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-4938-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32575">The '''World Passport''' is a fantasy travel document sold by the [[World Service Authority]], a non-profit organization founded by [[Garry Davis]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/gov.html | title=What is the World Government of World Citizens? | accessdate=2013-07-12 | author=WSA | publisher=World Service Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Council"&gt;[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st16/st16225.en08.pdf Table of travel documents entitling the holder to cross the external borders and which may be endorsed with a visa - (Parts II and II) and Part V (documents to which visas cannot be affixed]. [[Council of the European Union]]. 1 December 2008. The World Passport is placed in the latter category.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and price==
[[File:World Passport Data Page.jpg|thumb|right|Data page of the World Passport.]]

The World Passport is similar in appearance to a genuine national [[passport]] or other such authentic [[travel document]]. In 1979 the World Passport was a 42-page document, with a dark blue cover, and text in English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Chinese, and [[Esperanto]]. It contained a five-page section for medical history and a six-page section for listing organisational affiliation. The fee charged at that time was [[US$]]32 plus postage for a three-year World Passport that could be renewed for a further two years.&lt;ref name="Bangor"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9G0-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T1oMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3987,4848177 'World' passport termed advisable], an article by John Brannon Albright in the ''Bangor Daily News'', (26 October 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of the World Passport current {{As of|2017|lc=y}} was produced in January 2007. It has an embedded "ghost" photo for security, covered with a plastic film. Its data page is in the format of a [[machine-readable passport]], with an alphanumeric code bar in the machine-readable zone (MRZ) enabling it to be scanned by an optical reader. However, in place of a valid [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] code in the MRZ "issuer" and "nationality" fields, it uses the non-standard code "WSA".

According to the WSA website, the fee is $55 for a three-year World Passport, $75 for five years, and $100 for ten years. A "World Donor Passport" valid for fifteen years with a special cover is issued gratis to donors of at least $400 which, according to the WSA, is used to provide free documents to refugees and stateless persons.&lt;ref name="ApplicationForm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/appform.html |title=Application Form |website=Worldservice.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldservice.org/wcwfaq.html |title=World Service Authority FAQ|website= World Government of World Citizens|date=  |author= |accessdate= 9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the customer can choose between two World Passport covers: "World Passport" or "World Government Passport". The WSA recommends their customers to purchase the second option. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldservice.org/passcover.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential customer must provide as proof of identity a notarized certification of the details on the form, a copy of their national identity papers, or a fingerprint from their right index finger.&lt;ref name="ApplicationForm"/&gt; People have been known to obtain World Passports in names other than their legal names; see [[#Sale by third parties|the relevant section below]].

== As a travel document ==
The appearance is so similar to a genuine passport that in 1974 a criminal case was lodged against Garry Davis in France regarding his issuance of World Passports.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H_hUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1TwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3972,3289988 World Citizen, by Mark Blackburn, The Leader-Post, Regina, 31 May 1974, p30]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the WSA, the  version of the document introduced in 2007 was filed as a Machine Readable Travel Document (MRTD) with the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/docpass.html|title=THE WORLD PASSPORT |work=worldservice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ICAO documents on MRTDs cite the World Service Authority and its World Passport as an example of "Fantasy Documents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icao.int/Meetings/mrtd-Zimbabwe2012/Documents/2-11-Esteves_Portugal-forensic.pdf International Civil Aviation Organization Regional Seminar on MRTDs, Biometrics and Border Security, 27-29 November 2012, p30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icao.int/Meetings/TAG-MRTD/Documents/Tag-Mrtd-16/TagMrtd16_005_en.pdf International Civil Aviation TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP ON MACHINE READABLE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, TAG-MRTD/16, WP/5, 13/9/05, section 2.1.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable acceptances ===
Success in crossing a border using a World Passport is generally attributable to the whim or ignorance of individual immigration officers, not official recognition of the document.&lt;ref name="Engber"/&gt; The World Service Authority website has scans of letters dating from many decades ago from six countries ([[Burkina Faso]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mauritania]], [[Tanzania]], [[Togo]] and [[Zambia]]) which the WSA claims is legal recognition of the World Passports. These letters of recognition are several decades old (i.e., 1954 for Ecuador, 1972 for Burkina Faso, 1975 for Mauritania, 1995 for Tanzania, 1983 for Togo, 1973 for Zambia)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WSA Passport Acceptance - Visas on WSA Passports|url=http://www.worldservice.org/visas.html|website=www.worldservice.org|publisher=World Government of World Citizens|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasonable doubt exists about today's effective acceptance.

According to the World Service Authority website, some World Passports have reportedly been accepted on a case-by-case basis by over 180 countries  (i.e., they have been [[Passport stamp|stamped]] with a national visa or entry or exit stamp), and according to the World Service Authority some countries in the past accorded the document legal recognition.&lt;ref name="wsa-visa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/visas.html?s=1 | title=visas - World Government of World Citizen | accessdate=2013-07-11 | author=WSA | publisher=World Service Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgovernment.org/visas.html?s=1|title=WSA Passport Acceptance - Visas on WSA Passports|work=worldgovernment.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2016}}

The World Passport came under increased international scrutiny in 1996, after the [[Achille Lauro hijacking|hijacking of the MS ''Achille Lauro'']]. In the aftermath of the incident, one of the captured hijackers, Youssef Majed al-Molqi, escaped imprisonment in Italy and used a World Passport which he had purchased in 1988 to leave the country and travel to Spain before he was recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56823495.html Achille Lauro killer likely fled to Algeria: Furloughed terrorist used documents from U.S. to escape], Peggy Polk, ''[[The Washington Times]]'' (22 March 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al-Molqi"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56823516.html Private 'authority' issues passports: Escaped terrorist among recipients], Paige Bowers, ''[[The Washington Times]]'' (22 March 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/state/archive/march/sd3_3-25.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725080304/http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/state/archive/march/sd3_3-25.htm |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable rejections ===
Many countries and territories say they do not recognize the World Passport because it is not issued by a competent government authority, and thus does not meet the definition of a [[passport]]. By 1975, Garry Davis had already been detained twenty times for his attempts to cross international borders with a World Passport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RnBkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o30NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3057,2101985 Oddities in the news], article in ''[[The Calgary Herald]]'' (5 May 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commonwealth of Independent States ====
The Russian government states that it does not recognise the World Passport. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Kommersant]]'', a spokesman for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]' Department of Consular Services stated that the World Passport is not an acceptable document for proving identity or citizenship status at Russian border crossings; only a [[diplomatic passport]], official passport, seaman's passport, or general civil passport are accepted.&lt;ref name="Kommersant"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc-rss/18987 Лучший Способ Потерять Деньги], an article by Svetlana Branitskaya (18 June 1995) in ''[[Kommersant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, one Russian media report claims that some members of the [[House of Romanov]], travelling to [[Saint Petersburg]] for the reburial of the remains of one of their ancestors, were permitted by Russian authorities to obtain visas in their World Passports, in light of the special situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.travel.ru/archive/4409.html Паспорт, который только в Африке паспорт], an article by Valeriya Mozganova on Travel.ru (22 January 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, a man claiming to be a Russian citizen attempted to cross the border from [[Latvia]] into [[Belarus]] at the Urbany checkpoint using a World Passport; he stated he lost his Russian documents while in [[Sweden]]. He was arrested by the Belarusian border guards. A spokesman for Belarus' State Border Committee in an interview with a local newspaper stated that Belarus does not accept the World Passport at border crossings. He also claimed it was the first known case of its kind in the country.&lt;ref name="Lenta"&gt;[http://www.lenta.ru/news/2008/12/23/citizen/ Белорусские пограничники задержали гражданина мира], an article from [[Lenta.ru]] (23 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://naviny.by/rubrics/society/2008/12/23/ic_news_116_303608/ Полоцкие пограничники поймали гражданина мира], an article from Naviny.by (23 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
The [[United States Department of State]]'s official position on the World Passport is that it is a booklet produced by a private organisation upon payment of a fee, and not a passport. As early as 1991, the US [[Air Transport Association]] specifically included the World Passport in a training film as an example of unacceptable travel papers.&lt;ref name="Heartbreak"/&gt; In 2012, a [[Belize]]an man attempted to enter the U.S. through the [[Veterans International Bridge at Los Tomates]] using a World Passport. The man in question had prior felony convictions for drug trafficking and immigration offences, and had previously been deported from the United States multiple times. He claimed that he wanted to speak with President Obama about genocide in Belize. In a [[bench trial]], Judge [[Andrew S. Hanen]] found the man guilty of felony attempted re-entry after deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/tried-137193-claimed-work.html 'World Passport' didn't work on bridge], an article from The Brownsville Herald (February 21, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other countries ====
Peace activist [[Kenneth O'Keefe]] tried to travel to [[Iraq]] using a World Passport in 2003, but was rejected transit rights by [[Turkey]], and had to apply for an American passport to continue his journey.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"&gt;[http://harpers.org/archive/2004/10/0080240 Electing to leave: A reader's guide to expatriating on November 3], article by Bryant Urstadt in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salem-news.com/articles/may102011/world-citizen-ko-tk.php Ken O'Keefe - On Being a World Citizen], article by Tim King in ''Salem News'' (10 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, two men from [[People's Republic of China|China]] on board [[Cathay Pacific]] Flight 302 from Hong Kong to Guangzhou attempted to pass through immigration at [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] using World Passports. The officers at the airport arrested them for illegal entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2004-09-25/15023768907s.shtml |title=持“世界护照”入境？白云边检识破偷渡者_新闻中心_新浪网 |website=News.sina.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, though Garry Davis claims to have traveled to India using a World Passport and to have given one personally to [[Jawaharlal Nehru]],&lt;ref name="Nehru"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/509234912.html?dids=509234912:509234912&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic 'World Passport' Given to Nehru by Garry Davis], a [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] article (9 June 1956)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-12-10/lucknow/27295734_1_world-government-global-village-global-village Excludable alien with world passport], a [[Times of India]] article (10 December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2007 an Indian citizen was arrested for attempting to ''leave'' India at [[Begumpet Airport]] using a World Passport. The man, intending to travel to the United States, had purchased what he believed was a genuine passport and visa. His travel agency and [[Air India]] staff both accepted his World Passport, but Indian immigration did not.  The Times of India called it a clear case of "internet fraud" and stated that the man had been "duped".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-24/hyderabad/27884866_1_passport-authorities-immigration-counter-begumpet 'World passport' to nowhere], [[The Times of India]] article (24 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of the European Union]] has a table of travel documents entitling the holder to [[Visa policy of the Schengen Area|cross external borders of Schengen states]] and which may be endorsed with a visa; the World Passport is listed as a [[fantasy passport]] to which a visa may not be affixed.&lt;ref name="European Council" /&gt;

In February 2013, both Panama and Costa Rica rejected the use of the World Passport by Sage Million, a fugitive from Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20130404185822875 American Fugitive Expat Sage Million Hiding in Volcan], ''Panama Guide'' article (4 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip-hop artist and actor [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey (Mos Def)]] was arrested in South Africa on January 15, 2016 for attempting to leave the country using a World passport. He had entered the country using an American passport and had lived in Cape Town since May 2013. South Africa's Department of Home Affairs released a statement saying that Mr. Bey would be allowed to appeal the immigration action and possibly seek permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35330365 |title=Rapper Mos Def ordered to leave South Africa in passport row|website=BBC News |date=2016-01-15 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/15/mos-def-was-arrested-in-south-africa-for-using-a-world-passport-yes-thats-a-real-thing/ |title=Mos Def Was Arrested in South Africa for Using a ‘World Passport.’ Yes, That’s a Real Thing. |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2016-01-15 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use by refugees and stateless persons ===
The World Service Authority sells World Passports to refugees and other people who are unable to obtain valid, authentic travel documents. According to the WSA,  refugees in camps are given free World Passports. WSA reports that it "has [given out] more than 10,000 free World Passports to refugees residing in camps throughout the world" and that it "has documentary evidence that the issuance of such passports may permit refugees to leave such camps to seek asylum elsewhere or to claim other rights often denied to refugees".&lt;ref name="WSA Organizationa Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitnews.org/cgi/deptframe.php3?article=../web/articles/wsaofs.html&amp;title=Organizational+Fact+Sheet|title=World Citizen News - Articles|work=worldcitnews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of those refugees have found World Passports to be useless.&lt;ref name="Heartbreak"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1099454.html Documents for Refugees Criticized as Passports to Heartbreak], article by Karlyn Barker in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (10 December 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; According to statements by Garry Davis in the mid-1970s, major users of World Passports at the time included persons in Southeast Asia fleeing from wars, as well as holders of [[Rhodesian passport]]s who were otherwise unable to travel internationally as no other country accepted their documents besides [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=82ofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KNUEAAAAIBAJ U.S. Native advocates borderless world], an article in ''The Southeast Missourian'' (27 August 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many [[East Africa]]n refugees arriving in [[Nordic countries]] in the early 1990s had World Passports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/world/people-smugglers-send-new-tide-of-refugees-onto-nordic-shores.html 'People Smugglers' Send New Tide of Refugees Onto Nordic Shores], article by Henry Kamm in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (15 February 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, a Georgian citizen attempted to pass through [[Latvia]]n border control with a World Passport, though he also had a valid [[Georgian passport]] in his possession; after presenting his World Passport, he requested asylum in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_states_cis/?doc=43953 Georgian citizen presents ''World Passport'' to Latvian border guards], an article by Alla Petrova in ''The Baltic Course'', 27 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another category of users of World Passports are [[stowaway]]s on ships. Vessel owners are legally responsible for the stowaways until they can find a country to let them ashore, but countries are often reluctant due to questions over the validity of the stowaways' documents. From 1992 to 2006 the WSA sold their document to such individuals on five occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2006-01-30/news/25411427_1_stowaway-ivory-coast-port-city/3 Stowaway: A man with no country. From port to port, he is trapped on a ship.], article by Gaiutra Bahadur in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' (30 January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an identity document==
The World Service Authority promotes the World Passport not just as a document for international travel, but a "neutral, apolitical document of identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/docpass.html |title=World Government of World Citizens : The World Passport |website=Worldservice.org |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investor [[Doug Casey]], himself a World Passport customer, has suggested that a World Passport is useful at hotels and other non-governmental institutions where security is uncertain; if one is asked to hand over one's real passport in such situations, one can provide the World Passport instead of a genuine national passport.&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalman.com/im-interviews/doug-casey-on-second-passports|title=Doug Casey on Second Passports|work=International Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governmental authorities do not share this assessment.

The [[Criminal Records Bureau]] of the United Kingdom [[Home Office]] states that registered bodies should not accept the World Passport as a proof of identity, warning that "a fake 'World Passport' can be purchased online by members of the public and should not be confused with a genuine passport".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crb.homeoffice.gov.uk/pdf/dn_may_09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807155803/http://www.crb.homeoffice.gov.uk/pdf/dn_may_09.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The [[Isle of Man]]'s [[Financial Supervision Commission (Isle of Man)|Financial Supervision Commission]], which regulates the isle's banks and company formation agents, states that the World Passport is not an acceptable document to prove either the nationality or identity of the bearer. Specifically, it classifies it as a spurious or fantasy passport, a term which it defines to mean as documents which "have the appearance of a passport, but are issued by organisations with no authority and to which no official recognition has been given".&lt;ref name="gov.im"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/infocentre/archived_releases/PR_fsc_01/Passport.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720042243/http://www.gov.im/infocentre/archived_releases/PR_fsc_01/Passport.html |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Social Security Administration]] will also not accept any World Service Authority document (including the World Passport and World Donor Passport) as evidence of identity, age, citizenship, alien status, or marital status for either claims or enumeration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0110210720 |title=SSA - POMS: RM 10210.720 - Other and Novelty Birth Records - 05/02/2011 |website=Secure.ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia Department of Social Services explicitly classifies all World Service Authority documents as "unacceptable documents" for verification of identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/dfs/as/auxillary_grants/intro_page/manual/ag_chapc.pdf Virginia Department of Social Services; Auxiliary Grant Program, NOn Financial REquirements, Volume II, Part III, Chapter C], page 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of State]] instructs all U.S. embassies and consulates not to provide any [[notary|notarial]], [[apostille convention|apostille]], or other authentication services in respect of World Passports, whether regarding the World Passport itself or documents relating to the purchase of a World Passport. They warn that such documents could be used for fraudulent or criminal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86738.pdf 7 FAM 890 UNUSUAL NOTARIAL REQUESTS]. See: "7 FAM 893 NOTARIZATION OF WORLD SERVICE AUTHORITY-RELATED DOCUMENTS" (28 December 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/l/2004/78076.htm Message re apostille issues], Department of State (8 July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 a man was able to buy a World Passport in a name that was not his own, but was detected after repeated attempts to use it to prove his identity when opening accounts at various banks in [[Indiana]], without providing a verifiable address or telephone number. He was convicted of [[fraud]] on a financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/archive/090304.par.html |title=APPEAL FROM THE MARION SUPERIOR COURT - Cause No. 49G01-9611-CF-194134|website=www.in.gov |date=3 September 1998 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a political statement==
Regardless of its almost universal lack of acceptance, an individual may also seek to obtain a World Passport as part of a political statement. A number of Russian citizens have obtained the World Passport as a form of protest against the "red tape" imposed by the Russian government on their own citizens aiming to travel abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abakan-gazeta.ru/node/3508 Зачем россияне становятся Гражданами Мира?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903031729/http://www.abakan-gazeta.ru/node/3508 |date=2011-09-03 }}, an article in Abakan Gazeta (17 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, two mayors of [[West Bank]] towns bought World Passports during a visit by Garry Davis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wOVdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E18NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3532,2933071 World Citizen Makes Offer To Arabs], an article in the ''Observer-Reporter'' (January 22, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale by third parties==

Despite its limited acceptance, other entities have also sought to manufacture and sell the fantasy travel document, without the consent of the WSA. The Isle of Man's Financial Supervision Commission reports that they have identified counterfeit World Passports.&lt;ref name="gov.im"/&gt; Also, the first cross-jurisdictional fake passport case ever found in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], China involved counterfeit World Passports. In February 1981, the local [[Public Security Bureau]] identified some Hong Kong criminals who were charging World Passport customers more than ¥18,000 (more than US$10,000 at the official exchange rate at that time) in processing fees, and misrepresenting to them that World Passport customers could settle in any country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gzjd.gov.cn/pub/index_jsp_catid_11_23_id_559.html 警界纵横], on the website of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, gzjd.gov.cn&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, Russia does not accept World Passports, but in the 1990s, many company formation agents in Russia sold the World Passport together in a package-deal with the setup of an [[offshore company]] ([[international business company]]), and falsely claimed that all countries of the world accept it as an identity document.&lt;ref name="Kommersant"/&gt; In some cases, such companies charged up to US$1,000 for the document alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.eastview.com/browse/doc/9525466 Осторожно: стантия лоховская. Не пытайтесь стать "гражданином мира"], article by Sergey Zatsepin in ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' (5 February 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malaysia in 1994, a Nigerian man was arrested at the [[Central Market, Kuala Lumpur]] by tourist police during an identity check, after he showed a World Passport. A search of his belongings showed that he carried a total of five World Passports, as well as a real [[Nigerian passport]] that had been used by another person to travel to Malaysia and Hong Kong. Authorities suspected he might have been trying to sell the fantasy travel documents to other foreign nationals lacking valid travel documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iNxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rBMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1301,4084243 Nigerian with 'World Passports' detained], an article in the ''[[New Straits Times]]'' (20 May 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable World Passport owners==
Many notable people have owned World Passports.  Although some may have purchased them, the WSA typically gives them to prominent people. 

Garry Davis, the WSA founder, owned World Passport No. 1, originally manufactured in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/18/archives/a-talk-with-the-holder-of-world-passport-no-1-passports-are-a-joke.html A Talk With the Holder Of World Passport No. 1: "Passports Are a Joke"], article by Harry Benson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (October 18, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garrydavis.org/h_worldpass.html|title=Garry Davis - History|work=garrydavis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others who have been given what the WSA refers to as "honorary World Passports" include heads of state such as Indian prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]],&lt;ref name="Nehru" /&gt; [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the 34th president of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onefilms.com/nehru.pdf|title='Wolrld Citizen' Calls on Nehru|website=Onefilms.com|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Václav Havel]], [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|last president of Czechoslovakia]] and first president of the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PLOLf0tXCTMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=vaclav+havel+world+passport#v=onepage&amp;q=vaclav%20havel%20world%20passport&amp;f=false|title=Letters to World Citizens|author1=Hilda Emery Davis|author2=Garry Davis|date=2004-01-30|website=Books.google.co.il|isbn=9780970648372|page=100|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others include activists such as [[Edward Snowden]], [[NSA]] whistleblower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=354342214782054400|user=worldcitizengov|title=World Service Authority issues World Passport to Edward Snowden based on Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=World Service|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertclick.com/NRWire/Releasedetails.aspx?id=45686|title=Release Details|date=|publisher=ExpertClick|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Assange]], founder of [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertclick.com/NRWire/Releasedetails.aspx?id=41434|title=Release Details|date=|publisher=ExpertClick|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainers have also been given or purchased World Passports, including [[Yehudi Menuhin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBFEW-6KUaMC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=WORLD+SERVICE+AUTHORITY+BROCHURE&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e2VwCaXmjN&amp;sig=tVGUiK94A-XPXd-hRqsuZuIy8gk&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=11GiUJm8B8rDtAa33YDQBA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=MENUHIN&amp;f=false|title=World Government, Ready Or Not!|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Stewart]], actor, of [[Star Trek]] and [[X-Men]] fame,&lt;ref&gt;http://uwcdwg.tripod.com/sept-uw13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.il/books?id=WWz5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=LeVar+Burton+world+passport&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T5ONC4W17z&amp;sig=EoSppe0ADCuvd5DIMx5uHeuR4g4&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCuYnrharZAhWJblAKHSlQAksQ6AEIOzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=LeVar%20Burton%20world%20passport&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.il/books?id=PLOLf0tXCTMC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=patrick+stewart+world+passport&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dgur6cHskW&amp;sig=1324vmFHEvgoXZLOYuO2sOeG7lQ&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR_vr1harZAhUJZlAKHVl2A_IQ6AEIZzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=patrick%20stewart%20world%20passport&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LeVar Burton]], of [[Star Trek]] and [[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]] fame.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwcdwg.tripod.com/sept-uw13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.il/books?id=PLOLf0tXCTMC&amp;pg=PA115-IA1&amp;lpg=PA115-IA1&amp;dq=LeVar+Burton+world+passport&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dgur6cHsiT&amp;sig=J868UEpYpbjCTZtb4aU-PLRKtlI&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCuYnrharZAhWJblAKHSlQAksQ6AEINTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=LeVar%20Burton%20world%20passport&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.il/books?id=WWz5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=LeVar+Burton+world+passport&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T5ONC4W17z&amp;sig=EoSppe0ADCuvd5DIMx5uHeuR4g4&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCuYnrharZAhWJblAKHSlQAksQ6AEIOzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=LeVar%20Burton%20world%20passport&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminals and terrorists who have owned World Passports include [[Triston Jay Amero]], an American man charged with hotel bombings in Bolivia,&lt;ref name="Engber"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2138567/ What's a World Passport?] article by Daniel Engber in [[slate.com]] (March 24, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and Youssef Majed al-Molqi, one of the hijackers of the [[MS Achille Lauro|MS ''Achille Lauro'']] in 1985.&lt;ref name="al-Molqi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56864338.html We issue passports so people can escape injustice, not elude justice.], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', (March 27, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
