'''BioCity Nottingham''' is a bioscience [[science park]] in central [[Nottingham]] in the United Kingdom. It is the UK's largest bioscience innovation and incubation centre.

==History==
In 2002, laboratories and office space were donated to [[Nottingham Trent University]] by BASF. Biocity was founded in September 2003 by the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University (NTU) and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]] (which was based close to BioCity).

Biocity's premises were developed from the building donated by BASF. Phase 1 was completed in March 2004, providing {{convert|36000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space, then Phase 2 in March 2006 provided {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. When Phase 3 of the development was completed in October 2008, with {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, funding from emda also finished.

===Background===
Nottingham has long been an important centre for bioscience research, principally through work done at the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University and by [[Boots UK|Boots]], Britain's largest retail [[pharmacy]] company, which is based in [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]]/[[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]]. Although Boots no longer engages in drug discovery, [[Ibuprofen]] (iso-butyl-propanoic-phenolic acid) was created by Boots scientists in Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf Boots ibuprofen project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001172448/http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf |date=1 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 Nottingham was named as a Science City; the other 5 Science Cities were [[Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamsciencecity.co.uk/about-us/ About Us at Birmingham Science City]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], [[York]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm Newcastle Science City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002747/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manchester]].

==Structure==
It is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/318420 situated] in former [[BASF]] buildings, which previously were used by Boots as research laboratories.

The [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/948642 site] on ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1899769 Pennyfoot Street]'', between the [[A60 road|A60]] and [[A612 road|A612]], is for bioscience [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]s. The University of Nottingham has the largest collaboration with companies at BioCity, with a few having links with NTU.

There are three buildings –
* Innovation Centre Building
* Stewart Adams Building – named after Dr Stewart Adams OBE, who led the team at Boots (with John Nicholson) that discovered Ibuprofen, a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]], in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3351540/Dr-Stewart-Adams-I-tested-ibuprofen-on-my-hangover.html Dr Stewart Adams]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Laurus Building

In January 2012 BioCity opened a second site, BioCity Scotland, resulting from the acquisition of a former MSD research facility near Glasgow.

'''Bösendorfer''' (L. Bösendorfer Klavierfabrik [[GmbH]]) is an Austrian  piano manufacturer and, since 2008, a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] of [[Yamaha]].&lt;ref name=yamaha&gt;{{cite web| title=Yamaha History| url=http://www.yamaha.com/about_yamaha/corporate/history/index.html| accessdate=2014-02-24| publisher=Yamaha Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bösendorfer is unusual in that it produces 97- and 92-[[Key (instrument)|key]] models in addition to instruments with standard 88-key [[musical keyboard|keyboards]].

==History==
[[File:Boesendorfer Wieden.png|thumb|The founder Ignaz Bösendorfer]]
[[File:Bösendorfer Tafelklavier Wien SAM.jpg|thumb|The oldest preserved [[square piano]] by Bösendorfer, dating to 1828]]
Bösendorfer, one of the oldest piano manufacturers, was established in 1828 by [[Ignaz Bösendorfer]].&lt;ref name=oldest&gt;{{cite news| title=Yamaha calls the tune in fight for pianos| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/consumer/article2167105.ece| location=[[London]]| work=[[The Times]]| publisher=[[Times Online]]| date=26 November 2007| accessdate=2014-02-24| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a history of producing highly respected instruments; in 1830, it was granted the status of official piano maker to the [[Emperor of Austria]]. Ignaz's son [[Ludwig Bösendorfer]] (15 April 1835&amp;nbsp;– 9 May 1919) assumed control in 1859, operating from new premises from 1860. Between 1872 and its closure in 1913, the associated Bösendorfer-Saal was one of the premier concert halls of Vienna. In 1909, Carl Hutterstrasser purchased the company and was succeeded by his sons Alexander and Wolfgang in 1931. In 1966, the Jasper Corporation (later renamed [[Kimball International]]), parent company of Kimball Pianos, assumed control of Bösendorfer, where it remained before returning to Austrian hands, when the [[BAWAG PSK Gruppe]] purchased it in 2002.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/index.php?menu=120| title=History| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;!--info no longer contained in this reference--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; BAWAG signed an agreement to sell all stock in Bösendorfer to [[Yamaha]] on 20 December 2007.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Boesendorfer 002.jpg|thumb|A Bösendorfer piano, model 214CS]]
Bösendorfer pioneered the extension of the typical 88-key [[musical keyboard|keyboard]], creating the [[Imperial Bösendorfer (piano)|Imperial Grand (Model 290)]], which has 97 keys (eight octaves). [[Ferruccio Busoni]] initially ordered this innovation in 1909 as part of a custom piano, as he wanted to transcribe an organ piece that extended to the C below the standard keyboard.&lt;ref name=imperial&gt;{{cite web| title=Model 290 Imperial| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/model-290-imperial.html| publisher=Bosendorfer| access-date=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111181650/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/model-290-imperial.html| archivedate=11 November 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation worked so well that this piano was added to regular product offerings and quickly became one of the world's most sought-after concert grands. Because of the 290's success, the extra strings were added to Bösendorfer's other line of instruments such as the 225 model, which has 92 keys. The extra keys, at the bass end of the keyboard, were originally hidden beneath a hinged panel mounted between the piano's conventional low A and the left-hand end-cheek to prevent their being struck accidentally during normal play; more recent models have omitted this device and simply have the upper surface of the extra natural keys finished in matte black instead of white to differentiate them from the standard 88.

The Bösendorfer sound is usually described as darker or richer than the purer but less full-bodied sound of other pianos, such as [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] or [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]]. On the Imperial Grand, this characteristic tonal quality in part derives from the inclusion of nine additional bass notes below bottom A.  These extra keys were originally added so that pianists could play [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]]'s transcriptions of [[J.S. Bach]]'s organ works, which required the 32' bass pipes (usually played on the pedal organ).  As very little other music makes direct use of the extra strings, they usually contribute to the piano's sonic character not through being played directly but via [[Sympathetic resonance]], when other strings in the piano are struck, contributing additional body to the tone.  Moreover, the bass notes of the Bösendorfer, including the extra bass keys, are very powerful, adding volume in demanding literature.

Bösendorfer Kuhn pianos count with 10 cupper cristal Swarovski cristals inserted along the steel structure. This cristals help organize sounds and diversify harmonies in contrast to enhance each pianists’ personal signature colour. The Million dollar Kuhn has 72 cristals installed under the cupper wires to improve sound quality.

The rim of a Bösendorfer grand piano is built quite differently from that of all other grands. Instead of veneers bent around a form, the rim is made in solid sections of spruce and jointed together. Spruce is better at transmitting sound than reflecting it. This is perhaps why Bösendorfers tend to have a more delicate treble and a bass that features the fundamental tone more than the higher harmonics.&lt;ref name="Fine,"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fine| first=Larry| title=2007–2008 Annual Supplement to The Piano Book| publisher=Brookside Press| year=2007| page=31| isbn=1-929145-21-7}}&lt;!--| accessdate=25 January 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two other features of Bösendorfers that are shared with only a few other piano brands: one is a removable ''capo d'astro'' bar in the treble, which facilitates rebuilding of the instrument and, Bösendorfer says, provides greater acoustic separation from the plate, decreasing tonal absorption; the other is single-stringing, providing each string its own individual hitch pin on the plate instead of connecting it to a neighboring string. This design may slightly improve tuning stability and is an advantage in case of string breakage.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fine| first=Larry| title=The Piano Book| publisher=Brookside Press| year=2001 |page=103| isbn=1-929145-01-2}}&lt;!--| access-date=20 January 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest development in the Bösendorfer range is the CEUS digital grand piano reproducing system, which incorporates a computer-controlled mechanism that records a performance and plays it back. The requisite equipment can be fitted to most Bösendorfer pianos to allow the direct recording of pieces while capturing all the [[Keyboard expression|keyboard velocity]] data as a .boe file.&lt;ref name=ceus&gt;{{cite web| title=CEUS digital grand piano reproduces virtuosity and emotion| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/ceus-reproducing-system.html| publisher=Bösendorfer| access-date=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312070603/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/ceus-reproducing-system.html| archivedate=12 March 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
[[File:Bosendorfer capo d'astro bar.JPG|thumb|The removable capo d'astro bar is located across the upper two (treble) sections of the cast-iron plate.]]
Bösendorfer makes eight models of grand piano (from 5'1" to 9'6") and two vertical pianos (48" and 52" upright). The 9'6" Imperial Grand is one of the world's largest pianos.

===Standard Black Models===
&lt;ref name=models&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/index.php?menu=1| title=Bösendorfer Standard Models| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each numerical Bösendorfer model directly corresponds to its length in centimeters. For example, a Model 170 is 170 centimeters long (approximately 5'7"). The following table describes the current Bösendorfer models:

===Conservatory Series===
To appeal to a wider market, Bösendorfer designed the Conservatory Series for colleges and universities that could not afford Bösendorfer's standard black-model pianos. The production of the two CS Series pianos spends less time in "non-critical areas", cutting down costs of production and purchase, making them more affordable than standard models. The cases and frames are of satin finish, rather than polished, and initially, the pianos were loop-strung&lt;ref name=buying&gt;{{cite book| title=The Piano Book: Buying &amp; Owning a New Or Used Piano| last=Fine| first=Larry| first2=Keith| last2=Jarrett| first3=Douglas R.| last3=Gilbert| year=2000| publisher=Brookside Press| isbn=978-1-929145-01-0| pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than single-strung, but that difference has since been abandoned.&lt;ref name=accoustic&gt;{{cite book| title=Acoustic and Digital Piano Buyer| last=Fine |first=Larry |year=2010 |publisher=Brookside Press| isbn=1-929145-35-7| page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special and Limited editions===
Bösendorfer has produced a number of specially designed pianos named after famous composers such as [[Franz Schubert]], [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt]], as well as pianos designed for special occasions, such as Bösendorfer's 170th and 175th anniversaries.&lt;ref name=limited&gt;{{cite web| title=Limited Edition| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/limited-edition.html| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111210247/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/limited-edition.html| archivedate=11 November 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SE reproducing piano====
Under the ownership of Kimball, Bösendorfer built and sold a small number of 290SE automatic reproducing pianos.&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{cite book| title=The Piano: an Encyclopedia| url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Piano-Encyclopedia-Keyboard-Instruments/dp/0415937965#reader_0415937965| last=Palmieri| first=Robert| date=11 September 2003| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-0415937962| location=New York City| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 'SE' designation was for Stahnke Engineering, whose founder, [[Wayne Stahnke]], invented the mechanism. The 290 was fitted with electronics and mechanics to record on magnetic tape and playback through electro-mechanical actuation of the piano. After the release of the [[Windows 3.1x|Microsoft Windows v3.1]] operating system, the 290SE could be attached to a PC computer for recording, editing, and playback. The 290SE system was the first commercially available computer-controlled "[[player piano]]" capable of accurately reproducing both the notes and intensity of a performer's playing.  Unfortunately this system was not further developed or patented due to its high cost.  Competitors soon introduced patented reproducing piano technologies such as the [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[Disklavier]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=disklavier&gt;{{cite web| title=Development of Yamaha Products| url=http://usa.yamaha.com/about_yamaha/product_history/| publisher=Yamaha| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty seven SE models were produced between 1984 and 1986, including the 225SE, the 275SE, and the 290SE Imperial model pianos. In the 290 range, this included some 290 to 290SE conversions, while one third of the production were 290SEs that sold for $90,000.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The research that went into the 290SE later laid the foundation for the CEUS computerized reproducing piano system.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Designer Models===
Bösendorfer produces a limited number of Artisan Models annually, each available for order only during the calendar year in which it was developed. An example of a designer model is the Bösendorfer [[Swarovski]] Crystal Grand piano. Three of these special pianos were produced in 2003 in honor of Bösendorfer's 175th anniversary. Each piano's case is encrusted with 8000 crystals and layers of gold.&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web| title=Special and Designer Models| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/special-models.html| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407030042/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/special-models.html| archivedate=7 April 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://starbulletin.com/2007/01/05/news/photofinish.html| title=Photo Finish |work=[[Honolulu Star Bulletin]]| volume=12| issue=5| date=5 January 2007|accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three notable architects who have designed Bösendorfer piano models are [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] (1866), [[Josef Hoffmann]] (1909) and [[Hans Hollein]] (1990). There were only two Hans Hollein 225 models produced in 1990; one can be found in the lounge of the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref name="Kunz"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kunz| first=Johannes| title=Bösendorfer — A Living Legend| publisher=Molden Publishing Co| year=2002| page=213| isbn=3-85485-080-8}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2007-04-03--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bösendorfer artists==
[[File:Boesendorfer Liszt Franz Joseph.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Liszt]] giving a concert for [[Emperor Franz Joseph I]] on a Bösendorfer piano]]
Among the earliest artists to be associated with Bösendorfer was [[Franz Liszt]] who at least once opined that Bösendorfer and [[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]] pianos were the only instruments capable of withstanding his tremendously powerful playing, although he purchased and officially endorsed Steinway &amp; Sons pianos. The renowned twentieth-century American composer-conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] has also performed on a Bösendorfer. Another great pianist who championed Bösendorfer pianos was [[Wilhelm Backhaus]].

In his memoirs, [[Arthur Rubinstein]] recounts having insisted on a Bechstein instead of the hall's Bösendorfer before a recital in Austria.  After the performance, the then-head of the Bösendorfer company came backstage to meet this young artist who refused to play a piano highly cherished by his Russian namesake, [[Anton Rubinstein]]; Rubinstein claims he thereafter always sought out Bösendorfers when in Austria. Both Rubinsteins were Steinway &amp; Sons artists and played these pianos when in the United States.

In the late 1970s, following a concert performed in [[Vienna]], jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]] turned to his impresario, [[Norman Granz]], with the words: "Dammit, Norman, where does this box go? I also gotta have such a thing!" Such was his reaction to playing a Bösendorfer 290.&lt;ref name=oscar&gt;{{cite press release| title=IN MEMORIAM Oscar Emmanuel Peterson – (August 25, 1925 to December 23, 2007) Bösendorfer grieves for a friend...| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/archived-news.html?page=1453| date=28 November 2007| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103224248/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/archived-news.html?page=1453| archivedate=3 January 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician/comedian [[Victor Borge]] also played Bösendorfer pianos.&lt;ref name=borge&gt;{{cite web| title=He Introduced Me To The Bosendorfer Imperial: Victor Borge| url=http://www.company7.com/bosendorfer/victorborge.html| publisher=company7.com| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent examples of notable artists who have played the Bösendorfer include Russian pianist [[Sviatoslav Richter]] (who in later years chose to promote [[Yamaha]] claiming it had a preferable pianissimo sound and control, according to his own interview);&lt;ref name=ciao&gt;{{cite web| title=Richter – The Enigma (DVD)| url=http://dvd.ciao.co.uk/Productinformation/Richter_The_Enigma_DVD__5911109| publisher=[[Ciao (website)|Ciao!]]| date=22 May 2005| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian pianist [[András Schiff]]; Italian pianist [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]]; American [[free jazz]] pianist [[Cecil Taylor]] and American singer-songwriter [[Tori Amos]];&lt;ref name=amos&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/archived-news.html?page=3023| title=A wonderful piano evening in Farmingdale| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830003549/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/archived-news.html?page=3023| archivedate=30 August 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; German pianist [[Wolfgang Rübsam]]; Austrian pianist [[Friedrich Gulda]], [[Walter Klien]] and [[Paul Badura-Skoda]];&lt;ref name="owners"&gt;{{cite web| title=Reference List| url=http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/boesendorfer-owners.html| publisher=Bösendorfer| accessdate=2014-02-24| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235033/http://www.boesendorfer.com/en/boesendorfer-owners.html| archivedate=30 December 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; British pianists [[Leon McCawley]] and [[Mark Gasser]]&lt;ref name=maestro&gt;{{cite web| title=Piano Transport| url=http://www.maestronet.com/forum/index.php?/topic/181953-piano-transport/| date=9 February 2003| publisher=maestro.net| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Irish pianist [[John O'Conor]]. Ukrainian pianist [[Valentina Lisitsa]] has recorded DVDs of Chopin and Schubert-Liszt on a 1925 model Bösendorfer, and has released a new video set of a recital using the 97-key Bösendorfer Imperial.

Minimalist composer [[Charlemagne Palestine]] chose a nine-foot Bösendorfer as the vehicle on which to perform his 1974 composition ''Strumming Music''. Released as his first compact disc in 1991, it features in excess of 45 minutes of Palestine forcefully playing two notes in rapid alternation, slowly expanding into clusters, with the sustain pedal depressed throughout.&lt;ref name=duguid&gt;{{cite news| url=http://media.hyperreal.org/zines/est/intervs/palestin.html| title=Charlemagne Palestine Interview| last=Duguid| first=Mark| date=April 1996| work=Est| accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the music swells (and the piano gradually detunes), the harmonics build and the listener can hear a variety of timbres rarely produced by the piano.

Jazz pianist [[Keith Jarrett]] performed the solo improvisations (his [[The Köln Concert|Köln Concert]]) at the Cologne Opera House in [[Cologne]] on 24 January 1975 on a Bösendorfer and became a Steinway &amp; Sons artist in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://steinway.com/artists/keith-jarrett|title=Keith Jarrett – Steinway &amp; Sons|website=steinway.com|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jazz singers/pianists [[Nina Simone]] and [[Shirley Horn]] performed on Bösendorfers many times throughout their careers.

In a recent interview for Broadway.com, Academy Award-winning composer [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] stated that he purchased a Bösendorfer after the initial success of his musical [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]].

[[File:Pot of Bun Bo Hue.jpg|thumb|A pot of bún bò broth with rice noodles being cooked separately at a [[Saigon]] eatery]]

'''Bún bò Huế''' (pronounced {{IPA-vi|ɓun˧˥ ɓɔ˧˩ hwe˧˥|}}) or '''bún bò''' is a popular Vietnamese soup containing [[rice vermicelli]] (''bún'') and beef (''bò'').&lt;ref name=kim/&gt; [[Huế]] is a city in central Vietnam associated with the cooking style of the former royal court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thanh Nien Weekly]] 2 Dec 2011 print edition [http://www.thanhniennews.com/2010/pages/20111201-eating-hue-foods-as-locals.aspx When in Hue] "The most popular Hue dish would have to be bún bò Huế, a spicy beef and vermicelli soup that goes down well with Vietnamese people and foreigners alike."&lt;/ref&gt; The dish is greatly admired for its balance of spicy, sour, salty, and umami flavors. The predominant flavor is that of [[Cymbopogon|lemongrass]].&lt;ref name=Thaker/&gt; Compared to ''[[pho|phở]]'' or ''[[bún riêu]]'', the noodles are thicker and more cylindrical.&lt;ref name=Danh/&gt;

==Features==
Bún bò originated in Huế, a former capital of Vietnam. Outside the city of Huế and some parts of central Vietnam, it is called ''bún bò Huế'' to denote its origin. Within Huế and surrounding cities, it is known simply as ''bún bò''. The broth is prepared by simmering beef bones and beef shank with lemongrass, and then seasoned with fermented shrimp sauce and sugar for taste. Spicy chili oil is added later during the cooking process.

Bún bò usually includes thin slices of marinated and boiled [[beef shank]], chunks of [[oxtail]], and pig's knuckles. It can also include cubes of congealed pig blood, which has a color between dark brown and maroon, and a texture resembling firm tofu.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Nguyen ''Into the Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Foodways, Modern Flavors'' Ten Speed Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-1580086653}} p10 "people from the central region will at first demur and then counter that ''bún bò Huế'', a chile-and-lemongrass-seasoned beef and rice noodle soup from the former imperial capital, is equally good" full recipe p212-214&lt;/ref&gt;

Bún bò is commonly served with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] wedges, [[cilantro]] sprigs, diced green onions, raw sliced onions, chili sauce, thinly sliced banana blossom, red cabbage, mint, basil, perilla, ''Persicaria odorata'' or [[Vietnamese coriander]] (''rau răm''), [[saw tooth herb]] (''ngò gai'') and sometimes [[Mung bean#Bean sprouts|mung bean sprouts]]. Thinly sliced purple cabbage is acceptable substitute when banana blossoms are not available. Purple cabbage most resembles banana blossom in texture, though not in taste. Fish sauce and shrimp sauce are added to the soup according to taste. Ingredients might be varied by regions due to their availability.

'''''Cannibal''''' is a 2006 German [[direct-to-video]] [[horror film]] written, directed and produced by Marian Dora in his feature film debut. The film centers on a mentally disturbed individual simply known as "The Man", who has cannibalistic fantasies, who makes a deal with a suicidal man known as "The Flesh" who agrees to let The Man eat him.
{{TOC limit|2}}

== Plot ==

In the intro, a mother reads the story of ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' to her young boy. The setting then moves to the present day, where The Man goes about his day-to-day routines and occasionally chats with others on his computer, where he looks for someone who shares his cannibalistic fantasies. The Man meets with several people he had chatted with, but he either rejects them or is rejected (and in one case attacked) by them, except for The Flesh, a suicidal man who volunteers to be killed and eaten by The Man. The Flesh travels to The Man from [[Berlin]], and the two bond, having sex and frolicking in the nude in and around The Man's home.

When The Flesh decides that it is time for him to die and be devoured, he tries to coerce The Man into biting off his penis, but The Man is unable to go through with it, even when The Flesh uses drugs to knock himself out in an attempt to make things easier. Disappointed, The Flesh chastises The Man. The Flesh decides to give him another chance when The Man begs him to stay just as he is about to board a train back to Berlin. Returning to The Man's home, The Flesh ingests a large amount of alcohol and pills, then instructs The Man to castrate him with a kitchen knife, which The Man succeeds at doing. The two then fry and attempt to eat the severed penis, before The Flesh seemingly dies of blood loss in a bath The Man places The Flesh in.

The Man drags The Flesh's inert body (which vomits and defecates repeatedly) to a room he has readied for slaughter. Before he can begin taking The Flesh apart, The Man is shocked to discover The Flesh is still alive, so he stabs him in the throat. The Man then beheads, guts and dismembers The Flesh, buries the inedible parts, and cooks and eats the rest; he places The Flesh's severed head at the head of the table. The Man then masturbates to video footage of what he has done, and leaves.

* Victor Brandl as The Flesh
* [[Manoush]] as The Man's Mother

== Production ==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
''Cannibal'' is partially based on the true story of [[Armin Meiwes]] who killed and ate a man whom he met on the Internet.&lt;ref name="times06"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landler |first1=Mark |title=Cannibal Wins Ban of Film in Germany - The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/04/movies/MoviesFeatures/cannibal-wins-ban-of-film-in-germany.html |website=New York Times.com |publisher=Mark Landler |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 director Marian Dora, accepted [[Ulli Lommel]]'s assignment to make a feature film in Germany that documented the Meiwes case. Dora's finished film was rejected by Lommel as being too gory, and Dora subsequently released the movie on his own in Germany within months. Lommel set about producing his own version of the Meiwes case, which became the 2007 film ''[[Diary of a Cannibal]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Scott Weinberg of [[DVD Talk]] rated the film 2/5 stars and wrote, "One of the sickest and freakiest movies ever to come from a nation well-known for its freaky and sick movies (Germany), ''Cannibal'' is shocking, outrageous, sickening ... and just a little bit interesting because it's based on actual events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/26352/cannibal/|title=Cannibal|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2006-12-05|accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Siebalt of [[Dread Central]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "The only real selling point ''Cannibal'' has is its graphic depiction of cannibalism. There are some nasty, nasty moments throughout, but you have to get through a whole lot of nothing before you see them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/cannibal-dvd|title=Cannibal (DVD)|last=Siebalt|first=Joshua|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2006-12-15|accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Leonard from ''HorrorNews.net'' praised the film, writing, "This is the first movie in a long time that disturbed me to my core. The entire second half of this movie is non-stop suffering, sadness, dismemberment, and cannibalism. It feels very real, like the viewer is watching from the next room, but also like the viewer is watching something real. The scary thing is, somewhere out there exists video of the actual events."&lt;ref name="leanardhnrev"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leonard |first1=Sean |title=Film Review: Cannibal (2006) |url=https://horrornews.net/66155/film-review-cannibal-2006/ |website=HorrorNews.net |publisher=Sean Leonard |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gryllidae have mainly cylindrical bodies, round heads, and long [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Behind the head is a smooth, robust pronotum. The abdomen ends in a pair of long [[Cercus|cerci]] (spikes); females have a long, cylindrical [[ovipositor]]. The hind legs have enlarged femora (thighs), providing power for jumping. The front wings are adapted as tough, leathery [[elytron|elytra]] (wing covers), and some crickets chirp by rubbing parts of these together. The hind wings are membranous and folded when not in use for flight; many species, however, are flightless. The largest members of the family are the bull crickets, ''[[Brachytrupes]]'', which are up to {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} long.

More than 900 [[species]] of crickets are described; the Gryllidae are distributed all around the world except at latitudes 55° or higher, with the greatest diversity being in the [[tropics]]. They occur in varied habitats from grassland, bushes, and forests to marshes, beaches, and caves. Crickets are mainly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], and are best known for the loud, persistent, chirping song of males trying to attract females, although some species are mute. The singing species have good hearing, via the [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympana]] (eardrums) on the tibiae of the front legs.

Crickets often appear as characters in literature. The [[Talking Cricket]] features in [[Carlo Collodi]]'s 1883 children's book, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and in films based on the book. The eponymous insect is central to [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1845 ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', as is the chirping insect in [[George Selden (author)|George Selden]]'s 1960 ''[[The Cricket in Times Square]]''. Crickets are celebrated in poems by [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], and [[Du Fu]]. They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe, sometimes for cricket fighting. Crickets [[feed conversion ratio|are efficient at converting their food into body mass]], making them a candidate for food production. They are used as food in Southeast Asia, where they are sold [[deep-fried]] in markets as snacks. They are also used to feed carnivorous pets and zoo animals. In Brazilian folklore, crickets feature as omens of various events.

==Description==
[[File:african.field.cricket.arp.jpg|thumb|left|African [[field cricket]] ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'']]

Crickets are small to medium-sized insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind these are two large compound eyes. On the forehead are three [[ocelli]] (simple eyes). The [[pronotum]] (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-[[sclerotin]]ized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).&lt;ref name=Otte2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Otte, Daniel |title=Australian Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkvoRnAM6WUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ved=0CCQQuwUwAA&amp;q=Morphological%20characteristics |year=2007 |publisher=Academy of Natural Sciences |isbn=978-1-4223-1928-4 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the tip of the abdomen is a pair of long [[Cercus|cerci]] (paired appendages on rearmost segment), and in females, the [[ovipositor]] is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.&lt;ref name=Otte2007/&gt;

The wings lie flat on the body and are very variable in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore wings are [[Elytron|elytra]] made of tough [[chitin]], acting as a protective shield for the soft parts of the body and in males, bear the [[stridulatory]] organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.&lt;ref name=Resh/&gt;

The largest members of the family are the {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}}-long bull crickets (''[[Brachytrupes]]'') which excavate burrows a metre or more deep. The [[tree cricket]]s (Oecanthinae) are delicate white or pale green insects with transparent fore wings, while the [[field cricket]]s (Gryllinae) are robust brown or black insects.&lt;ref name=Resh&gt;{{cite book |author1= Resh, Vincent H. |author2= Cardé, Ring T. |title=Encyclopedia of Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jk0Hym1yF0cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA&amp;q=Grylloidea |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092090-0 |pages=232–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
Crickets have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in all parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at [[latitude]]s higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest [[Biodiversity|diversity]] occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near [[Kuala Lumpur]]. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are [[Muteness|mute]].&lt;ref name=Resh/&gt;

Crickets are found in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies are found in the upper [[Canopy (biology)|tree canopy]], in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, excavating shallow or deep burrows. Some make home in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of water.&lt;ref name=Resh/&gt;

==Biology==

===Defence===
Crickets are relatively defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are [[nocturnal]] and spend the day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in the cracks in the ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the [[mandible]]s and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.&lt;ref name=Huber1989/&gt;

Other [[antipredator adaptation|defensive strategies]] are the use of [[camouflage]], fleeing, and [[aggression]]. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that make it difficult for predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.&lt;ref name=Huber1989/&gt;

===Chirping===

[[File:Gryllus01.jpg|thumb|A male ''Gryllus'' cricket chirping: Its head faces its burrow; the leathery fore wings ([[tegmen|tegmina]]; singular "tegmen") are raised (clear of the more delicate hind wings) and are being scraped against each other ([[stridulation]]) to produce the song. The burrow acts as a [[resonator]], amplifying the sound.]]

Most male crickets make a loud chirping sound by [[stridulation]] (scraping two specially textured limbs together). The stridulatory organ is located on the [[tegmen]], or fore wing, which is leathery in texture. A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like [[serration]]s on its edge forming a file-like structure, and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper. The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other. The central part of the tegmen contains the "harp", an area of thick, [[sclerotin]]ized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound, as does the pocket of air between the tegmina and the body wall. Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, so make no sound.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chapman, R. F. |author2=Simpson, Stephen J. |author3=Douglas, Angela E. |title=The Insects: Structure and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXJEi8fo7CkC&amp;pg=PA826 |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-11389-2 |pages=826–833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of cricket songs are in the repertoire of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller. A triumphal song is produced for a brief period after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum1996/&gt; An aggressive song is triggered by contact [[chemoreceptor]]s on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hardy, Tad N. |author2=Shaw, Kenneth C. |year=1983 |title=The role of chemoreception in sex recognition by male crickets: ''Acheta domesticus'' and ''Teleogryllus oceanicus'' |journal=Physiological Entomology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=151–166 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3032.1983.tb00344.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature of their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the temperature is (about 62 chirps a minute at {{convert|13|C}} in one common species; each species has its own rate). The relationship between temperature and the rate of chirping is known as [[Dolbear's law]]. According to this law, counting the number of chirps produced in 14 seconds by the [[Oecanthus fultoni|snowy tree cricket]], common in the [[United States]], and adding 40 will approximate the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum1996&gt;{{cite book|author=Berenbaum, May R. |title=Bugs in the System: Insects and Their Impact on Human Affairs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2XygvH9GBoC&amp;pg=PA44 |year=1996 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02445-2 |pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|The calling song of a field cricket]]

In 1975, Dr. [[William H. Cade]] discovered that the [[parasitism|parasitic]] [[Tachinidae|tachinid]] [[fly]] ''[[Ormia ochracea]]'' is attracted to the song of the cricket, and uses it to locate the male to deposit her [[larva]]e on him. It was the first known example of a natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cade W. H. | year = 1975 | title = Acoustically orienting parasitoids: Fly phonotaxis to cricket song | url = | journal = Science | volume = 190 | issue = | pages = 1312–1313 | doi=10.1126/science.190.4221.1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many species of crickets have been found to be carrying the same parasitic fly, or related species. In response to this selective pressure, a mutation leaving males unable to chirp was observed amongst a population of [[Teleogryllus oceanicus|field crickets]] on the [[Hawaii]]an island of [[Kauai]], enabling these crickets to elude their [[parasitoid]] predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tinghitella, R.M. |year=2008 |title=Rapid evolutionary change in a sexual signal: genetic control of the mutation 'flatwing' that renders male field crickets (''Teleogryllus oceanicus'') mute |journal=Heredity |volume=100 |pages=261–267 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6801069 |pmid=18000520}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different mutation with the same effect was also discovered on the neighboring island of Oahu (ca. {{convert|100|mi|km}} away).&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite web |last=Yong |first=Ed |date=2014-05-09 |title=The Silence of the Crickets, The Silence of the Crickets |url= http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/05/29/the-silence-of-the-crickets-the-silence-of-the-crickets/ |work= Phenomena: A Science Salon |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |location= |access-date= 2017-06-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161225202343/http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/05/29/the-silence-of-the-crickets-the-silence-of-the-crickets/ | archivedate=2016-12-25 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight===

Some species, such as the ground crickets ([[Nemobiinae]]), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (''[[Copholandrevus]]''), others lack hind wings and have shortened fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the fore wings. In ''[[Teleogryllus]]'', the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight.&lt;ref name=Otte2007/&gt;

Some species, such as ''[[Gryllus assimilis]]'', take off, fly, and land efficiently and well, while other species are clumsy fliers.&lt;ref name=Resh/&gt; In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, they may be pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker, T.J. |year=1972 |title=Deciduous wings in crickets: a new basis for wing dimorphism |journal=Psyche |volume=79 |issue=4 |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/Walker/buzz/k340lw72.pdf |doi=10.1155/1972/17254 |pages=311–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gryllus firmus]]'' exhibits wing [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]; some individuals have fully functional, long hind wings and others have short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater [[ovarian]] development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.&lt;ref name=Devillers&gt;{{cite book|author=Devillers, James |title=Juvenile Hormones and Juvenoids: Modeling Biological Effects and Environmental Fate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FDOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 |year=2013 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4665-1322-8 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
[[File:Crickets feeding on carrot.jpg|thumb|Two adult domestic crickets, ''[[Acheta domestica]]'', feeding on carrot]]

Captive crickets are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]; when deprived of their natural diet, they accept a wide range of organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more [[Predation|predatory]] and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, [[scale insect]]s, and [[aphid]]s.&lt;ref name=Huber28/&gt; Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi.&lt;ref name="cricket"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insected.arizona.edu/cricketinfo.htm |publisher=University of Arizona |title=Cricket Information |accessdate=15 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527072448/http://insected.arizona.edu/cricketinfo.htm |archivedate=27 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry [[dog food]], supplemented with [[lettuce]] and aphids.&lt;ref name=Huber28&gt;{{cite book|author=Huber, Franz |title=Cricket Behavior and Neurobiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAP2LkQV0X0C&amp;pg=PA28 |year=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-2272-8 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crickets have relatively powerful jaws, and several species have been known to bite humans.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.S.C. (1879). ''Journal of Horticulture and Practical Gardening, Volume 37'', p.503.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and lifecycle===

Male crickets establish their [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]] over each other by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, at the same time each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.&lt;ref name=Matthews/&gt;

Females are generally attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur during which the character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single [[spermatophore]] is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's [[oviduct]] over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After [[copulation]], the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.&lt;ref name=Choe&gt;{{cite book |author1=Choe, Jae C. |author2=Crespi, Bernard J. |title=The Evolution of Mating Systems in Insects and Arachnids |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3Iz-zXolVcC&amp;pg=PA89 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58976-5 |pages=89–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Snodgrass Gryllus assimilis.png|thumb|Various [[instar]]s of ''[[Gryllus assimilis]]'', by [[Robert Evans Snodgrass]], 1930]]
Most crickets lay their eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, needle-like or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an [[ovipositor]]. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into the wall of a burrow.&lt;ref name=Resh/&gt; The short-tailed cricket (''[[Anurogryllus]]'') excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/buzz/g491a.htm |title=Genus Anurogryllus: Short-tailed crickets |author=Walker, T. J. |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crickets are [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolic]] insects, whose lifecycle consists of an egg stage, a larval or [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph about the size of a [[Drosophila|fruit fly]]. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive [[Moulting|moult]], it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manning, Aubrey |author2=Dawkins, Marian Stamp |title=An Introduction to Animal Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3khAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-37773-8 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Some species of cricket are [[polyandry|polyandrous]]. In ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'', the females select and mate with multiple viable sperm donors, preferring novel mates.&lt;ref name="BretmanTregenza2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bretman | first1=A. | last2=Tregenza | first2=T. | year=2005 | title=Measuring polyandry in wild populations: a case study using promiscuous crickets | journal=Molecular Ecology | volume=14 | issue=7| pages=2169–2179 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2005.02556.x | pmid=15910335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female ''[[Teleogryllus oceanicus]]'' crickets from natural populations similarly mate and store sperm from multiple males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simmons | first1=Leigh W. |last2=Beveridge | first2=Maxine | date=26 August 2010 | title=The strength of postcopulatory sexual selection within natural populations of field crickets | url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/6/1179/331339/The-strength-of-postcopulatory-sexual-selection | journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]] | volume=21 | issue=6 | pages=1179–1185 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arq132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female crickets exert a postcopulatory [[fertilization]] bias in favour of unrelated males to avoid the genetic consequences of [[Inbreeding depression|inbreeding]].

===Predators, parasites, and pathogens===
Crickets have many natural enemies and are subject to various [[pathogen]]s and parasites. They are eaten by large numbers of vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their hard parts are often found during the examination of animal intestines.&lt;ref name=Huber1989/&gt; [[Mediterranean house gecko]]s (''Hemidactylus turcicus'')  have learned that although a calling [[Gryllodes supplicans|decorated cricket]] (''Gryllodes supplicans'') may be safely positioned in an out-of-reach burrow, female crickets attracted to the call can be intercepted and eaten.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;{{cite book|author1= Matthews, Robert W.|author2= Matthews, Janice R. |title=Insect Behavior |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVz2Wztita8C&amp;pg=PA319 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-90-481-2389-6 |pages=314–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pterinochilus murinus sling.jpg|thumb|left|Crickets are reared as food for pets and zoo animals like this baboon spider, ''[[Pterinochilus murinus]]'', emerging from its den to feed.]]
The [[entomopathogenic fungus]] ''[[Metarhizium anisopliae]]'' attacks and kills crickets and has been used as the basis of control in pest populations.&lt;ref name=Huber1989/&gt; The insects are also affected by the [[cricket paralysis virus]], which has caused high levels of fatalities in cricket-rearing facilities.&lt;ref name=Kurstak&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kurstak, Edouard |author2=Kreuter, Jorg|title=Virus of Invertebrates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTVazIRltPMC&amp;pg=PA289 |year=1991 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-8469-0 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fatal diseases that have been identified in mass-rearing establishments include ''[[Rickettsia]]'' and three further viruses.

The fly ''Ormia ochracea'' has very acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby.

A phylogenetic study by Jost &amp; Shaw in 2006 using sequences from 18S, 28S, and 16S [[Non-coding RNA|rRNA]] supported the monophyly of Ensifera. Most ensiferan families were also found to be monophyletic, and the superfamily Gryllacridoidea was found to include Stenopelmatidae, Anostostomatidae, Gryllacrididae and Lezina. Schizodactylidae and Grylloidea were shown to be sister taxa, and Rhaphidophoridae and Tettigoniidae were found to be more closely related to Grylloidea than had previously been thought. The authors stated that "a high degree of conflict exists between the molecular and morphological data, possibly indicating that much homoplasy is present in Ensifera, particularly in acoustic structures." They considered that tegmen stridulation and tibial tympanae are ancestral to Ensifera and have been lost on multiple occasions, especially within the Gryllidae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jost, M.C, |author2=Shaw, K.L. |year=2006 |title=Phylogeny of Ensifera (Hexapoda: Orthoptera) using three ribosomal loci, with implications for the evolution of acoustic communication |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=510–530 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.10.004 |pmid=16298145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore and myth===
The folklore and mythology surrounding crickets is extensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Costa Neto, E.M. |date=2006 |title=Cricket singing means rain: semiotic meaning of insects in the district of Pedra Branca, Bahia State, northeastern Brazil |journal=Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0001-37652006000100007 |doi=10.1590/s0001-37652006000100007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singing of crickets in the folklore of Brazil and elsewhere is sometimes taken to be a sign of impending rain, or of a financial windfall. In [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]]'s  chronicles of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the sudden chirping of a cricket heralded the sighting of land for his crew, just as their water supply had run out.&lt;ref name="lenko"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lenko, K. |author2=Papavero, N. |date=1996 |title=Insetos no folclore |publisher=Plêiade/FAPESP |location=São Paulo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Caraguatatuba]], Brazil, a black cricket in a room is said to portend illness; a gray one, money; and a green one, [[hope]].&lt;ref name="lenko" /&gt; In [[Alagoas]] state, northeast Brazil, a cricket announces death, thus it is killed if it chirps in a house.&lt;ref&gt;Araujo, R. L. Catálogo dos Isoptera do novo mundo. Academia Brasileira de Ciências, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Barbados]], a loud cricket means money is coming in; hence, a cricket must not be killed or evicted if it chirps inside a house. However, another type of cricket that is less noisy forebodes illness or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Forde, G.

===In literature===

Crickets feature as major characters in novels and children's books. [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1845 novella ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', divided into sections called "Chirps", tells the story of a cricket which chirps on the hearth and acts as a [[guardian angel]] to a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kitton, Frederic G. |year=1900 |title=The Minor Writings of Charles Dickens |location=London |publisher=Elliot Stock |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Collodi]]'s 1883 children's book "Le avventure di Pinocchio" (''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'') featured "Il Grillo Parlante" (The [[Talking Cricket]]) as one of its characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Collodi, Carlo |title=Le Avventure di Pinocchio | date=1883 |publisher=Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Selden (author)|George Selden's]] 1960 children's book ''[[The Cricket in Times Square]]'' tells the story of Chester the cricket from [[Connecticut]] who joins a family and their other animals, and is taken to see [[Times Square]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Selden |first1=George |title=The Cricket in Times Square |date=1960 |publisher=Yearling |isbn=0-440-41563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story, which won the Newbery Honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922–Present |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal |publisher=American Library Association |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to Selden on hearing a real cricket chirp in Times Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edupaperback.org/showauth.cfm?authid=155 |title=On-line biography of George Selden |publisher=The Educational Paperback Association |accessdate=9 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423081829/http://www.edupaperback.org/showauth.cfm?authid=155 |archivedate=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Souvenirs entomologiques'', a book written by the French entomologist [[Jean-Henri Fabre]], devotes a whole chapter to the cricket, discussing its construction of a burrow and its song-making. The account is mainly of the field cricket, but also mentions the [[Oecanthus pellucens|Italian cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fabre |first1=Jean-Henri |title=Fabre's Book of Insects – Retold from Alexander Teixeira de Mattos' Translation of Fabre's "Souvenirs Entomologiques" |url=http://www.american-buddha.com/lit.fabreinsects.12.htm |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crickets have from time to time appeared in poetry. [[William Wordsworth]]'s 1805 poem ''The Cottager to Her Infant'' includes the couplet "The kitten sleeps upon the hearth, The crickets long have ceased their mirth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wordsworth | first=William |title=The Cottager to her Infant |url=http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww283.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Keats]]'s 1819 poem ''[[Ode to Autumn]]'' includes the lines "Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keats |first=John |title=Ode to Autumn |url=http://www.bartleby.com/106/255.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] poet [[Du Fu]] (712–770) wrote a poem that in the translation by J. P. Seaton begins "House cricket&amp;nbsp;... Trifling thing. And yet how his mournful song moves us. Out in the grass his cry was a tremble, But now, he trills beneath our bed, to share his sorrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tu Fu – translated by J.P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">The term '''cultural lag''' refers to the notion that [[culture]] takes time to catch up with technological innovations, and that [[social problems]] and conflicts are caused by this lag. Subsequently, cultural lag does not only apply to this idea only, but also relates to theory and explanation. It helps by identifying and explaining social problems to predict future problems.

As explained by James W. Woodward, when the material conditions change, changes are occasioned in the adaptive culture, but these changes in the adaptive culture do not synchronize exactly with the change in the material culture, this delay is the culture lag.&lt;ref name=Woodward&gt;Woodard, James W. "Critical Notes on the Culture Lag Concept." Social Forces 12.3 (Mar. 1934): 388-398. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by sociologist [[William F. Ogburn]] in his 1922 work ''Social change with respect to culture and original nature.''&lt;ref name=Ogburn&gt;Ogburn, William F. Social change: With respect to cultural and original nature. Oxford England: Delta Books, 1966. PsycINFO. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of cultural lag suggests that a period of maladjustment occurs when the non-material culture is struggling to adapt to new material conditions.&lt;ref name=Schaefer&gt;Schaefer, Richard T. ''Sociology: A Brief Introduction 8th Edition.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This resonates with ideas of [[technological determinism]]. That is it can presuppose that technology has independent effects on society at large. However it does not necessarily assign causality to technology. Rather cultural lag focuses examination on the period of adjustment to new technologies. 

According to Ogburn, cultural lag is a common societal phenomenon due to the tendency of [[material culture]] to evolve and change rapidly and voluminously while non-material culture tends to resist change and remain fixed for a far longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, William F. "Cultural Lag as Theory." Sociology &amp; Social Research 41.3 (Jan. 1957): 167-174. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the opposing nature of these two aspects of culture, adaptation of new technology becomes rather difficult. This distinction between material and non-material culture is also a contribution of Ogburn's 1922 work on social change.&lt;ref name="Ogburn"/&gt; 

Cultural lag creates problems for a society in a multitude of ways. The issue of cultural lag tends to permeate any discussion in which the implementation of some new technology is a topic. For example, the advent of stem cell research has given rise to many new, potentially beneficial medical technologies; however these new technologies have also raised serious ethical questions about the use of stem cells in medicine. Cultural lag is seen as a critical ethical issue because failure to develop broad social consensus on appropriate applications of modern technology may lead to breakdowns in social solidarity and the rise of social conflict.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, Kimball P. "Has Technology Introduced New Ethical Problems?." Journal of Business Ethics 19.1 (n.d.): 81-90. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deliberative democracy''' or '''discursive democracy'''  is a form of [[democracy]] in which [[deliberation]] is central to [[decision-making]]. It adopts elements of both [[consensus decision-making]] and [[majority rule]].  Deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic [[political theory|theory]] in that authentic deliberation, not mere [[vote|voting]], is the primary source of legitimacy for the [[law]].

While deliberative democracy is generally seen as some form of an amalgam of [[representative democracy]] and [[direct democracy]], the actual relationship is usually open to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landemore|first=HÉLÈNE|date=2017|title=Deliberative Democracy as Open, Not ( Just) Representative Democracy|url=|journal=Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners and theorists use the term to encompass representative bodies whose members authentically deliberate on legislation without unequal distributions of power, while others use the term exclusively to refer to decision-making directly by lay citizens, as in direct democracy.

The term "deliberative democracy" was originally coined by Joseph M. Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Press Clause to Amplify Civic Discourse beyond Mere Opinion Sharing|author=Akilah N.

==Overview==
Deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sze.hu/~smuk/Nyilvanossag_torvenyek_CEE/Szakirodalom/Deliberat%C3%ADv%20demokr%C3%A1cia/deliberative%20democracy%20book.pdf#page=72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibj|first=Ethan|year=1997|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Threlkeld, Simon. “A Blueprint for Democratic Law-making: Give Citizen Juries the Final Say.” Social Policy, Summer, 1998, pp 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; If the decision-makers cannot reach [[consensus]] after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to [[Aristotle]] and his notion of politics; however, the German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of the roots and different streams of deliberative democracy, see Ercan, S.A. (2014) 'Deliberative democracy', in: D. Phillips (ed.), Encyclopedia of educational theory and philosophy. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, pp.214-216 http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book238016&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both [[representative democracy|representative democracies]] and [[direct democracy|direct democracies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Introduction}} Elster offers a summary of the various common definitions that academics use for the term.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''elitist deliberative democracy,'' principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies, such as [[legislature]]s and [[court]]s; in ''populist deliberative democracy,'' principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibj|first=Ethan J.|year=1997|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic [[public opinion]] about societal issues but not directly create binding law; devices such as the [[deliberative opinion poll]] have been designed to achieve this goal. Another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of [[direct democracy]], where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a "public will" and directly creates binding law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibj|first=Ethan J.|year=1997|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Threlkeld, Simon. “A Blueprint for Democratic Law-making: Give Citizen Juries the Final Say.” Social Policy, Summer, 1998, pp 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; If political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives, then there is no democratic element; this deliberative process is called ''elite deliberation''.&lt;ref name="fishkin 2 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|location=Chapters 2 &amp; 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fishkin, this process attempts to indirectly filter the mass public opinion because representatives are better equipped with the knowledge of the common good than ordinary citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When the People Speak: Deliberative Democracy and Public Consultation|last=S. Fishkin|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199572106|location=New York|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Fishkin's model of deliberation===
[[James Fishkin]], who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy for over 15 years in various countries,&lt;ref name="ross 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Carne|year=2011|location=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation:
:*''Information'': The extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue
:* ''Substantive balance'': The extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives
:* ''Diversity'': The extent to which the major position in the public are represented by participants in the discussion
:* ''Conscientiousness'': The extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments
:* ''Equal consideration'': The extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When the People speak|last = Fishkin|first = James S.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-19-957210-6|location = Oxford|pages = 160f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Fishkin's definition of deliberative democracy, lay citizens must participate in the decision-making process, thus making it a subtype of [[direct democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Fishkin and Robert Luskin suggest that deliberative discussion should be:&lt;ref&gt;Fishkin, J. S., &amp; Luskin, R. C. (2005). Experimenting with a democratic ideal: Deliberative polling and public opinion. Acta Politica, 40(3), 284–298.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Informed'' (and thus informative). Arguments should be supported by appropriate and reasonably accurate factual claims.
# ''Balanced''. Arguments should be met by contrary arguments.
# ''Conscientious''. The participants should be willing to talk and listen, with civility and respect.
# ''Substantive''. Arguments should be considered sincerely on their merits, not on how they are made or by who is making them.
# ''Comprehensive''. All points of view held by significant portions of the population should receive attention.

===Cohen's outline===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a student of [[John Rawls]], outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy, in the article "Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy" in the 1989 book ''The Good Polity''.  He outlines five main features of deliberative democracy, which include:

# An ongoing independent association with expected continuation.
# The citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue.
# A commitment to the respect of a pluralism of values and aims within the polity.
# The citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy, and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process.
# Each member recognizes and respects other members' deliberative capacity.
This can be construed as the idea that in the legislative process, we "owe" one another reasons for our proposals.

Cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy, and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving "ideal deliberation":
# It is free in two ways:
## The participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation.  They are free from any authority of prior norms or requirements.
## The participants suppose that they can act on the decision made; the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached.
# Parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals, and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given, as the content of the very deliberation taking place.
# Participants are equal in two ways:
## Formal: anyone can put forth proposals, criticize, and support measures.  There is no substantive hierarchy.
## Substantive: The participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power, resources, or pre-existing norms. "The participants…do not regard themselves as bound by the existing system of rights, except insofar as that system establishes the framework of free deliberation among equals."
# Deliberation aims at a rationally motivated [[consensus]]: it aims to find reasons acceptable to all who are committed to such a system of decision-making.  When consensus or something near enough is not possible, [[majority rule|majoritarian decision making]] is used.

In ''Democracy and Liberty'', an essay published in 1998, Cohen reiterated many of these points, also emphasizing the concept of "reasonable pluralism" – the acceptance of different, incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 8 (essay by Cohen)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gutmann and Thompson's model===
[[Amy Gutmann]] and [[Dennis F. Thompson]]'s definition captures the elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy. They define it as "a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible, with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future".&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2004). ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' pp. 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

They state that deliberative democracy has four requirements, which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another:
# Reciprocal. The reasons should be acceptable to free and equal persons seeking fair terms of cooperation. 
# Accessible. The reasons must be given in public and the content must be understandable to the relevant audience.
# Binding. The reason-giving process leads to a decision or law that is enforced for some period of time.  The participants do not deliberate just for the sake of deliberation or for individual enlightenment. 
# Dynamic or Provisional. The participants must keep open the possibility of changing their minds, and continuing a reason-giving dialogue that can challenge previous decisions and laws.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
A claimed strength of deliberative democratic models is that they are more easily able to incorporate [[science|scientific]] opinion and base policy on outputs of ongoing research, because:
*Time is given for all participants to understand and discuss the science
*Scientific peer review, adversarial presentation of competing arguments, refereed journals, even betting markets, are also deliberative processes.
*The technology used to record dissent and document opinions opposed to the majority is also useful to notarize bets, predictions and claims.

According to proponents such as [[James Fearon]], another strength of deliberative democratic models is that they tend, more than any other model, to generate ideal conditions of [[impartiality]], [[rationality]] and [[knowledge]] of the relevant facts. The more these conditions are fulfilled, the greater the likelihood that the decisions reached are [[ethics|morally correct]]. Deliberative democracy takes on the role of an "[[epistemic democracy]]" in this way, as it thus has an ''[[epistemic]]'' value: it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 2 (essay by Fearon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been prominently held by [[Carlos Nino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nino|first=Carlos|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by [[James Fishkin]] and others have found that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan C. Strokes in her critical essay ''Pathologies of Deliberation'' (Chapter 5 of Elster 1998) concedes there that a majority of academics interested agree with this view.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberative democracy produces less partisanship and more sympathy with opposing views; more respect for evidence-based reasoning rather than opinion; a greater commitment to the decisions taken by those involved; and a greater chance for widely shared consensus to emerge, thus promoting social cohesion between people from different backgrounds.&lt;ref name="fishkin 2 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ross 3"/&gt; Fishkin cites extensive empirical support for the increase in public spiritedness that is often caused by participation in deliberation, and says theoretical support can be traced back to foundational democratic thinkers such as [[John Stuart Mill]]  and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Chapter 5 of Fishkin (2011), which gives detailed citations to the empirical work. The specific Mill work cited is ''Considerations on Representative Government'' (1861), and the specific Tocqueville work cited is ''Democracy in America'' (1835).&lt;/ref&gt; Former diplomat [[Carne Ross]] writes that in 2011 that the debates arising from deliberative democracy are also much more civil, collaborative, and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums. For Ross, the key reason for this is that in deliberative democracy citizens are empowered by knowledge that their debates will have a measurable impact on society.&lt;ref name="ross 3"/&gt;

A claimed failure of most theories of deliberative democracy is that they do not address the problems of voting. [[James Fishkin]]'s 1991 work, "Democracy and Deliberation", introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making, by way of what he calls the [[deliberative opinion poll]]. In the deliberative opinion poll, a statistically representative sample of the nation or a community is gathered to discuss an issue in conditions that further deliberation. The group is then polled, and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances, to replace a vote. Dozens of deliberative opinion polls have been conducted across the United States since his book was published.

The political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized deliberative democracy on four grounds: (i) the rules for deliberation that deliberative theorists affirm interfere with, rather than facilitate, good practical reasoning; (ii) deliberative democracy is ideologically biased in favor of liberalism as well as republican over parliamentary democratic systems; (iii) deliberative democrats assert a too-sharp division between just and rational deliberation on the one hand and self-interested and coercive bargaining or negotiation on the other; and (iv) deliberative democrats encourage an adversarial relationship between state and society, one that undermines solidarity between citizens.

A criticism of deliberation is that potentially it allows those most skilled in rhetoric to sway the decision in their favour. This criticism has been made since deliberative democracy first arose in [[Ancient Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryzek|first=John|year=2010|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Consensus-based decision making similar to deliberative democracy is characteristic of the hunter gather [[Band society|band societies]] thought to predominate in pre-historical times. As some of these societies became more complex with developments like [[division of labour]], community-based decision making was displaced by various forms of authoritarian rule. The first example of democracy arose in Greece as [[Athenian democracy]] during the sixth century BC. Athenian democracy was both ''deliberative'' and largely ''direct'': some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by ″the people″&lt;!--not all, but some only--&gt; directly. Athenian democracy came to an end in 322BC. When democracy was revived as a political system about 2000 years later, decisions were made by representatives rather than directly by the people. In a sense, this revived version was deliberative from its beginnings; for example, in 1774 [[Edmund Burke]] made a famous speech where he called Great Britain's parliament a [[deliberative assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Edmund|year=1854|pages=446–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elster 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] considered deliberation an essential part of the government they created in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberative element of democracy was not widely studied by academics until the late 20th century. Although some of the seminal work was done in the 1970s and 80s, it was only in 1990 that deliberative democracy began to attract substantial attention from political scientists.&lt;ref name="dryzek 6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryzek|first=John|year=2010|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor [[John Dryzek]], early work on Deliberative Democracy was part of efforts to develop a theory of [[Democratic legitimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryzek|first=John|year=2010|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Carne Ross]] advocate deliberative democracy as a complete alternative to representative democracy. The more common view, held by contributors such as [[James Fishkin]], is that direct deliberative democracy can be complementary to traditional representative democracy. Since 1994, hundreds of implementations of direct deliberative democracy have taken place throughout the world. For example, lay citizens have used deliberative democracy to determine local budget allocations in various cities and to undertake major public projects, such as the rebuilding of [[New Orleans]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="elster 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|location=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ross 3"/&gt;

==Association with political movements==
Deliberative democracy recognizes a [[conflict of interest]] between the citizen participating, those affected or victimized by the process being undertaken, and the [[group-entity]] that organizes the decision.  Thus it usually involves an extensive [[outreach]] effort to include marginalized, isolated, ignored groups in decisions, and to extensively document [[dissent]], grounds for dissent, and future predictions of consequences of actions.  It focuses as much on the process as the results.  In this form it is a complete theory of [[civics]].

On the other hand, many practitioners of deliberative democracy attempt to be as neutral and open-ended as possible, inviting (or even randomly selecting) people who represent a wide range of views and providing them with balanced materials to guide their discussions. Examples include [[National Issues Forums]], Choices for the 21st Century, study circles, [[deliberative opinion poll]]s, the [[Citizens' Initiative Review]], and the 21st-century town meetings convened by [[AmericaSpeaks]], among others. In these cases, deliberative democracy is not connected to [[left-wing politics]] but is intended to create a conversation among people of different philosophies and beliefs.

In Canada, there have been two prominent applications of deliberative democratic models. In 2004, the British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform convened a policy jury to consider alternatives to the first-past-the-post electoral systems. In 2007, the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform convened to consider alternative electoral systems in that province.  Similarly, three of Ontario's Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) have referred their budget priorities to a [[policy jury]] for advice and refinement.

The [[Green Party of the United States]] refers to its particular proposals for [[grassroots democracy]] and [[electoral reform]] by this name. Although not always the case,  participation in deliberation has often been found to shift participants opinions in favour of Green positions, and can even cause a favourable change of voting intention.&lt;ref name="fishkin x"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Graham|year=2003|location=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, with Europolis 2009, at the time one of the largest deliberative assemblies ever held, which set out to assess the public's view on a wide range of issues and included representatives from all 27 [[European Union|EU]] member nations, the share of citizens intending to vote for the Greens increased from 8% to 18%.&lt;ref name="fishkin x"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Academic contributors==
According to Professor Stephen Tierney, perhaps the earliest notable example of academic interest in the deliberative aspects of democracy occurred in [[John Rawls]] 1971 work ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agc-wopac.agc.gov.my/e-docs/Journal/0000013841.pdf Constitutional referendums: a theoretical enquiry (2009)] by Prof Stephen Tierney (see esp. ft note 67)&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph M. Bessette coined the term "deliberative democracy" in his 1980 work "Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government",&lt;ref name="dryzek 6"/&gt; and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in "The Mild Voice of Reason" (1994). Others contributing to the notion of deliberative democracy include [[Carlos Nino]],  [[Jon Elster]], [[Roberto Gargarella]], [[John Gastil]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[David Held]], [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], John Rawls, [[Amy Gutmann]], [[Noëlle McAfee]], [[John Dryzek]], [[Rense Bos]], [[James S. Fishkin]], [[Jane Mansbridge]], [[Jose Luis Marti]], [[Dennis Frank Thompson|Dennis Thompson]], [[Benny Hjern]], [[Hal Koch]], [[Seyla Benhabib]], [[Ethan Leib]], [[Charles Sabel]], [[Jeffrey K. Tulis]], [[David Estlund]], [[Mariah Zeisberg]], Jeffrey L. McNairn, [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Robert B. Talisse]].

Although political theorists took the lead in the study of deliberative democracy, political scientists have in recent years begun to investigate its processes. One of the main challenges currently is to discover more about the actual conditions under which the ideals of deliberative democracy are more or less likely to be realized.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F (2008). “Deliberative Democratic Theory and Empirical Political Science,” ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 11: 497-520. {{ISBN|978-0824333119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italian language}}

The '''''Divine Comedy''''' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|diˈviːna komˈmɛːdja|}}) is an Italian long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered to be the preeminent work in [[Italian literature]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Encyclopedia Americana'', 2006, Vol. 30. p.&amp;nbsp;605: "the greatest single work of Italian literature;" John Julius Norwich, ''The Italians: History, Art, and the Genius of a People'', Abrams, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;27: "his tremendous poem, still after six and a half centuries the supreme work of Italian literature, remains&amp;nbsp;– after the legacy of ancient Rome&amp;nbsp;– the grandest single element in the Italian heritage;" and Robert Reinhold Ergang, ''The Renaissance'', Van Nostrand, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;103: "Many literary historians regard the Divine Comedy as the greatest work of Italian literature. In world literature it is ranked as an epic poem of the highest order."&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greatest works of [[world literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Bloom | first=Harold | authorlink=Harold Bloom | title=The Western Canon | year=1994}} See also [[Western canon]] for other "canons" that include the ''Divine Comedy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's imaginative vision of the [[afterlife]] is representative of the [[medieval philosophy|medieval world-view]] as it had developed in the [[Catholic Church|Western Church]] by the 14th century. It helped establish the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]], in which it is written (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the standardized [[Italian language]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book| last=Lepschy | first=Laura |author2=Lepschy, Giulio | title=The Italian Language Today | year=1977}} or any other history of [[Italian language]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into three parts: ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', ''[[Purgatorio]]'', and ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.

The narrative describes Dante's travels through [[Christian views on hell|Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and Paradise or [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. Bondanella, ''The Inferno'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;xliii, Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, 2003, {{ISBN|1-59308-051-4}}: "the key fiction of the ''Divine Comedy'' is that the poem is true."&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorically]] the poem represents the soul's journey towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]] and the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Allen Dinsmore, ''The Teachings of Dante'', Ayer Publishing, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;38, {{ISBN|0-8369-5521-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ''Divine Comedy'' has been called "the ''Summa'' in verse".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;dq=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;cd=10 ''The Fordham Monthly''] Fordham University, Vol. XL, Dec. 1921, p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dante's work, Virgil is presented as [[human reason]] and Beatrice is presented as [[omniscience|divine knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Approaches to teaching Dante's Divine comedy|date=1982|publisher=Modern Language Association of America|others=Slade, Carole., Cecchetti, Giovanni, 1922–1998.|isbn=978-0873524780|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=7671339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was originally simply titled '''''Comedia''''' ({{IPA-it|komeˈdiːa|pron}}; so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472), Tuscan for "[[Comedy]]", later adjusted to the modern Italian {{lang|it|Commedia}}. The adjective {{lang|it|Divina}} was added by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], and the first edition to name the poem ''Divina Comedia'' in the title was that of the Venetian [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] [[Lodovico Dolce]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Terpening|Ronnie H. Terpening]], ''Lodovico Dolce, Renaissance Man of Letters'' (Toronto, Buffalo, London: University of Toronto Press, 1997), p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1555 by [[Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari]].

==Structure and story==
The ''Divine Comedy'' is composed of 14,233 lines that are divided into three ''cantiche'' (singular ''cantica'')&amp;nbsp;– ''Inferno'' ([[Hell]]), ''Purgatorio'' ([[Purgatory]]), and ''Paradiso'' ([[Heaven|Paradise]])&amp;nbsp;– each consisting of 33 [[canto]]s (Italian plural  ''canti'')&lt;!--NOTE: BEFORE ADDING "Inferno has 34" (AGAIN) READ THE NEXT SENTENCE--&gt;. An initial [[canto]], serving as an introduction to the poem and generally considered to be part of the first ''cantica'', brings the total number of cantos to 100. It is generally accepted, however, that the first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the entire epic, and that the opening two cantos of each ''cantica'' serve as prologues to each of the three ''cantiche''.&lt;ref&gt;Dante The Inferno A Verse Translation by Professor Robert and Jean Hollander p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epist. XIII 43 to 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins E.H The Prologue to the Divine Comedy Annual Report of the Dante Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number "three" is prominent in the work, represented in part by the number of ''cantiche'' and their lengths. Additionally, the verse scheme used, ''[[terza rima]]'', is [[hendecasyllabic]] (lines of eleven syllables), with the lines composing [[tercet]]s according to the [[rhyme scheme]] ''aba, bcb, cdc, ded, ...''.

Written in the first person, the poem tells of Dante's journey through the three realms of the dead, lasting from [[Maundy Thursday|the night before]] [[Good Friday]] to the Wednesday after [[Easter]] in the spring of 1300. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] guides him through Hell and Purgatory; [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], Dante's ideal woman, guides him through Heaven. Beatrice was a Florentine woman whom he had met in childhood and admired from afar in the mode of the then-fashionable [[courtly love]] tradition, which is highlighted in Dante's earlier work ''[[La Vita Nuova]]''.{{sfn|Shaw|2014|pp=xx, 100–101, 108}}

The structure of the three realms follows a common [[Numerology|numerical pattern]] of 9 plus 1, for a total of 10: 9 circles of the Inferno, followed by Lucifer contained at its bottom; 9 rings of Mount Purgatory, followed by the [[Garden of Eden]] crowning its summit; and the 9 celestial bodies of Paradiso, followed by the [[Empyrean]] containing the very essence of God. Within each group of 9, 7 elements correspond to a specific moral scheme, subdivided into three subcategories, while 2 others of greater particularity are added to total nine. For example, the [[seven deadly sins]] of the Catholic Church that are cleansed in Purgatory are joined by special realms for the Late repentant and the [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the church. The core seven sins within Purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, subdivided into three groups corresponding to excessive love ([[Lust]], [[Gluttony]], [[Greed]]), deficient love ([[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]), and malicious love ([[Wrath]], [[Envy]], [[Pride]]).{{sfn|Eiss|2017|p=8}}

In central Italy's political struggle between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], Dante was part of the Guelphs, who in general favored the [[Papacy]] over the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Florence's Guelphs split into factions around 1300—the White Guelphs and the Black Guelphs. Dante was among the White Guelphs who were exiled in 1302 by the Lord-Mayor Cante de' [[Gabrielli]] di [[Gubbio]], after troops under [[Charles of Valois]] entered the city, at the request of [[Pope Boniface&amp;nbsp;VIII]], who supported the Black Guelphs. This exile, which lasted the rest of Dante's life, shows its influence in many parts of the ''Comedy,'' from prophecies of Dante's exile to Dante's views of politics, to the eternal damnation of some of his opponents.{{sfn|Trone|2000|pp=362–364}}

The last word in each of the three ''cantiche'' is ''stelle'' ("stars").

===''Inferno''===

{{Main|Inferno (Dante)}}
The poem begins on the [[Maundy Thursday|night before Good Friday]] in the year 1300, "halfway along our life's path" (''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita''). Dante is thirty-five years old, half of the biblical lifespan of 70 ([[Psalms]] 89:10&lt;!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 --&gt;, Vulgate), lost in a dark [[forest|wood]] (understood as sin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.it/INFERNO-DIVINA-COMMEDIA-ANNOTATA-COMMENTATA-TOMMASO/590245816/bd |title=Inferno, la Divina Commedia annotata e commentata da Tommaso Di Salvo, Zanichelli, Bologna, 1985 |publisher=Abebooks.it |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lectura Dantis'', Società dantesca italiana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Online sources include [http://www.ladante.it/DanteAlighieri/hochfeiler/inferno/naviga/selva.htm], [http://www.operare.net/news.php?id=55] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233122/http://www.operare.net/news.php?id=55 |date=23 July 2011 }}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061113164331/http://www.learnitaly.com/selva.htm] [http://balbruno.altervista.org/index-182.html], {{cite web|url=http://www.primocircolopotenza.it/DivinaCommedia/Dante/caratteristiche.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202062524/http://www.primocircolopotenza.it/DivinaCommedia/Dante/caratteristiche.htm|archivedate=2 December 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=1 December 2009}}, [http://www.skuola.net/dante/divina-commedia/dante-l-inferno-simbolismo-e-allegorismo-il-simbolismo-numerico.html], and [http://doc.studenti.it/appunti/dante/3/inferno.html]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052503/http://www.ladante.it/DanteAlighieri/hochfeiler/inferno/naviga/selva.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assailed by beasts (a [[lion]], a [[leopard]], and a [[wolf|she-wolf]]) he cannot evade and unable to find the "straight way" (''diritta via'')&amp;nbsp;– also translatable as "right way"&amp;nbsp;– to salvation (symbolized by the sun behind the mountain). Conscious that he is ruining himself and that he is falling into a "low place" (''basso loco'') where the sun is silent ('''l sol tace''), Dante is at last rescued by Virgil, and the two of them begin their journey to the underworld. Each sin's punishment in ''Inferno'' is a ''[[contrapasso]]'', a symbolic instance of [[poetic justice]]; for example, in Canto XX, [[Fortune-telling|fortune-tellers]] and [[Divination|soothsayers]] must walk with their heads on backwards, unable to see what is ahead, because that was what they had tried to do in life:

{{poemquote|they had their faces twisted toward their haunches
and found it necessary to walk backward,
because they could not see ahead of them.
... and since he wanted so to see ahead,
he looks behind and walks a backward path.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XX, lines 13–15 and 38–39, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Allegorically, the ''Inferno'' represents the Christian soul seeing sin for what it really is, and the three beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence ([[lust]], [[gluttony]], [[avarice]], [[anger]]); Circle 7 for the sins of violence; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, with the addition of Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed, ''Divine Comedy'', "Notes to Dante's Inferno"&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Purgatorio''===
{{Main|Purgatorio}}
[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|Dante gazes at Mount Purgatory in an allegorical portrait by [[Agnolo Bronzino]], painted c. 1530]]
Having survived the depths of Hell, Dante and Virgil ascend out of the undergloom to the Mountain of [[Purgatory]] on the far side of the world. The Mountain is on an island, the only land in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], created by the displacement of rock which resulted when Satan's fall created Hell&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto 34, lines 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt; (which Dante portrays as existing underneath [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, ''The Dante Encyclopedia'', p.&amp;nbsp;475, Garland Publishing, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8153-1659-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The mountain has seven terraces, corresponding to the [[seven deadly sins]] or "seven roots of sinfulness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–67 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of sin here is more psychological than that of the ''Inferno'', being based on motives, rather than actions. It is also drawn primarily from Christian theology, rather than from classical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;xiv (Penguin, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dante's illustrative examples of sin and virtue draw on classical sources as well as on the Bible and on contemporary events.

Love, a theme throughout the ''Divine Comedy'', is particularly important for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends ([[Wrath]], [[Envy]], [[Pride]]), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough ([[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]) or love that is too strong ([[Lust]], [[Gluttony]], [[Greed]]). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from the church and the Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle-Oakey-Wickstead, ''Divine Comedy'', "Notes on Dante's Purgatory.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- 7 + 2 = 9 not 10 --&gt;

Allegorically, the ''Purgatorio'' represents the Christian life. Christian souls arrive escorted by an angel, singing ''[[Psalm 114|In exitu Israel de Aegypto]]''. In his ''Letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande]]'', Dante explains that this reference to Israel leaving Egypt refers both to the [[redemption (religious)|redemption]] of [[Christ]] and to "the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to the state of grace."&lt;ref&gt;"The Letter to Can Grande," in ''Literary Criticism of Dante Alighieri'', translated and edited by Robert S. Haller (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1973), 99&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriately, therefore, it is [[Easter Sunday]] when Dante and Virgil arrive.

The ''Purgatorio'' is notable for demonstrating the medieval knowledge of a [[spherical Earth]]. During the poem, Dante discusses the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the sun, and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth. At this stage it is, Dante says, sunset at Jerusalem, midnight on the River [[Ganges]], and sunrise in Purgatory.

===''Paradiso''===
{{Main|Paradiso (Dante)}}
[[File:Philipp Veit 004.jpg|thumb|''Paradiso'', Canto III: Dante and Beatrice speak to [[Piccarda]] and [[Constance of Sicily]], in a fresco by [[Philipp Veit]].]]

After an initial ascension, Beatrice guides Dante through the nine [[celestial spheres]] of [[Heaven]]. These are concentric and spherical, as in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] cosmology. While the structures of the ''Inferno'' and ''Purgatorio'' were based on different classifications of sin, the structure of the ''Paradiso'' is based on the [[four cardinal virtues]] and the [[three theological virtues]].

The first seven spheres of Heaven deal solely with the cardinal virtues of [[Prudence]], [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]], [[Justice]] and [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. The first three describe a deficiency of one of the cardinal virtues&amp;nbsp;– the [[Moon]], containing the inconstant, whose vows to God waned as the moon and thus lack fortitude; [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], containing the ambitious, who were virtuous for glory and thus lacked justice; and Venus, containing the lovers, whose love was directed towards another than God and thus lacked Temperance. The final four incidentally are positive examples of the cardinal virtues, all led on by the [[Sun]], containing the prudent, whose wisdom lighted the way for the other virtues, to which the others are bound (constituting a category on its own). [[Mars]] contains the men of fortitude who died in the cause of Christianity; [[Jupiter]] contains the kings of Justice; and [[Saturn]] contains the temperate, the monks who abided by the contemplative lifestyle. The seven subdivided into three are raised further by two more categories: the eighth sphere of the fixed stars that contain those who achieved the theological virtues of [[faith]], [[hope]] and [[love]], and represent the [[Church Triumphant]]&amp;nbsp;– the total perfection of humanity, cleansed of all the sins and carrying all the virtues of heaven; and the ninth circle, or [[Primum Mobile]] (corresponding to the Geocentricism of Medieval astronomy), which contains the angels, creatures never poisoned by original sin. Topping them all is the [[Empyrean]], which contains the essence of God, completing the 9-fold division to 10.

Dante meets and converses with several great saints of the Church, including [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Saint Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|St. John]]. The ''Paradiso'' is consequently more theological in nature than the ''Inferno'' and the ''Purgatorio''. However, Dante admits that the vision of heaven he receives is merely the one his human eyes permit him to see, and thus the vision of heaven found in the Cantos is Dante's personal vision.

The ''Divine Comedy'' finishes with Dante seeing the [[Trinity|Triune God]]. In a flash of understanding that he cannot express, Dante finally understands the mystery of [[Christ]]'s divinity and humanity, and his soul becomes aligned with God's love:&lt;ref name="DLS33"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto&amp;nbsp;XXXIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|But already my desire and my will
were being turned like a wheel, all at one speed,
by the Love which moves the sun and the other stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XXXIII, lines 142–145, [[C. H. Sisson]] translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Thematic concerns==
The ''Divine Comedy'' can be described simply as an [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegory]]: each canto, and the episodes therein, can contain many alternative meanings. Dante's allegory, however, is more complex, and, in explaining how to read the poem&amp;nbsp;– see the ''Letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/cangrande.english.html |title=Epistle to Can Grande |work=faculty.georgetown.edu |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – he outlines other levels of meaning besides the allegory: the historical, the moral, the literal, and the [[anagoge|anagogical]].

The structure of the poem is also quite complex, with mathematical and numerological patterns distributed throughout the work, particularly threes and nines, which are related to the [[Holy Trinity]]. The poem is often lauded for its particularly human qualities: Dante's skillful delineation of the characters he encounters in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise; his bitter denunciations of [[Florence|Florentine]] and Italian politics; and his powerful poetic imagination. Dante's use of real characters, according to [[Dorothy Sayers]] in her introduction to her translation of the ''Inferno'', allows Dante the freedom of not having to involve the reader in description, and allows him to "[make] room in his poem for the discussion of a great many subjects of the utmost importance, thus widening its range and increasing its variety."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;16 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante called the poem "Comedy" (the adjective "Divine" was added later, in the 16th century) because poems in the ancient world were classified as High ("Tragedy") or Low ("Comedy").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Tragedy/|title = Ancient History Encyclopedia|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low poems had happy endings and were written in everyday language, whereas High poems treated more serious matters and were written in an elevated style. Dante was one of the first in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of humanity, in the low and "vulgar" Italian language and not the Latin one might expect for such a serious topic. [[Boccaccio]]'s account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in [[Latin]] is still controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Boccaccio also quotes the initial triplet:"Ultima regna canam fluvido contermina mundo, / spiritibus quae lata patent, quae premia solvunt /pro meritis cuicumque suis". For translation and more, see Guyda Armstrong, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130402195337/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/heliotropia/02-02/armstrong.shtml Review] of Giovanni Boccaccio. Life of Dante. J. G. Nichols, trans. London: Hesperus Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hiram |last=Peri |title=The Original Plan of the Divine Comedy |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=18 |issue=3/4 |year=1955 |pages=189–210 |jstor=750179 |doi=10.2307/750179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific themes===
Although the ''Divine Comedy'' is primarily a religious poem, discussing sin, virtue, and theology, Dante also discusses several elements of the [[Science in the Middle Ages|science of his day]] (this mixture of science with poetry has received both praise and blame over the centuries&lt;ref&gt;Michael Caesar, ''Dante: The Critical Heritage'', Routledge, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;288, 383, 412, 631.&lt;/ref&gt;). The ''Purgatorio'' repeatedly refers to the implications of a [[spherical Earth]], such as the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the [[sun]], and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth. For example, at sunset in Purgatory it is midnight at the [[Ebro]], dawn in Jerusalem, and noon on the River Ganges:&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on p.&amp;nbsp;286&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|Just as, there where its Maker shed His blood,
the sun shed its first rays, and Ebro lay
beneath high Libra, and the ninth hour's rays

were scorching Ganges' waves; so here, the sun
stood at the point of day's departure when
God's angel—happy—showed himself to us.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XXVII, lines 1–6, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dante travels through the centre of the Earth in the ''Inferno'', and comments on the resulting change in the direction of [[gravity]] in Canto&amp;nbsp;XXXIV (lines 76–120). A little earlier (XXXIII, 102–105), he queries the existence of wind in the frozen inner circle of hell, since it has no temperature differentials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Inferno'', notes on p.&amp;nbsp;284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inevitably, given its setting, the ''Paradiso'' discusses [[astronomy]] extensively, but in the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic]] sense. The ''Paradiso'' also discusses the importance of the [[experiment|experimental method]] in science, with a detailed example in lines 94–105 of Canto&amp;nbsp;II:

{{poemquote|Yet an experiment, were you to try it,
could free you from your cavil and the source
of your arts' course springs from experiment.

Taking three mirrors, place a pair of them
at equal distance from you; set the third
midway between those two, but farther back.

Then, turning toward them, at your back have placed
a light that kindles those three mirrors and
returns to you, reflected by them all.

Although the image in the farthest glass
will be of lesser size, there you will see
that it must match the brightness of the rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto&amp;nbsp;II, lines 94–105, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A briefer example occurs in Canto XV of the ''Purgatorio'' (lines 16–21), where Dante points out that both theory and experiment confirm that the [[reflection (physics)|angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection]]. Other references to science in the ''Paradiso'' include descriptions of [[clock]]work in Canto&amp;nbsp;XXIV (lines 13–18), and [[Thales' theorem]] about triangles in Canto&amp;nbsp;XIII (lines 101–102).

[[Galileo Galilei]] is known to have lectured on the ''Inferno'', and it has been suggested that the poem may have influenced some of Galileo's own ideas regarding mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Mark A. [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/mpeterso/galileo/scaling8.pdf "Galileo's discovery of scaling laws"]. ''American Journal of Physics'' '''70''', 575 (2002). {{doi|10.1119/1.1475329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of influence from Islamic philosophy==
In 1919, [[Miguel Asín Palacios]], a Spanish scholar and a Catholic priest, published ''La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (''Islamic [[Eschatology]] in the Divine Comedy''), an account of parallels between [[early Islamic philosophy]] and the ''Divine Comedy''. Palacios argued that Dante derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter from the spiritual writings of [[Ibn Arabi]] and from the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] or night journey of [[Muhammad]] to heaven. The latter is described in the ''[[ahadith]]'' and the ''[[Kitab al Miraj]]'' (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before&lt;ref name="Heullant"&gt;I. Heullant-Donat and M.-A. Polo de Beaulieu, "Histoire d'une traduction," in ''Le Livre de l'échelle de Mahomet'', Latin edition and French translation by Gisèle Besson and Michèle Brossard-Dandré, Collection ''Lettres Gothiques'', Le Livre de Poche, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;22 with note 37.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Liber Scalae Machometi'', "The Book of Muhammad's Ladder"), and has significant similarities to the ''Paradiso'', such as a [[Seven Heavens|sevenfold division of Paradise]], although this is not unique to the ''Kitab al Miraj'' or Islamic cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ascent to Heaven in Islamic and Jewish Mysticism|last1=Uždavinys|first1=Algis|page=23, 92–93, 117|isbn=978-1908092021|publisher=Matheson Trust |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "superficial similarities"&lt;ref&gt;William Montgomery Watt and Pierre Cachia, ''A History of Islamic Spain'', 2nd edition, Edinburgh University Press, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126, {{ISBN|0-7486-0847-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Divine Comedy'' to the ''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran]]'' or ''Epistle of Forgiveness'' of [[Al-Ma'arri]] have also been mentioned in this debate. The ''Resalat Al-Ghufran'' describes the journey of the poet in the realms of the afterlife and includes dialogue with people in Heaven and Hell, although, unlike the ''Kitab al Miraj'', there is little description of these locations,&lt;ref&gt;Dionisius A. Agius and Richard Hitchcock, ''The Arab Influence in Medieval Europe'', Ithaca Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;70, {{ISBN|0-86372-213-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is unlikely that Dante borrowed from this work.&lt;ref&gt;Kāmil Kīlānī and G. Brackenbury, Introduction to ''Risalat ul Ghufran: A Divine Comedy'', 3rd ed, Al-Maaref Printing and Publishing House, 1943, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theory "receives little credence", according to Watt and Cachia, p.&amp;nbsp;183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante did, however, live in a Europe of substantial literary and philosophical contact with the Muslim world, encouraged by such factors as [[Averroism]] ("Averrois, che'l gran comento feo" Commedia, Inferno, IV, 144, meaning "Averrois, who wrote the great comment") and the patronage of [[Alfonso&amp;nbsp;X of Castile]]. Of the twelve wise men Dante meets in Canto&amp;nbsp;X of the ''Paradiso'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] and, even more so, [[Siger of Brabant]] were strongly influenced by Arabic commentators on [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="copleston"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Philosophy, Volume 2|author=Frederick Copleston|location=London|year=1950|publisher=Continuum|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval [[Christian mysticism]] also shared the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] influence of [[Sufi cosmology|Sufis]] such as [[Ibn Arabi]]. Philosopher [[Frederick Copleston]] argued in 1950 that Dante's respectful treatment of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], and Siger of Brabant indicates his acknowledgement of a "considerable debt" to Islamic philosophy.&lt;ref name="copleston" /&gt;

Although this philosophical influence is generally acknowledged, many scholars have not been satisfied that Dante was influenced by the ''Kitab al Miraj''. The 20th century Orientalist [[:it:Francesco Gabrieli|Francesco Gabrieli]] expressed skepticism regarding the claimed similarities, and the lack of evidence of a vehicle through which it could have been transmitted to Dante. Even so, while dismissing the probability of some influences posited in Palacios' work,&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Gabrieli, "New light on Dante and Islam", ''Diogenes'', 2:61–73, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrieli conceded that it was "at least possible, if not probable, that Dante may have known the ''Liber Scalae'' and have taken from it certain images and concepts of Muslim eschatology". Shortly before her death, the Italian philologist [[:it:Maria Corti|Maria Corti]] pointed out that, during his stay at the court of Alfonso&amp;nbsp;X, Dante's mentor [[Brunetto Latini]] met Bonaventura de Siena, a Tuscan who had translated the ''Kitab al Miraj'' from Arabic into Latin. Corti speculates that Brunetto may have provided a copy of that work to Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emsf.rai.it/interviste/interviste.asp?d=490#3|title=Errore|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Guénon]], a Sufi convert and scholar of Ibn Arabi, rejected in ''The Esoterism of Dante''  the theory of his influence (direct or indirect) on Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Guenon| first=René| authorlink=René Guenon | title=The Esoterism of Dante | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palacios' theory that Dante was influenced by Ibn Arabi was satirized by the Turkish academic [[Orhan Pamuk]] in his novel [[The Black Book (Pamuk novel)|''The Black Book'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=515–537|year=2002|last1=Almond|first1=Ian|title= The Honesty of the Perplexed: Derrida and Ibn 'Arabi on "Bewilderment" |jstor=1466522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence in the English-speaking world and beyond==

The ''Divine Comedy'' was not always as well-regarded as it is today. Although recognized as a [[masterpiece]] in the centuries immediately following its publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaucer]] wrote in the [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/chaucer/canterbury/daniel/chapter13.html Monk's Tale], "Redeth the grete poete of Ytaille /
That highte Dant, for he kan al devyse /
Fro point to point; nat o word wol he faille".&lt;/ref&gt; the work was largely ignored during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with some notable exceptions such as [[Vittorio Alfieri]]; [[Antoine de Rivarol]], who translated the ''Inferno'' into French; and [[Giambattista Vico]], who in the ''Scienza nuova'' and in the ''Giudizio su Dante'' inaugurated what would later become the romantic reappraisal of Dante, juxtaposing him to Homer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Auerbach]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=R_HofoKY87gC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=Vico++Dante&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=OzD6SISdOIm6zAS449X9DA Dante: Poet of the Secular World]. {{ISBN|0-226-03205-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Comedy'' was "rediscovered" in the English-speaking world by [[William Blake]]&amp;nbsp;– who illustrated several passages of the epic&amp;nbsp;– and the [[romanticism|romantic]] writers of the 19th century. Later authors such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[James Joyce]] have drawn on it for inspiration. The poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] was its first American translator,&lt;ref&gt;Irmscher, Christoph. ''Longfellow Redux''.

The '''Eighteen Lesser Texts''', known as the '''Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku''' ({{lang-ta|பதினெண்கீழ்கணக்கு}}) in the literature, is a collection of eighteen poetic works mostly created during the 'post [[Sangam period]]' (between 100 - 500 CE). The poems of this collection differ from the earlier works of the [[Eighteen Greater Texts]] (''Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku''), which are the oldest surviving [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Tamil literature|poetry]], in that the poems are written in the [[venpa]] meter and are relatively short in length. Naladiyar, having sung by 400 poets, is the only anthology in this collection. Each of the remaining works of the Eighteen Lesser Texts is sung by a single poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= M. V. Aravindan |title= உரையாசிரியர்கள் [Commentators] |url= |year= 1968 |edition= |publisher=Manivasagar Padhippagam | location= Chennai |isbn = |page= 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the books deal with morals and ethics.

The '''Emberá''' {{audio|emberá_people.ogg|listen}}, also known in the historical literature as the ''Chocó'' or ''Katío'' Indians are an indigenous people of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]]. In the [[Emberá languages|Emberá language]], the word ''ẽberá'' can be used to mean person, man, or indigenous person, depending on the context in which it is used. There are approximately 33,000 people living in Panama and 50,000 in Colombia who identify as Emberá.

== Language ==
{{main article|Embera language}}

The Emberá language, is not a single language but a group of mutually-intelligible languages spoken throughout Panamá and Colombia. Along with [[Wounaan language|Wounmeu]], they are the only extant members of the [[Choco languages|Chocó language family]] and not known to be related to any other language family of [[Central America|Central]] or [[South America|South]] America, although in the past relationships have been proposed with the [[Carib languages|Carib]], [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], and [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]] language families.&lt;ref name="Choco Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mortensen&gt;{{cite book|last=Mortensen|first=Charles A.|title=A Reference Grammar of the Northern Embera Languages|year=1999|publisher=SIL International and The University of Texas at Arlington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An established Emberá alphabet has been officially recognized by the government of Panama, consisting of:
* 6 oral vowels (a, e, i, o, u, ʌ)
* 6 nasal vowels (ã, ẽ, ĩ, õ, ũ, ʌ̃)
* 21 consonants (b, b̶, ch, d, d̶, dy, g, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, rr, s, t, v, w, y, z).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asemblea Nacional de Panamá |title=Por el cual se oficializan los idiomas alfabetos de los pueblos indígenas de Panamá, se establecen bases lingüisticas de la educación bilingüe intercultural y se adoptan otras disposiciones. |url=http://www.asamblea.gob.pa/apps/seg_legis/PDF_SEG/PDF_SEG_2000/PDF_SEG_2009/2009_P_055.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213214407/http://www.asamblea.gob.pa/apps/seg_legis/PDF_SEG/PDF_SEG_2000/PDF_SEG_2009/2009_P_055.pdf |archivedate=13 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, there have been very few books published in the Emberá language. These are mostly educational materials produced by [[Education in Panama|Panama's education ministry (MEDUCA)]] or by Christian missionaries. The most significant of these to date is a Bible translation containing the [[New Testament]] and parts of the [[Old Testament]] titled Ãcõrẽ Be&lt;s&gt;d&lt;/s&gt;ea, "the word of God."&lt;ref name=akore&gt;{{cite book|title=Ãcõrẽ Bedea|year=2011|publisher=Wycliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akore web"&gt;

== Geography ==
The Emberá people mostly live in the [[Chocó department]] of western [[Colombia]] and in Panama. For the Panamanian Emberá, the [[Chocó department|Chocó]] and its river systems remain their ancestral homelands, and the different dialects of the Emberá language still mostly correspond to different parts of that area and its river systems.&lt;ref name="Choco Languages"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aguirre Licht|first=D|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0080877747|pages=224–238|editor=Keith Brown|chapter=Choco Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of the Emberá in Panama ===
In the late 1700s, the Emberá began migrating from the Choco region to modern-day Colombia to what is currently the [[Darién Province|Darién]] province of Panama, which had been home to the Tule or [[Kuna people]] at the time of European contact.&lt;ref name="herlihy diss"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herlihy|first=Peter H.|title=A Cultural Geography of the Embera and Wounaan (Choco) Indians of Darien, Panama: With Emphasis on Recent Village Formation and Economic Diversification.|year=1986|publisher=Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This migration was prompted by the Spanish, and took the form of a conflict between the Emberá and the kuna, moving the latter into the lands along the Caribbean coast which now form the [[Guna Yala|Comarca Guna Yala]] and [[San Blas Islands]]. The Darién has subsequently become recognized as the homelands of the Emberá in Panama, though they had also settled as far west as [[Lake Gatún]] and the riverine areas of what would become the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]].

[[File:New Caledonia in Darien2.jpg|thumb|left|A map of the Darién isthmus, 1699.]]During the 19th century, during which it was part of the Gran Republica de Colombia, the Darién was inhabited almost exclusively by the indigenous Emberá and Guna peoples along with the descendants of [[Cimarron people (Panama)|escaped African slaves]], known as ''[[Afro-Panamanians|darienitas]]'' or ''libres''. Typically, ''darienitas'' settled in port towns at the mouths of rivers while the Emberá would live along the rivers downstream. This historical trend is still reflected in the current regional demographics; many port towns have retained their ''darienita'' identity, such as [[La Palma, Darién|La Palma]], [[Yaviza]] and [[Garachiné|Garachine]], while many contemporary Emberá towns are found downstream along the rivers.&lt;ref name = herlihy_participatory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herlihy|first=Peter H.|title=Participatory Research Mapping of Indigenous Lands in Darién, Panama|journal=Human Organization|year=2003|volume=62|issue=4|pages=315–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Separation of Panama from Colombia|Panama seceded from the Republic of Colombia]], achieving its independence in 1903. However, Eastern Panama still remained isolated and undeveloped during this time. While trade with the ''darienitas'' increased the access that the Emberá had to resources such as off-board motors, kerosene lamps, hunting rifles, and other modern commodities which would change their daily lives, major changes started taking place in the 1950s and 1960s. This time period observed the influence of missionaries and the involvement of the revolutionary government of [[Omar Torrijos]], who actively sought to integrate the indigenous population of Darién into Panamanian society by encouraging them to settle into communities for access to government-sponsored services such as schools and health centers. This initiated the transition of the Emberá people, who until that time had lived dispersed in small family units throughout the rainforest, into settled communities.

The [[Darién Province|Darién province]] changed dramatically with the completion of the [[Pan-American Highway|Pan-American highway]] into the province as far as Yaviza. Before the creation of the highway, the dominant if not exclusive mode of trade and transportation between Panama City and the Darién was by boat. The construction of this highway through a previously untraversable terrain had a number of significant effects. Latino farmers from the interior of the country, often called ''interioranos,'' began to migrate into the Darién in large numbers, effecting demographic shifts and an unprecedented scale of logging and deforestation for the purpose of establishing cattle ranches.&lt;ref name = "Colin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colin|first=France-Lise|title="Nosotros no solamente podemos vivir de cultura": Identity, Nature, and Power in the Comarca Emberá of Eastern Panama (PhD Dissertation)|year=2010|publisher=Department of Geography and Environmental Studies Carleton University|location=Ottawa, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also shifted the economic and political centers of the province from the coastal ''darienita'' cities to the new towns being established along the highway by these Latino settlers.

== Social organization ==

=== Transition from dispersed settlement to villages, towns, and urban neighborhoods ===
Historically, the Emberá lived in a dispersed settlement pattern along the river systems of Panamá and Colombia. Since the 1960s, the majority of Emberá have transitioned to settled communities and urban areas. Herlihy describes the pre-1950's settlement pattern:
:&lt;small&gt;"Traditional Chocó settlement consists of dispersed household units in a distinctive riverine pattern&amp;nbsp;... The extended family serv[ed] as the settlement unit. No villages or large agglomerations of dwellings exist[ed]. Thatched-roof, pile-dwellings are scattered along the river margin, usually constructed on levee tops and high alluvial terraces. Population densities vary from one river to another, but houses are generally situated at least several hundred meters from one another, with intervening forests and river bends blocking the view of a neighbor's house. Settlement density is usually greatest where occupation periods have been longest."&lt;ref name = herlihy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herlihy|first=Peter|title=Settlement and subsistence change among the Choco Indians of the Darien Province, eastern Panama: An overview|journal=Proceedings of the Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers|year=1985|volume=1|url=http://sites.maxwell.syr.edu/clag/yearbook1985/herlihy.pdf|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
The Emberá began forming the first small villages in the 1950s, in what has been described as a "slow, almost evolutionary process."&lt;ref name="herlihy settlement"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herlihy|first=Peter|title=Settlement and Subsistence Change Among the Chocó Indians of the Darién Province, Eastern Panama: An Overview|journal=Yearbook, Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers|year=1985|volume=11|pages=11–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic considerations, Western influence, and the presence of religious missionaries were influential factors in the first settlements of Emberá communities. Accounts also exist of a foreigner known by his nickname "Perú," a mysterious and legendary figure who tried to convince the Emberá to settle into colonies.

:&lt;small&gt;He instructed them that... through the formation of villages they could solicit government officials to provide teachers, schools, and medical supplies. He told them that through more effective occupation of their traditional lands, they could obtain a [semi-autonomous territory] like the one of the Cuna Indians of Panama's San Blas Islands, guaranteeing them legal rights to land and resources. As a result, among the Darién Chocó Perú is a larger-than-life romantic folk figure.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = "herlihy settlement" /&gt;

By the late 1960s, the government of Omar Torrijos was promoting the settlement of the Darién Emberá into communities; the first formal establishment of an Emberá town was in 1963 along the Rio Balsas river. In 1985, it was estimated that 25 percent of Emberá people in Panamá still lived according to the traditional dispersed settlement pattern.&lt;ref name = herlihy /&gt;  However, life in settled communities is now considered the norm, or "typical" of most Emberá.&lt;ref name  = "authenticity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Theodossopoulos|first=Dimitrios|title=Emberá Indigenous Tourism and the Trap of Authenticity: Beyond Inauthenticity and Invention|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|year=2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=397–426|doi=10.1353/anq.2013.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these settled communities, many Emberá now also live in urban areas. According to the 2010 Panamanian National Census, over one third of Panamanian Emberá people live in the central province of Panamá, and over 25% of the total Panamanian Emberá population reside in urban districts of Panama City.&lt;ref name = censo /&gt;

=== Female genital mutilation in Emberá culture ===
The Emberá are the only indigenous tribe in Latin America known to practise FGM. The tradition was extremely secretive and taboo until a 2007 incident, in which a girl died as a result of FGM. The incident caused much controversy, raised awareness and stimulated debate about ending the practice altogether. In 2015, it was reported that of the approximately 250,000 members of the tribe, 25,000 (10%) had decided to discontinue female genital mutilation, with a community leader saying they hoped to eradicate it by 2030.&lt;ref name=Moloney&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moloney|first1=Anastasia|title=Colombia's Embera tribe hopes to eradicate FGM by 2030|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-colombia-girls-fgm-idUSKBN0LA2FX20150206|website=Reuters|accessdate=6 August 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714145347/https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-colombia-girls-fgm-idUSKBN0LA2FX20150206|archivedate=14 July 2015|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riverine lifestyle and housing ===
The Emberá are a [[wikt:riverine|riverine]] people, historically building their houses along the banks of rivers. Although now most all Emberá people live in villages, towns, or urban centers, many established Emberá communities are still found along riverbanks. The designated autonomous region, the [[Comarca Emberá-Wounaan]], is split up into two territories surrounding two of the Darién's major river systems, the [[Sambú River|Sambú]] and [[Chucunaque River|Chucunaque]].&lt;ref name = herlihy_participatory /&gt; The word for river in both the Emberá and Wounaan languages is ''dó'', noticeable in the names of many of the rivers and towns in the Chocó department of Colombia, such as the Baudó river, as well as the capital of the department itself, [[Quibdó]].

Fish ''(bedá)'' are an important staple of the Emberá diet along with plantains ''(patá)'', and rivers play a central role in daily life for fishing, bathing, transport, and many domestic chores. Boats have also played important roles in Emberá tradition and cosmology. The craft of constructing dugout canoes ''(hampá)'' was historically a very significant skill for Emberá men, at times serving as a rite of passage or prerequisite for marriage according to oral history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Ethnographic records detail the ways in which boats take on an anthropomorphic character in the Emberá language and philosophy, and traditionally people were even buried in canoes.&lt;ref name="Transformations of eternity"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isacsson|first=Sven-Erik|title=Transformations of Eternity: On Man and Cosmos in Emberá Thought|year=1993|publisher=University of Göteborg|location=Göteborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthropologists have written about how central rivers are to the worldview of both the Emberá and the Wounaan, a closely related group of people who, while having a distinct history and belief system from the Emberá, share much with them linguistically, historically, and culturally.&lt;ref name="gringo boat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Stephanie|title=The phantom gringo boat: shamanic discourse and development in Panama|year=1994|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="runk rhizomic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velasquez Runk|first=Julie|title=Social and River Networks for the Trees:  Wounaan's Riverine Rhizomic Cosmos  and Arboreal Conservation|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2009|volume=111|issue=4|pages=456–457|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01155.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to changes in settlement patterns, the form of typical Emberá housing is actively going through a period of change. A traditional Emberá house can be described as an open-air dwelling raised 6–12 feet off the ground on stilts with thatched roofing made from palm leaves (often, but not exclusively, ''[[Sabal mauritiiformis]]'') and flooring made from the bark of the [[Socratea exorrhiza|''jira'']] palm ''(épa)''. These houses were typically round in shape and large enough to hold members of an extended family group. Logs with notches cut in them (''domé'') were used as ladders to enter/exit the house, and could be turned with the notches facing inwards to signal that people were busy, not home, or to keep animals from climbing into the house. The space under the house would be used as a dry space to carry out domestic chores or keep animals.

Contemporary Emberá housing style often employs many of the traditional materials and styles. However, they may often be smaller due to a comparatively smaller number of family members per house. Wooden boards often replace the ''jira'' bark as flooring, and durable aluminum roofing in place of palm leaves. Due to living in settled communities with other unrelated people, walls have become more common for added privacy, whereas walls were historically very uncommon. Propane stoves often replace or complement the traditional cooking fire. Some contemporary Emberá houses have both a larger structure of wooden floors and walls with metal roofing on a cement foundation, with an attached, more traditional thatched-roof structure for use as a kitchen. Many now live in cinder-block houses in the typical Panamanian style, if they have the access to the resources and infrastructure to rent or build one.

== Political organization ==
Historically, the Emberá people were described as having a fundamentally egalitarian social and political organization:

:&lt;small&gt;Ethnographic accounts and oral history indicate that since colonial times, [Emberá] social structure has been egalitarian, with no formal tribal leaders, chiefs, councils, or a structure of elders. Certain religious beliefs and ceremonial activities center on the shaman who, with an intimate knowledge of the medicinal, toxicologic and hallucinogenic properties of the surrounding plant and animal world, cures through exorcising malignant spirits. Yet, in terms of political, economic, or interpersonal relationships, no individual holds special leadership status.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name ="herlihy cultural survival"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herlihy|first=Peter|title=Chocó Indian Relocation in Darién, Panama|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1985|issue=9.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Organization of the Panamanian Emberá===

Part of [[Omar Torrijos]]'s efforts to organize the indigenous people of the Darién was through the establishment of the first National Indian Congress in 1968. The Emberá were encouraged to self-organize and form political leadership in the same way the [[Guna people]] had done, and a Guna chief was even appointed to aid them in the process. Throughout the 1970s, more and more Emberá families continued settling into communities and towns. By 1980, discussions were taking place about the establishment of a ''[[comarca indigena]]'', or autonomous territory, for the Emberá within the Darién province.

in November 1983, the [[National Assembly of Panama]] ratified the ''ley 22'', establishing the [[Comarca Emberá-Wounaan]], a territory of 4383.5&amp;nbsp;km² encompassing two [[Geographic contiguity|non-contiguous]] districts, Sambú and Cemaco, whose capital is the town of [[Unión Chocó]]. The law established the territory under a [[Customary land|collective land title]] of the Emberá and Wounaan peoples. The leadership structure, officially known as the ''Congreso General Emberá Wounaan de la Comarca,'' has a ''cacique general'' as its head. In addition, each district has a regional ''cacique,'' and individuals communities also elect local ''caciques'' as their representatives at the annual General Congress of the Comarcá.

'''Fast-Moving Consumer Goods''' ('''FMCG''') or '''Consumer Packaged Goods''' ('''CPG''') are products that are sold quickly and at a relatively [[low cost]]. Examples include non-durable goods such as [[packaged food]]s, [[beverage]]s, [[toiletries]], [[over-the-counter drug]]s, and other [[consumables]].&lt;ref name="Ramanuj_Majumdar"&gt;{{cite book | title = Product Management in India | author = Ramanuj Majumdar | publisher = PHI Learning | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-81-203-1252-4 | pages = 26–27 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ESJzaCJE3fQC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=what+is+fmcg&amp;q=what%20is%20fmcg | accessdate = 2010-06-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The advertising handbook By Sean Brierley | author = Sean Brierley | publisher = Routledge | edition = 2, illustrated | year = 2002 | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-415-24391-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many fast moving consumer goods have a short [[shelf life]], either as a result of high consumer demand or as the result of fast deterioration. Some FMCG, such as meats, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and baked goods are highly perishable. Other goods, such as pre-packaged foods, soft drinks, candies, and toiletries have high [[Inventory turnover|turnover]] rates. Sales are sometimes influenced by holiday and/or seasonal periods.

[[Packaging]] is critical for FMCG.  Logistics and distribution systems often require secondary and tertiary packaging to maximize efficiency. Unit or primary packaging protects products and shelf life while providing product information to consumers.

The [[profit margin]] on FMCG products can be relatively small, but they are generally sold in large quantities; thus, the cumulative profit on such products can be substantial. FMCG is a classic low margin and high volume business. According to BASES, 84% of fast-moving consumer goods professionals are under more pressure to quickly bring new products to the market than they were five or ten years ago. With this in mind, 47% of those surveyed confessed that product testing suffers most when deadlines are accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;United States: Nielsen Bases Debuts Faster In-Home Product Testing Solution for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods. (2018, August 23). Mena Report. from http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-551430065.html?refid=easy_hf&lt;/ref&gt; The most innovative FMCG companies are now adopting agile design [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/agile-marketing-a-step-by-step-guide/ Agile Marketing] and development principles which allow them to remain nimble in response to market demand and customer feedback.

The growth of the internet over the past quarter century and the rise of the [[brand community]] phenomenon have contributed greatly to the demand for FMCG. According to the AGOF internet facts, 73% of Germany's population is online. Additionally, 83.7% of internet users claim to use the web to search for information and 68.3% shop online&lt;ref&gt;Meister, S. (2012). Brand communities for fast moving consumer goods: An empirical study of members behavior and the economic relevance for the marketer. Wiesbaden: Springer Gabler.&lt;/ref&gt;. Vendors use the internet to their advantage to connect with consumers and market their goods, targeting consumers who show high identification with a specific brand or good. Marketers of FMCG have discovered this capability and are using it to build relationships with their customers to understand what they want.  

== Characteristics ==

The following are the main characteristics of FMCGs:&lt;ref name="Ramanuj_Majumdar"/&gt;

{{columns-list|
* '''From the consumer perspective'''
** Frequent purchases
** Low involvements (little or no effort to choose the item)

== Rural Consumers ==
Consumers in rural areas typically purchase goods from nearby towns and villages.  Recently, there has been a shift in consumer purchase behavior towards [[Local purchasing|purchasing locally]] that has prompted the need for better local promotional efforts to generate brand awareness in small towns.  FMCGs play a large part in the economy as inelastic products that touch every part of consumer life in one way or another.  Businesses that supply FMCGs to a rural community can help provide employment opportunities as well as drive down the cost of such products in those rural areas.  For instance, the FMCG sector in India is the 4th largest sector in its economy and generates employment for more than 3 million people in downstream activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalijdr.com/sites/default/files/issue-pdf/Download%201068.pdf|title=RURAL CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR ON FAST MOVING CONSUMER GOODS|last=Singaravelu|first=Dr. K.|date=October 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10445">The '''Great Race''' is a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] legend surrounding the Red Racetrack, a ring shaped depression surrounding the interior of the [[Black Hills]].&lt;ref name=Sundstrom96&gt;{{cite journal|first=Linea|last=Sundstrom|title=Mirror of Heaven: Cross-Cultural Transference of the Sacred Geography of the Black Hills|journal=World Archaeology|volume=28|number=2|year=1996|pages=177–89|doi=10.1080/00438243.1996.9980339}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}} The legend tells the story of when [[American bison|buffalo]] and man raced each other to establish order in the universe. The stories differ from tribe to tribe but the constant theme is that man established supremacy over the buffalo. This story is also associated with the origins of the [[Sun Dance]] and the [[Sweat lodge|Medicine Lodge]]. Taking place in July, Sun Dance is four to eight days of dancing in order to try to connect with the [[Great Spirit]].&lt;ref name=Powell98&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter J.|last=Powell|title=Sweet Medicine: the continuing role of the Sacred Arrows, the Sun Dance, and the Sacred Buffalo Hat in Northern Cheyenne history|location=Norman, Okla|publisher=University of Oklahoma|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|615}}

==Suhtai ==
This story relates to the origins concerning the medicine lodge. Told by Fire Wolfe, "The venerable Suhtai Buffalo and Sun Dance priest."&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|433}} The story takes place before the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Suhtai]] and the Tsistsistas became one tribe. In this time buffalo ate human beings. A Suhtai man dreamed that he was shooting at a certain buffalo however his arrow turned away and hit another buffalo standing far away. This dream occurred for three nights. Concerned, the young man spoke to the tribe's elders about his dreams. They responded by telling him that the dreams meant nothing. However, that night the young man had the same dream and the young man knew what he had to do. The next day he woke up early to go hunting. Just like in his dream when he shot at a buffalo his arrow diverted its path and hit another buffalo cow. The young man followed her until sundown but could never catch up with her so he went back to camp.
 
The next morning the young man went out looking for the buffalo cow again and found her standing in front of a [[tipi]] but, now she was a beautiful woman. The young man fell in love with her and she bore him a son and he looked exactly like his mother.

One morning the young man discovered that his wife and child were missing. For four days the young man searched for his family and on the fourth day he came to a high ridge and a herd of buffalo were grazing below. As the young man approached the heard a young buffalo calf came running out to meet him; this buffalo was his son. The young man told his son that he wished to follow them. However his son informed him that the trip was too long and that he would die. Still the young man continued despite his son's warning.  A few days later the buffalo decided to put the young man through a test, by seeing if he could identify his son in a group of other buffalo calf. Before the test the young man's son informed him that he would set up various signals so his father could identify him. When the test came the father and son had no problem communicating with each other so the young man passed the test.

The herd proceeded to carry on after this until a few days later when the young calf again approached his father. The calf's grandfather and grandmother wanted to kill the young man by charging at him. Again the young calf informed his father on how he could defeat them, instructing his father to stay calm and to have a pure heart. The grandfather then charged at the young man but was unable to kill him realizing that the young man had "a strong heart and great human power".&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|475}} The grandmother then proceeded to charge but she too realized that he had "a strong heart and great human power".&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|475}} Passing another test the herd carried on and so did the young man.

The young calf then approached his father again informing him that his grandfather was going to challenge him to a race in an attempt to kill the young man. The young calf told his father to take the black stick and not the red one and to run on the inside near the rim rock. He also instructed his father to duck down when his grandfather turned around for it was here that he would be trying to kill him. The race began and the young man ran along the inside of the track like his son instructed. The grandfather then turned around and charged at the young man. The young man ducked when the buffalo charged, and the buffalo ran by the young man off a cliff to his death.

The animals then proceeded to hold a council and decided to have a great race between man and buffalo. If man won he would eat buffalo and buffalo would no longer eat man. However if buffalo won they would eat man and man would no longer eat buffalo. All birds and animals showed up and painted their bodies the colors that they are now today. The buffalo selected Slim Walking Woman to be their racer "for she was the fastest and most long winded".&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|476}} The animals and birds chose their sides and an overwhelming number sided with buffalo. Only swift hawk, crow, magpie, and eagle sided with the young man. The race began and Slim Walking Woman got off to an early lead as magpie flew very high. Many racers passed out from exhaustion. Slim Walking Woman lead the whole race but just as she was about to pass the finish line magpie plunged from the sky passing her right before she crossed the line.

After the race the buffalo elders said they must have the medicine lodge. In it "all will be performed that has happened since the beginning of this great race. On the fourth day of the ceremony it will belong to human beings".&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|477}} The ceremony gave man the power over buffalo and from then on the Suhtaio considered themselves to be the buffalo people.&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|472–478}}

==Lakota==
The [[Lakota people|Lakota]] were the last native occupants of the Black Hills and had the land seized from them by the United States government in 1877.&lt;ref name=Sundstrom96/&gt;{{rp|177}} The Great Race story explains the origin of the Black Hills and the establishment of order in the universe.&lt;ref name=Sundstrom96/&gt;{{rp|181}} Lakota associate the Racetrack with gathering sacred stones for the [[Sun Dance|Sundance]] ceremonies. They believe the race took place at [[Inyan Kara Mountain|Inyan Kara]] and occurs before the summer equinox. Normally this story is not associated with the Falling Star stories that originated in the 1930s and 1940s by [[Nicholas Black Elk]].&lt;ref name=Sundstrom96/&gt;{{rp|181}} Lakota versions of the story refer specifically to the Black Hills and the Race Track.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker&gt;{{cite book|first=Nancy|last=Shoemaker|chapter=American Indians|title=Blackwell Readers in American Social and Cultural History|location=Grand Rapids|publisher=Blackwell Limited|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174}} The Lakota version says that the race was between the "two-leggeds" and the "four-leggeds" and would determine who would eat who.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|174}} Lakota also suggest that the race still goes on today as animals from around the world gather in order to reenact the race.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|174}} Lakotas also believe that the race track was where sundance originated and order in was established.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|174}}

==Cheyenne==
The [[Cheyenne]]/Suhtai inhabited the Black Hills from 1670–1876,&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|179}} also believing that the Great Race took place on Inyan Kara Mountain.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|182}} The Cheyenne Great Race myth explains the origins of the Cheyenne Sundance or Medicine Lodge.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|182}} The Cheyenne tradition of the great race is related to the Suhtai's version.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|186}} It is unknown if the Cheyenne's associated the great race with a constellation like the Lakota.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|186}} The story of the Great Race plays an important role in Cheyenne cosmology, in establishing order among living things.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|180}} In the Cheyenne and Lakota versions the race starts and ends at [[Buffalo Gap, South Dakota|Buffalo Gap]].&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|180}} Other versions of the story refer to the first Sun Dance near [[Bear Lodge Butte]] and Sundance Mountain.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker/&gt;{{rp|180}}

==Current day traditions related to the story==
During the Sundance, the arrow thrust through the piece of meat represents the arrow in the side of the buffalo woman. Both arrow and meat are placed in the Thunder's nest as an offering.&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|473}} The man's child looking like his mother is in accord with the Cheyenne kinship system by which a child belongs to the mother's people. The child became a buffalo calf because the buffalo people were his mother's tribe.&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|473}} Red and black paint used on the rafter beams and center pole of the Medicine Lodge are symbols of the painted sticks using in the great race.&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|475}} During the final dance in the Medicine Lodge, the instructor and pledger dance side by side. While they are dancing, the instructor pushes the pledger against the cottonwood brush surrounding the altar. This represents the attempt of the buffalo grandfather to push the Suhtai over the edge of the cliff.&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|476}} The only part of the buffalo not eaten by the Cheyenne was the [[sweetbreads]] ([[thymus]] gland) which the Cheyenne call ‘human fat'. This was because the "buffalo originally ate human beings." &lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|477}} It is believed that some buffalo that had killed a man were surprised by enemies. They fled, taking some human flesh with them. This fat became internalized in the buffalo, leaving a residue of human flesh in the buffalo's body to this day.&lt;ref name=Powell98/&gt;{{rp|477}}

[[Image:Himeyuri Monument-2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Himeyuri Monument in [[Itoman, Okinawa]]]]

The '''{{nihongo|Himeyuri students|ひめゆり学徒隊|Himeyuri Gakutotai|Lily Princesses Student Corps}}''', sometimes called "Lily Corps" in English, was a group of 222 students and 18 teachers of the Okinawa Daiichi Women's High School and Okinawa Shihan Women's School formed into a nursing unit for the Imperial Japanese Army during the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in 1945.  They were mobilized by the Japanese army on March 23, 1945. Many of the Himeyuri students thought that the Japanese army would defeat the Americans in a matter of days and accordingly brought school supplies to study and get ready to get right back into the classroom.

== History ==
During the nearly 3-month-long battle, the Himeyuri students were on the front lines performing surgery and other difficult duties. Near the end of the battle of Okinawa, many were living in dark caves filled with countless gravely injured and dead soldiers.

=== Unit dissolved ===
On June 18, 1945, an order of dissolution was given to the unit. Up until the dissolution order was given, only 19 of the students had been killed, but in the early morning of June 19, many of them were killed during an attack by US forces on the Ihara third surgery shelter. In the week following the dissolution order, approximately 80% of the girls and their teachers perished. Eventually, the death toll amounted to 123 out of the original 222 students and 18 teachers. Some committed [[suicide]] in various ways because of [[chastity]] fears of [[systematic rape]] by US soldiers. Some threw themselves off cliffs while others killed themselves with hand grenades given to them by the Japanese soldiers.

=== Himeyuri Monument ===
The Himeyuri Monument was built on April 7, 1946 in memory of those who died. Many of those who survived helped build and continue to maintain the facilities. As of 2008, there are still Himeyuri students alive.

=== Himeyuri Peace Museum ===
{{main|Himeyuri Peace Museum}}
The [[Himeyuri Peace Museum]] was modeled after the main school building in which the girls had once studied. The museum has five display chambers displaying photos from the eve of the Battle of Okinawa, the Haebaru Army Field Hospital, portraits of all the young victims who died after the military's retreat to the southernmost tip of the Kyan Peninsula, panels explaining the circumstances under which they died, twenty-eight volumes of testimonials and memoirs by 90 survivors, and a life-sized diorama of Himeyuri Cave. The testimonials bring to life each phase of the battle, as witnessed by the student nurses. Some of the former nurses serve as tour guides at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/manoa/v013/13.1himeyuri.html|title=Project MUSE - Testimonials--Himeyuri Student Nurses, |accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.okinawaindex.com/index/?tid=3&amp;cid=80&amp;id=1|title=Himeyuri No To Monument|accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Hypermodernism''' is a cultural, artistic, literary and architectural successor to [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]] in which the form (attribute) of an object has no context distinct from its function.  Attributes can include shapes, colors, ratios, and even time.  Unlike postmodernism and modernism, hypermodernism exists in an era of fault-tolerant technological change and treats extraneous attributes (most conspicuously physical form) as discordant with function.  While modernism and post-modernism debate the value of the "box" or absolute reference point, hypermodernism focuses on improvising attributes of the box (reference point now an extraneous value rather than correct or incorrect value) so that all of its attributes are non-extraneous; it also excises attributes that are extraneous.  Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute.  Synchrony between previously-clashing objects (now attributes) and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement. Some theorists view hypermodernism as a form of resistance to traditional modernism; others as a supersedence of it.

==Relationship to modernism and postmodernism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

Post-modernism and modernism debated each another in an industrial/physical context and were concerned with the social value of objects themselves.  Modernism focused on confining form within the limited function of a 1950s object while 1970's postmodernism focused on freeing form from its limited function ("there-is-no-box"). The modern/postmodern oversight of objects as a mediator between attribute and function led to redundant human-context thinking and false conflicts between objects such as ideas.

==Propelled by technological advances==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Technology has played a definitive role in function catching up to attribute.  An example is the touch-screen in which the attribute on the screen (ratio, shape, color, animation) becomes the focus of interaction as opposed to manipulation by an external tool i.e. cellphone keyboard.  In the long-term the object ceases to become the middleman between attribute (form) and function.

==Non-composability of objects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism holds that an object is by definition non-composable toward its attributes; and no one attribute of an object can act as a proxy for the object itself.  No whole, or object, is reducible to ONLY its attributes; and the attributes may not be mutually exclusive to the object itself.  Furthermore, an object may have extraneous functions independent of its composing attributes (postmodern theory); this potential supra-functionality is a key concern to hypermodernism's attempt to replace objects with attributes.  Attributes, while having the functions of an object, are not building blocks toward an object in hypermodernism.  No object is by definition hypermodern; however, an object can be more hypermodern or less hypermodern than another object.

[[File:Hypermodernism.jpg|thumb|2D aesthetic attributes projected as a 3D object.]]

==Long-term effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism displays a deep bias against objects physical and non-physical. It can be described as anti-object; however it is NOT anti-materialistic.   Objects are viewed as an extraneous mediator between attribute and function.  Over time, hypermodernism employs attributes to perform the functions of objects, and only those extant objects that can adequately convey the properties of its attributes are allowed to survive.  Those objects that are irreducible to complete attributes will disappear as in the case of the physical keyboard.  Over time, the attribute-function relationship becomes synonymous.

==Human psychology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism compensates for the tendency of human thought to extract the attributes of an object and assign those same attributes to the functions of the object.  Rather than focusing on a debate over "truth" or non-truth and other high-context social considerations, hypermodernism focuses on questions of extraneous vs non-extraneous (In design terms, correctness and incorrectness).  Hypermodernism emphasizes correctness over completeness in design in order to guard against human intuitive leaps.

The '''Ket''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|t}}&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt; language, or more specifically ''Imbak'' and formerly known as '''Yenisei Ostyak''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|s|t|i|æ|k}},&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Siberia]]n language long thought to be an [[language isolate|isolate]], the sole surviving language of a [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian language family]]. It is spoken along the middle [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] basin by the [[Ket people]].

The language is threatened with extinction—the number of ethnic Kets that are native speakers of the language dropped from 1,225 in 1926 to 537 in 1989. According to the UNESCO census, this number has since fallen to 150. There was a 2005 census reporting 485, but it is suspected to be inflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Yeniseian language, [[Yugh language|Yugh]], is believed to have recently become extinct.

==Classification==
Attempts have been made by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scholars to establish a relationship with either [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] or the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], and it frequently forms part of the [[Dene–Caucasian]] hypothesis. None of these attempts has been conclusive. [[Joseph Greenberg]] proposed a link between Ket and other Yeniseian languages and the Na-Dene language group of North America in his final study of Eurasiatic languages. In February 2008, the linguist [[Edward Vajda]] also submitted a paper on the proposed link between Ket with the [[Na-Dene languages]]. Now published in 2010, Vajda's paper has been favorably reviewed by several experts on Na-Dene and Yeniseian languages, including [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], Jeff Leer, [[James Kari]], and Heinrich Werner, as well as a number of other well-known linguists, including [[Bernard Comrie]], [[Johanna Nichols]], Victor Golla, [[Michael Fortescue]], and [[Eric P. Hamp|Eric Hamp]], so that a broad consensus has formed in support of this connection{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Some experts on Yeniseian remain extremely skeptical or reject the hypothesis (e.g. [[Stefan Georg]]).

== Documentation ==
The earliest observations about the language were published by [[Peter Simon Pallas|P. S. Pallas]] in 1788 in a travel diary (Путешествия по разным провинциям Русского Государства ''Puteshestviya po raznim provintsiyam Russkogo Gosudarstva''). [[Matthias Castrén|M.A. Castrén]] was one of the last known to study the [[Kott language|Kot language]]. [[Matthias Castrén|Castrén]] lived beside the [[Kan River|Kan river]] with five people of [[Kott language|Knot]], in which is believed was the last remaining people who spoke the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzM4OTQyOV9fQU41?sid=b69d602a-9f3b-4ceb-a388-7c57a1ffc80d@sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=2|title=A Descriptive Grammar of Ket (Yenisei-Ostyak)|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, [[M. A. Castrén]] published the first grammar and dictionary (''Versuch einer jenissei-ostjakischen und Kottischen Sprachlehre''), which also included material on the [[Kot language]]. During the 19th century, the Ket were mistaken for a tribe of the Finno-Ugric [[Khanty people|Khanty]]. A. Karger in 1934 published the first grammar (Кетский язык ''Ketskij jazyk''), as well as a Ket primer (Букварь на кетском языке ''Bukvar' na ketskom jazyke''), and a new treatment appeared in 1968, written by A. Kreinovich.

E. Alekseyenko has written a historical-ethnological treatment of the Kets (Кеты ''Kety'', 1967). [[Western Washington University]] historical linguist [[Edward Vajda]] offers better substantiated findings into the origins of the Ket people, where DNA claims show genetic affinities with that of Tibetan, Burmese, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ea210/ket.htm|title=East Asian Studies 210 Notes: The Ket|work=wwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Vajda spent a year in Siberia (2005–2006) studying the Ket people, and finds a relationship of Ket language to that of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Na-Dene languages]], and also suggests the tonal system of the Ket language is closer to that of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] than any of the other native Siberian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6050673836854498204#]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303083233/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6050673836854498204%23 |date=March  3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His (2004) monograph ''Ket'' is the first modern scholarly grammar of the Ket language in English.

There is much [[allophony]], and the phonetic inventory of consonants is essentially as below. This is the level of description reflected by the Ket alphabet.

Furthermore, all nasal consonants in Ket have voiceless allophones at the end of a monosyllabic word with a glottalized or descending tone (i.e. {{IPA|[m, n, ŋ]}} turn into {{IPA|[m̥, n̥, ŋ̥]}}), likewise, {{IPA|[ɮ]}} becomes {{IPA|[ɬ]}} in the same situation. Alveolars are often pronounced [[laminal consonant|laminal]] and possibly [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]], though not in the vicinity of a uvular consonant. {{IPA|/q/}} is normally pronounced with affrication, as {{IPA|[q&lt;sup&gt;χ&lt;/sup&gt;]}}.

=== Tone ===
Descriptions of Ket vary widely in the number of contrastive tones they report: as many as eight and as few as zero have been counted. Given this wide disagreement, whether or not Ket is a [[tonal language]] is debatable,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Maddieson, "Tone". The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. http://wals.info/feature/13&lt;/ref&gt; although recent works by Ket specialists Edward Vajda and Stefan Georg defend the existence of tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3749920/Tone_and_phoneme_in_Ket|title=Tone And Phoneme In Ket|publisher=Academia|author=[[Edward Vajda|Vajda, Edward]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tonal descriptions, Ket does not employ a tone on every syllable but instead uses one tone per word. Following Vajda's description of Southern Ket, the five basic tones are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Vajda (2004), pp. 8-12&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Tone name]]
! Glottalized
! High-Even
! Rising Falling

! Rising High-Falling
|-
! [[Tone contour]]
| {{IPA|[˧˦ʔ]}} (34’)
| {{IPA|[˥]}} (5)
| {{IPA|[˩˧.˧˩]}} (13.31)
| {{IPA|[˧˩]}} (31)
| {{IPA|[˩˧.˥˧]}} (13.53)
|-
! Example
| {{IPA|[kɛʔt]}}&lt;br&gt;"person"
| {{IPA|[sýl]}}&lt;br&gt;"blood"
| {{IPA|[su᷈ːl] ([sǔûl])}}&lt;br&gt;"hand sled"
| {{IPA|[qàj]}}&lt;br&gt;"elk"
| {{IPA|[bə̌ntân]}}&lt;br&gt;"mallard ducks"
|}

The glottalized tone features pharyngeal or laryngeal constriction, or a full glottal stop that interrupts the vowel.

Georg's 2007 description of Ket tone is similar to the above, but reduces the basic number of tonemes to four, while moving the rising high-falling tone plus a variant to a class of tonemes only found in multisyllabic words. With some exceptions caused by certain prefixes or clitics, the domain of tones in a multisyllabic word is limited to the first two syllables.{{sfn|Georg|2007|pages=49, 56-58}}

==Incorporation==
Ket makes significant use of [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]]. Incorporation is not limited to nouns, and can also include verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and bound morphemes found only in the role of incorporated elements. Incorporation also occurs as both a lexicalized process - the combination of verb and incorporate being treated as a distinct lexical element, with a meaning often based around the incorporated element - and a paradigmatic one, where the incorporation is performed spontaneously for particular semantic and pragmatic effect{{sfn|Georg|2007|pages=233, 235}} Forms of incorporation include:
*'''Nominal incorporation''', most commonly used to describe the [[Thematic relation|instrumental]] part of an action, but sometimes used to describe [[Patient (grammar)|patients]] instead. Instrumental incorporation doesn't affect the [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] of the verb (though there are examples where this form of incorporation is used to describe agentless changes of state), while patient incorporation can make a [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verb [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. Patient incorporation is usually used for patients that are wholly effected by an action (such as being brought into existence by it); more generally affected patients are typically incorporated only when significantly defocused or backgrounded.{{sfn|Georg|2007|pages=236}}
*'''Verbal incorporation''', more specifically the incorporation of verbal [[infinitives]] (rather than roots) into the verb complex. This form of incorporation is used to signify [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and form [[causative]]s. Incorporated infinitives may bring incorporated elements of their own into the verb as well.{{sfn|Georg|2007|pages=233-234}}
*'''Adjectival incorporation''', with an incorporated adjective describing the target or final state of an action.{{sfn|Georg|2007|pages=232-233}}
*'''Adverbial incorporation''', where a local adverb is used to describe the direction or path of a movement.{{sfn|Georg|2007|pages=233}}

== Decline and current use ==
Ket people were subjected to collectivization and then eventually sent to Russian-only boarding schools from the 1930s to 1960s.  Now, Ket is taught as a subject in some primary schools, but only older adults are fluent and few are raising their children with the language. [[Kellog]], Russia is the only place where Ket is still taught in schools. Special books are provided for grades second through fourth but after those grades there is only Russian Literature to read that describes Ket culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kryukova|first=Elena|year=2013|title=The Ket Language: from descriptive linguistic to interdisciplinary research|url=|journal=Tomsk Journal of Linguistics &amp; Anthropology|volume=1|pages=39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no known monolingual speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: a Comparative Handbook|last=Vajda|first=Edward|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=471–500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake of Stars Festival''' is an annual three-day international festival held on the shores of [[Lake Malawi]], the third largest lake in [[Africa]]. The first festival took place in 2004 and attracts over 4,000 attendees with musical acts drawn mainly from Africa and Europe.

==History==

The festival was founded by British tourist Will Jameson. Jameson visited Malawi in 1998. He was a student at [[John Moores University]] and took a year off to work with [[The Wildlife Society]]. That work sent him to Malawi. Upon returning to college, Jameson started night club as tribute to his trip, called [[Chibuku|Chibuku Shake Shake]], the name of a brand of Malawian beer. The club night was named the best club night in the [[United Kingdom]] 2004 by ''[[Mixmag]]''. That same year, Jameson held the first festival. An estimated 700 people attended, the majority from Africa. The 2011 Lake of Stars attracted over 3,000 attendees from Europe and Africa. The festival was opened with the Malawian ministry of tourism [[skydiving]] onto the festival beach.&lt;ref name=Lanyado&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lanyado|first1=Benjii|title=Malawi's musical turn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/12/malawi-africa-music-festival|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and accolades==

Lake of Stars Festival is widely referenced as being one of the most important festivals on the African continent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/africa-view-best-african-festivals/index.html|title=Why Africa's festival business is booming|date=16 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014, it was named one of the top seven African music festivals to attend by [[CNN]].&lt;ref name=Bgoya&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bgoya|first1=Lorraine|last2=Kapambwe|first2=Mazuba|title=7 African music festivals you really have to see|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/21/travel/africa-best-music-festivals/|website=CNN|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' named Lake of Stars as having the most beautiful festival location in the world, in 2015.&lt;ref name=Ensall&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ensall|first1=Jonny|title=Five reasons to go to Lake of Stars festival|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music-festivals/five-reasons-to-go-to-Lake-of-Stars-festival|website=London|publisher=Time Out|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The UK's Independent newspaper has said "the life-affirming Lake of Stars offers a fascinating opportunity to experience the musical pulse of this inspiring country"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/lake-of-stars-music-without-barriers-1823719.html|title=Lake of stars - Music without barriers|date=20 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016, Vice Magazine recognised that "the ability of this festival to inspire the young people who attend is pretty special" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/mgw9zq/this-festival-founded-by-brits-in-malawi-swears-its-not-problematic|title=This Festival Founded by Brits in Malawi Swears It's Not Problematic|date=7 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival management==

The Lake of Stars Festival is organised by a mixture of international volunteers, many of them with huge amounts of experience in the live events industry, supporting a team in Malawi.  The festival receives pro-bono support from the UK music industry, with the UK headliners that travel to Malawi usually agreeing to waive their normal performance fees. An estimated over $1 million is generated by the festival for the local economy each year.&lt;ref name=Lanyado/&gt;

==Activities==

The festival organizes volunteer opportunities for festival attendees, providing service to a variety of charities sponsored by the festival including the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Attendees also visit [[orphanage]]s to spend time with children and play games and sports with them.&lt;ref name=Lanyado/&gt; The festival also includes talks, similar to [[TED talks]], 
theatre, dance and [[mixed martial arts]].&lt;ref name=Mbowa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mbowa|first1=Aida|title=Malawi Lake of Stars festival: good music is just the half of it|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-08-07-lake-of-stars-festival-much-more-than-a-celebration-of-music|website=Arts|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''Legal consciousness''' is a ''collection'' of understood and/or imagined to have understood, [[legal awareness]] of ideas, views, feelings and traditions imbibed through [[legal socialization]]; which reflects as [[legal culture]] among given individual, or a group, or a given society at large. The legal consciousness evaluates the existing [[law]] and also bears in mind an image of the desired or ideal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Consciousness Among Youth at the Red Hook Community Justice Center By Aviad Lael Brisman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is not an individual trait nor solely ideational; legal consciousness is a type of [[Social Practice|social practice]] reflecting and forming [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Silbey Susan 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan|title=legal consciousness|journal=New Oxford Companion to Law|date=2008|pages=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/~ssilbey/www/pdf/Legal_consciousness.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015|ref=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of legal Consciousness documents the forms of participation and interpretation through which act or sustain, reproduce, or amend the circulating contested or hegemonic structures of meanings concerning [[law]]. Legal consciousness is the way in which [[law]] is experienced and interpreted by specific individuals as they engage, avoid, resist or just assume the [[law]] and legal meanings.

Legal consciousness is a state of being, [[legal socialisation]] is the process to Legal consciousness; where as [[legal awareness]] &amp; [[legal mobilisation]] are means to achieve  the same.

==Definition==
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (1979) defined legal consciousness as " ''the sum of views and ideas expressing the attitude of people toward law, legality, and justice and their concept of what is lawful and unlawful. Legal consciousness is a form of social consciousness. Legal ideology, the system of legal views based on certain social and scientific viewpoints, is a concentrated expression of legal consciousness. The customs and feelings of people in relation to legal phenomena constitute the psychological aspect of legal consciousness; among these are a sense of justice and a loathing of crimes and illegal actions'' "

Legal consciousness is defined by Ewick and Silbey as the process by which people make sense of their experiences by relying on legal categories and concepts. People do this even when they are not familiar with the details and minutia of law or the legal system. They explain that there are cultural schemas provided by law that people use to make sense of their experiences. They refer to this as legality. The concept of legality includes "the meanings, sources, authority and cultural practices that are commonly recognized as legal, regardless of who employs them or for what ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewick; Silbey|first1=Patricia; Susan|title=The Common Place of Law: Stories from Everyday Life|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meanings and sources and different ways of knowing and understanding enable people to make sense of what happens to them and what that might mean in terms of their rights and options. This process of understanding legal experiences occurs within a larger ecosystem in which there are disputes over meaning and values. Seron and Munger explain that ""in addition, class may affect legal consciousness: Law may mean different things depending on an individual's location in the various hierarchies of status, prestige, and knowledge associated with membership in a social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seron; Munger|first1=Carroll; Frank|last2=Munger|first2=Frank|title=Law and Inequality: Race, Gender... and of Course, Class|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1996|volume=22|pages=187–212|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols of the [[United Kingdom]] are mostly interchangeable with symbols of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. This page could, theoretically, be called [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural]] icons. The list includes certain symbols of [[List of cultural icons of England|England]], [[List of cultural icons of Wales|Wales]], [[List of cultural icons of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Culture of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] which, for one reason or another, may be perceived to be shared by other parts of the United Kingdom, or were founded or invented after the British [[Act of Union 1707]], or before the creation of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] (hence the inclusion of Stonehenge). At a stretch, they could be things which were created or invented, or people who were born, before the Act of Union but after the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603.

Icons of the United Kingdom include:

There is some variation in whether the term ''macaron'' or ''macaroon'' is used, and the related [[macaroon|coconut macaroon]] is often confused with the macaron. In English, some bakers have adopted the French spelling of ''macaron'' for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two. In a ''Slate'' article on the topic, [[Stanford University|Stanford]] professor of linguistics and computer science [[Daniel Jurafsky]] describes how the two confections have a shared history, also shared with [[macaroni]] ([[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|maccheroni}}).  Prof. Jurafsky notes that French words ending with "-on" that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with "-oon" (for example: ''balloon'', ''cartoon'', ''platoon'').{{sfnp|Jurafsky|2011b}} In an older version of this article, while mostly using the term "macaron" for the meringue-based item, Prof. Jurafsky also distinguishes the two using the terms "Parisian macaroon" and "coconut macaroon".{{sfnp|Jurafsky|2011a}}  Many bakeries continue to use the term "macaroon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Macaron vs Macaroon - What's in a name anyway? |url=https://www.angesdesucre.com/blogs/anges-de-sucre/14017793-macaron-vs-macaroon-whats-in-a-name-anyway |website=Anges de Sucre |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miss Macaroon |url=https://missmacaroon.co.uk/ |website=Miss Macaroon |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Collection Chocolate Macaroon Assortment (24 Pieces) |url=https://www.marksandspencer.com/chocolate-macaroon-assortment-24-pieces-/p/p60069379 |website=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical macaron is presented with a [[ganache]], [[buttercream]] or [[jam]] filling sandwiched between two such cookies, akin to a [[sandwich cookie]].  The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavors that range from traditional ([[raspberry]], [[chocolate]]) to unusual ([[foie gras]], [[matcha]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desserteater.com/macaron/134/ |title=Macaron |website=Dessert Eater |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811203844/http://desserteater.com/macaron/134/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Macaron.jpg|thumb|right|Picture from {{lang|fr|Dictionnaire encyclopédique de l'épicerie et des industries annexes}}, by [[Albert Seigneurie]], edited by ''L'Épicier'' in 1904, page 431.]]
Macarons have been produced in the Venetian monasteries since the 8th century A.D.  During the [[Renaissance]], French queen [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s Italian pastry chefs made them when she brought them with her to France in 1533 upon marrying [[Henry II of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madmacnyc.com/history-of-macarons |title=History of Macarons |publisher=Mad Mac LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'' the macaron was created in 1791 in a convent near [[Cormery]]. In 1792, macarons began to gain fame when two Carmelite nuns, seeking asylum in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] during the [[French Revolution]], baked and sold the macaron cookies in order to pay for their housing. These nuns became known as the "Macaron Sisters". In these early stages, macarons were served without special flavors or fillings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2007/10/introduction-to-french-macarons.html |title=Introduction to French Macarons |author=Robyn Lee |website=Serious Eats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 1930s that macarons began to be served two-by-two with the addition of jams, liqueurs, and spices.  The macaron as it is known today, composed of two almond meringue discs filled with a layer of buttercream, jam, or [[ganache]] filling, was originally called the "Gerbet" or the "Paris macaron."  Pierre Desfontaines, of the French pâtisserie [[Ladurée]], has sometimes been credited with its creation in the early part of the 20th century, but another baker, Claude Gerbet, also claims to have invented it.{{sfnp|Jurafsky|2011b}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,578089,00.html |title=Macarons, the Daddy Mac of Cookies |author=Elena Ferretti |work=Fox News |date=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; French macaron bakeries became trendy in North America in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/staff/2014/06/10/french-macaron/10279099/ |title=The French Macaron Trend |author=Mary Chao |website=Democrat &amp; Chronicle |date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest recipe==
Many Italian cookbooks of the 16th century mention almond biscuits closely resembling macarons albeit under different names. The earliest known recipe dated back from the early 17th century and appears to be inspired by a French version of the recipe.
{{quote|quote='''To make French Macaroones'''&lt;br /&gt;
Wash a pound of the newest and the best [[Jordan almond|Jordane Almonds]] in three or foure waters, to take away the rednesse from their out-side, lay them in a Bason of warme water all night, the next day blanch them, and dry them with a faire cloath, beat them in a stone morter, untill they be reasonably fine, put to them halfe a pound of fine beaten Sugar, and so beat it to a perfect Paste, then put in halfe a dozen spoonefuls of good [[Rosa × damascena|Damaske]] [[rose water|Rose-water]], three graines of [[ambergris|Ambergreece]], when you have beaten all this together, dry it on a [[chafing dish|chafingdish]] of coales untill it grow white and stiffe, then take it off the fire, and put the whites of two new laid Egs first beaten into froath, and so stirre it well together, then lay them on wafers in fashion of little long rowles, and so bake them in an Oven as hot as for [[Manchet]], but you must first let the heat of the Oven passe over before you put them in, when they rise white and light, take them out of the Oven, and put them in a warm platter, and set them againe into the warme Oven &amp; so let them remain foure or five houres, and then they wil be thoroughly dry, but if you like them better being moist, then dry them not after the first baking.

==Method==
[[File:Preparing macarons for Valentine's Day, filling, February 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Macaron preparation]]
There are two main methods to making a macaron - the "French" method and the "Italian" method. The difference between the two is the way the meringue is made.

In the French method, egg whites are whisked until a stiff-peaked meringue forms. From there, sifted, ground almonds and powdered sugar are folded in slowly until the desired consistency is reached. This process of knocking out air and folding is called macaronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cordonbleu.edu/news/technique-video-macronage/en | title = French pâtisserie technique: Macaronage |website=Le Cordon Bleu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian method involves whisking the egg whites with a hot sugar syrup to form a meringue. Sifted almonds and icing sugar are also mixed with raw egg whites to form a paste. The [[meringue]] and almond paste are mixed together to form the macaron mixture. This method is often deemed more structurally sound yet also sweeter and also requires a candy thermometer for the sugar syrup.

Either Italian or French meringue can be combined with ground almonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/may/17/how-to-cook-perfect-chocolate-macarons | title = How to cook perfect chocolate macarons |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A macaron is made by combining icing sugar and ground almonds into a fine mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://betterwithbutter.com/macaron-mania/ | title = Macaron troubleshooting tips |website=Better with Butter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate bowl, egg whites are beaten to a meringue-like consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/macaroons_16105 |title=Macaroons |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two elements are then folded together until they are the consistency of "shaving foam", and then are piped, left to form a skin, and baked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 22, 2015 |website=The World of Anges |url=http://www.angesdesucre.com/pages/macaron-myth-buster-french-or-italian-tips-and-hints | title = Macaron Myth Buster: French or Italian?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, a filling is added.

===France===
Several French cities and regions claim long histories and variations, notably [[Lorraine]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and [[Boulay]]), [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] ([[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]), [[Saint-Émilion]], [[Amiens]], [[Montmorillon]], [[Le Dorat]], [[Sault, Vaucluse|Sault]], [[Chartres]], [[Cormery]], [[Joyeuse]] and Sainte-Croix in Burgundy.

{{anchor|Macarons d'Amiens}}
Macarons d'Amiens, made in [[Amiens]], are small, round-shaped biscuit-type macarons made from [[almond paste]], fruit and honey, which were first recorded in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Rider|title=Short Breaks Northern France|publisher=New Holland Publishers|date=1 May 2005|pages=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwG65xpOh9oC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781860111839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Montmorillon]] is well known for its macarons and has a museum dedicated to it. The Maison Rannou-Métivier is the oldest macaron bakery in Montmorillon, dating back to 1920. The traditional recipe for Montmorillon macarons remains unchanged for over 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museedumacaron.com/press_book.htm |website=Musée de l'Amande et du Macaron |title=Montmorillon — Le musée du Macaron et de l'Amande |language=fr |trans-title=Montmorillon — The Macaron and Almond Museum |author=Cécile Teurlay |date=July–August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in the [[Lorraine]] region has a storied history with the macaron. It is said that the abbess of [[Remiremont]] founded an order of nuns called the "Dames du Saint-Sacrement" with strict dietary rules prohibiting the consumption of meat. Two nuns, Sisters Marguerite and Marie-Elisabeth are credited with creating the Nancy macaron to fit their dietary requirements. They became known as the 'Macaron Sisters' (Les Soeurs Macarons). In 1952, the city of Nancy honored them by giving their name to the Rue de la Hache, where the macaron was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.achat-meurthe-et-moselle.com/pro19-Notre-Histoire-MAISON-DES-SOEURS-MACARONS.htm |title=Maison des soeurs Macarons &gt; Notre histoire ... |language=fr |website=achatville.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mr. Terrific''''' is an American [[television|TV]] [[sitcom]] that aired on [[CBS Television]] from January 9 to August 28, 1967, Monday nights  at 8 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]. [[Stephen Strimpell]] starred in the title role. A  similar series on [[NBC]], ''[[Captain Nice]],'' also aired that season on Monday nights following ''Mr.Terrific'' at 8:30 pm.

==Premise==
Riding the tide of the camp [[superhero]] craze of the 1960s, the show's premise involved gas station attendant Stanley Beamish (Strimpell), a mild-mannered scrawny youth who secretly worked to fight crime for a government organization, "The Bureau of Secret Projects," in Washington. All he needed to do was to take a "power pill" which gave him the strength of a thousand men and enabled him to fly, much like [[Superman]], albeit by furious flapping while wearing the top half of a [[wingsuit]]. To the often-lamented misfortune of the Bureau of Secret Projects, he was the only person on whom the pills worked. It was established that, although the pill would give him high strength levels, he was still vulnerable to bullets. Furthermore, each power pill had a time limit of one hour (like ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' and [[DC Comics]]'s [[Hourman]]), although he generally had two 10-minute booster pills available per episode. Much of the show's humor revolved around the tendency of the amiable yet gullible Beamish to lose Mr. Terrific's powers at inopportune times, before he completed his given assignment.

Beamish's government employers were Mr. Barton J. Reed and Mr. Harley Trent, and his day-job partner at the service station was Hal Walters. Beamish was sworn to secrecy concerning his alter-ego and super-powers.

[[Alan Young]], who had just completed his run as Wilbur Post on ''[[Mister Ed]],'' was the original choice to play Stanley H. Beamish, and appeared in the original 1966 unaired version of the pilot, which featured a different supporting cast ([[Edward Andrews]] as The Chief, All Checco as Dr. Kramer, Dick Merrifield as Tony Lawrence, Sheilah Wells as Gloria Dickinson, and [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Mr. Finney).

A custom of [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecers]] is to give [[nickname]]s to their [[politician]]s (and some personalities), quite especially [[Premier of Quebec|their Premiers]]. Many of those given to Premiers are affectionate or even express admiration, while others are insulting.

==Nicknames of Quebec Premiers==
* [[Maurice Duplessis]] (1936 &amp;ndash; 1939 and 1944–1959): Le Chef ''("The Leader" or "The Chief")''.  Often pronounced (and even spelled) "Le Cheuf", to reflect an old-fashioned [[joual]] pronunciation of the word.
** Often used disparagingly to evoke Duplessis's despotism. Nevertheless, he apparently used the nickname to refer to himself.
* [[Daniel Johnson Sr.]] (1966 &amp;ndash; 1968): Danny Boy.
** Name given to the portrayal of Johnson as a comical and clueless [[cowboy]] in [[political cartoon]]s drawn by Normand Hudon before Johnson taking power. An apparent reference to his [[Danny Boy|Irish roots]].
* [[Robert Bourassa]] (1970 &amp;ndash; 1976 and 1985 &amp;ndash; 1994)
** Boubou.
*** Also inspired the term "[[Boubou Macoutes]]".
** L'homme le plus détesté du Québec ''("The most hated man of Quebec")''.
*** A term used by historians to denote the unpopularity of Bourassa and his government before first losing power to [[René Lévesque]]'s [[Parti Québécois]] in [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976]].
** Bourassa I; Bourassa II.
***Terms historians use to refer to Bourassa and his governments under his first two mandates and his last two mandates as Premier, respectively.
* [[René Lévesque]] (1976 &amp;ndash; 1985): Ti-Poil ''(literally, "Lil' Hair", but more accurately translated as "Baldy")''.
** A reminder of his often ruffled comb-over.
* [[Jacques Parizeau]] (1994 &amp;ndash; 1996): Monsieur ''("Sir")''.
** Positive and relatively appreciative reference to his well-known aristocratic pride and assurance. Source of the title of a 2003 documentary, ''Monsieur'' about Parizeau.
* [[Lucien Bouchard]] (1996 &amp;ndash; 2001):
** Madame Lulu.
** Barbe Bleue.
* [[Jean Charest]] (2003 &amp;ndash; 2012): Charest has gained numerous nicknames:
**Patapouf or Patapouf Premier ''("Patapouf the First")''.
***The name was rumoured to be a nickname given by Charest's wife, something he denied. It first came to be used in the campaign [[Destituons Patapouf!]], an operation of disgruntled citizens who spread a petition from 2003 to 2004 to have Charest [[recall election|recalled]], not unlike California governor [[Gray Davis]]. [[Loco Locass]] (music group), in their song [[Libérez-nous des libéraux]] ("Free us from the liberals") used this nickname to refer to him. The word is an [[archetypal name]] for a clown in [[Quebec French]] (like [[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]). It is also a [[pejorative]] way to talk about someone fat, so it could refer to the fact that he gained some weight. Patapouf Premier is a sarcastic variant that paints Charest as a farcical, despotic [[monarch]]. Both are used mockingly.
**Le Frisé ''("Curly")''.
***Referring to his famous curly hair. It is negative. A humorous, mocking song from irony rocker [[Mononc' Serge]] about the man is entitled "Le Frisé".
**Le p'tit Saint-Jean-Baptiste ''("Lil' Saint John the Baptist")''.
***The [[Fête nationale du Québec|Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] parades of first half of the 20th century usually featured a curly-haired boy representing [[Saint John the Baptist]]. It is therefore another mocking of Charest's hairstyle. This could also refer to Charest's birthdate, which is June 24, the feast of John the Baptist.
**Le mouton ''("The Sheep")''
***Another reference to his curly hair.
* [[Pauline Marois]] (2012 &amp;ndash; 2014):
**Dame de béton ''("The Concrete Lady")'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/pqs-pauline-marois-a-feminist-whose-toughness-earned-her-concrete-lady-reputation PQ’s Pauline Marois a feminist whose toughness earned her ‘Concrete Lady’ reputation]&lt;/ref&gt;
***In reference to her toughness and that she had survived several challenges to her leadership from prominent members of her caucus.
* [[Philippe Couillard]] (2014 &amp;ndash; 2018):
**The Bear&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/have-the-pq-poked-the-bear-liberal-leader-philippe-couillard-may-be-a-fiercer-opponent-than-marois-expects Have the PQ poked the bear?: Liberal leader Philippe Couillard may be a fiercer opponent than Marois expects]&lt;/ref&gt;
***In reference to his beard, build and ambling gait.
**Philippe-Flop&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnews.ca/news/985068/liberal-leader-gets-a-new-nickname/ Liberal leader gets a new nickname]&lt;/ref&gt;
***Used by opposition parties as a pejorative against him, due to his perceived shifting of his positions on issues.

* [[François Legault]] (2018 &amp;ndash; present):
**Maternelle Quatre-Ans 1er ''("Preschool the First")''
***Especially used social media’s by meme Facebook pages, In reference to an electoral promise to implement a second preschool year at the age of 4 years old, as it was ostensibly repeated and considered as absurdly unrealistic considering the timeframe and funding.

==Similar nicknames==
*[[Louis St. Laurent]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]] from 1948 to 1957): Oncle Louis ''("Uncle Louis")''.
* [[Camillien Houde]] (Four-time [[Mayor of Montreal]] from the 20s to the 50s): Monsieur Montréal.
* [[Pacifique Plante]] ([[crime]]fighting [[lawyer]] from the 40s to the 50s): Pax Plante.
* [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]] from 1968 to 1979 and 1980 to 1984): Ti-Pet ''("Lil' Fart")'' or Pet.
** Always derogatory. P.E.T. were Trudeau's initials traditionally used in [[English Canada]] as alternative naming and ''pet'' is French for fart. Since Trudeau was in power for many of the same years as Lévesque, the two were sometimes referred to collectively as "Ti-Pet et Ti-Poil" by irreverent members of the population.  These initials were also popularly used to parody the name of the nationalized oil/gas company PETRO Canada (founded during Trudeau's reign) which was rendered as:  Pierre Elliot Trudeau ripping off Canada—probably of Albertan origin.
* [[Brian Mulroney]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]] from 1984 to 1993): Lyin' Brian; Le p'tit gars de Baie-Comeau ''("Little Guy from Baie-Comeau")'', "The chin that walks like a man" (a moniker given him by columnist [[Allan Fotheringham]]), and "Mini Trudeau"  (a name given to him by René Lévesque for his similarities to Pierre Elliot Trudeau perceived by Quebec)
** Mulroney was born and raised in [[Baie-Comeau]], a city in the [[Côte-Nord]] region of Quebec.
* [[Jean Chrétien]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]] from 1993 to 2003): Le p'tit gars de Shawinigan ''("Little Guy from Shawinigan")''.
** Chrétien received a similar nickname to Mulroney's. This refers to his own city of origin, [[Shawinigan, Quebec|Shawinigan]], Quebec. Chrétien sometimes spoke of himself that way.
* [[Mario Dumont]] (leader of the [[Action Démocratique]] from 1994 to 2009): Super Mario.
**A common criticism towards Dumont is his relatively young age. Super Mario is both a comment on his youth (referring to the [[Nintendo]] video game series [[Super Mario Bros.]], popular amongst children) and an [[irony|ironic]] glorification of his [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] popularity. Also, the rap group [[Loco Locass]] wrote a song called Super Mario in reference of Dumont. Since the election of 2007, when his party won 41 seats (they'd only won 5 as a result of the previous election), the nickname "Super Mario" isn't always pejorative.
* [[Amir Khadir]] (leader and [[National Assembly of Quebec|MNA]] of [[Québec solidaire]]): "Godasse Khadir" (in French slang, godasse means ''old shoe''). Khadir was nicknamed Godasse after throwing a shoe on an effigy of [[George W. Bush]] in 2008, during a protest held in Montreal for journalist [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi]], famous for throwing a pair of shoes at the U.S. President in Iraq.
* [[Jack Layton]] (leader of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]): "le bon Jack" (''un bon jack'' meaning a nice guy).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jackomania-in-quebec-puts-layton-in-opponents-crosshairs/article1995387/?from=sec368 'Jackomania' in Quebec puts Layton in opponents' crosshairs – The Globe and Mail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thomas Mulcair]] (Leader of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]) "Pinocchio". For his diametrically opposed views that he publicly states depending on the language and/or the province he delivers the message. A well known example is "Nous sommes contre [[Energy East]], we're for Energy East".

'''Nocturne painting''' is a term coined by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] to describe a painting style that depicts scenes evocative of the night or subjects as they appear in a veil of light, in twilight, or in the absence of direct light. In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any  [[Night in paintings (Western art)|painting of a night scene]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, Denis. (1992). ''Education And Politics For The 1990s: Conflict Or Consensus?'' (edition reprint). Psychology Press. p. 150. {{ISBN|0750700793}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or night-piece, such as [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''.

Whistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a "dreamy, pensive mood" by applying a musical name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/8.htm |title=Tonalism and the "Nocturne  |publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a "symphony", "harmony", "study" or "arrangement", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ronald and Anne Koval.

(''Note: need to verify this was the edition used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "nocturne" can be associated with the [[Tonalism]] movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is "characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Marter|Marter, Joan]].

==Rembrandt’s nocturnes==
In northern [[Europe]], the [[Dutch Golden Age]] produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in ''The Mill'' (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/11/art|title=The Enduring Genius of Rembrandt|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|date=11 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an [[illustrator]] to that of a fine artist and had chosen [[American Impressionism|Impressionism]] as the style in which he worked at the time. One example of his work is [http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/images/agart/stampede.jpg ''The Stampede'' (also known as ''The Stampede by Lightning'', 1908).]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Non-well-founded set theories''' are variants of [[axiomatic set theory]] that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of [[well-foundedness]]. In non-well-founded set theories, the [[axiom of regularity|foundation axiom]] of [[ZFC]] is replaced by axioms implying its negation.

The study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an [[axiom]]. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until [[Peter Aczel]]’s [[hyperset theory]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Pakkan and Akman (1994, [http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/mirrors/www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/%257Eakman/jour-papers/air/node8.html section link]); Rathjen (2004); Sangiorgi (2011) pp. 17–19, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the [[logic]]al [[model (abstract)|modelling]] of non-terminating [[Computing|computational]] processes in computer science ([[process algebra]] and [[final semantics]]), [[linguistics]] and [[natural language]] [[semantics]] ([[situation theory]]), philosophy (work on the [[Liar Paradox]]), and in a different setting, [[non-standard analysis]].{{sfnp|Ballard|Hrbáček|1992|p=}}

== Details ==
In 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;68; Hallett (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TM3AKPYdQVgC&amp;pg=PA186 p.&amp;nbsp;186]; Aczel (1988) p. 105 all citing Mirimanoff (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[well-founded set|well-foundedness]] of a set:

:A set, x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is well-founded if it has no infinite descending membership sequence &lt;math&gt; \cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

In ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the [[axiom of regularity]]. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the ''foundation axiom'' since it can be proved within ZFC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the [[axiom of regularity]], the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set ''A'' such that ''A'' ∈ ''A'' is non-well-founded.

Although Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (1988) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Paul Finsler]] introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of [[von Neumann]] 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=107}} An early non-well-founded set theory was [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]’s [[New Foundations]], although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.

Several proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by [[Paul Bernays]] (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by [[Ernst Specker]] who gave a different proof in his [[Habilitationsschrift]] of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 [[Rieger's theorem]] was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=107–108}} The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of [[Dana Scott]] (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called [[Anti-Foundation Axiom|SAFA]].{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=108–109}} Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was [[Maurice Boffa]]'s axiom of [[superuniversality]], described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=110}} Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every [[extensionality|extensional]] [[binary relation|set-like]] relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.

A more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a [[bisimulation]]. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the [[axiom of extensionality]]. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as '''anti-foundation axioms''', and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a '''hyperset'''.

Four mutually [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:
# '''A'''FA ("Anti-Foundation Axiom") – due to M. Forti and F. Honsell (this is also known as [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]]);
# '''S'''AFA ("Scott’s AFA") – due to [[Dana Scott]],
# '''F'''AFA ("Finsler’s AFA") – due to [[Paul Finsler]],
# '''B'''AFA ("Boffa’s AFA") – due to [[Maurice Boffa]].
They essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on [[accessible pointed graph]]s (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg.  Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called [[Quine atom]], formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.

Each of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: [[Von Neumann universe|V]] ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.&lt;ref&gt;Nitta, Okada, Tsouvaras (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.

== Applications ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Aczel’s hypersets were extensively used by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] in their 1987 book ''The Liar'', on the [[liar's paradox]]; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.

Boffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic [[nonstandard analysis]].{{sfnp|Kanovei|Reeken|2004|p=303}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1302">'''Ozidi''' is a folk hero among the [[Ijaw people|Ijo]] of [[Nigeria]], and the subject of [[The Ozidi Saga]] composed by [[playwright]] and [[poet]] [[John Pepper Clark]]. The saga's first performance was in 1966.

== Plot ==

After his father is murdered by treacherous colleagues, Ozidi seeks vengeance so his father can join his ancestors. His goal is to call home his father from a [[limbo]]-like evil grove where the murdered go instead of joining their ancestors.

Ozidi vomits his sword and battle outfit out of himself before each battle. He leads his musician-assistants, his grandmother, and the animals and objects that he regurgitates. His grandmother coaches him to many victories, but Ozidi goes too far and kills his uncle and an innocent woman and her newborn son. The [[Smallpox]] King comes to take Ozidi in punishment, but Ozidi's mother insists that her son was only being afflicted by [[Yaws]], a mild childhood disease that Ozidi had never contracted. Somehow the Smallpox King was confused and he retreated.  Upon recovery, Ozidi gave up his battle sword for good.

'''Pete Lawrence''' is a conceptualist, social entrepreneur, recording artist, DJ, event organiser, music programmer writer and broadcaster based in the UK.

==Background==

Lawrence created the concept for [[The Big Chill (music festival)|The Big Chill]] in February 1994, originally as a new type of Sunday multimedia club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.petelawrence.net/the_big_chill|title=The Big Chill|newspaper=Pete Lawrence|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his partner at the time, Katrina Larkin, he put together an event at which people were able to network and enjoy an experimental, audio-visual environment, as part of a multi-faceted eight-hour event. It was the first London club to have its own website and to offer free internet access and was initially noted for its ambient and downtempo soundtrack, contributing to the development of the chill out’ boom at the turn of the Millennium.

This “festival in a club” concept adapted relatively easily to an outdoors setting and in 1995 Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin staged the first Big Chill Festival, reaching a capacity of 35,000 by 2007 as one of the top UK festivals. He was also instrumental in taking The Big Chill concept to several locations worldwide in collaboration with The [[British Council]].

Lawrence was also involved in The Big Chill's expansion into opening London venues. The Big Chill Bar in Brick Lane, was followed in autumn 2006 with the three story Big Chill House in Kings Cross as well as releasing his own recording project [[Chilled By Nature]]. It included a number of EPs, one-off tracks and collaborations, live performances at The Big Chill festival, and the debut album ''Under One Sun''.

In the mid 80s, he established the [[Cooking Vinyl]] label and recorded 'The Texas Campfire Tapes' with singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked which went to No 1 in the UK Independent album charts. He co-edited the book ''Crossfade - a Big Chill Anthology'' (Serpents Tail). In December 2007, Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin were voted into Time Out's Top 100 ‘movers and shakers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/Pete-Lawrence|title=Pete Lawrence - Virtual Festivals|last=Jasinski|first=Mr|newspaper=Virtual Festivals|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence stood down as a director and shareholder of Chillfest (The Big Chill) in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/09/pete-lawrence-big-chill|title=My greatest mistake: Pete Lawrence|last=Snowdon|first=Graham|date=2010-10-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Lawrence's new project [https://campfireconvention.uk Campfire Convention] launched as a social network and membership based events community. Campfire's aims include :
Building a social movement around values, bringing people together to find common ground, real life meet ups, connections and conversations : campaigning, initiatives and engagement at local level via Campfire Beacons, building resources for reference and activism, pioneering a new journalistic media voice, creating new models for a post-capitalist world which reward engagement and global cultural exchange.

Campfire's first outdoor Convention was in August 2016 in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire which included keynote addresses from their patron Brian Eno and peace activist Scilla Elworthy as well as panels, thinkshops, music, art and yoga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">A '''re-recording''' is a recording produced following a new performance of a work of music. This is most commonly, but not exclusively, by a popular artist or group. It differs from a [[reissue]], which involves a second or subsequent release of a previously-recorded piece of music.

Re-recordings are often produced decades after the original recordings were released, usually under contract terms more favorable to the artists. This is especially common among acts that originally agreed to [[Recording contract|contracts]] that would be considered unfair and exploitative today.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/05/re_recordings_runaway_and_other_classic_songs_redone_in_the_studio_can_we.html| last=Mandl| first=Dave| title=Same old song?

{{Short description|Cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning}}

{{Reading}}

'''Reading''' is the complex [[cognitive process]] of decoding [[symbols]] to derive meaning. 

Success in this process is measured as ''[[reading comprehension]]''. Reading is a means for [[language acquisition]], communication, and sharing [[information]] and ideas. The symbols are typically visual ([[written]] or [[printing|printed]]) but may be tactile ([[Braille]]). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"&gt;De Certeau, Michel. "Reading as Poaching." ''The Practice of Everyday Life''. Trans. Steven F. Rendall. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of [[speech]]) and comprehension. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]].

Other types of reading are not speech based [[writing system]]s, such as music [[Musical notation|notation]] or [[pictograms]]. The common link is the interpretation of [[symbols]] to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of [[Braille]]).

==Overview==
[[File:03282012Casa hogar niñas tlahuac30.JPG|thumb|Volunteer reads to a girl at the [[Casa Hogar de las Niñas]] in [[Mexico City]]]]
Currently most reading is either of the printed word from ink or [[toner]] on paper, such as in a [[book]], [[magazine]], [[newspaper]], [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]], or [[notebook]], or of electronic displays, such as [[computer display]]s, [[television]], [[mobile phone]]s or [[e-reader]]s. [[Handwriting|Handwritten]] text may also be produced using a [[graphite]] [[pencil]] or a [[pen]].
Short texts may be written or [[paint]]ed on an object.

Often the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a [[traffic sign|traffic]] or street sign. A [[slogan]] may be painted on a wall. A text may also be produced by arranging stones of a different color in a wall or road. Short texts like these are sometimes referred to as environmental print.

Sometimes text or images are in [[relief]], with or without using a color contrast. Words or images can be carved in stone, wood, or metal; instructions can be printed in relief on the plastic housing of a [[home appliance]], or myriad other examples.

A requirement for reading is a good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between letters and background (depending on colors of letters and background, any pattern or image in the background, and [[lighting]]) and a suitable font size. In the case of a computer screen, it is important to see an entire line of text without [[scrolling]].

The field of visual word recognition studies how people read individual words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cornelissen PL, Kringelbach ML, Ellis AW, Whitney C, Holiday IE, Hansen PC |title=Activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in the first 200 ms of reading: evidence from magnetoencephalography (MEG) |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5359 |year=2009 |pmid=19396362 |pmc=2671164 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005359|editor1-last=Aleman|editor1-first=André|last2=Kringelbach |last3=Ellis |last4=Whitney |last5=Holliday |last6=Hansen |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.5359C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wheat KL, Cornelissen PL, Frost SJ, Hansen PC |title=During visual word recognition, phonology is accessed within 100 ms and may be mediated by a speech production code: evidence from magnetoencephalography |journal= Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=15 |pages=5229–33 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20392945 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4448-09.2010|pmc=3419470|last2=Cornelissen |last3=Frost |last4=Hansen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nation K |title=Form-meaning links in the development of visual word recognition |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This has revealed that reading is performed as a series of eye [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] with [[saccade]]s between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead pause on some words mentally while their eyes are moving. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The process of recording information to read later is [[writing]]. In the case of computer and [[microfiche]] storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.

Reading is typically an individual activity, though on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners. Reading aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension, is a form of [[intrapersonal communication]]: in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard SC, Coltheart M, Palethorpe S, Castles A |title=Nonword reading: comparing dual-route cascaded and connectionist dual-process models with human data |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1268–88 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22309087 |doi=10.1037/a0026703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed the [[dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud]], accordingly to which there were two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, that are involved in this case, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the [[pronunciation]] of a written stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=coltheart1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Curtis, Brent |author3=Atkins, Paul |author4= Haller, Micheal |title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1993|volume=100|issue=4|pages=589–608|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada J, Imai H, Ikebe Y |title=The use of the orthographic lexicon in reading kana words |journal=J Gen Psychol |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=311–23 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2213002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading to young children is a recommended way to instill language and expression, and to promote comprehension of text. [[Personalised books]] for children are recommended to improve engagement in reading by featuring the child themselves in the story.

Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late [[Middle Ages]], the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Manguel/Silent_Readers.html | title=THE SILENT READERS | website=Alberto Manguel, Chapter 2 of A History of Reading (New York; Viking, 1996) | accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Learning to read}}
[[Literacy]] is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. [[Illiteracy]] is the inability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.
[[Dyslexia]] refers to a cognitive difficulty with reading and writing. It is defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=November 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|archive-date=July 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term dyslexia can refer to two disorders: [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]]&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400|last2=Tschierse |last3=Amunts |last4=Wilms |last5=Vossel |last6=Willmes |last7=Grabowska |last8=Huber }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185–91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umiltà |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anchoring&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading rate===
[[File:Reading speed by age.jpg|thumb|Average reading rate in ''words per minute'' (wpm) depending on age and measured with different tests in English, French and German]]
Many studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED523331.pdf|title=Reading Rate and Comprehension|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|date=August 2011|website=ERIC:ED523331}}&lt;/ref&gt;Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age,&lt;ref&gt;''Im Auge des Lesers, foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung: vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude''(2006), ppgs. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension test. The reading test by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais ("L'alouette", published in 1967) tested reading aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Carver, Ronald P. |title=Reading rate: a review of research and theory |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-162420-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the data from Taylor (English) and Landerl (German) are based on texts of increasing difficulty; other data were obtained when all age groups were reading the same text.

Rates of reading include reading for memorization (fewer than 100 [[words per minute]] [wpm]); reading for learning (100–200 wpm); reading for comprehension (200–400 wpm); and [[skimming (reading)|skimming]] (400–700 wpm). Reading for comprehension is the essence of the daily reading of most people. Skimming is for superficially processing large quantities of text at a low level of comprehension (below 50%).

Advice for choosing the appropriate reading-rate includes reading flexibly, slowing when concepts are closely presented and when the material is new, and increasing when the material is familiar and of thin concept. [[Speed reading]] courses and books often encourage the reader to continually accelerate; comprehension tests lead the reader to believe his or her comprehension is continually improving; yet, competence-in-reading requires knowing that skimming is dangerous, as a default [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method|date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading speed has been used as a measure in research to determine the effect of interventions on human vision.

Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Some argue that this competes with phonics and synthetic phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning to spell.

Other methods of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become somewhat controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Feitelson |first=Dina |title=Facts and Fads in Beginning Reading: A Cross-Language Perspective |year=1988 |publisher=Ablex |location=Norwood, New Jersey, United States |isbn=978-0-89391-507-0 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning to read in a second language, especially in adulthood, may be a different process than learning to read a native language in childhood.
There are cases of very young children learning to read without having been taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Hughes, Diana |author2=Stainthorp, Rhona |title=Learning from children who read at an early age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-415-17495-4 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case with [[Truman Capote]] who reportedly taught himself to read and write at the age of five.

Brain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNorgan C, Alvarez A, Bhullar A, Gayda J, Booth JR |title=Prediction of reading skill several years later depends on age and brain region: implications for developmental models of reading |journal=[[The Journal of Neuroscience]] |volume=31 |issue=26 |pages=9641–8 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21715629 |pmc=3147303 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0334-11.2011 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21715629|last2=Alvarez |last3=Bhullar |last4=Gayda |last5=Booth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that can be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes:
* ''[[Subvocalization|Subvocalized]]'' reading combines sight reading with internal sounding of the words as if spoken. Advocates of speed reading claim it can be a bad habit that slows reading and comprehension, but other studies indicate the reverse, particularly with difficult texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moidel|first=Steve|title=Speed Reading for Business|publisher=Barron's Educational|location=Hauppauge, NY|pages=23–24|isbn=978-0-7641-0401-5|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rayner|first=Keith|others=Pollatsek, Alexander|title=The Psychology of Reading|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1995|pages=192–194|isbn=978-0-8058-1872-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Speed reading]]'' is a collection of methods for increasing reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. Methods include skimming or the [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]] of words in a body of text to increase the rate of reading. It is closely connected to [[speed learning]].
* ''[[Incremental reading]]'' is a software-assisted reading method designed for [[long-term memory|long-term memorization]]. "Incremental reading" means "reading in portions": in each session, parts of several electronic articles are read inside a prioritized reading list. In the course of reading, important pieces of information are extracted and converted into [[flashcard]]s, which are then reviewed by a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.
* ''[[Proofreading]]'' is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting [[typographical]] errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional proofreaders typically acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for some kinds of material than for others, while they may largely suspend comprehension while doing so, except when needed to select among several possible words that a suspected typographic error allows.
* ''Rereading'' is reading a book more than once. "One cannot read a book: one can only reread it," [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once said.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Meyer Spacks (2011). ''On Rereading'', [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-674-06222-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (Cristel Antonia (2012)) found re-reading offers mental health benefits because it allows for a more profound emotional connection and self-reflection, versus the first reading, which is more focused on the events and plot.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Waugh. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2101516/Reading-book-really-better-second-time-round--reading-offer-mental-health-benefits.html "Reading a book really is better the second time round - and can even offer mental health benefits"], ''Daily Mail'', 15 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bookandpencil.png|thumb|250px|mini|right|Many take notes while reading.]]
* ''Structure-proposition-evaluation (SPE)'' method, popularized by [[Mortimer Adler]] in ''[[How to Read a Book]]'', mainly for non-fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three passes: (1) for the structure of the work, which might be represented by an outline; (2) for the logical propositions made, organized into chains of inference; and (3) for evaluation of the merits of the arguments and conclusions. This method involves [[suspended judgment]] of the work or its arguments until they are fully understood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''Survey-question-read-recite-review ([[SQ3R]])'' method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading toward being able to teach what is read, and is appropriate for instructors preparing to teach material without referring to notes.
{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Multiple intelligences]]''-based methods, which draw on the reader's diverse ways of thinking and knowing to enrich appreciation of the text. Reading is fundamentally a linguistic activity: one can basically comprehend a text without resorting to other intelligences, such as the visual (e.g., mentally "seeing" characters or events described), auditory (e.g., reading aloud or mentally "hearing" sounds described), or even the logical intelligence (e.g., considering "what if" scenarios or predicting how the text will unfold based on context clues). However, most readers already use several kinds of intelligence while reading. Doing so in a more disciplined manner—i.e., constantly, or after every paragraph—can result in a more vivid, memorable experience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP)'' reading involves presenting the words in a sentence one word at a time at the same location on the display screen, at a specified eccentricity. RSVP eliminates inter-word saccades, limits intra-word saccades, and prevents reader control of fixation times (Legge, Mansfield, &amp; Chung, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Legge GE, Mansfield JS, Chung ST |title=Psychophysics of reading. XX. Linking letter recognition to reading speed in central and peripheral vision |journal=Vision Research |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=725–43 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11248262 |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(00)00295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP controls for differences in reader eye movement, and consequently is often used to measure reading speed in experiments.
Reading process is therefore a communication context.

==Assessment==

===Types of tests===
* Sight word reading: reading words of increasing difficulty until they become unable to read or understand the words presented to them. Difficulty is manipulated by using words that have more letters or syllables, are less common and have more complicated spelling–sound relationships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Nonword reading: reading lists of pronounceable nonsense words out loud. The difficulty is increased by using longer words, and also by using words with more complex spelling or sound sequences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k12academics.com/educational-psychology/reading-activity/reading-assessment#.WKHjtneZNo4|title=Reading Assessment - K12 Academics|first=Chris|last=Glavin|date=6 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reading comprehension: a passage is presented to the reader, which they must read either silently or out loud. Then a series of questions are presented that test the reader's comprehension of this passage.
* Reading fluency: the rate with which individuals can name words.
* Reading accuracy: the ability to correctly name a word on a page.

Some tests incorporate several of the above components at once. For instance, the [[Nelson-Denny Reading Test]] scores readers both on the speed with which they can read a passage, and also their ability to accurately answer questions about this passage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Recent research has questioned the validity of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, especially with regard to the identification of reading disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Coleman C, Lindstrom J, Nelson J, Lindstrom W, Gregg KN |title=Passageless comprehension on the Nelson-Denny reading test: well above chance for university students |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=244–9 |year=2010 |pmid=19933897 |doi=10.1177/0022219409345017|last2=Lindstrom |last3=Nelson |last4=Lindstrom |last5=Gregg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Nigth reading.JPG|thumb|Night reading has benefits to calm the nerves by eliminating excess sound and vision stimulus resulting in better sleep.]]

===Lighting===
Reading from paper and from some screens requires more [[lighting]] than many other activities. Therefore, the possibility of doing this comfortably in [[café]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[bus]]es, at [[bus stop]]s or in [[park]]s greatly varies depending on available lighting and time of day.

Reading from screens that produce their own light does not depend on external light, except that external light may lessen visual fatigue. For controlling what is on the screen ([[scrolling]], turning the page, etc.), a [[touch screen]] or [[Keyboard (computing)#Illumination|keyboard illumination]] further reduces dependency on external light.

==History==
[[File:Men reading the Koran in Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Syria.jpg|thumb|Men reading]]
The history of reading dates back to the [[History of writing|invention of writing]] during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading [[printing|print]] text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With [[Literacy#Ancient and medieval literacy|some exceptions]], only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered [[Literacy|literate]] before the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included [[classical Athens]] and the Islamic [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Delivering Education|author = Andrew J. Coulson|page = 117|publisher = [[Hoover Institution]]|url = http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817928928_105.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars assume that reading aloud (Latin ''clare legere'') was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (''legere tacite'' or ''legere sibi'') was unusual.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"&gt;Carruthers, Mary. 2008. ''The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture''. 2nd. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 212 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] remarks on [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]]'s unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jajdelska, Elspeth. 2007. ''Silent Reading and the Birth of the Narrator''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Reading has no concrete laws, but lets readers escape to produce their own products introspectively, promoting deep exploration of texts during interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society—and viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt; Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product. [[Michel de Certeau]] argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt;

In 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one—and as [[sleeping]] increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers—especially women—could escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mavrody|first1=Nika|title=The Dangers of Reading in Bed|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/reading-in-bed/527388/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rosia Water Tanks''' were large [[water tank]]s built at the turn of the nineteenth century at [[Rosia Bay, Gibraltar|Rosia Bay]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of  [[Gibraltar]]. They were constructed based on the recommendation by [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent]] that the [[Victualling Yard, Gibraltar|Victualling Yard]] complex be relocated to Rosia Bay. The complex allowed [[Royal Navy]] vessels to obtain both food and water at one site. The Rosia Water Tanks remained in the possession of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] until 2004, at which time they were transferred to the [[Government of Gibraltar]]. Despite local and international criticism, and a court case brought by the [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust]], the tanks were demolished in 2006 to make way for affordable housing. When developer [[OEM International]]'s funding proved insufficient to complete the project the government repossessed the site.

The Rosia Water Tanks consisted of six parallel underground chambers built by contractor [[Giovanni Maria Boschetti]] adjacent to the Victualling Yard of bricks brought from Britain and sand-lime mortar, then waterproofed. The roofs of the Victualling Yard served as a catchment directing rain to a settlement tank, which was then purified by flowing it successively from one tank to the next.

The Rosia Water Tanks were utilised by the Ministry of Defence until April 2004, at which time they were transferred to the Government of Gibraltar. The Gibraltar Heritage Trust sought a legal remedy when the government planned to demolish the tanks and construct a building offering affordable housing, [[Nelson's View]], and underground car parking at the site. During a visit permitted by the courts in January 2006, historian [[Lionel Culatto]] assessed the tanks and found them to be in good condition.&lt;ref name=gsda/&gt;&lt;ref name=sal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Supreme Court of Gibraltar|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/115426454/IN-THE-SUPREME-COURT-OF-GIBRALTAR|work=docstoc.com|publisher=The Supreme Court of Gibraltar|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=19 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly thereafter, the Gibraltar Heritage Trust voted to drop its court case due to fears of the mounting legal costs. The vote prompted the resignations of the trust's chairman, [[Joe Ballantine]], and another board member, Denis King, and also called into question the ability of the Gibraltar Heritage Trust to accomplish its stated mission.&lt;ref name=noonan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chairman of Heritage Trust resigns over Rosia Tanks issue|url=http://www.panorama.gi/localnews/headlines.php?action=view_article&amp;article=603|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=Panorama}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heritage Trust should RESIGN!|url=http://www.panorama.gi/localnews/headlines.php?action=view_article&amp;article=578|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=Panorama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, [[Marcus Binney]], Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and Architecture Correspondent of ''[[The Times]]'', wrote about the controversy. In his column, "Nelson caves to be turned into a car park," Binney reported that:&lt;ref name=sal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rosia Tanks issue hits UK headlines|url=http://www.panorama.gi/localnews/headlines.php?action=view_article&amp;article=597|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=Panorama}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Under heavy pressure from the Gibraltar Government and the Irish development company OEM International, the Gibraltar Heritage Trust withdrew last week an injunction delaying the construction of a block of 200 flats on top of the Rosia Water Tanks.}}

Dr. [[Ann Coats]], Secretary of the [[Naval Dockyards Society]] and author of ''History of the Rosia Water Tanks, Gibraltar'', described the Rosia Water Tanks as:&lt;ref name=sal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Rosia Water Tanks, Gibraltar|year=2005|publisher=Naval Dockyards Society|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_Rosia_Water_Tanks_Gibralt.html?id=1m3WSAAACAAJ|author=Ann Coats|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|A unique engineering monument to Royal Navy ingenuity and Gibraltarian craftsmanship, transforming Gibraltar into an invincible fortress.

[[Jonathan Coad]], also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, is with [[English Heritage]]. The author of ''The Royal Dockyards 1690-1850'', he is considered to be a preeminent authority on Royal Naval Dockyard architecture.&lt;ref name=sal/&gt;&lt;ref name=vox/&gt; He contacted the Naval Dockyards Society, expressing his dismay over "the destruction of the vaulted underground storage tanks, which were a remarkable construction feat", and continued that "equally serious will be the impact of the multi-storey building upon the enclosure of the Victualling Yard which will seriously affect the whole setting of this remarkable enclave and destroy the intimate scale of this area."&lt;ref name=sal/&gt;&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;

On 3 February 2006, the Government of Gibraltar issued a press release in which it acknowledged that the Nelson's View Development at the Rosia Water Tanks site had been awarded to the developer (OEM International) without a bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by the Government relating to the Nelson’s View Development at Rosia Tank |url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2006/Rosia_Tanks.pdf |work=gibraltar.gov.gi |publisher=Government of Gibraltar |accessdate=15 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521180249/http://gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2006/Rosia_Tanks.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the government repossessed the affordable housing project, initially claiming that it was to protect home purchasers from delays related to litigation.

== Malaysian/Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word ''meng-âmuk'', which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hempel A. A., Levine R. D., Meloy J. D., Westermeyer J.

H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah". Retrieved March 30, 2013 from PsychINFO. [http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=a71ca420-96ff-40e4-be67-3ac88801c158%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-01643-010]&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that amok was caused by the ''hantu belian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu: hantu belian|url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=hantu+belian|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=Malaysia|language=Malay, English|quote=hantu belian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 | doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the cultures of [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Culture of Brunei|Brunei]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=181064|year=1999|author1=Saint Martin|first1=M. L.|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–70|pmid=15014687|doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464 |title=Definition of Amok |publisher=Medterms.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218053501/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html#|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms ''[[going postal]]'' or ''going ballistic'' are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "[[suicide by cop]]".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid15014687"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= 10.4088/pcc.v01n0302|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1427677"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''[[Berserker]]'', the ''cafard'' or ''cathard'' (Polynesia), ''mal de pelea'' (Puerto Rico), and ''iich'aa'' (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf |title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. [[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.&lt;ref name=Hurley14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[Berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], some notable cases have occurred among the [[Rajputs]]. In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amuck, Running|volume=1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hobbit''''' is a [[film series]] consisting of three [[high fantasy]] [[adventure films]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. They are based on the 1937 novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to ''[[The Return of the King]]'', which expand on the story told in ''The Hobbit'', as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. Together they act as a [[prequel]] to Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. The films are subtitled ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' (2012), ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'' (2013), and ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Jackson retitles The Hobbit part three The Battle of the Five Armies |first=Ben |last=Child |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/peter-jackson-hobbit-battle-of-the-five-armies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay was written by [[Fran Walsh]], [[Philippa Boyens]], Jackson, and [[Guillermo del Toro]], who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of [[Middle-earth]] sixty years before the beginning of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and follow [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] ([[Martin Freeman]]), who is convinced by the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] ([[Ian McKellen]]) to accompany [[Characters in The Hobbit#Thorin's Company|thirteen dwarves]], led by [[Thorin Oakenshield]] ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]), on a quest to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] from the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] (voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at [[Dol Guldur]], and the pursuit of [[Azog]] and [[Bolg]], who seek vengeance against Thorin and [[Durin's folk|his kindred]].

The films feature an [[ensemble cast]] that also includes [[James Nesbitt]], [[Ken Stott]], [[Evangeline Lilly]], [[Lee Pace]] and [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]], with several actors reprising their roles from ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], and [[Andy Serkis]]. The films also feature [[Manu Bennett]], [[Sylvester McCoy]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Mikael Persbrandt]], [[Barry Humphries]], and [[Lawrence Makoare]]. Also returning for production, among others, were illustrators [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]] and [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], art director [[Dan Hennah]], cinematographer [[Andrew Lesnie]], and composer [[Howard Shore]], while props were again crafted by [[Weta Workshop]], with visual effects managed by [[Weta Digital]].

The first film in the series premiered at the [[Embassy Theatre, Wellington|Embassy Theatre]] in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on [[Courtenay Place, Wellington|Courtenay Place]], and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and [[Streaming media|streamed over the Internet]]. The second film of the series premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 1 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2014/12/01/95286-weve-got-you-covered-for-the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-world-premiere/|title = We’ve got you covered for ‘The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies’ world premiere!|date = 1 December 2014|accessdate = 18 December 2014|website = The One Ring|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series|one of the highest-grossing film series]] of all time, and earned more money than ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. Although critically considered to be inferior to ''The Lord of the Rings,'' it was nominated for various awards and won several, though not as many as its predecessor series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey| accessdate = 12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_desolation_of_smaug/| accessdate = 12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_battle_of_the_five_armies/| accessdate = 12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===First stages of development===
Jackson and Walsh originally expressed interest in filming ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1995, then envisaging it as part one of a trilogy (part two would have been based on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').{{Sfn | Sibley | 2006 |pp = 313–16}}  Frustration arose when Jackson's producer, [[Harvey Weinstein]], discovered that [[Saul Zaentz]] had production rights to ''The Hobbit'', but that distribution rights still belonged to [[United Artists]] (which had kept those rights, believing that filmmakers would prefer to adapt ''The Hobbit'' rather than ''The Lord of the Rings'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Thomas ‘Tom’ | last = Ambrose|title=The Return of the Ring|work= [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=March 2009|page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Artists studio and its parent corporation [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]  was [[United Artists#The 2000s|for sale in 2005]], but Weinstein's attempts to buy the movie rights from the studio were unsuccessful. Weinstein asked Jackson to press on with adapting ''The Lord of the Rings''.{{Sfn | Sibley | 2006 |pp = 323–25}}  Ultimately, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was produced by [[New Line Cinema]], not the Weinsteins, and their rights to film ''The Hobbit'' were set to expire in 2010.&lt;ref name="peace"&gt;{{cite news | first = Benjamin | last = Svetkey | title = ''The Hobbit'': Peace in Middle-Earth? |work= Entertainment Weekly | date = 4 October 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20036782_20037403_20142132,00.html | accessdate = 5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, the new ownership and management of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] expressed interest in teaming up with New Line and Jackson to make ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Stax | title = MGM Eyes Hobbit, T4 | work = [[IGN]] | date = 11 September 2006 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/732/732006p1.html | accessdate=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Jackson SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Peter Jackson]], the film's director, [[Screenwriter|co-writer]], and producer.]]
In March 2005, Jackson launched a lawsuit against New Line, claiming he had lost revenue from merchandising, video and computer games releases associated with ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Director sues over Rings profits | publisher =BBC | work = News | date = 2 March 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4312463.stm | accessdate = 17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not seek a specific settlement, but requested an [[audit]] to see whether New Line had withheld money owed him.&lt;ref name="peace" /&gt; Although Jackson wanted it settled before he would make the film,&lt;ref name="peace" /&gt; he felt the lawsuit was minor and that New Line would still let him make ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="action" /&gt; New Line co-founder [[Robert Shaye]] was annoyed with the lawsuit and said in January 2007 that Jackson would never again direct a film for New Line, accusing him of being greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Jackson ruled out of Hobbit film | publisher = BBC | work = News| date= 11 January 2007| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6251099.stm | accessdate = 30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; MGM boss Harry Sloan halted development, as he wanted Jackson to be involved.&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Dade | last1 = Hayes | first2 = Dave| last2 = McNary | title = New Line in Warner's corner |work = Variety | date = 28 February 2008 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981598.html?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1 | accessdate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August, after a string of flops, Shaye tried to repair his relationship with the director. He said, "I really respect and admire Peter and would love for him to be creatively involved in some way in ''The Hobbit''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Patrick | last = Goldstein | title = The big picture: New Line's midlife crisis |work=Los Angeles Times | date = 10 August 2007 | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-goldstein10aug10,0,7800308.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews | accessdate = 17 August 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114044341/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/10/entertainment/et-goldstein10| archivedate = 14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, New Line was fined $125,000 for failing to provide requested accounting documents.&lt;ref name="peace" /&gt;

On 16 December 2007, New Line and MGM announced that Jackson would be executive producer of ''The Hobbit'' and its sequel. The two studios would co-finance the film and the latter studio (via [[20th Century Fox]]) would distribute the film outside North America—New Line's first ever such deal with another major studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Fleming | title = 'Hobbit' back on track as twin bill |work = Variety | date = 18 December 2007 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977891.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each film's budget was estimated at US$150&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;{{cite news | first = Borys | last = Kit | title = Del Toro doubles up for 'Hobbit' |work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = 28 January 2008 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/del-toro-doubles-up-hobbit-103547 | accessdate = 28 January 2008}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; which compares to the US$94&amp;nbsp;million budget for each of the films in Jackson's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. After completion of the merger of New Line Cinema with [[Warner Bros.]] in February 2008, the two parts were announced as scheduled for release in December 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name="merger" /&gt; Producer [[Mark Ordesky]], the executive producer of ''The Lord of the Rings'', planned to return to supervise the prequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Anne | last = Thompson | title = Shaye kept New Line afloat |work = Variety | date = 6 March 2008 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117982001.html?categoryId=2508&amp;cs=1&amp;query=the+hobbit | accessdate = 7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson explained he chose not to direct because it would have been unsatisfying to compete with his previous films.&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt;

In February 2008, the [[Tolkien Estate]] (through [[The Tolkien Trust]], a British charity) and [[HarperCollins Publishers]] filed a suit against New Line for [[breach of contract]] and fraud and demanded $220&amp;nbsp;million in compensation for ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. The suit claimed New Line had only paid the Estate an upfront fee of $62,500, despite the trilogy's gross of an estimated $6&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide from box office receipts and merchandise sales. The suit claimed the Estate was entitled to 7.5% of all profits made by any Tolkien films, as established by prior deals. The suit also sought to block the filming of ''The Hobbit''. The suit was settled in September 2009 for an undisclosed amount. However the Tolkien Trust's 2009 accounts show that it received a payment from New Line Cinema of £24&amp;nbsp;million, (a little over US$38&amp;nbsp;million). This amount was the Trust's estimated share in respect of the gross profit participation due for the films based on "The Lord of the Rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = The Tolkien Trust Accounts for the year ended 5 April 2009| publisher = Charity Commission| pages = 8, 17| url = http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends15/0000273615_ac_20090405_e_c.pdf| accessdate = 26 October 2015| format = PDF| place = United Kingdom| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6V07qzucC?url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends15/0000273615_ac_20090405_e_c.pdf| archivedate = 22 December 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Christopher Tolkien]] said: "The trustees regret that legal action was necessary but are glad that this dispute has been settled on satisfactory terms that will allow the Tolkien Trust properly to pursue its charitable objectives.

===Development with del Toro===
[[File:Guillermo del Toro in 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Guillermo del Toro]] was originally set to direct the film, but left because of ongoing delays. Jackson stated that del&amp;nbsp;Toro's "creative DNA" would remain in the scripts and designs.]]
Despite the legal suits, development proceeded and in April 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro]] was hired to direct the film. Del&amp;nbsp;Toro has said he was a fan of Jackson's trilogy and had discussed directing [[Halo (series)#Live action|a film adaptation of ''Halo'']] with him in 2005. Though that project stalled, they kept in contact.&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt; In a 2006 interview, del&amp;nbsp;Toro was quoted saying "I don't like little guys and [[dragon]]s, hairy feet, [[hobbit]]s .... I don't like sword and sorcery, I hate all that stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.salon.com/ent/audiofile/2006/10/12/conversations_toro/ | title = Conversations: Guillermo del Toro | work = [[Salon.com]] | date = 12 October 2006 | accessdate=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he signed on to direct in April 2008,&lt;ref name="golden" /&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro posted on [[TheOneRing.net]] forums that he had been enchanted by ''The Hobbit'' as a child, but found that Tolkien's other books "contain[ed] geography and genealogy too complex for my prepubescent brain".  In taking the job of director, del&amp;nbsp;Toro was now "reading like a madman to catch up with a whole new land, a continent of sorts—a [[cosmology]] created by brilliant [[philologist]] turned [[Shaman]]".  He also posted that his appreciation of Tolkien was enhanced by his knowledge of the fantasy genre and the folklore research he had undertaken while making his own fantasy films.&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt;

[[Pre-production]] began around August 2008, with del Toro, Jackson, Walsh and [[Philippa Boyens]] writing the scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/08/the-hobbit.html| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024418/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/08/the-hobbit.html| dead-url= yes| archive-date= 28 August 2008| first= Nicole| last= Sperling| title= Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens join Guillermo Del Toro penning ''The Hobbit''| work= Entertainment Weekly| date= 19 August 2008| accessdate= 20 August 2008| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro collaborated with Jackson, Walsh and Boyens via [[videoconferencing]] and flew every three weeks, back and forth from Los Angeles (where some of the designs were done)&lt;ref name="golden" /&gt; to New Zealand to visit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Michael | last = Fleming | title = Guillermo Del Toro booked thru 2017 | work = Variety |date=3 September 2008 |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991560.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | accessdate =6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro spent his mornings writing and afternoons looking at material related to Tolkien to help him understand the writer's work. He watched [[World War I]] documentaries and asked for book recommendations from Jackson, who is a collector of World War I memorabilia.

Del Toro said that he interpreted ''The Hobbit'' as being set in a "world that is slightly more golden at the beginning, a very innocent environment", and that the film would need to "[take] you from a time of more purity to a darker reality throughout the film, but [in a manner] in the spirit of the book".&lt;ref name="golden" /&gt; He perceived the main themes as loss of innocence, which he likened to the experience of England [[Aftermath of World War I|after World War I]], and greed, which he said [[Smaug]] and [[Thorin Oakenshield]] represent.&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt; [[Bilbo Baggins]] reaffirms his personal morality during the story's third act as he encounters Smaug and the Dwarves' greed.&lt;ref name="dinner"&gt;{{Cite news| first = Joe | last = Utichi|title=Guillermo del Toro&amp;nbsp;– RT's Dinner and the Movies Interview | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=11 July 2008|url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/dinner_and_the_movies/news/1739826/guillermo_del_toro_rts_dinner_and_the_movies_interview | accessdate =12 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "The humble, sort of a sturdy moral fibre that Bilbo has very much represents the idea that Tolkien had about the little English man, the average English man",&lt;ref name="narration" /&gt; and the relationship between Bilbo and Thorin would be the heart of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Shawn | last = Adler | title = Director Guillermo Del Toro Answers Your ‘Hobbit’ Questions | publisher = MTV | work = Movies | format = blog | date = 2 July 2008 | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/07/02/director-guillermo-del-toro-answers-your-hobbit-questions/ | accessdate= 2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] will also be less solemn.&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt;

Del Toro also wanted the animals to speak so that Smaug's speech would not be incongruous, though he explained portraying the talking animals would be more about showing that other characters can understand them.&lt;ref name="dinner"/&gt; Smaug would not have a "snub [[Simian]] [mouth] in order to achieve a dubious lip-synch".&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro stated that Smaug would be the first character design begun and the last to be approved.&lt;ref name="wardocs" /&gt;

Del Toro and Jackson considered the sudden introduction of [[Bard the Bowman]] and Bilbo's unconsciousness during [[the Battle of the Five Armies]] to be "less cinematic moments" reminiscent of the novel's greater "fairy tale world" than ''The Lord of the Rings'', and they would change them to make ''The Hobbit'' feel more like the trilogy. However, del&amp;nbsp;Toro did say he considered some of these moments iconic and would require the "fairy tale logic [to] work as is".&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

Several actors were considered by del Toro for roles in the film. He wrote the part of [[Beorn]] specifically for American actor [[Ron Perlman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Perlman Talks The Hobbit, Hong Kong Butterfly and More!| type = interview | url = http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2010/12/01/exclusive-ron-perlman-interview/ | date= 1 December 2010| accessdate= 8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro had originally considered asking Perlman to voice the dragon [[Smaug]], but decided against this.&lt;ref name="theonering.net"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/unexpectedpartychat/ |title= Welcome to the 'Unexpected Party' chat... blog... log... thing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro met with English actor [[Brian Blessed]] to discuss the possibility of him playing [[Thorin Oakenshield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= My customer | title = The Hobbit: Brian Blessed reveals casting discussions |url = http://www.mycustomer.com/topic/brian-blessed/114935|access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director later stated that he thought [[Ian McShane]] "would make the most perfect dwarf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| location = UK | url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/cheltenham-festival/article2747454.ece | title = Guillermo del Toro, dark lord of Hollywood| first =Chris | last = Ayres| work = The Times | date = 2 October 2010|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent del&amp;nbsp;Toro collaborator [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] said that he would love to play the Elvenking [[Thranduil]], but del&amp;nbsp;Toro later stated that he had another role (or roles) in mind for the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.popeater.com/2010/07/04/hobbit-movie-release/|title='Hobbit' Fans Have Long Road to Final Release | date = 30 June 2008 | accessdate = 8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro was the one who originally pushed to cast [[Sylvester McCoy]] as [[Radagast the Brown]], a choice Peter Jackson later followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2011/05/06/44141-sylvester-mccoy-talks-radagast-casting-besides-other-hobbit-stuff/ |title = Sylvester McCoy Talks Radagast Casting (Besides Other Hobbit Stuff) | publisher = The One Ring net| date= 6 May 2011| accessdate = 8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While del&amp;nbsp;Toro initially wanted [[Ian Holm]] to reprise the role of [[Bilbo Baggins]], he also said that he "absolutely" supported the casting of [[Martin Freeman]] as the character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.totalfilm.com/news/del-toro-backs-martin-freeman| title = Del Toro backs Martin Freeman| publisher= Total Film | first = Sam | last = Ashurst |date= 27 October 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted all other returning ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' characters to be played by the original actors where possible.&lt;ref name="theonering.net" /&gt;

In December 2012, Philippa Boyens expressed regret that del Toro's version of the film remained unmade.

===Del Toro's departure===
In 2010, del Toro left the project because of ongoing delays. On 28 May he explained at a press conference that owing to MGM's financial troubles the ''Hobbit'' project had then not been officially [[green-light|green-lit]] at the time. "There cannot be any start dates until the MGM situation gets resolved .... We have designed all the creatures. We've designed the sets and the wardrobe. We have done [[animatics]] and planned very lengthy action sequences. We have scary sequences and funny sequences and we are very, very prepared for when it's finally triggered, but we don't know anything until MGM is solved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | type = interview | title = Guillermo del Toro on Splice | url = http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=15329 | publisher = Shock Till You Drop | accessdate = 29 May 2010 | date = 28 May 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100530065530/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=15329 | archivedate = 30 May 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =Silas | last = Lesnick |title=Guillermo del Toro Confirms Hobbit Delay | url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=66472 | work= Coming Soon | accessdate= 29 May 2010 | date = 28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, del&amp;nbsp;Toro announced at [[TheOneRing.net]] that "In light of ongoing delays in the setting of a start date for filming", he would "take leave from helming", further stating that "the mounting pressures of conflicting schedules have overwhelmed the time slot originally allocated for the project. ...

However, this incident received negative reaction from many ''Hobbit'' fans, who were angry at MGM for delaying the project. They also tried willing the studio to sell their rights to Warner Bros. On 27 July, del&amp;nbsp;Toro responded to these angry fans, saying that "it wasn't just MGM.

Partly out of fear for the [[Tolkien tourism]] effect, on 25 October 2010, thousands of New Zealanders organised [[Demonstration (people)|protest rallies]] imploring that production remain in New Zealand, arguing that shifting production to locations outside New Zealand would potentially cost the country's economy up to $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Rallies"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSGE69O04920101025 | title= New Zealand's Hobbit crisis spurs national rallies | agency= Reuters | date = 25 October 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two days of talks with the New Zealand government (including involvement by Prime Minister [[John Key]]), Warner Bros. executives decided on 27 October to film ''The Hobbit'' in New Zealand as originally planned. In return, the government agreed to introduce legislation to remove the right of workers to organise [[trade unions]] in the film production industry and to give money to big budget films made in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= |title=New Zealand Reaches Deal to Keep 'Hobbit' at Home | first =Jonathan | last = Hutchison | newspaper= The New York Times | date= 27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| location = United Kingdom | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11633724 | title= The Hobbit will be made in New Zealand, PM confirms | publisher = BBC | date= 27 October 2010|work= News|accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/27/the-hobbit-deal-new-zealand |title=Hobbit deal costs New Zealand changes in labour laws and $25m tax break | date= 27 October 2010 | newspaper= The Guardian | accessdate= 27 October 2010 | location= London| first= Xan | last = Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation reversed a decision by the New Zealand Supreme Court called ''[[Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2005] NZSC 34&lt;/ref&gt; holding that under the [[Employment Relations Act 2000]], a model maker named Mr Bryson was an "employee" who could organise a union to defend his interests. The Employment Relations (Film Production Work) Amendment Bill passed all three readings under urgency on 29 October 2010, 66 votes in favour to 50 opposed. The government's legislation has been criticised as breaching the [[International Labour Organization]]'s core [[ILO Convention 87]] on [[freedom of association]], and giving an unfair subsidy to protect multinational business interests.&lt;ref&gt;See B Walker and R Tipples,  [http://voicesatwork.org.uk/files/2011/06/Walker-Tipples-VAW-Conference-2012_07_02.pdf 2012 Voiceless Actors?

Some have subsequently called the price (further financial subsidies and specific laws made for the producers' benefit) that New Zealand had to pay to retain the movie 'extortionate'. It was also argued that the discussion had occurred in a climate of 'hyperbole and hysteria'.&lt;ref name="EXTORT"&gt;{{Cite news| type =Editorial | title = Price to keep Hobbit in NZ is extortionate|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10683762 |accessdate=15 May 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, emails and documents released under orders of the [[Office of the Ombudsman (New Zealand)|Ombudsman]] showed that the union representing actors had already reached an agreement with Warner two days before 20 October protest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Hobbit-files-released/tabid/1607/articleID/288190/Default.aspx| work=3 News NZ| title=Hobbit files released| date=26 February 2013| access-date=28 February 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003946/http://www.3news.co.nz/Hobbit-files-released/tabid/1607/articleID/288190/Default.aspx| archive-date=3 December 2013| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10867898|work=NZ Herald|title= The Hobbit documents released: Jackson's frustrations revealed| date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Warner refused to confirm the deal publicly.

===From two to three films===
The project had been envisaged as two parts since 2006, but the proposed contents of the parts changed during development. [[MGM]] expressed interest in a second film in 2006, set between ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hobbit, Crown, Panther News | work = [[IGN]] | date = 14 November 2006 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746019p1.html | accessdate =17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson concurred, stating that "one of the drawbacks of ''The Hobbit'' is its relatively lightweight compared to ''LOTR'' [''The Lord of the Rings''] .... There's a lot of sections in which a character like Gandalf disappears for a while&amp;nbsp;– he references going off to meet with the [[White Council]], who are actually characters like [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman]] and people that we see in ''Lord of the Rings''. He mysteriously vanishes for a while and then comes back, but we don't really know what goes on."&lt;ref name="action"&gt;{{cite news | first = Stephen ‘Steve’ | last = Daly | title = Action Jackson | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = 22 September 2006 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1538494,00.html | accessdate= 5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was also interested in showing [[Gollum]]'s journey to [[Mordor]] and [[Aragorn]] setting a watch on the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first= Eric | last = Vespe | title = Quint and Peter Jackson talk The Hobbit and a potential return to low budget horror!!!| work = [[Ain't It Cool News]]| date = 8 October 2008| url= http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30085 | accessdate = 8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his hiring in 2008, del Toro confirmed the sequel would be about "trying to reconcile the facts of the first movie with a slightly different point of view. You would be able to see events that were not witnessed in the first."&lt;ref name="european" /&gt; He also noted the story must be drawn from only what is mentioned in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', as they do not have the rights to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=News of the Week|work=[[Sci Fi Weekly]]|date=7 July 2008|url = http://www.scifi.com/sfw/news/sfw_news_20080707.html |accessdate=30 September 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822144859/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/news/sfw_news_20080707.html |archivedate =22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del&amp;nbsp;Toro also added (before writing began) that if they could not find a coherent story for the second film, they would just film ''The Hobbit'', stating "''The Hobbit'' is better contained in a single film and kept brisk and fluid with no artificial 'break point'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author-link = Guillermo del Toro | first = Guillermo | last = del Toro| title= 2 centavos| publisher= The One Ring net | type = forum |date=26 May 2008|url= http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?post=101653;guest=3666153#101653 |accessdate= 1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2008, he acknowledged that the book was more detailed and eventful than people may remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=7125 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221004732/http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=7125| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | first =AC | last = Ferrante|title=Guillermo del Toro updates about ''The Hobbit'' status|work=iF Magazine|date= 12 November 2008 | accessdate= 12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to abandon the "bridge film" concept, feeling that it would be better for the two parts to contain only material from ''The Hobbit'':
{{quote|when you lay out the cards {{sic|fr|o}} the story beats contained within the book (before even considering any {{sic|ap|endix}} material) the work is enormous and encompasses more than one film. That's why we are thinking of the two instalments as parts of a single narrative. That's why I keep putting down the use of a "bridge" film (posited initially). I think the concept as such is not relevant any more. I believe that the narrative and characters are rich enough to fit in two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink = Guillermo del Toro | first = Guillermo | last = del Toro |title=Hola|publisher=The One Ring net|date=8 November 2008|url = http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?post=147373;#147373 |accessdate=25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Del Toro said that he was faced with two possible places to split the story,&lt;ref name="twobreaks" /&gt; including Smaug's defeat. He noted the second film would need to end by leading directly into ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/10/07/hobbit-films-will-be-one-continuous-journey-promises-guillermo-del-toro/ | title = 'Hobbit' Films Will Be One 'Continuous Journey,' Promises Guillermo Del Toro | first = Shawn | last = Adler | publisher = MTV | work = Movies | type = blog | date = 7 October 2008 | accessdate = 8 October 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081009105005/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/10/07/hobbit-films-will-be-one-continuous-journey-promises-guillermo-del-toro/ | archivedate = 9 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, del&amp;nbsp;Toro revealed he had decided where to divide the story based on comments from fans about signifying a change in Bilbo's relationship with the dwarves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Eric | last = Ditzian | title = Guillermo Del Toro Rules Out Directing 'Hobbit' Bridge Film | publisher = MTV | work = Movies | type = blog | date = 5 June 2009 | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/06/05/exclusive-guillermo-del-toro-rules-out-directing-hobbit-bridge-film/ | accessdate = 8 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090608142440/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/06/05/exclusive-guillermo-del-toro-rules-out-directing-hobbit-bridge-film | archivedate = 8 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second film's story would also have depended on how many actors could have reprised their roles.&lt;ref name="webchat" /&gt;

Although ''The Hobbit'' was originally made as a two-part film, on 30 July 2012, Jackson confirmed plans for a third film, turning his adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' into a trilogy.&lt;ref name="THR30712"&gt;{{cite news| first =Zakarin | last = Jordan |date=30 July 2012 |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-confirmed-355817 |title=Third 'Hobbit' Film Confirmed |work= The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PJFB30712"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Peter |authorlink= Peter Jackson | date= 30 July 2012 | url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/an-unexpected-journey/10151114596546558 | title = An unexpected journey |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jackson, the third film would make extensive use of the appendices that Tolkien wrote to expand the story of Middle-Earth (published in the back of ''The Return of the King''). While the third film, which as its title indicates, depicts the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], largely made use of footage originally shot for the first and second films, it required additional filming as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://screenrant.com/hobbit-3-peter-jackson/ |title='The Hobbit 3' Edges Closer to Production | publisher =ScreenRant |last=Outlaw |first=Kofi |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second film was retitled ''The Desolation of Smaug'' and the third film was titled ''There and Back Again'' in August 2012.&lt;ref name="McClintock"&gt;{{cite news| last= McClintock|first= Pamela| title= Third 'Hobbit' Film Sets Release Date |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-sets-release-367258 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=31 August 2012 |date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2014, the third film was renamed ''The Battle of the Five Armies''. On the title change, Jackson said, "''There and Back Again'' felt like the right name for the second of a two film telling of the quest to reclaim Erebor, when Bilbo's arrival there, and departure, were both contained within the second film. But with three movies, it suddenly felt misplaced—after all, Bilbo has already arrived "there" in the ''Desolation of Smaug''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hobbit-third-movie-renamed-hobbit-battle-five-armies-1445943 |title=Hobbit Third Movie Renamed The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies |last=Skipper |first=Ben  |date=24 April 2014 |website= |publisher=[[International Business Times]] UK |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaun Gunner, the chairman of [[The Tolkien Society]], supported the decision: "‘''The Battle of the Five Armies''’ much better captures the focus of the film but also more accurately channels the essence of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/blog/2014/04/the-battle-of-the-five-armies-is-the-right-name-for-the-third-hobbit-film/ |title=The Battle of the Five Armies is the right name for the third Hobbit film |last=Gunner |first=Shaun  |date=28 April 2014 |website= |publisher=The Tolkien Society |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting==
[[File:Martin Freeman during filming of Sherlock cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Freeman]] was cast as [[Bilbo Baggins|the titular character]].]]
In early October 2010, it was confirmed by the studio that [[Martin Freeman]] had been cast in the role of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. It was revealed that he had earlier been approached by the producers to play a role in the films, but was forced to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts with the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]''. At the time, Freeman was quoted as saying, "[I]f something could be worked out, that would be great. I did it [turned down the role] with a heavy heart, definitely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=29175 |title=Martin Freeman Talks The Hobbit | publisher =Empire Online |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when you come across an actor who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to announce that he is our Hobbit."&lt;ref name="BBC Freeman"&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11604193| title = Martin Freeman to play Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit | date = 22 October 2010| publisher =BBC | work = News|accessdate=24 October 2010 | place = United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in October, it was revealed that several other cast members had joined the project, including [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] as [[Thorin Oakenshield]], [[Graham McTavish]] as [[Dwalin]], [[Aidan Turner]] as [[Kíli]], [[Mark Hadlow]] as [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], [[John Callen]] as [[Óin, son of Gróin|Óin]], [[Stephen Hunter (actor)|Stephen Hunter]] as [[Bombur (Middle-earth)|Bombur]] and [[Peter Hambleton]] as [[Glóin]]. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, "Richard is one of the most exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands."&lt;ref name="BBC Freeman" /&gt; McTavish was quoted on his casting, "I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to ''The Hobbit''. I can't think of anything comparable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/12/09/41267-torn-exclusive-graham-dwalin-mctavish-interview/#more-41267 |title= Exclusive: Graham 'Dwalin' McTavish Interview |publisher=TheOneRing.net |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate= 30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'', resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli."&lt;ref name="AU Dwarves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pop Dwarves" /&gt; On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects [''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'']; he is a fantastic actor.

On his casting Callen stated, "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone.  Given that Óin is almost 200&amp;nbsp;years old I can presume only that it was the age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/11/20/40586-exclusive-getting-to-know-john-callen-aka-oin/#more-40586 |title= Getting to know John Callen aka Óin|publisher=TheOneRing.net |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate= 1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On being cast in the role, Hunter said, "Being cast in ''The Hobbit'' is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original ''Lord of the Rings'' way back when I signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do ''The Hobbit''.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/10/31/39979-torn-exclusive-an-interview-with-stephen-hunterbombur/ |title= Exclusive: an interview with Stephen Hunter/Bombur |publisher = TheOneRing.net |date= 31 October 2010|accessdate= 1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2010, it was revealed that several other cast members had joined the project, including [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Galadriel]], [[Sylvester McCoy]] as [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]], [[Mikael Persbrandt]] as [[Beorn]], [[William Kircher]] as [[Bifur]], [[Ken Stott]] as [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]] and [[Jed Brophy]] as [[Nori (Middle-earth)|Nori]].&lt;ref name="blanchett"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/12/07/41135-torn-exclusive-cate-blanchett-ken-stott-sylvester-mccoy-mikael-persbrandt-join-cast-of-peter-jackson%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cthe-hobbit%E2%80%9D/ |date=7 December 2010|accessdate=7 December 2010|publisher= TheOneRing.net| title = TORN Exclusive: Cate Blanchett, Ken Stott, Sylvester McCoy, Mikael Persbrandt join cast of Peter Jackson’s ‘The Hobbit’}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchett was the first returning cast member from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] to be cast in the films, even though her character does not appear in the novel. On her casting, Jackson said, "Cate is one of my favorite actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films."&lt;ref name="blanchett" /&gt; McCoy, the former ''[[Doctor Who]]'' star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s [[King Lear (2008 TV film)|King Lear]], was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a "wizard" in October 2010,&lt;ref name="cowal"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.dunoon-observer.com/index.php/news/1-news/827-chieftain-confirms-exciting-new-role=%22_blank%22 |title= Cowal Games Exclusive |date= 28 August 2010 |accessdate = 29 August 2010 |agency=Dunoon Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown.&lt;ref name="radagast-brown"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/08/28/38114-sylvester-mccoy-up-for-radagast-the-brown/ |publisher= TheOneRing.net |title=Sylvester McCoy up for Radagast the Brown? |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the production of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, McCoy had been contacted about playing the role of Bilbo and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Ian Holm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Diane | last = Parkes |title=Who's that playing The Mikado? |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=19 September 2008|url = http://www.birminghammail.net/what-is-on-in-birmingham/theatre-in-birmingham/2008/09/19/who-s-that-playing-the-mikado-97319-21855947/ |accessdate=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the casting of Persbrandt, Jackson was quoted as saying, "The role of Beorn is an iconic one and Mikael was our first choice for the part. Since seeing him read for the role we can't imagine anyone else playing this character."&lt;ref name="blanchett" /&gt; On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented "[[Fran Walsh|Fran]] and I have long been fans of Ken's work and are excited he will be joining us on this journey."&lt;ref name="blanchett" /&gt; The casting of Brophy came after his collaboration with Jackson on several films, including ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'', ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|all three ''Lord of the Rings'' films]] as various creatures.

On 7 January 2011, [[TheOneRing.net]] confirmed that [[Elijah Wood]] had joined the cast to reprise his role of [[Frodo Baggins]] in the project. As Frodo hadn't been born during the events of ''The Hobbit'', the inclusion of Frodo indicated that parts of the story would take place shortly before or during the events of ''The Lord of the Rings''. According to TheOneRing.net, "As readers of 'The Hobbit' know, the tale of 'The Downfall of The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit or There and Back Again,' are contained in the fictional '[[Red Book of Westmarch]].' In Peter Jackson's LOTR films, the book is shown on screen and written in by Bilbo and Frodo and handed off to [[Samwise Gamgee]] .... The fictional book and either the telling from it or the reading of it, will establish Frodo in the film experiencing Bilbo's story. Viewers are to learn the tale of 'The Hobbit' as a familiar Frodo gets the tale as well."&lt;ref name="elijahwood"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2011/01/07/41520-elijah-wood-will-be-in-the-hobbit/ |agency=TheOneRing.net |title=Elijah Wood will be in 'The Hobbit' (and we know how!) |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2011, it was confirmed that [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Andy Serkis]] would reprise their respective roles of [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] and [[Gollum]] from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis join cast of The Hobbit|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/ian-mckellen-and-andy-serkis-join-the-hobbit|publisher=Total Film|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both actors were expected to return for their roles McKellen was previously quoted in July 2010 on [[TVNZ]]'s ''[[Good Morning (New Zealand TV series)|Good Morning]]'' that: "I'm not under contract and my time is running out.

On his casting, Jackson said, "Casting these Tolkien stories is very difficult, especially the Elven characters and Lee has always been our first choice for Thranduil. He's going to be great. We loved his performance in a movie called ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'' a few years ago and have been hoping to work with him since.

The films were filmed in 3D using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red]] Epic cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Carlyle| first= Erin|date= 15 December 2012 |title= 'The Hobbit' Director Peter Jackson: How Billionaire Jim Jannard Made The Film Possible| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2012/12/15/the-hobbit-director-peter-jackson-how-billionaire-jim-jannard-made-the-film-possible/|work=[[/Film]]|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a production diary video, 48 Epic cameras were used during the film's production.&lt;ref name="ProductionVideo4" /&gt;  The production employed a specialty rig designed by [[3ality Technica]], using two cameras and a mirror in order to achieve an intraocular effect similar to that of human sight (the distance between the eyes). This is how the depth required for 3D film is achieved.&lt;ref name="ProductionVideo4"&gt;{{cite web|title= Production Video #4|url= http://www.thehobbitblog.com/?p=3933 | publisher = The Hobbit Team|work=The Hobbit Blog|date= 5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Jackson revealed through his Facebook page that he would film ''The Hobbit'' at 48&amp;nbsp;[[Frame rate|fps]] (frames per second) instead of the normal 24&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sciretta| first= Peter|date= 11 April 2011 |title= Peter Jackson Explains Why He's Shooting 'The Hobbit' at 48 Frames Per Second| url = http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-jackson-explains-shooting-the-hobbit-48-frames|work=[[/Film]]|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the films were filmed at a 5K [[image resolution|resolution]], native to the Red Epic cameras, which provides a more detailed picture than the conventional 4K resolution. The films were recorded digitally onto 128 GB [[solid-state drive]]s that fit into the Red Epic camera.&lt;ref name="ProductionVideo4" /&gt;

===Alleged animal abuse===
[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) asked the New Zealand government to investigate allegations that 27 animals used for the film died due to poor living conditions. Claims also include sheep falling into sinkholes, chickens being mauled by unsupervised dogs, a horse falling over a steep embankment, and another one being left on the ground for three hours after being hobbled. PETA says that instead of "vainly defending himself", Peter Jackson should be giving a "firm assurance that this will never happen again". They also called Jackson a "CGI master", stating that he could easily make convincing CGI animals, instead of using actual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/features/the-hobbit-unexpected-cruelty.aspx |title=The Hobbit: Unexpected Cruelty |publisher=PETA.org |date= |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/366227/hobbit-brouhaha-peta-now-demanding-new-zealand-government-probe-animal-abuse-allegations |title=Hobbit Brouhaha: PETA Now Demanding New Zealand Government Probe Animal Abuse Allegations |publisher=E!

Peter Jackson denied these allegations in a press conference hours before the premiere of the first film stating that there was "Absolutely none; no mistreatment, no abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/peter-jackson-again-denies-the-hobbit-animal-cruelty-claims-before-premiere/ |title=Peter Jackson Again Denies Animal Abuse Claim Before Hobbit Premiere |website=Deadline Hollywood |date= |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. also released a statement which joined Peter Jackson in denying the allegations, questioning the timing and claiming the primary source of the allegations could be traced to freelance animal wranglers who had been dismissed by the production over a year earlier "for cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/23/hobbit-animal-abuse-warner-bros/ |first=Ben |last=Child |title=Hobbit animal abuse claims: Warner Bros backs Peter Jackson |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-production==

===Music===
{{Main|Music of The Hobbit film series}}
The music of ''The Hobbit'' film series was composed, produced and (in the case of the first film) orchestrated and conducted by [[Howard Shore]], who scored all three [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' films]]. Recording sessions for the first film began on 20 August 2012, at [[Abbey Road Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On The Hobbit Recording Sessions &amp; Doug Adams’ Book "The Music Of The Hobbit Films"|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2012/08/20/61016-on-the-hobbit-recording-sessions-doug-adams-book-the-music-of-the-hobbit-films/|publisher=[[TheOneRing.net]]|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third films were recorded in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZSO to record Desolation of Smaug soundtrack|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/07/13/75587-nzso-to-record-desolation-of-smaug-soundtrack/|publisher=[[TheOneRing.net]]|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike with the Lord of the Rings, which only received an expanded release after 2005, each Hobbit soundtrack was released in a two-CD, two-hour release. The music features 64-70 new [[Leitmotif|leitmotives]], about 40 leitmotives returning from The Lord of the Rings, and a variety of non-orchestral instruments, including [[bagpipes]], [[didgeridoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and a whole [[Gamelan]] orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Music of The Hobbit film series|music of the Hobbit film series]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The score for ''An Unexpected Journey'' was primarily played by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (as it was for ''The Lord of the Rings''), London Voices and Tiffin' Boys choir, although Jackson and Shore chose the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] (which participated in scoring a large section of the Fellowship of the Ring) to score ''The Desolation of Smaug'' and ''The Battle of the Five Armies''. Additional musicians, including two [[gamelan]] orchestras, and the London Voices and Tiffin' boys choir, augmented the orchestra. Musicians [[Neil Finn]] and [[Ed Sheeran]] contributed to the score as well as some actors including [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] and the cast of dwarves, [[James Nesbitt]] and [[Barry Humphries]] (in the extended edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey – Extended Edition REVIEW|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/11/08/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-extended-edition-review/|publisher=sfx.co.uk|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clara Sanabras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarasanabras.co.uk/project/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/|title=The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - clarasanabras.co.uk|first=|last=alaricking.co.uk|website=clarasanabras.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grace Davidson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/art/rising-soprano-in-waso-ring-quest-ng-ya-372729|title=Rising soprano in WASO ring quest|date=18 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sang the soprano parts.

===Visual effects===
As with [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]], [[Weta Digital]] was involved in the creation of special effects. However, as opposed to ''The Lord of the Rings'', where the actors who played Orcs portrayed them through full-body makeup and prosthetics, many of those actors in ''The Hobbit'' had [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] faces in order to portray them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind the scenes of The Hobbit |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/7932722/Behind-the-scenes-of-The-Hobbit |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the actors who played Orcs in this trilogy portrayed them through [[performance capture]].

===Reaction to high frame rate===
At an industry event screening in April 2012, Peter Jackson showed a ten-minute clip of the film, and the new [[High Frame Rate]] 48 fps format received "an underwhelming reaction at best",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=24 April 2012 |title=CinemaCon 2012: Dim reaction to high-def look of Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit'|url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/04/24/cinemacon-2012-dim-reaction-to-high-def-look-of-peter-jacksons-the-hobbit/ | work = Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that the footage "looked distinctively sharper and more immediate than everything shown before it, giving the 3D smoother movement and crisp sharpness". It also reported that it lost "the cinematic glow of the industry-standard 24 fps" and that "human actors seemed overlit and amplified in a way that many compared to modern sports broadcasts ... and daytime television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= 24 April 2012|title= 'Hobbit' preview divides CinemaCon auds | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053075|work= Variety|accessdate= 26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One projectionist complained that "it looked like a made-for-TV movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 April 2012|title=The Hobbit: first glimpse gets mixed response|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/25/the-hobbit-first-screening-cinemacon|work=The Guardian |accessdate= 26 April 2012|location=London|first=Ben|last=Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Jackson claimed that the poor reception "wasn't particularly surprising" because "it does take you a while to get used to it. Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=29 April 2012|title= Jackson responds to critics| location = United Kingdom | work = News | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17885833 |publisher = BBC | accessdate = 30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as "hyper-real," clear enough to detect "painted sets" and "prosthetic noses".&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter (13 December 2012).

Retrieved 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just takes a while to get used to&amp;nbsp;– still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Examining-criticisms-of-The-Hobbit/tabid/1748/articleID/279188/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Examining criticisms of The Hobbit|date= 5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'' was also released in the current 24 fps standard in many theatres, some of which had not yet switched from film to digital projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-qa-peter-jackson-on-his-return-to-middle-earth-with-%E2%80%98the-hobbit%E2%80%99-and-how-48-frames-can-save-moviegoing/#more-301516 |title= Comic-Con Q&amp;A: Peter Jackson on His Return to Middle Earth with 'The Hobbit' and How 48 Frames Can Save Moviegoing |first= Mike, Jr. |last= Fleming |work= [[Deadline Hollywood]] |date= 15 July 2012 |accessdate= 6 September 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120915114301/http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-qa-peter-jackson-on-his-return-to-middle-earth-with-%E2%80%98the-hobbit%E2%80%99-and-how-48-frames-can-save-moviegoing/#more-301516 |archivedate= 15 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative works===

====Toys====
On 6 October 2011, [[Warner Bros.]] Consumer Products and U.S. toy company The Bridge Direct announced their partnership on worldwide master toy rights for ''The Hobbit'' films.&lt;ref&gt;Graser, Marc (6 October 2011). [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118044008 "WB hops on Bridge Direct"], ''Variety''.&lt;/ref&gt; The toy line will include action figures, playsets and role-play accessories like swords and battle axes representing the characters and weapons in the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=82992|title= Warner Bros.

The first wave of toy products hit store shelves in October 2012, ahead of the release of ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey''. U.S. retailers that carry the toy line include [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Kmart]], and [[Walmart]]. [[Games Workshop]] released miniatures from ''The Hobbit'' as part of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game.  The company has had rights to produce miniatures from the original book for some years but has not released any lines, save for a stand-alone game based on the Battle of Five Armies, with original designs not related to ''The Lord of the Rings'' films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2012/09/24/62227-hobbit-toys-hit-store-shelves-tauriel-revealed/ | title = Hobbit toys hit stores | date = 24 September 2012| work = TheOneRing.net | accessdate = 7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a number of companies were vying for ''The Hobbit'' deal, Warner Bros. Consumer Products awarded the license to Bridge Direct partly because some of its execs and staffers had worked on ''The Lord of the Rings'' toy line during their tenure at other toy companies, including [[Toy Biz]] and [[Play Along]]. The Bridge Direct, run by toy business veteran [[Jay Foreman (businessman)|Jay Foreman]], is best known for toys such as Inkoos activity plush, and the [[Zhu Zhu Pets]] plush line.

On 16 December 2011, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Consumer Products]] and [[Lego]] announced the development of figures and play sets based on the upcoming adaptations of ''The Hobbit'' as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. The launch of the ''[[Middle-earth Lego sets|Lego The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' was released to coincide with the release of the film adaptation's first part in December 2012.&lt;ref name="Lego1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Building Sets Based on Epic Film Trilogy and Forthcoming Theatrical Release Slated for 2012|publisher=[[Lego]] |date=16 December 2011 |url= http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/news-room/2011/december/warner-bros-consumer-products-and-the-lego-group/ |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video games====
Following the expiration in 2008 of [[Electronic Arts]]' license to ''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] acquired the rights to develop a video game based on ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-warner-bros-lording-over-rings-ip/1100-6206033/|title=Lord of the Rings game rights now at Warner Bros | work =Variety |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Guillermo del&amp;nbsp;Toro was set to direct he had stated that a video game, if it were to be made, would not be released to tie-in with ''The Hobbit'' film, but rather after their release. Del&amp;nbsp;Toro had stated that while he would like to be involved in the video game's creation, making it at the same time as the film would complicate things due to a "tight schedule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Andrei | last = Dumitrescu |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Hobbit-Videogame-Not-Arriving-Alongside-Movie-113957.shtml |title= Hobbit Videogame Not Arriving Alongside Movie |publisher=Softpedia |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Warner Bros. confirmed that a ''Hobbit'' video game would be released in 2012, before the first film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Warner's approach to video games is paying off |url= http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-1018-ct-warner-interactive-20111018,0,7733264.story |first=Ben|last=Fritz |date=18 October 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate= 19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the studio did not confirm whether or not the game would be a tie-in with the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Report: ''Lego Batman 2'', ''The Hobbit'' and DC Comic games releasing in 2012 |url= http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/18/report-lego-batman-2-the-hobbit-and-dc-comics-game-in-the-works-for-2012/ |first=Stephany|last=Nunneley |date=18 October 2011 |work= [[VG247]]| accessdate =19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner Brothers developed two free-to-play online strategy games in collaboration with [[Kabam]] for promoting the film series which were ''The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle Earth'' released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] on 8 November 2012 and ''The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age'' playable online on web browsers and as a [[Facebook app]] that was released on 21 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/25/kabam-to-make-social-and-mobile-games-based-on-the-hobbit-film/|title= Kabam to make social and mobile games based on The Hobbit film|author= Dean Takahashi|publisher= [[VentureBeat]]|date= 25 September 2012|accessdate= 26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.technologytell.com/apple/107572/the-hobbit-kingdoms-of-middle-earth-now-out-for-ios-android/|title= The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle Earth now out for iOS, Android|author= Bill Stiteler|publisher= TechnologyTell|date= 8 November 2012|accessdate= 26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vg247.com/2013/03/21/the-hobbit-armies-of-the-third-age-now-available-for-browsers-facebook/|title= The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age now available for browsers, Facebook|author= Stephany Nunneley|publisher= [[VG247]]|date= 21 March 2013|accessdate= 26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monolith Productions]] developed ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.com/ | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120807215035/http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.com/lang_select | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 7 August 2012 | title = Guardians of Middle-earth | publisher = Monolith | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released on 4 December 2012 for [[PlayStation 3]] via the [[PlayStation Network]], and 5 December 2012 for [[Xbox 360]] via [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. ''Guardians of Middle-earth'' delivers a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game set in Middle-earth and crafted specifically for the console systems. Gamers can play in teams of up to 10 players in strategic five versus five competitive multiplayer battle arenas in the epic setting of Middle-earth.  Players can develop and master more than 20 guardians, including Gandalf, Sauron, Gollum and many more, forming memorable and unlikely alliances with and against friends. Gamers can connect via an in-game voice communication system, as well as access a comprehensive online stat and leader board system where they can track friends’ victories and defeats. The game featured tie-ins to the released ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'' motion picture which released on 14 December 2012.

On 25 November, Warner Brothers confirmed ''[[Lego The Hobbit (video game)|Lego The Hobbit]]'' video game. The game's levels only took place in the first two films. The game was released 8 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Luke (25 November 2013).  "[http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/25/lego-the-hobbit-game-could-be-coming-in-2014 LEGO Hobbit Game Confirmed for Spring 2014]." ''[[IGN]]''.  Retrieved 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two video games were developed to coincide with the film's theatrical release.
{{Main|The_Hobbit:_The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies#Video_games|l1=The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies - Fight for Middle Earth}}
A tie-in fighting video game was released simultaneously with the film for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] platforms which received negative reviews from critics and users.
{{Main|Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor}}
''Shadow of Mordor'' was a critically acclaimed [[Action-adventure]] video game released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] &amp; [[Xbox One]] in October 2014 and for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] on 21 November, nearly a week prior to ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' world [[premiere]] in London, on 1 December. The events of the game take place directly after [[Sauron]] fled to [[Mordor]], escaping [[The White Council]], which was shown at the beginning of the film. The game was planned to act as an overlap between The Hobbit and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]].

====Other Versions====
In January 2015 a fan going by the name of "TolkienEditor" recut the three Hobbit films into a single, four-and-a-half-hour film that removed much content that many fans had complained about. Much of this material was seen as superfluous, admittedly added by Jackson at the request of the studio, in order to make the films more appealing to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kottke.org/15/01/the-hobbit-the-tolkien-edit|title=The Hobbit: The Tolkien Edit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was quickly followed by several other fan made editions with different approaches and lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ifdb.fanedit.org/fanedit-search/tag/franchise/lord-of-the-rings/?criteria=2|title=FanEdit.org Lord of the Rings franchise data base.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maple-films.com/jrr-tolkiens-the-hobbit|title=JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit by Maple Films|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitivehobbitcut.tumblr.com/|title=There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale Recut|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehobbitdwarfededition.tumblr.com/|title=The Hobbit: Dwarfed Edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hobbitfanedit.wixsite.com/ironfoot|title=The Hobbit: Ironfoot Edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Swallow's Tail — Series of Catastrophes''''' ({{lang-fr|La queue d'aronde — Série des catastrophes}}) was [[Salvador Dalí]]'s last painting. It was completed in May 1983, as the final part of a series based on the mathematical [[catastrophe theory]] of [[René Thom]].

Thom suggested that in [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional phenomena]], there are seven possible equilibrium surfaces, and therefore seven possible discontinuities, or "elementary catastrophes": [[Catastrophe theory#Fold catastrophe|fold]], [[Catastrophe theory#Cusp catastrophe|cusp]], [[Catastrophe theory#Swallowtail catastrophe|swallowtail]], [[Catastrophe theory#Butterfly catastrophe|butterfly]], [[Catastrophe theory#Hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe|hyperbolic umbilic]], [[Catastrophe theory#Elliptic umbilic catastrophe|elliptic umbilic]], and [[Catastrophe theory#Parabolic umbilic catastrophe|parabolic umbilic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thom, René,|year=1972|title=''Structural stability and morphogenesis. an outline of a general theory of models'', (D.H.Fowler, trans.) (Reading, Mass. London. Benjamin. 1975). Originally published in French as ''Stabilité structurelle et morphogénèse''|publisher=Westview Press {{ISBN|0201406853}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The shape of Dalí’s Swallow’s Tail is taken directly from Thom’s four-dimensional graph of the same title, combined with a second catastrophe graph, the s-curve that Thom dubbed, 'the cusp'.  Thom’s model is presented alongside the elegant curves of a [[cello]] and the instrument’s [[sound hole|f-holes]], which, especially as they lack the small pointed side-cuts of a traditional f-hole, equally connote the mathematical symbol for an integral in [[calculus]]: &lt;math&gt;\int_{}^{}&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Elliott|editor1-last=Ades|editor1-first=Dawn|editorlink1=Dawn Adès|title=Dali|date=2004|publisher=Bompiani Arte|location=Milan|pages=418–421 {{ISBN|0847826732}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1979 speech, ''Gala, Velázquez and the Golden Fleece'', presented upon his 1979 induction into the prestigious [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] of the [[Institut de France]], Dalí described Thom's theory of catastrophes as "the most beautiful aesthetic theory in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Dalí, Salvador, ‘Gala, Velásquez and the Golden Fleece’ (9 May 1979).  Reproduced in-part in: {{cite book|author=Descharnes, Robert|year=1984|title=''Dalí, the Work, the Man''|publisher= New York: Harry N. Abrams, page 420. {{ISBN|0810908255}}}} Originally published in French as ''Dalí, l'oeuvre et l'homme'' (Lausanne: Edita, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;  He also recollected his first and only meeting with René Thom, at which Thom purportedly told Dalí that he was studying [[tectonic plate]]s; this provoked Dalí to question Thom about [[Gare de Perpignan|the railway station at Perpignan]], France (near the Spanish border), which the artist had declared in the 1960s to be the center of the universe.

Thom reportedly replied, "I can assure you that Spain pivoted precisely — not in the area of — but exactly there where the Railway Station in [[Perpignan]] stands today".   Dalí was immediately enraptured by Thom's statement, influencing his painting ''Topological Abduction of Europe — Homage to René Thom'', the lower left corner of which features an equation closely linked to the "swallow’s tail": &lt;math&gt;V = x^5 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx,&lt;/math&gt; an illustration of the graph, and the term ''queue d'aronde''.  The seismic fracture that transverses ''Topological Abduction of Europe'' reappears in ''The Swallow’s Tail'' at the precise point where the y-axis of the swallow's tail graph intersects with the S-curve of the [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]].&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11895">'''Traditional witchcraft''' is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of [[witchcraft]]. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gardner]]ianism and the wider [[Wicca]]n movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205&amp;ndash;206}}

According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the [[Witchcraft (contemporary)#Sabbatic Craft|Sabbatic craft]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, three pseudonymous authors published ''Wicca: The Ancient Way'', in which they used ''traditional witchcraft'' to refer to [[Gardnerian Wicca]].&lt;ref name="DoyleWhite197"&gt;[[#Doy10|Doyle White 2010]]. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cochrane’s Craft ==
Cochrane’s Craft, which is also known as Cochranianism, is a tradition of traditional witchcraft founded in 1951 by the [[English people|English]] Witch [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], who himself claimed to have been taught it by some of his elderly family members, a claim that is disputed by some historians such as [[Ronald Hutton]] and [[Leo Ruickbie]].

Cochranianism revolved around the veneration of the [[Horned God]] and the [[Mother Goddess]], alongside seven [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities which are viewed as children of the God and Goddess. Cochranian Witchcraft has several features that separate it from other traditions such as [[Gardnerian Wicca]], such as its emphasis on [[mysticism]] and [[philosophy]], and Cochrane's attitude that it was not [[Paganism|pagan]], but only based upon paganism.&lt;ref name="Roebuck"&gt;{{cite book | first=Mike | last=Howard | authorlink= | title=The Roebuck in the Thicket: An Anthology of the Robert Cochrane Witchcraft Tradition | publisher = Capall Bann| year=2001}} Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feri Tradition ==
The [[Feri Tradition]] (which is a different tradition than Faery, Fairy, Faerie, or Vicia) is an initiatory tradition of [[Witchcraft]] distinct from Wicca. It is an [[ecstasy (state)|ecstatic]] (rather than [[fertility]]) tradition stemming from the experience of Cora and [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor Anderson]]. Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression.&lt;ref name=Korn&gt;"The Faery Tradition" ©1988, 1995, 2000 Anna Korn&lt;/ref&gt; The Feri Tradition has very diverse influences, such as [[Huna (New Thought)|Huna]], [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], [[Fairy|Faery lore]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]], [[Tantra]], and [[Gnosticism]].

Among the distinguishing features of the Feri tradition is the use of a specific Feri power or energetic current.&lt;ref name=Korn/&gt; Feri witches often see themselves as "fey": outside social definitions and intentionally living within paradox. They believe that much of reality is unseen, or at least has uncertain boundaries. Within the tradition there is a deep respect for the wisdom of nature, a love of beauty, and an appreciation of bardic and mantic creativity.

Core teachings acknowledged by most branches of the tradition include the concepts of the Three Souls and the Black Heart of Innocence, the tools of the Iron and Pearl Pentacle (now commonly also used by [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)]]), as well as an awareness of "energy ecology", which admonishes practitioners to never give away or waste their personal power. Trance experiences and personal connection to the Divine are at the heart of this path, leading to a wide variety of practices throughout the larger body of the tradition.

In his study of Wicca, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White characterised Feri as a "Wiccan" tradition.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=46}} He noted however that some practitioners of modern Pagan Witchcraft restrict the term "Wicca" to [[British Traditional Wicca]], in which case Feri would not be classified as "Wicca"; he deemed this exclusionary definition of the term to be "unsuitable for academic purposes".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=161}} Instead, he characterised Feri as one form of Wicca which is nevertheless distinct from others, such as British Traditional Wicca, [[Dianic Wicca]], and [[Stregheria]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=162}}

== Sabbatic craft ==
{{Anchor|Sabbatic|Sabbatic Craft|Sabbatic witchcraft}}

Sabbatic craft, a term coined by [[Andrew D. Chumbley]], is described as "an initiatory line of spirit-power that can inform all who are receptive to its impetus, and which{{spaced ndash}}when engaged with beyond names{{spaced ndash}}may be understood as a Key unto the Hidden Design of Arte."&lt;ref name="Chumbley2002a"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reserved "Sabbatic Craft" as a unifying term to refer to the "convergent lineages"&lt;ref name="Chumbley2002a"/&gt; of the "Cultus Sabbati," a body of traditional witchcraft initiates.&lt;ref name="Schulke2006"/&gt; 

Chumbley's works and those of Daniel Schulke on the Cultus Sabbati's "ongoing tradition of sorcerous wisdom"&lt;ref name="Chumbley2002b"/&gt; continue to serve as the prototypical reference works. The craft is not an ancient, pre-Christian tradition surviving into the modern age. It is a tradition rooted in "[[cunning-craft]]," a patchwork of older magical practice and later Christian mythology.

{{Quote|‘Sabbatic Craft’ describes a corpus of magical practices which self-consciously utilize the imagery and mythos of the "[[Witches' Sabbath]]" as a cipher of ritual, teaching and gnosis. This is not the same as saying that one practises the self-same rituals in the self-same manner as the purported early modern "witches" or historically attested [[cunning folk]], rather it points toward the fact that the very mythos which had been generated about both "witches" and their "ritual gatherings" has been appropriated and re-orientated by contemporary successors of cunning-craft observance, and then knowingly applied for their own purposes.|[[Andrew D. Chumbley|Andrew Chumbley]] defining Sabbatic Craft&lt;ref name="Chumbley2002a"/&gt;}}

In his [[grimoire]] ''Azoëtia'', Chumbley incorporated diverse iconography from ancient [[History of Sumer|Sumerian]], [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Yezidi]], and [[Aztec]] cultures.&lt;ref name="Schulke2006"/&gt; He spoke of a patchwork of [[veneration of the dead|ancestral]] and [[tutelary spirit|tutelary]] spirit [[folklore]] which he perceived amidst diverse "Old Craft" traditions in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as "a gnostic faith in the Divine Serpent of Light, in the Host of the Gregori, in the Children of Earth sired by the Watchers, in the lineage of descent via Lilith, Mahazael, Cain, Tubal-cain, Naamah, and the Clans of the Wanderers."&lt;ref name="Chumbley2002a"/&gt; Schulke believed that [[folk magic|folk]] and cunning-crafts of Britain absorbed [[multicultural]] elements from "[[Freemasonry]], [[bibliomancy|Bible divination]], [[Romany people|Romany]] charms, and other diverse streams,"&lt;ref name="Schulke2006"/&gt; what Chumbley called "dual-faith observance," referring to a "co-mingling of ‘native’ forms of British magic and [[Christianity]]".&lt;ref name="Schulke2006"/&gt;

Its symbol is a cracked [[egg (biology)|egg]]. Among the themes of the set were [[chicken]], [[dice]] rolling and multiplayer Magic games.&lt;ref name="MILLER"&gt;{{Citation

==History==
''Unglued'' was originally conceived by then-lead Magic designer Joel Mick and fellow designer Bill Rose. Having helped in the creation of many of the expansion sets of the time, they began talking about cards which were cut from the expansion or were unplayable, based on the rules of the game. Thinking this through, they conceptualized an expansion where all the cards had no place in serious games.

''Unglued'' was not entirely a commercially successful expansion, but the unique basic land cards - the only cards from the set legal in tournaments - were and still are valuable. The set also developed a cult following among casual Magic fans, and two sequel sets have been released since, ''[[Unhinged (Magic: The Gathering)|Unhinged]]'' which came out in 2004, and ''[[Unstable (Magic: The Gathering)|Unstable]]'' in 2017.

==Unglued secret message==
All 94 cards in the ''Unglued'' set each had a single word printed on the bottom of the card. Alone these single words made little or no sense but when combined in proper numerical order with other cards in the series spell out the following secret message:

"Here are some cards that didn't make it to print: Socks of [[Richard Garfield|Garfield]], Hot [[Monkey]] Love, [[Kentucky Fried Chicken|Colonel's Secret Recipe]], [[Squeeze play (baseball)|Squee's Play]], Banned in [[France]], [[The Tick|Spoon]], Disrobing Scepter, Butt Wolf, Lotus Roach, [[Sesame Street|Sesame]] [[Efreet]], Needless Reminder Text, [[masturbation|Chicken Choker]], Clockwork Doppelganger, Henway, HELP I'M TRAPPED IN [[Cartamundi|CARTA MUNDI]], [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow]], Poke, Lord of [[Wombat]]s, Gratuitous Babe Art, [[The Brothers' War|Brothers' War]] [[War Bonds|Bonds]], Dwarven Kickboxer, Mickey's Drunk, Pact with the Wastes, CoP:[[Body odor|BO]], Urza's [[Chia Pet]], [[Creatures of Magic: The Gathering#Thallid|Thallid]] [[Salad Shooter|Shooter]], Shoelace, [[When Animals Attack!|When Chihuahuas Attack]], Wall of Cookies, Kobold Ninja, Mucusaur, Kjeldoran Outhouse, Bear in the Woods, Dental [[Creatures of Magic: The Gathering#Thrull|Thrull]], Flavatog, [[Serial killer|Cereal Killer]]."

==Flavor Text==
The [[flavor text]]s of the cards Double Dip, Double Play, Double Deal, Double Take, and Double Cross form the following [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]:

In a duel and taking a lickin'...&lt;br /&gt;
The wizard exclaimed, "I'm no chicken...."&lt;br /&gt;
"I'm facing defeat,..."&lt;br /&gt;
"But the next time we meet,..."&lt;br /&gt;
"You're in for a nasty butt kickin'."

Which fit the mechanics of the cards, as all five not only did something for the player when played, but also created a benefit for him at the beginning of his next game against the same opponent.

A '''vernissage''' (from [[French language|French]], originally meaning “[[varnish]]ing”) is a term used for a preview of an [[art exhibition]], which may be private, before the formal [[Grand opening|opening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vernissage| title=Vernissage | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] | work=Dictionary | year=2010 | accessdate=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the vernissage is not open to the public, but only for invited guests, it is often called a ''[[private view]]''.

At official exhibitions in the nineteenth century, such as the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]], artists would give a finishing touch to their works by varnishing them. The custom of patrons and the élite of visiting the academies during the varnishing day prior to the formal opening of the exhibition gave rise to the tradition of celebrating the completion of an art work or a series of art works with friends and sponsors. In the twentieth century it became an opportunity to market the works on view to buyers and critics.

[[File:Jonn_Leffmann_-_En_passant_-_vernissagekort_2004.jpg|thumb|222px|Invitation card to a Vernissage.]]
There is a comparable ceremonial ending of art exhibitions, called a ''finissage''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Invitation: Finissage in Venice|url=http://www.artelagunaprize.com/index.php/speed-news-premio/227-finissage-in-venice.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from the French word meaning "finishing". Larger art exhibitions may also have an event halfway through their residency called a ''midissage''. These latter terms are rare in English; they are more commonly used in [[German language|German]] but not in French.{{CN|date=August 2014}} 
The term ''finissage'' was first used in this context in 2003 by Walter Hilliger and Sabine Sallarsaïb for Geheimat Multinational Gallery in Berlin, Germany.

'''Vinicius''' ({{IPA-pt|viˈnisjus|}}; sometimes ''Vinícius''&lt;ref&gt;The official website of the mascots uses ''Vinicius'' (without diacritics); however, some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] secondary sources use ''Vinícius'' (with an accent over the second "i").

Both events were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The [[mascot|mascots]] were created by [[São Paulo]]-based animation company Birdo, which was selected by a national tender process that began in November 2012. Vinicius's design represents Brazilian wildlife, combining aspects of cats, monkeys, and birds, while Tom's design represents Brazilian plant life.

Tenders to create the mascots were only accepted from Brazilian design, illustration, animation, and advertising companies. The final designs were unanimously selected in August 2013 by a panel of judges comprising media professionals and representatives from various Olympic organizations. They were revealed to the public without names on 23 November 2014. Following a three-week online vote which ended on 14 December 2014, the public named the two mascots after [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim|Tom Jobim]], the co-writers of the 1962 [[bossa nova]] song "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]".

Media involving the mascots includes various merchandise and a series of two-minute animated shorts that were broadcast on [[Cartoon Network Brazil]]. Plush dolls of Vinicius were provided to coaches during the [[Wrestling at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Olympic wrestling events]] to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call, a practice many observers found humorous. All Paralympic medalists received a plush doll of Tom, with the leaves on Tom's head the same color as their respective medals. Some observers praised the appearance of the mascots, while others called them "strange-looking".&lt;ref name="Mic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glum" /&gt;

==History==
===Creation and development===
Tenders to create the mascots of the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Summer Olympic]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], were requested in November 2012.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/rio-2016-mascot|title=Rio 2016 Mascot Vinicius - Origin, Design and Photos|last=|first=|website=Olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tender process involved design, illustration, animation, and advertising firms exclusively from Brazil, in order to ensure a "Brazilian-flavoured design".&lt;ref name=Martins&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rio2016.com/blog/en/coming-soon-rio-2016-mascots|title=Coming soon, the Rio 2016 mascots…|last=Martins|first=Tânia|date=18 November 2014|website=Field of Play (Rio 2016 Official Blog)|publisher=Rio 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221161143/http://www.rio2016.com/blog/en/coming-soon-rio-2016-mascots|archive-date=21 February 2015|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors from the Brazilian film festival [[Anima Mundi (event)|Anima Mundi]] served as consultants in the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Rio 2016 organizers sent the agencies involved a list of 17 guidelines, among which were: &lt;blockquote&gt;... the mascots need to reflect the local culture, but must also be universally understood; they should be aligned with the brand direction of the Rio 2016 logos and with the values of the Olympic and Paralympic movements; they must represent universal values, such as friendship, respect and fair play; they must speak to children in particular, but also resonate with adults.&lt;ref name="Martins" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The organizers selected three proposed mascot designs and subjected them to a perception survey with children aged six to twelve in Rio de Janeiro and [[São Paulo]]. The organizers presented each of the three potential mascots to the children, who were unaware that the designs were candidates for the Rio 2016 mascots and were told only about their fictional backgrounds and personality traits. The children responded with comments such as "'This is my friend', 'This one seems stuck-up', 'This one has cool hair'; and 'That one looks silly'".&lt;ref name="Martins" /&gt; The organizers used the children's comments to improve the mascot designs.&lt;ref name="Martins" /&gt;

In August 2013, a panel of judges was formed to select the final mascots, comprising representatives of the organizers of Rio 2016, the [[International Olympic Committee]], the [[Brazilian Olympic Committee]], and the [[Brazilian Paralympic Committee]], along with professionals in the fields of animation, illustration, advertising and market research.&lt;ref name="Martins" /&gt; The judges unanimously chose a set of two mascots, one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games,&lt;ref name="Martins" /&gt; created by Birdo, a São Paulo-based animation company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After a search of existing [[intellectual property]] confirmed that the mascot designs were original, Birdo and the organizers began to create content featuring the mascots, working in secrecy.&lt;ref name="Martins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mascotes Rio2016|url=http://www.birdo.com.br/mascotes-rio2016|website=Birdo Studio|publisher=Birdo Studio|accessdate=7 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318180903/http://www.birdo.com.br/mascotes-rio2016|archivedate=18 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naming and unveiling ===
On 22 November 2014, in preparation for the unveiling, the Rio 2016 organizers held a press event in which costumes of the mascots of past Olympic and Paralympic Games visited Rio de Janeiro to meet the new mascots of the Rio 2016 Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hearst|first1=Chesney|title=Famous Olympic Mascots in Rio de Janeiro|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-sports/famous-olympic-mascots-in-rio/#|website=Rio Times Online|publisher=The Rio Times/Brazil News Agency|accessdate=16 September 2016|date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date= 21 November 2014|title= Olympic mascots visit Rio de Janeiro – video|medium=Online video|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/nov/21/olympic-mascots-visit-rio-de-janeiro-2016-video|access-date=22 August 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mascots were revealed to the public on 23 November 2014, the names to be determined by an online public vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were three candidates in the vote:
* "Oba and Eba" – [[Brazilian Portuguese]] expressions of joy
* "Tiba Tuque and Esquindim" – "tiba" means "a lot" in [[Tupi–Guarani languages]], "tuque" comes from [[Batuque (music and dance)|batuque]], and "esquindim" is a Brazilian Portuguese word for natural sway
* "Vinicius and Tom" – the names of musicians [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim|Tom Jobim]], the co-writers of the song "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio 2016 Mascots - Vote |url=http://www.rio2016.com/mascots#!vote |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126152050/http://www.rio2016.com/mascots/#!vote |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 November 2014 |website=Rio 2016 |publisher=Rio 2016 Organizing Committee |accessdate=15 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website ''[[Thrillist Media Group|Thrillist]]'', wrote that the mascot took "a little of the anger out of a challenge."&lt;ref name="thrillist" /&gt; Jason Bryant, the in-house commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was slightly surprised to see the practice at the Olympics, given the emphasis there on "protocol", but he eventually commented that it does not matter what the challenge object is, particularly if it has cultural significance to the location of the competition.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; Coach Mike Malinconico argued that the practice does not belong at the Olympic Games, stating, "The fate of one of my athletes who has been training for this specific moment for four years hangs in the balance of a referee's error. And I have a stuffed animal in my hands."&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;

The series consists of 32 two-minute episodes and is the third television cartoon series based on Olympic mascots and the first such cartoon created in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="cn-rio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio 2016 mascots to become characters in new Cartoon Network series in Brazil |url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/rio-2016-mascots-to-become-characters-in-new-cartoon-network-series-in-brazil |website=Rio 2016 |accessdate=25 July 2016 |date=21 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921154327/https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/rio-2016-mascots-to-become-characters-in-new-cartoon-network-series-in-brazil |archivedate=21 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show follows Vinicius and Tom as they live in Brazilian forests and cities.&lt;ref name="cn-rio" /&gt; In the series, the mascots are occasionally joined by the "Carioca Sisters" ({{Lang-pt|Irmãs Cariocas}}): Bela, Sol, and Vida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Carioca Sisters' to join Rio 2016 mascots in new series on Cartoon Network |url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/carioca-sisters-to-join-rio-2016-mascots-in-new-series-on-cartoon-network |website=Rio 2016 |publisher=Rio 2016 Organizing Committee |accessdate=22 August 2016 |date=4 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922185941/https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/carioca-sisters-to-join-rio-2016-mascots-in-new-series-on-cartoon-network |archivedate=22 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is designed to promote the mascots. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the owner of Cartoon Network, invested US$750,000 in the series.

The cartoon will give them life, reinforcing the emotional link of the public with the event."&lt;ref name="SwimSwam" /&gt; Although the series is targeted towards children, Sylmara Multini, Director of Licensing and Retail for the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee, stated that it will attract adults too.&lt;ref name="SwimSwam" /&gt;

{{Wiktionary|wall of sound}}

The '''Wall of Sound''' (also called the '''Spector Sound'''){{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-first1=Robert|editor-last1=Birkline|last1=Hoffman|first1=Frank|title=Survey of American Popular Music|url=http://www.shsu.edu/lis_fwh/book/brill_building/Spector%20Sound2.htm|publisher=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=October 17, 2014|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a music production formula developed by American record producer [[Phil Spector]] at [[Gold Star Studios]] in the 1960s, with assistance from engineer [[Larry Levine]] and the [[session musician]] conglomerate later known as "[[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]". The intention was to [[Recording studio as an instrument|exploit the possibilities of studio recording]] to create an unusually dense [[orchestral]] aesthetic that came across well through [[Radio receiver|radio]]s and [[jukebox]]es of the era. Spector explained in 1964: "I was looking for a sound, a sound so strong that if the material was not the greatest, the sound would carry the record. It was a case of augmenting, augmenting. It all fitted together like a jigsaw."&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; 

Critical shorthand usually reduces the Wall of Sound inaccurately to a maximum of noise.&lt;ref name="HinckleyLiner"/&gt; Levine recalled how "other engineers" mistakenly thought that the process was "turning up all the faders to get full saturation, but all that achieved was [[distortion (music)|distortion]]."&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; To attain the Wall of Sound, Spector's [[Musical arrangement|arrangements]] called for large ensembles (including some instruments not generally used for ensemble playing, such as [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitars]]), with multiple instruments doubling or tripling many of the parts to create a fuller, richer tone.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=77}} For example, Spector would often duplicate a part played by an [[acoustic piano]] with an [[electric piano]] and a [[harpsichord]].{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}} Mixed well enough, the three instruments would then be indistinguishable to the listener.{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}}&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Additionally, Spector incorporated an array of orchestral instruments ([[String instrument|strings]], [[woodwind]], [[Brass instrument|brass]] and [[percussion]]) not previously associated with youth-oriented [[pop music]]. [[Reverb]] from an [[echo chamber]] was also highlighted for additional texture. He characterized his methods as "a [[Wagnerian]] approach to rock &amp; roll: little symphonies for the kids".{{sfn|Williams|2003}} 

The intricacies of the technique were unprecedented in the field of sound production for popular music.&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; According to [[Beach Boys]] leader [[Brian Wilson]], who used the formula extensively: "In the '40s and '50s, arrangements were considered 'OK here, listen to that [[French horn]]' or 'listen to this string section now.' It was all a definite sound. There weren't combinations of sound, and with the advent of Phil Spector, we find sound combinations, which—scientifically speaking—is a brilliant aspect of sound production."&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN WILSON OF THE BEACH BOYS IN EARLY 1980'S|url=http://www.globalimageworks.com/clip-brian-wilson-interview-beach-boys-1874_023?id=45092|publisher=Global Image Works|accessdate=July 18, 2014|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Session guitarist [[Barney Kessel]] noted how "terribly simple" it was, however, "the way [Spector] recorded and miked it, they’d diffuse it so that you couldn't pick out any one instrument.

The chamber.|source=—[[Marshall Leib]]{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|p=44}}}}

During the mid-1950s, Spector worked with [[Brill Building]] songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]] during a period where they sought a fuller sound by the use of excessive instrumentation, using up to five electric guitars and four percussionists.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}} This was later to evolve into Spector's Wall of Sound, which Leiber and Stoller consider to be very distinct from what they were doing, stating: "Phil was the first one to use multiple [[drum kit]]s, three pianos and so on. We went for much more clarity in terms of instrumental colors, and he deliberately blended everything into a kind of mulch. He definitely had a different point of view."{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}} Spector's first production was the self-penned 1957 single "[[Don't You Worry My Little Pet]]", performed with his group [[the Teddy Bears]]. The recording was achieved by taking a demo tape of the song and playing it back over the studio's speaker system in order to overdub another performance over it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=57}} The end product was a cacophony, with stacked harmony vocals that could not be heard clearly.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=5}} He would spend the next several years further developing this unorthodox method of recording.

In the 1960s, Spector usually worked at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Los Angeles because of its exceptional [[echo chamber]]s. He also typically worked with such [[audio engineer]]s as [[Larry Levine]] and the conglomerate of [[session musician]]s who later became known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]. The sum of his efforts would be officially designated "Phil Spector's Wall of Sound" by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who coined the term within advertisements for [[the Righteous Brothers]] 1964 single "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling]]".{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=401}}

== Process ==

===Layering===
[[File:The Ronettes 1966.JPG|alt=|thumb|[[The Ronettes]], one of the several [[girl group]]s Spector produced in the early to mid-1960s]]

The process is almost the same for most of Spector's recordings, with Spector starting by rehearsing the assembled musicians for several hours before recording. The backing track was performed live and recorded monaurally; a bass drum overdub on "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]" was the exception to the rule.&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; Songwriter [[Jeff Barry]], who worked extensively with Spector, described the Wall of Sound as "by and large…a formula arrangement" with "four or five guitars…two basses in [[perfect fifth|fifths]], with the same type of line…[[string section|strings]]…six or seven [[horn section|horns]] adding the little punches…[and] percussion instruments—the little bells, the shakers, the [[tambourine]]s".{{sfn|Williams|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/philspectorrr |accessdate=2009-06-16|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans]]' version of "[[Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" formed the basis of Spector and Levine's future mixing practices, almost never straying from the formula it established.&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; For the recording of "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]", engineer [[Larry Levine]] described the process thus: they started by recording four acoustic guitars, playing eight bars over and over again, changing the figure if necessary until Spector thought it ready. They then added the pianos, of which there were three, and if they didn't work together, Spector would start again with the guitars. This is followed by three basses, the horns (two trumpets, two trombones, and three saxophones), then finally the drums.  The vocals were then added with [[Bill Medley]] and [[Bobby Hatfield]] singing into separate microphones, and backing vocals supplied by [[the Blossoms]] and other singers.&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mix&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-righteous-brothers-youve-lost-lovin-feeling/365140 |title=Classic Tracks: The Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" |date=March 1, 2002|author=Dan Daley |work=Mix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Lanois]] recounted a situation during the recording of the track "Goodbye" from [[Emmylou Harris]]'s ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]'': "We put a huge amount of compression on the piano and the mandoguitar, and it turned into this fantastic, chimey harmonic instrument. We almost got the old Spector '60s sound, not by layering, but by really compressing what was already there between the melodic events happening between these two instruments."{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=77}} Nonetheless, layering identical instrumental parts remained an integral component of many of Spector's productions, as session musician [[Barney Kessel]] recalled:

{{quote|There was a lot of weight on each part.…The three pianos were different, one [[electric piano|electric]], one not, one [[harpsichord]], and they would all play the same thing and it would all be swimming around like it was all down a well. Musically, it was terribly simple, but the way he recorded and miked it, they’d diffuse it so that you couldn't pick any one instrument out. Techniques like distortion and echo were not new, but Phil came along and took these to make sounds that had not been used in the past. I thought it was ingenious.{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}}}}

All early Wall of Sound recordings were made with a three-track Ampex 350 tape recorder.&lt;ref name=Buskin2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buskin|first1=Richard|title=CLASSIC TRACKS: The Ronettes 'Be My Baby'|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr07/articles/classictracks_0407.htm|website=Sound on Sound|publisher=Sound on Sound|accessdate=August 19, 2014|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine explained that during mixing, "I [would] record the same thing on two of the [Ampex machine's] three tracks just to reinforce the sound, and then I would erase one of those and replace it with the voice. The console had a very limited equalizer for each input … That was basically it in terms of effects, aside from the two [[echo chamber]]s that were also there, of course, directly behind the control room."&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt;

=== Echo ===
Microphones in the recording studio captured the musicians' performance, which was then transmitted to an echo chamber—a basement room fitted with [[Loudspeaker|speakers]] and [[microphone]]s. The signal from the studio was played through the speakers and reverberated throughout the room before being picked up by the microphones. The echo-laden sound was then channeled back to the control room, where it was recorded on tape. The natural [[reverberation]] and echo from the hard walls of the echo chamber gave Spector's productions their distinctive quality and resulted in a rich, complex sound that, when played on [[AM radio]], had a texture rarely heard in musical recordings. Jeff Barry noted, "Phil used his own formula for echo, and some overtone arrangements with the strings."{{sfn|Williams|2003}}

==== Spill ====
{{Main|Spill (audio)}}
During the mixing for "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah", Spector turned off the track designated for electric guitar (played on this occasion by [[Billy Strange]]). However, the sound of the guitar could still be heard [[spill (audio)|spilling]] onto other microphones in the room, creating a ghostly ambiance that obscured the instrument. In reference to this nuance of the song's recording, music professor Albin Zak has written:

{{quote|It was at this moment that the complex of relationships among all the layers and aspects of the sonic texture came together to bring the desired image into focus. As long as Strange’s unmiked guitar plugs away as one of the layered timbral characters that make up the track’s rhythmic groove, it is simply one strand among many in a texture whose timbres sound more like impressionistic allusions to instruments than representations. But the guitar has a latency about it, a potential. Because it has no microphone of its own, it effectively inhabits a different ambient space from the rest of the track. As it chugs along in its accompanying role, it forms a connection with a parallel sound world of which we are, for the moment, unaware. Indeed, we would never know of the secondary ambient layer were it not for the fact that this guitar is the one that takes the solo. As it steps out of the groove texture and asserts its individuality, a doorway opens to an entirely other place in the track. It becomes quite clear that this guitar inhabits a world all its own, which has been before us from the beginning yet has somehow gone unnoticed.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=83}}}}

Levine disliked Spector's penchant for mic bleeding, accordingly: "I never wanted all the bleed between instruments — I had it, but I never wanted it — and since I had to live with it, that meant manipulating other things to lessen the effect; bringing the guitars up just a hair and the drums down just a hair so that it didn't sound like it was bleeding."&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; In order to offset the mixing problems percussion leakage caused, he applied a minimal number of microphones to the drum kits, using Neumann U67s overhead and RCA 77s on the kick to establish a feeling of presence.&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt;

=== Mono ===
{{Main|Monaural}}

According to Zak: "Aside from the issues of retail and radio exposure, mono recordings represented an aesthetic frame for musicians and producers, who had grown up with them."{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=148}} Despite the trend towards multi-channel recording, Spector was vehemently opposed to stereo releases, claiming that it took control of the record's sound away from the producer in favor of the listener, resulting in an infringement of the Wall of Sound's carefully balanced combination of sonic textures as they were meant to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6467441.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Phil Spector's Wall of Sound |publisher=BBC News |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Wilson agreed, stating: "I look at sound like a painting, you have a balance and the balance is conceived in your mind. You finish the sound, dub it down, and you’ve stamped out a picture of your balance with the mono dubdown. But in stereo, you leave that dubdown to the listener—to his speaker placement and speaker balance. It just doesn't seem complete to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people = Leaf, David|year=1993|title=Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys|medium =Booklet|format =Liner notes| publisher=Capitol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

It has been inaccurately suggested in critical shorthand that Spector's "wall of sound" filled every second with a maximum of noise. Biographer David Hinckley wrote that the Wall of Sound was flexible, more complex, and more subtle, elaborating:

{{quote|Its components included an [[R&amp;B]]-derived rhythm section, generous echo and prominent choruses blending percussion, strings, saxophones and human voices. But equally important were its open spaces, some achieved by physical breaks (the pauses between the thunder in "[[Be My Baby]]" or "[[Baby, I Love You]]") and some by simply letting the music breathe in the studio. He also knew when to clear a path, as he does for the sax interlude and [[Darlene Love|[Darlene] Love's]] vocal in "(Today I Met) The Boy I'm Gonna Marry".&lt;ref name="HinckleyLiner"&gt;David Hinckley; ''[[Back to Mono (1958–1969)]]''; 1991; ABKCO music, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Wall of Sound has been contrasted with "the standard pop mix of foregrounded solo vocal and balanced, blended backing" as well as the airy mixes typical of [[reggae]] and [[funk]].{{sfn|Middleton|1989|p=89}} Jeff Barry said: "[Spector] buried the lead and he ''cannot stop'' himself from doing that … if you listen to his records in sequence, the lead goes further and further in and to me what he is saying is, 'It is ''not'' the song... just listen to those ''strings''. I want ''more'' musicians, it's ''me''.'"{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=149}} Musicologist [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] wrote: "This can be contrasted with the ''open'' spaces and more ''equal'' lines of typical funk and reggae textures [for example], which seem to invite [listeners] to insert [themselves] in those spaces and actively participate."{{sfn|Middleton|1989|p=89}} Closer reflection reveals that the Wall of Sound was compatible with, even supportive of, vocal protagonism. Such virtuosity was ultimately serving of Spector's own agenda—[[The Righteous Brothers]]' vocal prowess provided him a "secure and prosperous headrest", such as in Bobby Hatfield's rendering of "[[Unchained Melody]]".{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=192}}

[[Wagnerian rock]] derives its characterization from a merge between Spector's Wall of Sound and the [[opera]]s of [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last  = Crawford| first = Jeff | title = 'Old Ham' using his loaf| date  = March 3, 2004| work  = Messenger – Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last  = Brearley| first = David |author2=Waldren, Murray |author3=Butler, Mark |author4=Shedden, Iain| title = 25 classic albums that never get played...and the 25 good reasons why not – ROCK monuments| date  = August 9, 2003| work  = Weekend Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and popularity ==

=== Phil Spector ===
{{See also|Phil Spector#Musicianship}}

The Wall of Sound forms the foundation of Phil Spector's recordings, in general. However, certain records are considered to have epitomized its use. The Ronettes' version of "[[Sleigh Ride]]" used the effect heavily. Another prominent example of the Wall of Sound was "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]" by [[The Crystals]].&lt;ref name=Buskin2007 /&gt; Spector himself is quoted as believing his production of [[Ike and Tina Turner]]'s "[[River Deep, Mountain High]]" to be the summit of his Wall of Sound productions,{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989}} and this sentiment has been echoed by [[George Harrison]], who called it "a perfect record from start to finish".{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|p=250}} Spector later produced his album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (1970).

Perhaps Phil Spector's most infamous use of his production techniques was on the ''[[Let It Be]]'' album. Spector was brought in to salvage the incomplete ''Let It Be'', an album abandoned by The Beatles, performances from which had already appeared in several bootleg versions when the sessions were still referred to as ''Get Back''. "[[The Long and Winding Road]]", "[[I Me Mine]]", and "[[Across the Universe]]" are often singled out by Paul McCartney, and others, as those tracks receiving the greatest amount of post-production work. The modified treatment (often misrepresented as a Wall of Sound, although neither Spector nor the Beatles used this phrase to refer to the production) and other [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] proved controversial among fans and [[The Beatles]] themselves. Eventually, in 2003, ''[[Let It Be... Naked]]'' was released, an authorized version without Spector's additions.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Outside of Spector's own songs, the most recognizable example of the "Wall of Sound" is heard on many classic hits recorded by [[The Beach Boys]] (e.g., "[[God Only Knows]]", "[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]"—and especially, the psychedelic "pocket symphony" of "[[Good Vibrations]]"), for which [[Brian Wilson]] used a similar recording technique, especially during the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' and ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' eras of the band.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=16}} Wilson considers ''Pet Sounds'' to be a [[concept album]] centered around interpretations of Phil Spector's recording methods.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; Author [[Domenic Priore]] observed, "The Ronettes had sung a dynamic version of [[The Students]]' 1961 hit '[[I'm So Young]]', and Wilson went right for it, but took the Wall of Sound in a different direction. Where Phil would go for total effect by bringing the music to the edge of cacophony – and therefore rocking to the tenth power – Brian seemed to prefer audio clarity. His production method was to spread out the sound and arrangement, giving the music a more lush, comfortable feel."{{sfn|Priore|2005}}

According to Larry Levine, "Brian was one of the few people in the music business Phil respected. There was a mutual respect. Brian might say that he learned how to produce from watching Phil, but the truth is, he was already producing records before he observed Phil. He just wasn't getting credit for it, something that in the early days, I remember really used to make Phil angry. Phil would tell anybody who listened that Brian was one of the great producers."&lt;ref name="Levine1997"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|first=|last=|authorlink=|chapter=Musician Comments: Larry Levine|title=The Pet Sounds Sessions|others=[[The Beach Boys]]|year=1997|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Larry_Levine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, British band [[Wizzard]] revived the Wall of Sound in three of their hits "See My Baby Jive", "Angel Fingers" and "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday".{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=29–30}} [[Bruce Springsteen]] would also emulate the Wall of Sound in his recording of "[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]]" (1975).{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=29–30}}

Spector's Wall of Sound is distinct from what's typically characterized as a "wall of sound", according to author Matthew Bannister. During the 1980s, "Jangle and drone plus reverberation create[d] a contemporary equivalent of Spector's 'Wall of Sound' — a massive, ringing, cavernous noise and a device used by many indie groups: [[Flying Nun]], from [[Sneaky Feelings]]' ''[[Send You]]'' to [[Straitjacket Fits]] and [[the JPS Experience]]". He cites 1960s psychedelic and [[garage rock]] such as [[the Byrds]]' "[[Eight Miles High]]" (1966) as a primary musical influence on the movement.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=39}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">The '''World Cinema Project''' ('''WCP''') is a [[non-profit organization]] devoted to the preservation and restoration of neglected [[world cinema]].

Founded in 2007 as the '''World Cinema Foundation''' by [[Martin Scorsese]], it was inspired by the work of [[The Film Foundation]] in the United States, a similar venture which Scorsese founded with [[George Lucas]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] in 1990.

The World Cinema Foundation is backed by an advisory board "Filmmaker Council" which includes [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Fatih Akin]], [[Souleymane Cissé]], [[Guillermo Del Toro]], [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Wong Kar-Wai]], [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Deepa Mehta]], [[Ermanno Olmi]], [[Raoul Peck]], [[Cristi Puiu]], [[Walter Salles]], [[Abderrahmane Sissako]], [[Elia Suleiman]], [[Bertrand Tavernier]], [[Wim Wenders]], and [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcinemafoundation.net/filmmakers-board/ World Cinema Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving his position at the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]], [[Kent Jones (director)|Kent Jones]] became the foundation's executive director.

''Trances'', a music documentary about [[Nass El Ghiwane]] an influential Moroccan music group, was picked by [[Martin Scorsese]] as the inaugural release for the foundation; it was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007 and at Djemaa el-Fna square in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-foundation.org/world-cinema Official Film Foundation site]&lt;/ref&gt;
