}}The '''Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms''' (BCCM) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] government funded consortium of seven scientific institutions, who manage and exploit a collection of microbial and genetic resources. The consortium comprises more than 269,000 publicly available strains of [[bacteria]] including [[mycobacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]] , [[filamentous fungi]], [[yeasts]], [[diatoms]] and [[plasmids]].
BCCM is embedded in international initiatives such as the World Federation of Culture Collections ([[World Federation for Culture Collections|WFCC]]) and operates in compliance with the rules of the [[Nagoya Protocol]]. 




==History== 
In 1983 the Belgian Council of Ministers decided to bring the microbial resources and the expertise available in different Belgian institutes together in a network of culture collections: with this the consortium of Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Microorganisms (BCCM) saw the light of day. 

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BCCMconsortium.png|200px|thumb|left|Composition of the BCCM consortium.]] --&gt;

In 1983, the BCCM consortium consisted of the microbial collections of one public scientific institution and two universities:
* the collection of medical [[yeasts]] and [[fungi]] of the Mycology Laboratory of [[Sciensano]] (former Scientific Institute of Public Health) (BCCM/IHEM)
* the collection of [[filamentous fungi]], [[yeasts]] and [[arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] of the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] (BCCM/MUCL) 
* the [[bacteria]] collection of the Laboratory for Microbiology of the Faculty of Sciences of the [[Ghent University]] (BCCM/LMG).

In 1990 the [[plasmid]] collection of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of [[Ghent University]] was added to the consortium (BCCM/GeneCorner). 

In 2011, 3 additional dedicated collections were included in the BCCM consortium:
* the [[diatom]] collection of the Laboratory for Protistology &amp; Aquatic Ecology of [[Ghent University]] (BCCM/DCG)
* the [[mycobacteria]] collection of the [[Institute of Tropical Medicine]] in Antwerp (BCCM/ITM)
* the [[cyanobacteria]] collection of the Centre for Protein Engineering of the [[University of Liège]] (BCCM/ULC).

==Collection==

[[File:BCCMpatrimonium.png|700px|thumb|left|The BCCM collections contain more than 269.000 different resources.]]

Micro-organisms are an important raw material in biotechnology. The properties of bacteria, fungi, yeasts and diatoms are used in countless industrial applications and processes. Consider, for example, fermentation processes and the use of probiotics in foods, the production of antibiotics in medicine, the use of microorganisms as growth promoting elements in agriculture, as bioremediatiors on polluted sites, etc. 

Moreover, the properties of numerous microbial species are still unknown. Therefore public culture collections  truly are a treasure trove of biological material, which can be explored through screening projects, for example.

==Services==

BCCM operates under a multi-site ISO 9001 quality management system


'''Public collection'''

The BCCM collections gather biological resources from all over the world, from samples constructed or isolated by the collections themselves or from samples provided by other scientists.
These well-documented and authenticated strains of bacteria, filamentous and yeasts fungi (including the most important test and control strains), diatoms, plasmids and DNA libraries are made publicly available and are distributed worldwide.
Strains for educational purposes are also available.


'''Safe deposits'''

Resources in the safe deposit collection are not catalogued, and are only available to the depositor, or to third parties with the written authorisation of the depositor.


'''Patent deposits'''

Under a Belgian Government initiative the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has recognised the BCCM consortium as an International Depositary under the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of Deposit of Microorganisms for Patent Procedure. The BCCM contributes to the innovation process by accepting and storing deposits of the biological materials referred to in patent applications. 
Therefore, the BCCM collections can accept as patent deposits under the Budapest Treaty:

•	all bacterial strains, except pathogens belonging to a hazard group higher than group 2 (BCCM/LMG)

•	filamentous fungi and yeasts, non-pathogenic to humans and animals, representing a wide species diversity from natural and industrial sources as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi preserved by in-vitro cultivation (BCCM/MUCL)

•	filamentous fungi and yeasts, including pathogens that cause mycosis in man and animals (BCCM/IHEM)

•	human and animal cell lines, including hybridomas (BCCM/GeneCorner)

•	genetic material in a host or in the form of isolated material (e.g. plasmids, oncogenes, RNA) (BCCM/GeneCorner)


'''Other services'''

Next to its collections of biological materials, BCCM also offers expertise in:

* Identification : molecular biology – physiology – morphology – taxonomy
* Screenings (e.g. genomic) for properties of interest
* Industrial products and processes: quality – monitoring – biosafety
* Food and agricultural products and processes: quality – safety – monitoring
* Bio-assays : resistance – inhibition
* Tailor-made approaches

==Research==

Research projects autonomously developed by BCCM staff or in collaboration with research groups of the host laboratories are focussed among others on:

* biodiversity and taxonomy
* preservation of genetic resources
* bioprospecting
* bioassays for antibacterial activity screening
* food bacteriology
* population genetics
* microbial interactions
* molecular basis of genetic resources

'''Cassini''' is a crater on [[Mars]] named in honour of the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Cassini]]. The name was approved in 1973, by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) [[Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Cassini|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1046|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attached to the crater in the north is the smaller [[Luzin (Martian crater)|Luzin]], further east is [[Flammarion (Martian crater)|Flammarion]] and further southwest is another prominent crater named [[Pasteur (Martian crater)|Pasteur]] but smaller.  Next to the crater in the southeast is [[Indus Vallis]].

The crater measures approximately 415 kilometers in diameter and can be found at 327.9°W and 23.8°N.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/projects/bayes-group/Atlas/Mars/features/crater/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009234124/http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/projects/bayes-group/Atlas/Mars/features/crater/index.html |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[Arabia quadrangle]] of Mars. Pictures of small craters on the floor of Cassini reveal multiple layers. Some of these layers can be easily seen in the pictures below. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/?PSP_008437_1750 |title=HiRISE – High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment |publisher=[[University of Arizona]] |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research leads scientists to believe that some of the craters in Arabia may have held huge lakes. Cassini Crater probably once was full of water since its rim seems to have been breached by the waters. Both inflow and outflow channels have been observed on its rim. The lake would have contained more water than Earth's Lake Baikal, our largest freshwater lake by volume.&lt;ref&gt;Fassett, C. and J. Head III. 2008.

He started as a salesman in [[Le Bon Marché]] in [[Paris]], where he became a close friend of [[Ernest Cognacq]], subsequently the founder of the [[Samaritaine]] department store.

Pigeon became a dealer in cycle lamps and other lamps. His invention and manufacture of the '''Pigeon lamp''', a non-exploding gasoline lamp, in 1884 (exhibited at the ''Exposition universelle de 1900''), made him famous and wealthy.

After his death he remains noted for his family grave in [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris, which he commissioned in 1905 to hold up to 18 family members. The main feature is a life-sized bronze sculpture&lt;ref&gt;by Caveau&lt;/ref&gt; of Pigeon (notebook and pencil in hand) and his wife lying on a bed, overlooked by an angel, which had been illuminated by a lamp for many years by his custodians&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Jullian, ''Montmartre'', 1977, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Constant conjunction''' is a phrase used in philosophy as a variant or near synonym for [[causality]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. It can be construed to contradict a more common phrase: [[correlation is not causation]]. 

==Overview==
The philosopher [[David Hume]] used the phrase frequently in his discussion of the limits of [[empiricism]] to explain our ideas of causation and [[inference]]. In ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume proposed that the origin of our knowledge of necessary connections arises out of observation of the ''constant conjunction'' of certain impressions across many instances. A more modern conception would argue that [[scientific law]] is distinguishable from a principle that arises merely accidentally because of the constant conjunction of one thing and another, but there is considerable controversy over what this distinguishing feature might be.

Although [[British empiricism]] and [[associationist]] philosophers elaborated on Hume's fundamental idea in many diverse ways, and metaphysicians like [[Immanuel Kant]] tried to dissipate the position,{{verification needed|date=October 2014}} the force of his arguments has remained remarkably robust, and they have found unexpected support in three scientific discoveries of the 20th century: [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s laws of conditioning; [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebbian]] [[biological neural network|neural network]]s; and spike-timing-dependent plasticity ([[STDP]]).

In Pavlov's framework, an [[unconditioned stimulus]] can follow in constant conjunction a conditioning/conditioned stimulus within a timeframe of milliseconds to several seconds, and result in the [[conditioned stimulus]] having many of the properties of the unconditioned stimulus. [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb]] explained this as an intrinsic property of [[cell assemblies]] within the nervous system to form connections within large cliques of cells whenever those cells fire together within a reasonably short period of time. (A modern shorthand for his ideas states: "Cells that fire together, wire together".) Modern [[neuroscience]] has confirmed this insight as a product of the activity of synapses and STDP, so structured to strengthen connections between cells that fire within very short periods (10s of milliseconds) of each other. The longer time periods of classical conditioning are presumably a large-number effect of cliques of these synapses and cells.

The group grew out of the [[Academic conference|Conference]] on the Teaching of Modern [[Physics]] held at [[Fermilab]] in 1986, organized by the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Aubrecht, ed., ''Quarks, Quasars, and Quandaries: Proceedings of the Conference on the Teaching of Modern Physics'' (College Park, MD: American Association of Physics Teachers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first effort aimed to supply a chart for [[particle physics]] teaching that would rival the [[Periodic Table]] of the [[Chemical element|elements]]. The first version of this chart was published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamental Particles and Interactions — A Wall Chart of Modern Physics'', Fundamental Particle and Interaction Chart Committee (W. Achor et al.), Phys. Teach. 26, 556 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

CPEP has created four charts emphasizing contemporary aspects of physics research: [[Elementary particle|particles]] and interactions; [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[plasma physics]]; [[nuclear science]]; and [[cosmology]]. Almost half a million of these charts and similar products have been distributed.

The group has created website support for teaching for each of the charts.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

CPEP received the 2017 "Excellence in Physics Education Award" from the American Physical Society, "for leadership in providing educational materials on contemporary physics topics to students for over 25 years."&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

Offshoots of CPEP include the book, "The Charm of Strange Quarks: Mysteries and Revolutions of Particle Physics" (2000), by R. Michael Barnett, Henry Muehry, and [[Helen R. Quinn]], three of the founders of CPEP. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnett |first1=R.

A '''drag count''' is a dimensionless unit used by [[aerospace]] engineers where 1 drag count is equal to a &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; of 0.0001.&lt;ref&gt;T. Yechout. Introduction to Aircraft Flight Mechanics: Performance, static stability, dynamic stability, and classical feedback control. AIAA Education Series. 2003. https://books.google.com/books?id=a_c2V0zAFwcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=drag+count&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZE7-7RqzBf&amp;sig=_zGTQQWXAuPaYLlgd-tReHT1pa4&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=drag%20count&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basha, W. A. and Ghaly, W. S., “Drag Prediction in Transitional Flow over Airfoils,” Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 44, 2007,p. 824–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A drag count &lt;math&gt;\Delta C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta C_\mathrm d = 10^{4} \dfrac{2 F_\mathrm d}{\rho v^2 A}\, ,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hucho, Aerodynamik des Automobils, {{ISBN|978-3-8348-1919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[drag (physics)|drag force]], which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,&lt;ref&gt;See [[lift force]] and [[vortex induced vibration]] for a possible force components transverse to the flow direction.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass density]] of the fluid,&lt;ref&gt;Note that for the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the air density can be found using the [[barometric formula]]. Air is 1.293 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed]] of the object relative to the fluid and
:&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reference [[area]].

The [[drag coefficient]] is used to compare the solutions of different geometries by means of a dimensionless number.  A drag count is used as a more user-friendly measurement as the coefficient of drag is usually much less than 1.  A drag count of 200 to 400 is typical for an airplane at cruise.&lt;ref&gt;"Ask Us - Drag Coefficient &amp; Lifting Line Theory". Aerospaceweb.org. 2004-07-11. http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/aerodynamics/q0184.shtml. Retrieved 2010-12-07&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction of one drag count on a subsonic civil transport airplane means about 200&amp;nbsp;lbs more in payload.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, C.

[[File:Orange-breasted Sunbird (Nectarinia violacea).jpg|right|thumb|The [[orange-breasted sunbird]] (''Nectarinia violacea'') is exclusively found in [[fynbos]] vegetation.]]

'''Endemism''' is the [[ecological]] state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] type; organisms that are [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is '''precinctive''', which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area.

== Etymology ==

The word ''endemic'' is from [[New Latin]] ''endēmicus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ενδήμος, ''endēmos'', "native". ''Endēmos'' is formed of ''en'' meaning "in", and ''dēmos'' meaning "the people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/endemic?s=t "Endemic"]. [[Reference.com]]. Retrieved 6 december 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "precinctive" has been suggested by some scientists,{{efn|''Precinctivity''}} and was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917. It is the equivalent of "endemism".&lt;ref&gt;MacCaughey, Vaughaun 1917. A survey of the Hawaiian land flora. Botanical Gazette 64: 89–114 [see p. 92]. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2469367&lt;/ref&gt; ''Precinction'' was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J. H. and McCoy, E. D. 1990. Endemics and epidemics of shibboleths and other things causing chaos. Florida Entomologist 73: 1–9. http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/58577/56256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J. H. and McCoy, E. D. 1995. Precinctive insect species in Florida. Florida Entomologist 78: 21–35. [also uses word ''precinction'']. http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/74657/72315&lt;/ref&gt; ''Precinctive'' seems to have been coined by  David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian fauna in 1900:&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, D. 1900. Coleoptera. I. Coleoptera Phytophaga, pp. 91–116 in D. Sharp [ed.]. Fauna Hawaiiensis, Being the Land-Fauna of the Hawaiian Islands. Cambridge Univ. Press; Cambridge, vol. 2 part 3 [see p. 91].&lt;/ref&gt; "I use the word precinctive in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ... 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified." That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks.

== Overview ==

[[File:Chorus cicada.jpg|thumb|[[Chorus cicada]], a species endemic to New Zealand]]
Physical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism. The [[orange-breasted sunbird]] is exclusively found in the [[fynbos]] vegetation zone of southwestern [[South Africa]]. The [[glacier bear]] is found only in limited places in [[Southeast Alaska]]. Political factors can play a part if a species is protected, or actively hunted, in one [[jurisdiction]] but not another.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There are two subcategories of endemism: [[paleoendemism]] and [[neoendemism]]. Paleoendemism refers to species that were formerly widespread but are now restricted to a smaller area. Neoendemism refers to species that have recently arisen, such as through divergence and reproductive isolation or through hybridization and [[polyploidy]] in plants.

Endemic types or species are especially likely to develop on geographically and biologically isolated areas such as islands and remote island groups, such as [[Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and [[Socotra]]; they can equally develop in biologically isolated areas such as the [[Ethiopian Highlands|highlands]] of [[Ethiopia]], or large bodies of water far from other lakes, like [[Lake Baikal]]. ''[[Hydrangea hirta]]'' is an example of an endemic species found in [[Japan]].

Endemics can easily become [[endangered]] or [[extinct species|extinct]] if their restricted habitat changes, particularly—but not only—due to human actions, including the [[introduced species|introduction of new organisms]]. There were millions of both [[Bermuda petrel]]s and "[[Juniperus bermudiana|Bermuda cedars]]" (actually ''junipers'') in [[Bermuda]] when it was settled at the start of the seventeenth century. By the end of the century, the petrels were thought extinct. Cedars, already ravaged by centuries of shipbuilding, were driven nearly to extinction in the twentieth century by the introduction of a parasite. Bermuda petrels and cedars are now rare, as are other species endemic to Bermuda.

== Threats to highly endemistic regions ==

Principal causes of habitat degradation and loss in [[List of ecoregions with high endemism|highly endemistic ecosystems]] include agriculture, urban growth, surface mining, mineral extraction, [[logging]] operations&lt;ref&gt;Fred Smiet (1982). [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0376892902000097%20 Threats to the Spice Islands.] Oryx, 16, pp 323–328 {{doi|10.1017/S0030605300017774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 5|p=25–32 | doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[25:ARFDAL]2.0.CO;2 | volume=5|issue=1|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture.

The '''European Survey Research Association (ESRA)''' was founded in 2005 to provide coordination in the field of [[statistical survey|Survey]] Research in [[Europe]]. According to the website, ESRA's main goal is to encourage communication between [[Methodology|methodologist]]s and researchers in substantive fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], and other disciplines employing survey data. Its main two activities are the biannual [[Academic conference|conference]]s on [[statistical survey|survey]] research, and the [[open access journal]] Survey Research Methods (SRM).

Established in January 2007, '''Survey Research Methods (SRM)''' is the official journal of the European Survey Research Association.  This young [[peer-reviewed journal]] aims to be a high quality scientific publication that will be of interest to researchers in all disciplines involved in the design, implementation and analysis of [[statistical survey]]s. The journal is published electronically with free and open access via the internet. The first issue was published 31 January 2007, and contained articles dealing with topics such as survey [[nonresponse]], the measurement of [[social capital]], the [[questionnaire construction|quality of survey questions]], and cross-cultural research. The current editors of SRM are Jaak Billiet of the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, and Ulrich Kohler of the [[University of Potsdam]], Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3191">'''F number''' is a correlation number used in the analysis of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) as a descriptor of their hydrophobicity and molecular size.&lt;ref name="Jinno 1984 p495"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jinno |first1= Kiyokatsu |last2= Okamoto |first2= Mitsuyoshi |journal= [[Chromatographia]] |year= 1984 |volume= 18 |issue= 9 |pages= 495–498 |title= Molecular-shape recognition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in reversed phase liquid chromatography |doi= 10.1007/BF02267234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by Robert Hurtubise and co-workers in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= John F. |last1= Schabron |first2= Robert J. |last2= Hurtubise |first3= Howard F. |last3= Silver |journal= [[Anal.

==Calculation==
The F number is calculated using the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;F = B_2 + C_{12} - \frac{1}{2}R&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of [[double bond]]s
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of [[primary carbon]] and [[secondary carbon]] atoms
: ''R'' is the number of [[non-aromatic]] rings.

===Example===
[[Image:Fluorene.png|Fluorene|thumb]]
For [[fluorene]], there are 6 apparent double bonds (three [[pi bond]]s in each side [[benzene]]-like ring); the central ring has one secondary carbon and is non-aromatic. Therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;F = 6 + 1 - \frac{1}{2}1 = 6.5&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}

==Correlation==
It has been found that the F number linearly correlates with the log&amp;nbsp;k' value ([[logarithm]] of the [[retention factor]]) in aqueous [[Reversed-phase chromatography|reversed-phase]] [[liquid chromatography]].&lt;!-- refs 9 &amp; 10 of Jinno-1984-p46 --&gt; This relationship can be used to understand the significance of different aspects of molecular architecture on their separation using different [[stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]]s.&lt;ref name="Jinno 1984 p46"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jinno |first1= Kiyokatsu |last2= Okamoto |first2= Mitsuyoshi |journal= [[Chromatographia]] |year= 1984 |volume= 18 |issue= 1 |pages= 44–46 |title= Correlation of the retention data of polyaromatic hydrocarbons obtained on various stationary phases used in normal- and reversed-phase liquid chromatography |doi= 10.1007/BF02279465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This size analysis is complementary to the length-to-breadth (L/B) ratio, which classifies molecules according to their "rodlike" or "squarelike" shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Molecular Shape Selectivity through Multiple Carbonyl−π Interactions with Noncrystalline Solid Phase for RP-HPLC |first1= M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'''Franz Dannehl''' (7 February 1870, [[Rudolstadt]] – 1947) was a [[Germany|German]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Lepidoptera]].

He was an insect dealer first in [[Bözen]], then in [[Munich]].

His private collection, mainly butterflies and moths from the [[German Tyrol]] is in [[Museo Civico di Zoologia]], Rome, [[Zoologische Staatssammlung München]] in Munich and [[Museum für Naturkunde]] in Berlin.

According to [[Peter Levenda]], Dannehl was a member of the [[occultist]] [[Thule Society]], and joined the [[Nazi Party]] early on.

Dannehl also trained as a composer. According to [[Daniel Gregory Mason]], "He studied composition in Brussels, Weimar, and Berlin"; a violin sonata is among music compositions of his that survive in score. Some of his songs were reviewed in The Monthly Musical Record (February 1, 1901, page 40) as containing "only slight interest" when performed in a concert at the time.

[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Alchemist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'', by Joseph Wright, 1771]]

The '''history of pseudoscience''' is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A [[pseudoscience]] is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to properly be called such.&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific - pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Pseudoscience']&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper [[science]] and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One popular proposal for demarcation between the two is the [[Falsifiability|falsification criterion]], most notably contributed to by the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the history of pseudoscience it can be especially hard to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins from the [[protoscience]] of [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of pseudoscience. Some pseudosciences originated in the pre-scientific era, such as [[astrology]] and [[acupuncture]]. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. An example of this is [[creationism]], which was developed as a response to the scientific [[theory of evolution]].

Despite failing to meet proper scientific standards, many pseudosciences survive. This is usually due to a persistent core of [[True-believer syndrome|devotees]] who refuse to accept scientific criticism of their beliefs, or due to popular misconceptions. Sheer popularity is also a factor, as is attested by astrology which remains popular despite being rejected by a large majority of scientists.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Religious and Other Beliefs of Americans 2003 | author=Humphrey Taylor | url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=359 | accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa1"&gt;{{cite web | title= Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding | publisher=National Science Foundation | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3 | accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==19th century==
[[Image:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|A [[phrenology]] chart from 1883. During the first half of the 19th century, phrenology was a popular study and considered scientific. By the second half of the century, the theory was largely abandoned.]]

Among the most notable developments in the history of pseudoscience in the 19th century are the rise of [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Spiritualism]] (traced in America to 1848), [[homeopathy]] (first formulated in 1796), and [[phrenology]] (developed around 1800). Another popular pseudoscientific belief that arose during the 19th century was the idea that there were [[Martian canal|canals visible on Mars]]. A relatively mild Christian fundamentalist backlash against the scientific [[theory of evolution]] foreshadowed subsequent events in the 20th century.

The study of bumps and fissures in people's skulls to determine their character, '''[[phrenology]]''', was originally considered a science. It influenced psychiatry and early studies into neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Simpson 2005"&gt;Simpson, D. (2005) Phrenology and the neurosciences: contributions of F. J. Gall and J. G. Spurzheim ANZ Journal of Surgery. Oxford. Vol.75.6; p.475&lt;/ref&gt; As science advanced, phrenology was increasingly viewed as a pseudoscience. Halfway through the 19th century, the scientific community had prevailingly abandoned it.&lt;ref name="van Wyhe, J."&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/science/phrenology/index.html Phrenology: An Overview, by dr. John van Wyhe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Halfway through the century, '''[[iridology]]''' was invented by the Hungarian physician [[Ignaz von Peczely]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/iridol.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Iridology']&lt;/ref&gt; The theory would remain popular throughout the 20th century as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html Iridology Is Nonsense], by Stephen Barrett, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venice_ast_sm.jpg|thumb|The astrological signs of the zodiac.]]

'''[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Spiritualism]]''' (sometimes referred to as "Modern Spiritualism" or "Spiritism")&lt;ref name="Podmore"&gt;{{cite journal  | last=Podmore | first=Frank | year=1903 | title=Modern Spiritualism. A History and a Criticism | journal= The American Journal of Psychology | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=116&amp;ndash;117 | doi=10.2307/1412224 | jstor=1412224 | publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or "Modern American Spiritualism"&lt;ref name="Britten"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Britten | first=Emma Hardinge | title=Modern American Spiritualism | year=1870 | publisher= | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew phenomenally during the period. The American version of this movement has been traced to the [[Fox sisters]] who in 1848 began claiming the ability to communicate with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/spiritul.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Spiritualism']&lt;/ref&gt; The religious movement would remain popular until the 1920s, when renowned magician [[Harry Houdini]] began exposing famous mediums and other performers as frauds (see also [[Harry Houdini#Debunking spiritualists]]). While the religious beliefs of Spiritualism are not presented as science, and thus are not properly considered pseudoscientific, the movement did spawn numerous pseudoscientific phenomena such as [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] and [[spirit photography]].

The principles of '''[[homeopathy]]''' were first formulated in 1796, by German physician [[Samuel Hahnemann]]. At the time, mainstream medicine was a primitive affair and still made use of techniques such as [[bloodletting]]. Homeopathic medicine by contrast consisted of extremely diluted substances, which meant that patients basically received water. Compared to the damage often caused by conventional medicine, this was an improvement.&lt;ref name="pmid8885813"&gt;
{{cite journal |author=[[Edzard Ernst|Ernst E]], Kaptchuk TJ |title=Homeopathy revisited |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=156 |issue=19 |pages=2162–4 |year=1996 |pmid=8885813 |doi=10.1001/archinte.156.19.2162}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1830s homeopathic institutions and schools spread across the USA and Europe.&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_pro/homeopathy_1825_1849.html |title=Homeopathy Timeline |accessdate=2007-07-23 |last=Winston |first=Julian |year=2006 |work=The Faces of Homoeopathy |publisher=Whole Health Now
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these early successes, homeopathy was not without its critics.&lt;ref&gt;Example of a contemporary criticism of homeopathy:{{cite book |author=John Forbes |title=Homeopathy, allopathy and young physic |location=London |year=1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity was on the decline before the end of the 19th century, though it has been revived in the 20th century.

The supposed '''[[Martian canal]]s''' were first reported in 1877, by the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]]. The belief in them peaked in the late 19th century, but was widely discredited in the beginning of the 20th century.

The publication of ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' by politician and author [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] in 1882, renewed interest in the ancient idea of '''[[Atlantis]]'''. This highly advanced society supposedly existed several millennia before the rise of civilizations like [[Ancient Egypt]]. It was first mentioned by [[Plato]], as a literary device in two of his dialogues. Other stories of lost continents, such as [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] also arose during the late 19th century.

In 1881 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij]] ([[English language|English]]: ''Society against Quackery'') was formed to oppose pseudoscientific trends in medicine. It is still active.

==20th century==
Among the most notable developments to pseudoscience in the 20th century are the rise of [[Creationism]], the demise of [[Spiritualism]], and the first formulation of [[Ancient astronauts|ancient astronaut theories]].

'''[[Reflexology]]''', the idea that an undetectable life force connects various parts of the body to the feet and sometimes the hands and ears, was introduced in the USA in 1913 as 'zone therapy'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/reflex.html Reflexology: A Close Look], by Stephen Barrett, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/reflex.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Reflexology']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Creationism]]''' arose during the 20th century as a result of various other historical developments. When the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] overcame the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] in the first half of the 20th century, American [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] began opposing the teaching of the [[theory of evolution]] in public schools. They introduced numerous laws to this effect, one of which was notoriously upheld by the [[Scopes Trial]].
In the second half of the century the [[Space Race]] caused a renewed interest in science and worry that the USA was falling behind on the Soviet Union. Stricter science standards were adopted and led to the re-introduction of the [[theory of evolution]] in the curriculum. The laws against teaching evolution were now ruled unconstitutional, because they violated the [[separation of church and state]]. Attempting to evade this ruling, the Christian fundamentalists produced a supposedly secular alternative to evolution, Creationism. Perhaps the most influential publication of this new pseudoscience was ''[[The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications|The Genesis Flood]]'' by [[young earth creationism|young earth creationists]] [[John C. Whitcomb]] and [[Henry M. Morris]].

The dawn of the space age also inspired various versions of '''[[Ancient astronauts|ancient astronaut theories]]'''. While differences between the specific theories exists, they share the idea that intelligent extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past and made contact with then living humans. Popular authors, such as [[Erich von Däniken]] and [[Zecharia Sitchin]], began publishing in the 1960s. Among the most notable publications in the genre is ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', which appeared in 1968.

The [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[Moon landing]]s from the 1960s through the 70's gave rise to a number of '''[[Apollo Moon Landing hoax conspiracy theories]]'''. These [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] are universally ignored by the scientific community, but at the end of the century a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll showed 6 percent of the American population did not believe the landings were genuine.&lt;ref name="gallup1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1993/Did-Men-Really-Land-Moon.aspx |title=Did Men Really Land on the Moon? |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallup2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3712/Landing-Man-Moon-Publics-View.aspx |title=Landing a Man on the Moon: The Public's View |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 20th century several prominent [[Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] foundations were formed to counter the growth of pseudosciences. In the USA, the most notable of these are, in chronological order, the [[Center for Inquiry]] (1991), [[The Skeptics Society]] (1992), the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] (1996), and the [[New England Skeptical Society]] (1996). The [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]], which has similar goals, had already been founded in 1976. It became part of the Center for Inquiry as part of the foundation of the latter in 1991. In the Netherlands [[Stichting Skepsis]] was founded in 1987.

==21st century==
At the beginning of the 21st century, a variety of pseudoscientific theories remain popular.

'''Creationism''', in the form of '''[[Intelligent Design]]''', suffered a major legal defeat in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial. Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled that Intelligent Design is inseparable from Creationism, and its teaching in public schools violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]. The trial sparked much interest, and was the subject of several documentaries including the award-winning [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] production ''[[Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial]]'' (2007).

The pseudoscientific idea that '''[[Thiomersal controversy|vaccines cause autism]]''' originated in the 1990s, but became prominent in the media during the first decade of the 21st century.

Most notable of these is [[Jenny McCarthy]], whose son has autism.
In February 2009, surgeon [[Andrew Wakefield]], who published the original research supposedly indicating a link between vaccines and autism, was reported to have fixed the data by [[The Sunday Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism | publisher=The Sunday Times | date=2009-02-08 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece | accessdate=2009-02-08  | location=London

The most notable development in the '''ancient astronauts''' genre was the opening of Erich von Däniken's [[Mystery Park]] in 2003. While the park had a good first year, the number of visitors was much lower than the expected 500,000 a year. This caused financial difficulties, which led to the closure of the park in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/top_news/detail/Closure_of_Mystery_Park_is_no_enigma.html?siteSect=106&amp;sid=7266028&amp;cKey=1163955688000 Closure of Mystery Park in Interlaken is no mystery] by swissinfo.ch&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Peter Kortschak''' (or Kortschack; 4 September 1911, in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] – 20 August 1983)&lt;ref name="geni"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Hugo-P-Kortschak/6000000049656984196 |title=Hugo P. Kortschak  |date=11 November 2016 |website=geni.com |access-date=1 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[biologist]] who discovered the [[C4 pathway]] in 1957. This pathway is an adaptation found in plants which reduces loss of [[energy]] via the inefficient [[photorespiration|C2 pathway]]. It is found in several plants, such as [[maize]] and [[sugarcane]]. The C4 pathway was rediscovered by [[Marshall Hatch|Hatch]] and Slack (to whom the discovery is sometimes wrongly credited).&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Louis G. (1993). "A tribute to Hugo P. Kortschak: The man, the scientist and the discoverer of C4 photosynthesis". Photosynthesis Research 35 (2): 201.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of the Austrian-American violinist [[Hugo Kortschak]], father of Alice M Kortschak and Nonnie Winifred Kortschak.&lt;ref name="geni" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">The '''International Biology Olympiad''' ('''IBO''') is a [[International Science Olympiad|science olympiad]] for high school students under the age of 20. The first academic international Olympiads after the (originally Eastern European-based) [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] were launched under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] in the 1960s. The programs have gradually expanded to include more than 70 participating countries across five continents. The IBO is one of these olympiads. All participating countries send the four winners of their National Biology Olympiad to the IBO, usually accompanied by two adults who are members of the international jury for the duration of the competition.

== Summary ==
Each year, the IBO is organised by a different country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo-info.org/ibo-results-and-awards |title=Past IBOs |website=International Biology Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo-info.org/next-ibos |title=Next IBOs |website=International Biology Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2204">A '''Lilian date''' is the number of days since the beginning of the [[Gregorian Calendar]] on October 15, 1582, regarded as Lilian date 1.  It was invented by Bruce G. Ohms of [[IBM]] in 1986 and is named for [[Aloysius Lilius]], who devised the Gregorian Calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Ohms
  | first = Bruce G
  | title = Computer processing of dates outside the twentieth century
  | journal = IBM Systems Journal
  | volume = 25
  | pages = 244–251
  | year = 1986
  | publisher = IBM
  | doi = 10.1147/sj.252.0244
  | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilian dates can be used to calculate the number of days between any two dates occurring since the beginning of the Gregorian calendar. It is currently used by date conversion routines that are part of [[IBM Language Environment (LE) software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/topic/com.ibm.zos.r12.ceea800/ceea81b034.htm Date and Time Services] in z/OS V1R12.0 Language Environment Programming Reference&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lilian date is only a date format: it is not tied to any particular time standard. Another, better known, date notation that is used for similar purposes is the [[Julian date]], which is tied to [[Universal time]] (or some other closely related time scale, such as [[International Atomic Time]]). The Julian date always begins at noon, [[Universal time]], and a decimal fraction may be used to represent the time of day. In contrast, Ohms did not make any mention of time zones or time of day in his paper.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|year=2004
|work=COBOL for AIX Programming Guide (1st ed. ver. 2)

|url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v7v91/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.aix.cbl.doc%2Frpsrv06.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If the Lilian date was to be reckoned in [[Universal Time]], and if the Lilian date is taken to begin at midnight, the Lilian date can be obtained from the [[Julian date]] by subtracting {{nowrap|2,299,159.5}} from the Julian date, and ignoring the decimal fraction in the result.

'''SDN ([[Software-defined networking]])''' is a new paradigm to configure and operate computer networks (especially [[data center]] networks) through a centralized software controller that dictates how the network behaves. The core of this new paradigm is the SDN controller.

There are typically two sets of SDN controllers:
* SDN controllers for the [[network function virtualization|NFV]] Intrastucture of a datacenter,
* Historical SDN controllers for managing the programmable switches of the network.

In case of SDN controllers for the NFV Infrastructure of a datacenter, they are mostly designed to provide some policy and centralized managements for the Openstack Neutron networking layer that shall provide inter-working between the virtual ports created by Nova. The de facto technology of the SDN controllers is to manage the Linux kernel features made of [[IP forwarding|L3 IP routing]], [[Bridging (networking)|Linux bridges]], [[iptables]] or ebtables, network namespaces and [[Open vSwitch]].

[[File:Evolution of computers 2.png|thumb|right|400px|This illustration shows the development of computers, from huge room-sized computers in the 1940s and 1950s (left-most photo) to smaller [[personal computer]]s over the 1980s to the 2010s.]]
This '''list of computer size categories''' attempts to list commonly used categories of [[computer]] by the physical size of the device and its chassis or case, in descending order of size. One generation's "supercomputer" is the next generation's "mainframe", and a "PDA" does not have the same set of functions as a "laptop", but the list still has value, as it provides a ranked categorization of devices. It also ranks some more obscure computer sizes.
{{Computer form factors}}

== [[Supercomputer]]s == 

* [[Minisupercomputer]]

== [[Mainframe ]] ==

Mainframe computers are large and expensive but powerful, so they can handle hundreds and thousands of connected users at the same time.

* [[Handheld computer]]s, which include the classes:
*** [[Ultra-mobile PC|Ultra-mobile personal computer]], or UMPC
*** [[Personal digital assistant]] or [[enterprise digital assistant]], which include:
**** [[handheld PC|HandheldPC]] or [[palmtop|Palmtop computer]]
**** [[pocket PC|Pocket personal computer]]

== Others ==

* [[Deskside computer]] - often [[19-inch rack|strd. rack]] width but less than half of the typical rack height, esp. for mid-range  [[Server hardware|servers]] (e.g. [[RS/6000#Type 7025|RS/6000 7025-F80]]), [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualisation]] (e.g. [[SGI Onyx|Onyx Deskside]]) or [[Vector processor|vector processing]] (e.g. [[NEC SX-6|SX-6i]]).

** [[Blade PC]]
* [[Small form factor|Small form factor personal computer]] (SFF, ITX, DTX.etc.)

== Distinctive marks ==
The classes above are not rigid; there are "edge devices" in most of them. For instance, the "subnotebook" category can usually be distinguished from the "PDA" category because a subnotebook has a keyboard and a PDA has not; however, tablet PCs may be larger than subnotebooks (making it seemingly correct to classify them as laptops) and also lack a keyboard, while devices such as the Handspring [[Treo 600]] have something that might charitably be called a keyboard, but are still definitely in the "smartphone" category.

In the higher end of the spectrum, this informal and somewhat humorous rule might help:

* You can throw a laptop if you wanted to
* You can lift a workstation if you need to
* You can tilt a minicomputer if you need to
* You cannot move a mainframe, even if you tried

Several non-avian [[feathered dinosaurs|dinosaurs were feathered]]. Direct evidence of feathers exists for the following species, listed in the order currently accepted evidence was first published. In all examples, the evidence described consists of feather impressions, except those genera inferred to have had feathers based on skeletal or chemical evidence, such as the presence of quill knobs (the anchor points for wing feathers on the forelimb) or a [[pygostyle]] (the fused vertebrae at the tail tip which often supports large feathers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Stephen L.

'''Mercury-Atlas 1 (MA-1)''' was the first attempt to launch a [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule and occurred on July 29, 1960 at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida. The spacecraft was unmanned and carried no [[launch escape system]]. The [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas]] rocket suffered a structural failure 58 seconds after launch at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet (9.1&amp;nbsp;km) and 11,000 feet (3.4&amp;nbsp;km) down range. All telemetry signals suddenly ceased as the vehicle was passing through [[Max Q]]. Because the day was rainy and overcast, the booster was out of sight from 26 seconds after launch, and it was impossible to see what happened.

The mission was to conduct a [[suborbital]] test flight and reentry of the spacecraft. The capsule carried live separation rockets, but dummy retrorockets. Several other systems were not installed, including the cabin pressurization system and the astronaut couch. A number of Mercury engineers had voiced their objection to the launch because the weather would prevent observation of the flight. Some witnesses claimed to have heard an explosion, but this could not be verified. The capsule continued transmitting until it impacted the ocean, approximately 6 miles downrange. Salvage brought the capsule, Atlas booster engines and [[LOX]] vent valve to the surface from the ocean floor. The engines showed no sign of damage except some deformation from impact with the ocean, but the vent valve and a still attached segment of piping had noticeable fatigue cracks.

==Investigation==
[[File:MA-1 Capsule Reassembled After Explosion - GPN-2002-000043.jpg|thumb|left|The reconstructed MA-1 spacecraft after debris recovery]]
Telemetry indicated that the Atlas functioned normally up to T+58 seconds and there was no sign of any problems up to that point, when a severe axial disturbance was detected. Approximately one second later, the pressure difference between the RP-1 and LOX tanks dropped to zero followed by loss of engine thrust and telemetry and the appearance of multiple objects on radar. Capsule data indicated violent movements following loss of booster telemetry, but the Mercury otherwise continued functioning normally until impact with the ocean at around 220 seconds after launch. The automatic abort system appeared to have functioned correctly and issued a shutdown command to the Atlas's engines the moment that it detected an abnormal situation. The parachute system did not deploy because the abort had taken place too early in the launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740075942_1974075942.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49295932/Post-Launch-Report-for-Mercury-Atlas-No-1|title=Post Launch Report for Mercury-Atlas No. 1|publisher=NASA|date=August 2, 1960|archivedate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flight Test Report, Mercury/Atlas MA-1|publisher=Convair|date=July 29, 1960|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=AD0842203}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike R&amp;D Atlas D missiles, Atlas 50D was not carrying a large compliment of telemetry probes; only 50 measurements were taken on this flight. The Atlas had appeared to be on a steady flight path when telemetry was lost at T+60 seconds, but the last 1.2 seconds of telemetry data was questionable due to open circuits in the booster following the disturbance. The capsule gyroscope data suggested that the stack had pitched over as much as 10°. There had been two separate disturbances. The first one, at T+58.5 seconds, had caused the instant loss of telemetry measurements in the forward part of the booster. The second disturbance occurred at T+59.4 seconds, following the ASIS-generated engine cutoff. The propulsion system did not appear to be affected by the initial event.

==Conclusions==
The initial suspicion was that the fiberglass fairing placed on top of the capsule to sit in place of the absent LES had broken loose and punctured the Atlas's LOX tank. NASA's [[Owen Maynard]], who was involved in Mercury systems engineering, led the recovery of the MA-1 capsule from the sea-floor (in which he performed a 30-foot free-dive to find one particular missing component of the capsule). He stated in an oral history interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral History Transcript|first=Owen|last=Maynard|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/MaynardOE/OEM_4-21-99.pdf|date=21 April 1999|page=12-84|publisher=Johnson Space Center History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his post-flight calculations showed the skin of the launch vehicle just below the spacecraft would have buckled due to the combined drag, acceleration, and bending loads which exceeded the resisting tensile stress in the skin provided by internal pressure.  Maynard recalled that "The problem of mating the Mercury capsule to the Atlas was far from being properly resolved at the time of MA-1." Based on that finding, the NASA specified that future Mercury-Atlas launch vehicles add doublers to the skin structure in that area, and that future launch trajectories be shallowed to reduce pitch angle rate, to reduce the bending stress on the launch vehicle. In fact, Atlas 50D already had slightly thicker skin than Big Joe's booster (Atlas 10D) but only on the RP-1 tank while the LOX tank still had the standard thin-gauge Atlas ICBM skin. This failure mode did not recur on those subsequent launches. There were also suspicions that the lack of a launch escape system had negatively affected the booster's aerodynamic profile. Convair engineers had argued that including the LES was necessary both from an aerodynamic standpoint and for data-gathering purposes, but Mercury program officials ultimately ruled against it.

The capsule reached an apogee of 13&amp;nbsp;km and flew 9.6&amp;nbsp;km downrange. The flight lasted 3 minutes and 18 seconds. Capsule weight 1,154&amp;nbsp;kg. Serial numbers: Atlas 50-D, Mercury spacecraft #4.

Pieces of Mercury spacecraft #4, used in the Mercury-Atlas 1 mission, are currently displayed at the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center]], [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americanspacecraft.com/pages/mercury/MA-1.html|first=Jim|last=Gerard| title=Mercury spacecraft # 4 |publisher= A Field Guide to American Spacecraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milorganite''' is a brand of [[biosolids]] [[fertilizer]] produced by [[Sewage sludge treatment|treating sewage sludge]] by the [[Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the term ''Mil''waukee ''Org''anic ''Nit''rog''e''n. The [[sewer system]] of the District collects [[sewage|municipal wastewater]] from the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. It is coarsely filtered and treated with [[microbes]] to break down organic matter at the [[Jones Island, Milwaukee|Jones Island]] [[sewage treatment plant]] (also called "[[Water reclamation|Water Reclamation]] Facility") in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The byproduct [[sewage sludge]] is produced. This is heat-dried to {{convert|900-1200|°F|°C}}, which kills [[pathogen]]s. The result is then pelletized and marketed throughout North America&lt;ref name="Tanzilo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onmilwaukee.com/history/articles/makingmilorganite.html|title=In Milwaukee History: Milorganite is made!

The treated wastewater is discharged to [[Lake Michigan]].

[[Recycling|Recycled]] fertilizer contains [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], essential nutrients plants need for growth.  Its use can help offset the amount of chemical based  fertilizer produced.

After more than 90 years, Milorganite production and use is a long-term and large-scale example of a municipality-run nonprofit environmental program.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanzilo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="press" /&gt;

== History ==
"Milorganite" is a portmanteau of the term ''Mil''waukee ''Orga''nic ''Nit''rog''e''n. It was the winning entry in a 1925 naming contest for a biosolids-based fertilizer held in ''National Fertilizer Magazine''. Its history began with Milwaukee’s goal to clean up its rivers and Lake Michigan.&lt;ref name="Schneider1"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JMu6pdfkFEsC&amp;pg=PA170 |pages=170-192 |first1=Daniel |last1=Schneider |title=Histories of the Dustheap: Waste, Material Cultures, Social Justice |editor-first1=Stephanie |editor-last1=Foote |editor-first2=Elizabeth |editor-last2=Mazzolini|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2012 |chapter=7, "Purification or Profit: Milwaukee and the Contradiction of Sludge"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than [[land fill]]ing solids left over from wastewater treatment, the [[sludge]] was used in a pioneering effort to make, distribute and sell fertilizer.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012Milorganite/06OrganicFertilizer/prweb9563797.htm |title=Milorganite Reaches 9 Billion Pounds with 85 Years of Recycling |publisher=PRWEB |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin  |date=June 2, 2012  |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting production is among the largest recycling programs in the world.&lt;ref name="Tanzilo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merritt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Report Photographs, Written Historical and Descriptive Data |work=Historic American Engineering Record |first1=Raymond H. |last1=Merritt |year=1982 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |format=[[PDF]] |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/wi/wi0100/wi0154/data/wi0154data.pdf |accessdate=April 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095944/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/wi/wi0100/wi0154/data/wi0154data.pdf |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milorganite's roots began in 1911, when local [[socialist]] politicians were elected on a platform calling for construction of a [[wastewater treatment plant]] to protect against [[Waterborne diseases|water borne pathogens]].&lt;ref name="Schneider1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clifford |last1=Mortimer |date=May 1981 |url=https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/54945 |title=The Lake Michigan Pollution Case: A Review and Commentary on the Limnological and Other Issues |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin |work=Publications of the Great Lakes Center for Research |publisher=Center for Great Lakes Studies, [[University of Wisconsin]] {{ndash}} Milwaukee |pages=2–3 |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As raising taxes for [[public health]] was relatively controversial in the early 1900s,{{cn|date=February 2017}} producing an [[organic fertilizer]] as a means of partially offsetting its operating cost was proposed.  With the help of researchers in the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], the use of waste solids in the form of [[activated sludge]] as a source of fertilizer had been developed in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milorganite.com/en/Header-Links/About-Us/History.aspx |title=History of Milorganite |publisher=Milorganite/[[Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District]] |accessdate=March 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326164445/http://www.milorganite.com/en/Header-Links/About-Us/History.aspx |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments showed that heat-dried activated sludge pellets "compared favorably with standard organic materials such as dried blood, tankage, fish scap, and cottonseed meal."&lt;ref&gt;Eleventh Annual Report of the Sewerage Commission of the City of Milwaukee for 1924, pp. 32–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milorganite made its debut in 1926 as the first pelletized fertilizer in the United States,&lt;ref name="Tanzilo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://onmilwaukee.com/market/articles/makingmilorganite.html |title=Urban spelunking: Brewing up Milorganite |first1=Bobby |last1=Tanzilo |publisher=RSS Feed/OnMilwaukee.com |date=28 September 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with sales directed at golf courses,&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xnhZI5KUs0C&amp;pg=PA149 |title=Hybrid Nature: Sewage Treatment and the Contradictions of the Industrial Ecosystem |first1=Daniel |last1=Schneider |pages=149-151 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=September 2011 |isbn=9780262016445  |id=ISBN 9780262516389}}&lt;/ref&gt; turf farms and flower growers.&lt;ref&gt;See, North American's Most Widely Known, Respected, and Beloved Turfgrass Agronomist, The O.J.

Since its inception, over four million metric tons of Milorganite have been sold.&lt;ref name="press" /&gt; As of 2012, the plant produces about 45,000 tons of Milorganite per year.&lt;ref name="Tanzilo"/&gt; The sale of product does not generate sufficient funds to cover the costs of manufacture, but the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District states that the environmental benefits are a legitimate offsetting consideration:&lt;ref name="press" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Milorganite products are manufactured and marketed by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD), a regional government agency whose primary focus is providing water reclamation and flood management services for about 1.1 million customers in 28 communities in the Greater Milwaukee Area. Since 1926 MMSD has been a world leader in supplying Organic Nitrogen fertilizers for professional and residential use. While revenue generated through the sale of Milorganite products does not make up for the entire cost to produce and market, our belief in beneficial reuse and recycling makes producing our value added products the clear choice."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milorganite.com/About |title=About us |publisher=Milorganite/[[Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District]] |accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even as it balances such conflicting goals and successfully navigates the fluctuations and vagaries of a changing waste stream,{{efn-ua|Such as the impact upon both the quality and the quantity of raw material available with Milwaukee losing much of its [[malting]] and [[brewing]] industry through the departure of once-giant local concerns [[Schlitz Brewing Company]] and [[Pabst Brewing Company]]).&lt;ref name="Schneider1"/&gt;}}Milorganite has been at the forefront of the sewage sludge recycling industry in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Schneider1"/&gt;

The process is the end point of the Milwaukee County sewerage system, which includes "three thousand miles of household laterals and another 3,000 miles of sanitary sewers."  Also included is the {{convert|28.5|mi}} "deep tunnel project" and the {{convert|521|e6usgal|e6m3+e6impgal}} overflow storage system.  Two plants, one on Jones Island and the other in Oak Creek, process sewage using bacteria.  They employ about 220 people.  Methane is recaptured and used to minimize energy costs.&lt;ref name="Tanzilo2"/&gt;

The presence of heavy metals is a source of concern.

The EPA has not regulated levels of environmentally toxic manmade [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]]s.&lt;ref name="wef"/&gt;  Substantial levels of [[polybrominated diphenyl ether]]s, a type of "persistent, [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic" (PBT) contaminant, were detected in biosolids in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/35084130 |title=Flame retardants: Persistent pollutants in land-applied sludges |date=July 12, 2001|journal=Nature |volume=412 |pages=140-14 |doi=10.1038/35084130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding came despite the EPA's previous assertion that all PBT organic pollutants of concern had been banned from production in the 1970s and hence these could be ignored in risk assessment.

The [[United States Geological Survey]] analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15798">The term '''new social movements''' ('''NSMs''') is a theory of [[social movement]]s that attempts to explain the plethora of new movements that have come up in various [[Western world|western]] societies roughly since the mid-1960s (i.e. in a [[post-industrial economy]]) which are claimed to depart significantly from the conventional social movement [[social paradigm|paradigm]].&lt;ref name="Pic"&gt;Pichardo 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two central claims of the NSM theory. First, that the rise of the post-industrial economy is responsible for a new wave of social movement and second, that those movements are significantly different from previous social movements of the industrial economy.&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt; The primary difference is in their goals, as the new movements focus not on issues of materialistic qualities such as economic wellbeing, but on issues related to [[human rights]] (such as [[gay rights]] or [[pacifism]]).&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;

Thinkers have related these movements with the [[postmaterialism]] hypothesis and New Class Model as put forth by [[Ronald Inglehart]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==The new movements==
Numerous social movements from mid-1960s differed from their precursors, such as the [[labor movement]], which had previously been seen as focused on [[economics|economic concerns]].&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bue"/&gt; The 1960s were a period of transformation in collective action, the [[May 1968 protests in France|French May]] (1968) probably being its most determinant moment. It is important to highlight, however, that it is currently being discussed whether this phenomenon was the first example of a new social movement or as Staricco has stated: "It did not so much open an era as close one. It was not the beginning of a paradigm, but the end of another one. What comes after – the growing importance of new social movements both empirically and theoretically – can be understood as a consequence, but not as a continuation or progression".{{sfn|Staricco|2012}}

The new movements instead of pushing for specific changes in public policy emphasize [[social change]]s in identity, lifestyle and culture.&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt; Thus the social aspect is seen by the NSM as more important than the economic or political aspects.&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt; Some NSM theorists, like F. Parkin (''Middle Class Radicalism'', 1968), argue that the key actors in these movements are different as well, as they are more likely to come from the "new [[middle class]]" rather than the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt; Unlike pressure groups that have a formal organisation and 'members', NSMs consist of an informal, loosely organised [[social network]] of 'supporters' rather than members.

Protest groups tend to be single issue based and are often local in terms of the scope of change they wish to effect. In contrast, NSMs last longer than single issue campaigns and wish to see change on an (inter)national level on various issues in relation to their set of beliefs and ideals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A NSM may, however adopt the tactic of a protest campaign as part of its strategy for achieving wider-ranging change.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Examples of those new movements include the [[women's movement]], the [[ecology movement]], [[gay rights movement]] and various [[peace movement]]s, among others.{{sfn|Laclau|Mouffe|2001|p=159}}

==The theory==
Buechler argues that there is in fact no single new social movement theory, but a set of new social movement theories, each a variant on a general approach to "something called new social movement", which he cautiously defines as a "diverse array of collective actions that has presumably displaced the old social movement of [[proletarian revolution]]".&lt;ref name="Bue"&gt;Buechler 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kendall, new social movement theory focuses on [[organizational culture|movement culture]]; it also pays attention to their [[cultural identity|identity]] and on their relations to [[culture]], [[ideology]] and [[politics]].&lt;ref name="Ken"&gt;Kendall 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Important contributors in the field include [[sociologist]]s such as [[Alain Touraine]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], [[Chantal Mouffe]], [[Claus Offe]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Manuel Castells]] or philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Félix Guattari]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Characteristics==
The most noticeable feature of new social movements is that they are primarily social and cultural and only secondarily, if any, political.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from the worker’s movement, which was central to the political aim of gaining access for the working class with the extension of citizenship and representation, new social movements such as youth culture movement concentrate on bringing about social mobilization through cultural innovations, development of new life-styles and transformation of identities. It is clearly elaborated by Habermas that new social movements are the ‘new politics’ which is about quality of life, individual self-realisation and human rights whereas the ‘old politics’ focus on economic, political, and military security.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;Charles 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This can be exemplified in the gay liberation, the focus of which broadens out from political issue to social and cultural realization and acceptance of homosexuality. Hence, new social movements are understood as new because they are first and foremost social.

New social movements also give rise to a great emphasis on the role of post-material values in contemporary and post-industrial society as opposed to conflicts over material resources. According to Melucci, one of the leading new social movement theorists, these movements arise not from relations of production and distribution of resources but within the sphere of reproduction and the life world, as a result of which, the concern has shifted from the sole production of economic resources directly connected to the needs for survival or for reproduction to cultural production of social relations, symbols and identities. In other words, the contemporary social movements are rejections of the materialistic orientation of consumerism in capitalist societies by questioning the modern idea that links the pursuit of happiness and success closely to growth, progress and increased productivity and by promoting alternative values and understandings in relation to the social world. As an example, the environmental movement that has appeared since the late 1960s throughout the world, with its strong points in the United States and Northern Europe, has significantly brought about a ‘dramatic reversal’ in the ways we consider the relationship between economy, society and nature.&lt;ref name="Castells"&gt;Castells 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, new social movements are located in civil society or the cultural sphere as a major arena for collective action rather than instrumental action in the state, which Claus Offe characterises as ‘bypass the state’.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with its little concern to directly challenge the state, new movements are regarded as anti-authoritarian and resisted incorporation in institutional levels. They tend to focus on single issue, or a limited range of issues connected to a single broad theme such as peace and environment. Without the attempt to develop a total politics under a single focus, new social movements set their stress on grass-roots in the aim of representing the interests of marginal or excluded groups. Paralleled with this ideology, the organization form of new collective actions is also locally based, centred on small social groups and loosely held by personal or informational networks such as radios, newspapers and posters. This ‘local- and issue-centred’ characteristic which does not necessarily require a highly agreed ideology or agreement on ultimate ends makes these new movements distinctive from the ‘old’ labour movement with a high degree of tolerance of political and ideological difference appealing to broader sections of population.

Additionally, if old social movements namely the worker’s movement presupposed a working –class base and ideology, the new social movements are presumed to draw from a different social class base, that is, ‘the new class’, as a complex contemporary class structure that Claus Offe identifies as ‘threefold’: the new middle class, elements of the old middle class and peripheral groups outside the labour market.&lt;ref name="Buechler"&gt;Buechler 1995&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Offe,&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;Charles 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the new middle class in association with the old one is evolved in the new social movements because of their high levels of education and their access to information and resources that lead to the questions of the way society is valued; the group of people that are marginal in terms of labour market such as students, housewives and the unemployed participate in the collective actions as a consequence of their disposable resource of time, their position in the receiving end of bureaucratic control and disability to be fully engaged in the society based on employment and consumption. The main character in old social movements, the industrial working class, nonetheless, is absent here in the class base of new social mobilizations.

==Criticism==
Some sociologists, like [[Paul Bagguley]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and [[Nelson Pichardo]],&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt; criticize NSM theory for a number of reasons, including:
# the movements concerned with non-materialistic issues existed (in one extent or another) during the industrial period and traditional movements, concerned with economic well-being, still exist today,&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;
# there are few unique characteristics of the new social movements, when compared to the traditional movements,&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;
# differences between older and newer movements have been explained by older theories,&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;
# there is doubt in terms of whether contemporary movements are specifically a product of postindustrial society,&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;
# NSM focuses almost exclusively on [[left-wing]] movements and does not consider [[right-wing]],&lt;ref name="Pic"/&gt;
# the term "new middle class" is amorphous and not consistently defined,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and
# might be better viewed as a certain instance of social movement theory rather than a brand new one.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

In [[electronics]], a '''nullator''' is a theoretical [[linear]], [[time-invariant]] [[one-port]] ''defined'' as having zero [[Electric current|current]] and [[voltage]] across its terminals.  Nullators are strange in the sense that they simultaneously have properties of both a [[short circuit|short]] (zero voltage) and an [[wiktionary:open circuit|open circuit]] (zero current). They are neither current nor voltage sources, yet both at the same time.&lt;ref name=Verhoeven&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Inserting a nullator in a circuit schematic imposes a ''mathematical constraint'' on how that circuit must behave, forcing the circuit itself to adopt whatever arrangements needed to meet the condition. For example, the inputs of an ideal [[operational amplifier]] (with negative feedback) behave like a nullator, as they draw no current and have no voltage across them, and these conditions are used to analyze the circuitry surrounding the operational amplifier.

A nullator is normally paired with a [[norator]] to form a [[nullor]].

Two trivial cases are worth noting: A nullator in parallel with a norator is equivalent to a short (zero voltage any current) and a nullator in series with a norator is an open circuit (zero current, any voltage).

[[Nilli Lavie]] presented the '''perceptual load theory''' in the mid-nineties as a potential resolution to the early/late selection debate.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Tsal|first2=Yehoshua|title=Perceptual load as a major determinant of the locus of selection in visual attention|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1994|volume=56|issue=2|pages=183–197|url=http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/Lavie%20&amp;%20Tsal_1994.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.3758/bf03213897}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= two&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|title=Perceptual load as a necessary condition for selective attention|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1995|volume=21|issue=3|pages=451–468|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fb33/666f554fca9ef4b0da105dc493a9c70edbe0.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.3.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate can be summated through two questions, firstly; when in the information processing stream does attention select target information? Secondly; to what degree do distractor stimuli get processed? Prior to Lavie’s theory there were several other suggestions as to how targets are perceived amongst distractor stimuli.

Researcher’s such as Donald Broadbent &lt;ref name= three&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broadbent|first1=Donald. E|title=Perception and Communication|date=1958|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that selection occurs during the early stages of processing by suggesting that information has to go through a sensory filter, and as that filter has a limited capacity all information that is not directly attended to will decay. Whilst researchers such as Deutsch and Deutsch argued that this filtering &lt;ref name= four&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=J. A.|last2=Deutsch|first2=D|title=Attention: some theoretical considerations|journal=Psychological Review|date=Jan 1963|volume=70|issue=1|pages=80–90|doi=10.1037/h0039515}}&lt;/ref&gt; of irrelevant stimuli occurs in the late stages of processing, in that, all of the information is processed on a sensory level but just before the level of working memory the semantic content of the message is the filter. 
Lavie attempts to resolve this debate by stating that both early and late selection occur varying on the stimulus presented.

From the perspective of perceptual load theory stimulus variation means whether the stimulus has high or low perceptual load. Perceptual load refers to the complexity of the physical stimuli, particularly the distractor stimuli e.g. a square surrounded by circles is a scene with low perceptual load whereas a square surrounded by lots of different shapes has high perceptual load. Due to the assumed limited capacity of attentional resources and that distractors have to be processed before the target it is suggested that, in high load tasks the targets attentional resources are depleted faster therefore being able to attend to the target sooner compared to a low load task. This is because the low load task needs to process more of the distractors to exhaust mental resources, therefore the distractors cause a greater inference in finding the target. This demonstrates that selection occurs both in the early stages of processing (high load condition) when the degree of inference is low as the majority of the resources process the target and enables the individual to ignore distractors. As well as the late stages (low load condition) when the distractors are perceived because they take up fewer attentional resources and as such spill over to the distractors which results in them being perceived, causing an interference.&lt;ref name= five&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartwright-finch|first1=Ula|last2=Lavie|first2=Nilli|title=The role of perceptual load in inattentional blindness|journal=Cognition|date=2007|volume=102|issue=3|pages=321–340|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.01.002|pmid=16480973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= six&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Hirst|first2=A|last3=de Fockhert|first3=J.

==Key assumptions==

Perceptual load theory makes three main assumptions, these are;&lt;ref name= one /&gt;&lt;ref name= two /&gt;

# Attentional resources are limited in capacity.
# Task-relevant stimuli are processed before task-irrelevant stimuli. 
# That all of the attentional resources have to be used up.

Therefore, if the task-relevant stimulus uses all of the attentional resources then none of the task-irrelevant stimuli (distractors) will be processed.

==Criticisms==

In spite of the collection of research that has accumulated over the 90’s and early 2000’s there has been a counter argument posited by Lavie’s PhD supervisor, Tsal Yehoshua. However, it should be noted that in spite of the relevance of Tsal’s critique some of the first critiques to the perceptual load theory pointed out how a visual cue can eliminate the inference effect supposedly created by perceptual load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D. N.|last2=McGrath|first2=A.|last3=McNeil|first3=C.|title=Cuing interacts with perceptual load in visual search|journal=Psychological Science|date=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=284–287|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00452|pmid=12009052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paquet|first1=L|last2=Craig|first2=G.

===Dilution Effects===

Primarily; the critique that Tsal makes is that perceptual load theory is not a solution to the early selection versus late selection debate but rather is purely an early selection model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benoni|first1=H|last2=Tsal|first2=Y|title=Conceptual and methodological concerns in the theory of perceptual load|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2013|volume=4|page=522|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00522|pmid=23964262|pmc=3741554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggested reason that causes the inference rates to change between simple versus complex displays is dilution not load.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsal|first1=Y|last2=Benoni|first2=H|title=Where have we gone wrong? Perceptual load does not affect selective attention|journal=Vision Research|date=2010|volume=50|issue=13|pages=1292–1298|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.04.018|pmid=20430048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that the high load condition has lower inference because the higher number/more complex distractors, not because of perceptual load. This was tested in a series of experiments &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; which took the classic perceptual load experiments &lt;ref name= one /&gt; and added a new condition, the dilution condition. The way this condition varied is that it makes the distractors in the task the same colour, and making that colour differ from the target letter. This creates a condition that is low in load, and high in dilution and thus isolates dilution as a variable. The result of this manipulation was not that of a higher inference rate in low perceptual load conditions comparative to high as seen in the original perceptual load experiments. Rather that inference levels were significantly lower in the low load and dilution conditions compared to the high load.

===Distractor Salience===

Another proposed theory to explain results attained by Lavie’s original experiments is that of distractor salience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eltiti|first1=Stacy|last2=Wallace|first2=Denise|last3=Fox|first3=Elaine|title=Selective target processing: Perceptual load or distractor salience?|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=2005|volume=67|issue=5|pages=876–885|doi=10.3758/bf03193540}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests this theory concerns the salience, or prominence, of a distractor as being the primary factor in inducing these results instead of load. By manipulating the onset versus offset of the distractor, research displayed the effect of salience on selective information. In this research onset and offset differed in terms of when the distractor was presented, either simultaneously with the singleton search task (onset) or having it appear with a fixation point before the task (offset). This resulted in an inference effect on reaction times when searching for the target in the onset condition regardless of whether the trial was a high load trial or a low load trial. This demonstrates that the effect seen in Lavie’s work &lt;ref name= one /&gt; is not as a result of load manipulation, but of distractor salience.

===Methodological Issues===

There are also some crucial methodological issues with perceptual load theory research pertaining to experimental design.&lt;ref name= two /&gt;&lt;ref name= five /&gt;&lt;ref name= six /&gt;&lt;ref name= seven /&gt;&lt;ref name= eight /&gt; Specifically, the use of a blocked design compared to a mixed design in the experiments. In this case, blocked experimental design is when all of the trials with either low or high perceptual load are carried out sequentially within a block of trials. Whereas, a mixed experimental design has combination of both low and high perceptual load trials that are randomly intermixed within a block of trials. The issue with using a blocked design is that the repetition of the same experimental condition can allow for attention to be localised in one particular spot. Research has shown that when conducting a perceptual load task under a mixed design there is no significant difference in interference between low load and high load conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Janice E|last2=Jones|first2=Craig|title=Attention to local form information can prevent access to semantic information|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=2010|volume=55|issue=2|pages=609–625|doi=10.1080/02724980143000370|pmid=12047062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, suggesting that when the trials are blocked it is not perceptual load that causes the difference in interference rather how localised the participants field of attention was. This has since been expanded and developed by &lt;ref name= nineteen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Perceptual load vs. dilution: the roles of attentional focus, stimulus category, and target predictability|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=June 2013|volume=4|pages=1–14|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00327|pmid=23761777|pmc=3675768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Identifying Visual Targets Amongst Interfering Distractors: Sorting Out the Roles of Perceptual Load, Dilution, and Attentional Zoom|journal=Attention, Pereception, and Psychophsics|date=2016|volume=78|issue=7|pages=1822–38|doi=10.3758/s13414-016-1149-9|pmid=27250363}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be coined as ‘Attentional Zoom’.

===Attentional Zoom===

As previously discussed attentional zoom was coined by researchers Zhe Chen and Kyle Cave as an alternative explanation to the results seen in perceptual load theory. The pair also critique other attempts into understanding the data presented by perceptual load theory, such as dilution.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Attentional zoom theory states that participants can process distractors when they are within their attentional focus. So when an individual is induced to have a small attentional focus and the distractors fall outside of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eriksen|first1=Charles W|last2=St James|first2=J. D.|title=Visual attention within and around the field of focal attention: A zoom lens model|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1986|volume=40|issue=4|page=225|doi=10.3758/BF03211502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise for a larger attentional focus that incorporates distractors a higher level of inference is seen. This can be demonstrated as separate from dilution as in &lt;ref name= nineteen /&gt; dilution through luminance decrease had no effect on distractor processing whilst being cued as to whether a target would appear in either one of two locations or one of six did. According to dilution theory the two trials should be show similar levels of inference regardless of cueing, however, what this experiment reveals is that when cued for two locations the attentional focus of the participants narrowed, thus reducing the effect of the distractor as it was outside the attentional view. Whereas, when the target was cued for six the attentional focus was forced to widen and as such the distractor could be processed causing an inference effect.

[[File:Test_inducer.png|thumb|right|An inducer designed for testing in water tunnels]]
An '''inducer''' is the [[Axis of rotation|axial]] inlet portion of a [[centrifugal pump]] rotor, the function of which is to raise the inlet [[pressure head|head]] by an amount sufficient to prevent significant [[cavitation]] in the following pump stage.&lt;ref name=nasa_sp8052&gt;{{cite book|title=NASA SP-8052 Liquid rocket engine turbopump inducers|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in applications in which the inlet [[pressure]] of a pump is close to the [[vapor pressure]] of the pumped liquid. Inducers are frequently included in design of [[turbopump]]s for liquid propellant [[rocket engines]], although they are used in other applications which require high suction performance.&lt;ref name=Japikse2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Japikse|first=David|title=Overview of Industrial and Rocket Turbopump Inducer Design|url=http://caltechconf.library.caltech.edu/101/1/OV-Turbopump.pdf|publisher=Concepts NREC|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Inducer_tip_vortex_cavitation.png|thumb|right|An inducer operating in an experimental water tunnel. The tip vortex cavitation phenomenon can be clearly identified.]]

== Use in rocketry ==
In order to achieve high [[delta-v]], the structural mass of a [[launch vehicle]] should be as low as possible. Liquid fuel tanks can be constructed lighter if the pressure within those tanks is kept low. Typically, for pump-fed rocket engines, the propellant tank pressures (and masses) are 1/10 to 1/40 of those in a pressure-fed rocket.&lt;ref name=sutton2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=Rocket propulsion elements (7th ed.)|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley&amp;Sons|pages=218, 363|url=http://web.mit.edu/e_peters/Public/Rockets/Rocket_Propulsion_Elements.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102204553/http://web.mit.edu/e_peters/Public/Rockets/Rocket_Propulsion_Elements.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structural weight constraint also makes the rotating speed of the [[turbopump]] rotor as high as possible. For example, the rotating speed of the oxygen turbopump of the Japanese [[LE-7]] rocket engine is 18300rpm.&lt;ref name=sutton2001 /&gt; These two factors above combine to make the pump impeller very susceptible to cavitation. If cavitation occurs in the impeller, the performance of the pump will be severely degraded and the pump itself may be damaged.

From a theoretical point of view, any language that can be parsed in [[PTIME|polynomial time]] belongs to the subset of RCG called positive range concatenation grammars, and reciprocally.&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|page=37}} citing http://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/publications/2001d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though intended as a variant on Groenink's [[Literal movement grammar]]s, RCGs treat the grammatical process more as a proof than as a production. Whereas LMGs produce a terminal string from a start predicate, RCGs aim to reduce a start predicate (which predicates of a terminal string) to the empty string, which constitutes a proof of the terminal strings membership in the language.

==Description==

=== Formal definition ===
A '''Positive Range Concatenation Grammar''' (PRCG) is a tuple &lt;math&gt; G = (N,~T,~V,~S,~P)&lt;/math&gt;, where:
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint finite sets of (respectively) ''predicate names'', ''terminal symbols'' and ''variable names''. Each predicate name has an associated arity given by the function &lt;math&gt;\dim: N \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;S \in N&lt;/math&gt; is the start predicate name and verify &lt;math&gt;\dim(S)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''clauses'' of the form &lt;math&gt;\psi_0 \rightarrow \psi_1 \ldots \psi_m&lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;\psi_i&lt;/math&gt; are ''predicates'' of the form &lt;math&gt;A_i(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{\dim(A_i)})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A_i \in N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in (T \cup V)^\star&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''Negative Range Concatenation Grammar''' (NRCG) is defined like a PRCG, but with the addition that some predicates occurring in the right-hand side of a clause can have the form &lt;math&gt;\overline{A_i(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{\dim(A_i)})}&lt;/math&gt;. Such predicates are called ''negative predicates''.

A '''Range Concatenation Grammar''' is a positive or a negative one. Although PRCGs are technically NRCGs, the terms are used to highlight the absence (PRCG) or presence (NRCG) of negative predicates.

A '''range''' in a word &lt;math&gt;w \in T^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a couple &lt;math&gt;\langle l, r \rangle_w&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;0 \leq l \leq r \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the length of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. Two ranges &lt;math&gt;\langle l_1, r_1 \rangle_w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle l_2, r_2 \rangle_w&lt;/math&gt; can be concatenated iff &lt;math&gt;r_1 = l_2&lt;/math&gt;, and we then have: &lt;math&gt;\langle l_1, r_1 \rangle_w \cdot \langle l_2, r_2 \rangle_w = \langle l_1, r_2 \rangle_w&lt;/math&gt;.

For a word &lt;math&gt;w = w_1w_2\ldots w_n&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;w_i \in T&lt;/math&gt;, the '''dotted notation''' for ranges is: &lt;math&gt;\langle l, r \rangle_w = w_1\ldots w_{l-1} \bullet w_l\ldots w_{r-1} \bullet w_r\ldots w_n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Recognition of strings ===
Like LMGs, RCG clauses have the general schema &lt;math&gt;A(x_1, ..., x_n) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where in an RCG, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is either the empty string or a string of predicates. The arguments &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; consist of strings of terminal symbols and/or variable symbols, which pattern match against actual argument values like in LMG. Adjacent variables constitute a family of matches against partitions, so that the argument &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;, with two variables, matches the literal string &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; in three different ways: &lt;math&gt;x = \epsilon,\ y = ab;\ x = a,\ y = b;\ x = ab,\ y = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Predicate terms come in two forms, positive (which produce the empty string on success), and negative (which produce the empty string on failure/if the positive term does ''not'' produce the empty string). Negative terms are denoted the same as positive terms, with an overbar, as in &lt;math&gt;\overline{A(x_1, ..., x_n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The rewrite semantics for RCGs is rather simple, identical to the corresponding semantics of LMGs. Given a predicate string &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where the symbols &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are terminal strings, if there is a rule &lt;math&gt;A(x_1, ..., x_n) \to \beta&lt;/math&gt; in the grammar that the predicate string matches, the predicate string is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, substituting for the matched variables in each &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, given the rule &lt;math&gt;A(x, ayb) \to B(axb, y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are variable symbols and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are terminal symbols, the predicate string &lt;math&gt;A(a, abb)&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;B(aab, b)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;A(a, abb)&lt;/math&gt; matches &lt;math&gt;A(x, ayb)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x = a,\ y = b&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, if there were a rule &lt;math&gt;A(x, ayb) \to A(x, x)\ A(y, y)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A(a, abb)&lt;/math&gt; could be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;A(a, a)\ A(b, b)&lt;/math&gt;.

A proof/recognition of a string &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is done by showing that &lt;math&gt;S(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; produces the empty string. For the individual rewrite steps, when multiple alternative variable matches are possible, any rewrite which could lead the whole proof to succeed is considered. Thus, if there is at least one way to produce the empty string from the initial string &lt;math&gt;S(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, the proof is considered a success, regardless of how many other ways to fail exist.

==Example==

RCGs are capable of recognizing the non-linear index language &lt;math&gt;\{ www : w \in \{a,b\}^{*} \}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

Letting x, y, and z be variable symbols:


&lt;math&gt;S(xyz) \to A(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A(ax, ay, az) \to A(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A(bx, by, bz) \to A(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A(\epsilon, \epsilon, \epsilon) \to \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;


The proof for ''{{not a typo|abbabbabb}}'' is then

&lt;math&gt;S(abbabbabb) \Rightarrow A(abb, abb, abb) \Rightarrow A(bb, bb, bb) \Rightarrow A(b, b, b) \Rightarrow A(\epsilon, \epsilon, \epsilon) \Rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Or, using the more correct dotted notation for ranges:

&lt;math&gt;S(\bullet{}abbabbabb\bullet{}) \Rightarrow A(\bullet{}abb\bullet{}abbabb, abb\bullet{}abb\bullet{}abb, abbabb\bullet{}abb\bullet{}) \Rightarrow A(a\bullet{}bb\bullet{}abbabb, abba\bullet{}bb\bullet{}abb, abbabba\bullet{}bb\bullet{})&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow A(ab\bullet{}b\bullet{}abbabb, abbab\bullet{}b\bullet{}abb, abbabbab\bullet{}b\bullet{}) \Rightarrow A(\epsilon, \epsilon, \epsilon) \Rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

He is a theorist who works on understanding materials, ranging from minerals to technological materials like [[ferroelectrics]]. Much of his work has centered on materials at extreme conditions, like the high pressures at the center of the Earth, and on [[transducer]] materials, used for [[sonar]] and [[medical ultrasound]]. He is one of the pioneers for applying of first-principles methods to minerals. In first-principles methods, only the atom types are input, and all properties can be computed using [[quantum mechanics]]. He also expanded the application of these methods to [[ferroelectrics]], and continues to clarify the origin of [[ferroelectric]] and [[relaxor]] behavior.

He was awarded the [[Dana Medal]] by the [[Mineralogical Society of America]] in 2009, and the Mineralogical Society of America Award in 1994. He is a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], the [[American Geophysical Union]], and the [[Mineralogical Society of America]]. He has also contributed to about 200 scientific papers, and has given about 200 invited talks around the world.

He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland with his wife Kathryn. They have three children, Daniel, Jacob, and Rebecca.

'''Shimon Fritz Bodenheimer''' ([[Hebrew]] שמעון פריץ בודנהיימר) (June 6, 1897 - October 4, 1959) was an Israeli [[entomologist]] and [[zoologist]].

==Biography==
Bodenheimer was born in [[Germany]]. His parents were [[Max Bodenheimer]], a leading [[Zionism|Zionist]], and Rosa Dalberg. He immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1922 and joined the new agricultural experimental station near Tel Aviv. When the [[Hebrew University]] opened, he was appointed head of the Institute of zoology and Entomology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7A9z54ju7aAC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=fritz+bodenheimer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zevAcjkCzB&amp;sig=iYtxVSTWzHRDX2tQaOuPJWyffAI&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0ZG2U9eEEcaO7Aav9oCwDg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=fritz%20bodenheimer&amp;f=true Dissenter in Zion: From the Writings of Judah L. Magnes, Judah Leon Magnes]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1936, Bodenheimer published ''The Biological Background of the Human Population Theory'' based on university lectures he gave in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00dDXnUck9QC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=shimon+bodenheimer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=88i-OaVnGO&amp;sig=0nv4dMRX27H2_mAwNV9GTYfgX98&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6I-2U9flNrTe7AbrtIGwDA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=shimon%20bodenheimer&amp;f=true Jews and Sciences in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9785">'''Stefan Weber''' (born 14 June 1970 in [[Salzburg]]) is an Austrian media researcher and writer. The mass media often call him "plagiarism hunter" (in German "Plagiatsjäger").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/studium/hochschule/2011-09/portraet-weber Stefan Weber: Der einsame Plagiatsjäger | Studium | ZEIT ONLINE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/interviewstefanweber100.html Plagiatsjäger Weber kritisiert "Textkultur ohne Hirn" | tagesschau.de&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wienerzeitung.at/themen_channel/wissen/forschung/45568_Johannes-Hahn-ist-ein-Viertel-Guttenberg.html "Johannes Hahn ist ein Viertel Guttenberg" - Plagiatsjäger Stefan Weber: Auf jeder vierten Seite von Hahns Dissertation ist ein Plagiatsfragment zu finden - Wiener Zeitung Onl...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Weber studied journalism and communication science at the [[University of Salzburg]] and subsequently worked in Salzburg as a journalist and university lecturer. In 2005 he completed his Habilitation at the [[University of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsjournals.de/index.php;do=show_article/sid=a3a9a3b310ac4bc5d2e3ada4e234bf1f/site=pub/area=kom/id=1098 Publizistik – Vierteljahreshefte für Kommunikationsforschung Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Weber discovered in 2005 that a Tübingen theologian, in 2004, had copied approximately half of his doctoral thesis more or less verbatim from Weber's own 1996 thesis, he launched a public media campaign to draw attention to the problem of [[plagiarism]] in academia. The Tübingen plagiarist had his doctoral degree retracted in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,382779,00.html Abgeschrieben und erwischt: Der Plagiator - SPIEGEL ONLINE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he received a criminal court sentence in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713201046/http://science.orf.at/science/news/149043 Deutscher wegen Plagiats strafrechtlich verurteilt - ORF ON Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Weber co-authored a [[Google]]-critical study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/iicm_papers/dangers_google.pdf |title=ISDS - Home |accessdate=2017-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229105054/http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/iicm_papers/dangers_google.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published the book "The Google-Copy-Paste-Syndrome".&lt;ref name="networkcultures"&gt;[http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/query/2009/06/19/brainless-text-culture-and-mickey-mouse-science/ Brainless Text Culture and Mickey Mouse Science :: Society of the Query&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Weber founded with Gerhard Fröhlich (University of Linz) the "Initiative Transparente Wissenschaft" (also "AntiPlag Austria"),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://derstandard.at/1297819768145/Plagiatsjaeger-machen-mobil Plagiatsjäger machen mobil]'' in ''Der Standard'', march 8th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which operates a website on Wikia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.antiplagaustria.wikia.com/ Initiative Transparente Wissenschaft] on ''wikia.com''&lt;/ref&gt; There, suspicious cases of scientific misconduct in Austria can collaboratively be dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philo.at/pipermail/register/2011-March/001137.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313081353/http://philo.at/pipermail/register/2011-March/001137.html |archivedate=2011-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public plagiarism allegations ==
Weber has raised allegations against several high-profile public personalities. A media sensation was created by the allegations against the then Austrian Minister for Science and Research, [[Johannes Hahn]] (see "Discussion about his PhD thesis"), in 2007, claiming that in his doctoral thesis he had "copied page per page without proper reference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsv1.orf.at/070524-12647/index.html Zitierregeln damals noch anders?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">In [[philosophy of science]], '''strong inference''' is a [[model of scientific inquiry]] that emphasizes the need for [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], rather than a single hypothesis to avoid [[confirmation bias]].

The term "strong inference" was coined by [[John R. Platt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3642|pages=347–53|year=1964|title=Strong inference| doi = 10.1126/science.146.3642.347 |pmid=17739513|author=John R. Platt|url=http://256.com/gray/docs/strong_inference.html|bibcode=1964Sci...146..347P}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Biophysics|biophysicist]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. Platt notes that some fields, such as [[molecular biology]] and [[high-energy physics]], seem to adhere strongly to strong inference, with very beneficial results for the rate of progress in those fields.

==The single hypothesis problem==

The problem with single hypotheses, [[confirmation bias]], was aptly described by [[Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin]] in 1897:
{{cquote|The moment one has offered an original explanation for a phenomenon which seems satisfactory, that moment affection for [one’s] intellectual child springs into existence, and as the explanation grows into a definite theory [one’s] parental affections cluster about [the] offspring and it grows more and more dear .... There springs up also unwittingly a pressing of the theory to make it fit the facts and a pressing of the facts to make them fit the theory...

The temptation to misinterpret results that contradict the desired hypothesis is probably irresistible. &lt;ref name="jewett2005"/&gt;}}

Despite the admonitions of Platt, reviewers of grant-applications often require "A Hypothesis" as part of the proposal (note the singular). Peer-review of research can help avoid the mistakes of single-hypotheses, but only so long as the reviewers are not in the thrall of the same hypothesis. If there is a shared enthrallment among the reviewers in a commonly believed hypothesis, then innovation becomes difficult because alternative hypotheses are not seriously considered, and sometimes not even permitted.

==Strong Inference==
&lt;!--(A note on typography: A name is capitalized ["the Dept. of Chemistry at Harvard"). "Strong Inference" is the name given by Platt to the method he describes, so both words should be capitalized.)--&gt;
The method, very similar to the [[scientific method]], is described as:
# Devising alternative [[hypotheses]];
# Devising a [[Experimentum crucis|crucial experiment]] (or several of them), with alternative possible outcomes, each of which will, as nearly as possible, exclude one or more of the hypotheses;
# Carrying out the experiment(s) so as to get a clean result;
# Recycling the procedure, making subhypotheses or sequential hypotheses to refine the possibilities that remain, and so on.

==Criticisms==
The original paper outlining strong inference has been criticized, particularly for overstating the degree that certain fields used this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Donohue|first=William|author-link=William O'Donohue|last2=Buchanan|first2=Jeffrey A.|date=|year=2001|title=The weaknesses of strong inference|url=http://www.behavior.org/resource.php?id=102|journal=Behavior and Philosophy|publisher=Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies|volume=29|pages=1–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|year=2006|title=Strong Inference: rationale or inspiration?|volume=49|number=2|pages=238–250|author=Rowland H. Davis|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/perspectives_in_biology_and_medicine/v049/49.2davis01.html|doi=10.1353/pbm.2006.0022|pmid=16702707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong inference plus==
The limitations of Strong-Inference can be corrected by having two preceding phases:&lt;ref name="jewett2005"/&gt;
# An exploratory phase: at this point information is inadequate so observations are chosen randomly or intuitively or based on [[List of scientific method topics#Scientific creativity|scientific creativity]].
# A pilot phase: in this phase [[statistical power]] is determined by replicating experiments under identical experimental conditions.
These phases create the critical seed observation(s) upon which one can base alternative hypotheses.&lt;ref name="jewett2005"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 2005|title=What’s wrong with single hypotheses? Why it is time for Strong-Inference-PLUS|author=Don L. Jewett

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4987">In [[particle physics]], a '''superpartner''' (also '''sparticle''') is a class of hypothetical [[elementary particle]]s. [[Supersymmetry]] is one of the synergistic theories in current [[high-energy physics]] that predicts the existence of these "shadow" particles.&lt;ref name="physics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

When considering extensions of the [[Standard Model]], the ''s-'' prefix from ''sparticle'' is used to form names of superpartners of the Standard Model [[fermion]]s ([[sfermions]]),&lt;ref name=Studenikin&gt;Alexander I. Studenikin (ed.), ''Particle Physics in Laboratory, Space and Universe'', World Scientific, 2005, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. the [[stop squark]]. The superpartners of Standard Model [[bosons]] have an ''-ino'' ('''bosinos'''&lt;!--'Bosino' and 'Bosinos' redirect here--&gt;)&lt;ref name=Studenikin/&gt; appended to their name, e.g. [[gluino]], the set of all gauge superpartners are called the [[gaugino|gauginos]].

== Theoretical predictions ==
According to the [[supersymmetry]] theory, each [[fermion]] should have a partner [[boson]], the fermion's superpartner, and each boson should have a partner fermion. Exact ''unbroken'' supersymmetry would predict that a particle and its superpartners would have the same mass. No superpartners of the [[Standard Model]] particles have yet been found. This may indicate that supersymmetry is incorrect, or it may also be the result of the fact that supersymmetry is not an exact, ''unbroken'' symmetry of nature. If superpartners are found, their masses would indicate the scale at which supersymmetry is broken.&lt;ref name="physics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican" /&gt;

For particles that are real scalars (such as an [[axion]]), there is a fermion superpartner as well as a second, real scalar field.  For axions, these particles are often referred to as axinos and saxions.

In extended supersymmetry there may be more than one superparticle for a given particle. For instance, with two copies of supersymmetry in four dimensions, a photon would have two fermion superpartners and a scalar superpartner.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In zero dimensions it is possible to have supersymmetry, but no superpartners. However, this is the only situation where supersymmetry does not imply the existence of superpartners.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Recreating superpartners ==
If the supersymmetry theory is correct, it should be possible to recreate these particles in high-energy [[particle accelerator]]s. Doing so will not be an easy task; these particles may have masses up to a thousand times greater than their corresponding "real" particles.&lt;ref name="physics" /&gt; 

Some researchers have hoped the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] might produce evidence for the existence of superpartner particles.&lt;ref name="physics" /&gt; However, as of 2018, no such evidence has been found.

[[File:Auklet flock Shumagins 1986.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A flock of [[auklet]]s exhibit swarm behaviour]]

'''Swarm behaviour''', or '''swarming''', is a [[Collective animal behaviour|collective behaviour]] exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving ''en masse'' or [[Animal migration|migrating]] in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.&lt;ref name=Bouffanais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bouffanais|first1=Roland|title=Design and Control of Swarm Dynamics|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-287-750-5|edition=First|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789812877505}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term, ''swarming'' is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term ''[[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]'' or ''murmuration'' can refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, ''[[herd behaviour|herding]]'' to refer to swarm behaviour in [[tetrapods]], and [[shoaling and schooling|''shoaling'' or ''schooling'']] to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. [[Phytoplankton]] also gather in huge swarms called [[Algal bloom|''blooms'']], although these organisms are [[algae]] and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term “swarm” is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a [[Swarm robotics|robot swarm]], an [[earthquake swarm]], or a swarm of stars.

From a more abstract point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion of a large number of [[Self-propelled particles|self-propelled entities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = O'Loan|author2 = Evans|doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|title = Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking|year = 1998|journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General|volume = 32|issue = 8|pages = L99–L105|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode = 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an [[emergence|emergent]] behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by [[active matter]] physicists as a phenomenon which is not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the [[statistical physics]] of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Swarm behaviour was first simulated on a computer in 1986 with the simulation program [[boids]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reynolds CW | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | isbn = 0-89791-227-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The model was originally designed to mimic the flocking behaviour of birds, but it can be applied also to schooling fish and other swarming entities.

==Models==

{{See also|Collective animal behaviour}}

In recent decades, scientists have turned to modeling swarm behaviour to gain a deeper understanding of the behaviour.

===Mathematical models===
[[File:Metric vs topological distance in schools of fish.png|right|thumb|400px|In the [[metric distance]] model of a [[fish school]] (left), the focal fish (yellow) pays attention to all fish within the small zone of repulsion (red), the zone of alignment (lighter red) and the larger zone of attraction (lightest red). In the [[Topological space|topological distance]] model (right), the focal fish only pays attention to the six or seven closest fish (green), regardless of their distance.]]

|image3=[http://www.aridolan.com/ofiles/Efloys.aspx Efloys simulation]}}
Early studies of swarm behaviour employed mathematical models to simulate and understand the behaviour. The simplest mathematical models of animal swarms generally represent individual animals as following three rules:
* Move in the same direction as their neighbours
* Remain close to their neighbours
* Avoid collisions with their neighbours

The [[boids]] computer program, created by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, simulates swarm behaviour following the above rules.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Many subsequent and current models use variations on these rules, often implementing them by means of concentric "zones" around each animal. In the "zone of repulsion", very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbours to avoid collision. Slightly further away, in the "zone of alignment", the focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. In the outermost "zone of attraction", which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seek to move towards a neighbour.

The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of a given animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish rely on both vision and on [[hydrodynamic]] perceptions relayed through their [[lateral line]]s, while Antarctic [[krill]] rely both on vision and hydrodynamic signals relayed through [[antenna (biology)|antennae]].

However recent studies of starling flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are.&lt;ref name="Ballerini et al"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711437105 |vauthors=Ballerini M, Cabibbo N, Candelier R, Cavagna A, Cisbani E, Giardina I, Lecomte V, Orlandi A, Parisi G, Procaccini A, Viale M, Zdravkovic V |title= Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=1232–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18227508 |pmc=2234121|arxiv = 0709.1916 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.1232B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a [[topological]], rather than a metric, rule. It remains to be seen whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high-speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildenbrandt H, Carere C, Hemelrijk CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemelrijk CK, Hildenbrandt H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode=2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index|title=Zwermen en scholen - Swarming - Permanente expo - Bezoek onze expo's &amp; workshops! - Science LinX - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk|title=Onderzoek aan de Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Over ons - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary models===
In order to gain insight into why animals evolve swarming behaviours, scientists have turned to evolutionary models that simulate populations of evolving animals. Typically these studies use a [[genetic algorithm]] to simulate [[evolution]] over many generations. These studies have investigated a number of hypotheses attempting to explain why animals evolve swarming behaviours, such as the [[selfish herd theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Critical Interplay Between Density-dependent Predation and Evolution of the Selfish Herd | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2463372.2463394 | journal = Proceedings of GECCO 2013 | pages = 247–254 | doi = 10.1145/2463372.2463394 | isbn = 9781450319638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ward CR, Gobet F, Kendall G | year = 2001 | title = Evolving collective behavior in an artificial ecology | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=569757 | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–209 | doi = 10.1162/106454601753139005 | pmid=11580880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reluga TC, Viscido S | year = 2005 | title = Simulated evolution of selfish herd behavior | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304005715 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 234 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–225 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.035 | pmid=15757680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wood AJ, Ackland GJ | year = 2007 | title = Evolving the selfish herd: emergence of distinct aggregating strategies in an individual-based model | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1618/1637 | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 274 | issue = 1618 | pages = 1637–1642 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2007.0306 | pmid=17472913 | pmc=2169279}}&lt;/ref&gt; the predator confusion effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Hintze A, Dyer FC, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviour | url = http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/85/20130305 | journal = J.

===Emergence===
{{Main|Emergence}}

The concept of emergence—that the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind [[Self-organization|self-organizing systems]].&lt;ref name="importance-ppt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/wdorsey-88049-hierarchy-life-biology-education-ppt-powerpoint/ |accessdate=6 October 2009 |title=Hierarchy of Life |date=14 September 2008 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]] leading to emergence in the natural world occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scents from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviours and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.

===Stigmergy===
{{Main|Stigmergy}}

A further key concept in the field of swarm intelligence is [[stigmergy]].&lt;ref name="Parunak2003"&gt;Parunak, H. v D. (2003). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.1990&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf  "Making swarming happen"] In: Proceedings of Conference on Swarming and Network Enabled Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), McLean, Virginia, USA, 3 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsh2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marsh L. |author2=Onof C. | year = 2008 | title = Stigmergic epistemology, stigmergic cognition | url = http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10004/1/3z2fx4r7prqwob3vfdq.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 136–149 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogsys.2007.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of each other.&lt;ref name=Marsh2007 /&gt;

===Swarm intelligence===
{{Main|Swarm intelligence}}

[[Swarm intelligence]] is the [[collective behaviour]] of [[decentralization|decentralized]], [[Self-organization|self-organized]] systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on [[artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by [[Gerardo Beni]] and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of [[Cellular automaton|cellular robotic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beni, G., Wang, J. Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems, Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26–30 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm intelligence systems are typically made up of a population of simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] such as [[boids]] interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the [[emergence]] of intelligent global behaviour, unknown to the individual agents.

Swarm intelligence research is multidisciplinary. It can be divided into natural swarm research studying biological systems and artificial swarm research studying human artefacts.

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralized coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time.&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995" /&gt; SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buhl J, ((Sumpter DJT)), Couzin D, Hale JJ, Despland E, Miller ER, Simpson SJ | display-authors = etal | year = 2006 | title = From disorder to order in marching locusts | url = http://webscript.princeton.edu/~icouzin/website/wp-content/plugins/bib2html/data/papers/buhl06.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5778| pages = 1402–1406 | doi = 10.1126/science.1125142 | pmid = 16741126 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1402B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarming systems give rise to [[emergent behaviour]]s which occur at many different scales, some of which are both universal and robust.

[[Particle swarm optimization]] is another algorithm widely used to solve problems related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by [[James Kennedy (social psychologist)|Kennedy]] and [[Russell C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the [[Candidate solution|problem space]] through successive generations using [[stochastic optimization]] to find the best solutions. The solutions it finds are called [[Point particle|particles]]. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the [[Maxima and minima|best local value]] obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple [[mathematical formulae|mathematical rules]]. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications.&lt;ref&gt;Hu X [http://www.swarmintelligence.org/tutorials.php Particle swarm optimization: Tutorial].

===Insects===
[[File:Mueckenschwarm 50p 1600kbit.ogv|thumb|right|Swarm of [[nematocera]], flying around a treetop]]

The behaviour of insects that live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, has always been a source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner.&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts&gt;Bonabeau E and Theraulaz G (2008) "Swarm Smarts". In ''Your Future with Robots'' Scientific American Special Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely [[Self-organization|self-organized]]. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts /&gt;

====Ants====
[[File:Ants eating fruit.jpg|thumb|right|A swarm of [[ant]]s which have discovered a food source]]
{{See also|Ant colony|Ant colony optimization|Ant mill|Ant robotics|Artificial ants}}

Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet a colony of ants collectively achieves complex tasks such as constructing nests, taking care of their young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czaczkes|first1=T.J.|last2=Grüter|first2=C.|last3=Ratnieks|first3=F. L. W.|title=Trail pheromones: an integrative view of their role in colony organisation|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=581–599|doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-010814-020627|pmid=25386724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of the best food source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a [[pheromone]] chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beckers|first1=R.|last2=Deneubourg|first2=J. L.|last3=Goss|first3=S|title=Modulation of trail laying in the ant Lasius niger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and its role in the collective selection of a food source|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1993|volume=6|issue=6|pages=751–759|doi=10.1007/BF01201674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for the best food source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source are more likely to be those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=S.|last2=Aron|first2=S.|last3=Deneubourg|first3=J. L.|last4=Pasteels|first4=J.

The successful techniques used by [[ant]] colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems. This area of [[biomimetics]] has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of "foraging trails", fault-tolerant storage and networking algorithms.&lt;ref name="SANdisk"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicke E, Byde A, Cliff D, Layzell P |year=2004 |chapter=An ant-inspired technique for storage area network design |title=Proceedings of Biologically Inspired Approaches to Advanced Information Technology: First International Workshop, BioADIT 2004 LNCS 3141 |pages=364–379 |editor1=A.

{{Main|Bees algorithm|Swarming (honey bee)}}

When a honey bee swarm emerges from a hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a suitable new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the [[waggle dance]] to indicate direction and distance to others in the cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as ''[[Apis dorsata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=BP|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of ''Apis dorsata'' Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=1998|volume=47|pages=94–95|doi=10.1007/s000400050015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.&lt;ref&gt;Milius, Susan [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/43117/title/Swarm_Savvy Swarm Savvy], How bees, ants and other animals avoid dumb collective decisions; Science News, May 9th, 2009; Vol.175 #10 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081003081637.htm Bee Swarms Follow High-speed 'Streaker' Bees To Find A New Nest]; ScienceDaily (Nov. 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = Thomas D. | last2 = Visscher | first2 = P.

====Cockroaches====
Similar to ants, [[cockroach]]es leave chemical trails in their faeces as well as emitting airborne [[pheromones]] for swarming and mating. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches can exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent behaviour]],&lt;ref name="viegas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessdate=10 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704111419/http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which group or swarm behaviour emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and other European institutions created a set of tiny [[robot]]s that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]]. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Locusts====
[[File:Schwarm Wanderheuschrecke.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th century depiction of a swarm of [[desert locust]]s]]
{{see also|Marching locusts}}

''[[Locusts]]'' are the swarming phase of the short-horned [[grasshopper]]s of the family [[Acrididae]]. Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly [[pest (organism)|damaging crops]]. The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2&amp;nbsp;grams) in plants every day. That means one million locusts can eat more than one ton of food each day, and the largest swarms can consume over 100,000 [[tonne]]s each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/locust.html Locust ''Locustidae''] ''National Geographic''. Retrieved 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming in locusts has been found to be associated with increased levels of [[serotonin]] which causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, become mutually attracted, and breed much more easily. Researchers propose that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding and studies have shown that increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs or, in some species, simply encountering other individuals causes an increase in levels of serotonin. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety can be induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7858996.stm|title=Locust swarms 'high' on serotonin|date=29 January 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.00648 |vauthors=Rogers SM, Matheson T, Despland E, Dodgson T, Burrows M, Simpson SJ |date = November 2003|title=Mechanosensory-induced behavioural gregarization in the desert locust ''Schistocerca gregaria'' |journal=J.

An individual locust's response to a loss of alignment in the group appears to increase the randomness of its motion, until an aligned state is again achieved.

====Insect migration====
[[File:Monarch flock.jpg|thumb|Cluster of [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]]. Monarch butterflies migrate to [[Santa Cruz, California]] where they [[overwinter]]]]
{{Main|Insect migration}}
{{see also|Lepidoptera migration}}
[[Insect migration]] is the seasonal movement of [[insect]]s, particularly those by species of [[dragonflies]], [[beetle]]s, [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s. The distance can vary from species to species, but in most cases these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from [[bird migration]].

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates both north and south as the birds do on a regular basis. But no single individual makes the entire round trip. Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Robert Michael, "National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies", p712-713, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, {{ISBN|0-394-51914-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as [[diapause]] and may live seven months or more.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |title=Monarch, Danaus plexippus |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121215095741/http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |archivedate=2012-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of the position of the sun in the sky&lt;ref&gt;Gugliotta, Guy (2003): [http://ipm.osu.edu/trans/053_231.htm Butterflies Guided By Body Clocks, Sun Scientists Shine Light on Monarchs' Pilgrimage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305034410/http://ipm.osu.edu/trans/053_231.htm |date=2006-03-05 }}.

{{See also|Reverse migration (birds)}}

Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sekercioglu, C.H.|year=2007|title=Conservation ecology: area trumps mobility in fragment bird extinctions|journal=Current Biology |volume=17|pages=R283–R286|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.019|pmid=17437705|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]]es than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.

Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it is assumed that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V formation is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long [[Bird migration|migratory]] routes. All the birds except the first fly in the [[upwash]] from one of the [[wingtip vortices]] of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a [[V formation]] save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090521201002/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA401264 Drag Reduction from Formation Flight.

Other animals may use similar drafting techniques when migrating. [[Lobster]]s, for example, migrate in close single-file formation "lobster trains", sometimes for hundreds of miles.

The Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s and storks pass through areas such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Falsterbo]], and the [[Bosphorus]] at migration times. More common species, such as the [[European honey buzzard]], can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the [[Central America]]n migratory bottleneck. This concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the [[passenger pigeon]]. During migration the flocks were a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide and 300 miles (500&amp;nbsp;km) long, taking several days to pass and containing up to a billion birds.

}}

The term "shoal" can be used to describe any group of fish, including mixed-species groups, while "school" is used for more closely knit groups of the same species swimming in a highly synchronised and polarised manner.

Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of capture), enhanced [[foraging]] success, and higher success in finding a mate.&lt;ref name="Pitcher 1993"&gt;Pitcher TJ and Parish JK (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22Behaviour+of+teleost+fishes%22+%22%22Functions+of+shoaling+behaviour+in+teleosts%22%22&amp;num=50&amp;ei=JzYKSpyWM42GkQSM992bBA "Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts"] In: Pitcher TJ (ed) ''Behaviour of teleost fishes''. Chapman and Hall, New York, pp 363–440&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased [[hydrodynamic]] efficiency.&lt;ref name="Hoare et al. 2000"&gt;Hoare DJ, Krause J, Peuhkuri N and Godin JGJ (2000) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119004845/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ''Body size and shoaling in fish''] Journal of Fish Biology, 57(6) 1351-1366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish use many traits to choose shoalmates. Generally they prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognised). The "oddity effect" posits that any shoal member that stands out in appearance will be preferentially targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble them. The oddity effect would thus tend to homogenise shoals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snekser JL, Ruhl N, Bauer K, McRobert SP | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Sex and Phenotype on Shoaling Decisions in Zebrafish | url = http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 23 | issue =  | pages = 70–81 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725190329/http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One puzzling aspect of shoal selection is how a fish can choose to join a shoal of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance. Experiments with [[zebrafish]] have shown that shoal preference is a learned ability, not innate. A zebrafish tends to associate with shoals that resemble shoals in which it was reared, a form of [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engeszer RE, Ryan MJ, Parichy DM | year = 2004 | title = Learned Social Preference in Zebrafish | url = http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/ryan/Publications/2004/2004CurrBiol14%20881.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 10| pages = 881–884 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.042 | pmid = 15186744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open questions of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals are responsible for the direction of shoal movement. In the case of [[fish migration|migratory]] movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of [[golden shiner]] (a kind of [[minnow]]) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1314 |author=Reebs, S.G. |title=Can a minority of informed leaders determine the foraging movements of a fish shoal? |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=403–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10675263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 4.8 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre. That's several billion fish in one school.&lt;ref&gt;Radakov DV (1973) ''Schooling in the ecology of fish.'' Israel Program for Scientific Translation, translated by Mill H.

Between May and July huge numbers of [[sardine]]s spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and then follow a current of cold water northward along the east coast of South Africa. This great migration, called the [[sardine run]], creates spectacular feeding frenzies along the coastline as marine predators, such as dolphins, sharks and gannets attack the schools.

====Krill====
[[File:Krill swarm.jpg|right|thumb|Swarming [[krill]]]]

Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Current Biology |year=2006 |volume=16 |pmid=16461267 |issue=3 |pages=83–4 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.044 |title=Satiation gives krill that sinking feeling |author1=Geraint A. Tarling  |author2=Magnus L. Johnson |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;Howard, D.: "[http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1198/chapters/133-140_Krill.pdf Krill]", pp.&amp;nbsp;133–140 in Karl, H.A. et al.

====Copepods====
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|right|This copepod has its antenna spread (click to enlarge). The antenna detects the pressure wave of an approaching fish.]]
{{See also|Hunting copepods}}

[[Copepod]]s are a group of tiny [[crustacean]]s found in the sea and lakes. Many species are [[plankton]]ic (drifting in sea waters), and others are [[benthos|benthic]] (living on the ocean floor). Copepods are typically {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2}} long, with a teardrop shaped body and large [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Although like other crustaceans they have an armoured [[exoskeleton]], they are so small that in most species this thin armour, and the entire body, is almost totally transparent. Copepods have a compound, median single eye, usually bright red, in the centre of the transparent head.

Copepods also swarm. For example, monospecific swarms have been observed regularly around [[coral reef]]s and [[sea grass]], and in lakes. Swarms densities were about one million copepods per cubic metre. Typical swarms were one or two metres in diameter, but some exceeded 30 cubic metres. Copepods need visual contact to keep together, and they disperse at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamner | first1 = WM | last2 = Carleton | first2 = JH | year = 1979 | title = Copepod swarms: Attributes and role in coral reef ecosystems | url = http://72.48.224.78/lo/toc/vol_24/issue_1/0001.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Limnol.

Spring produces [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of swarming [[phytoplankton]] which provide food for copepods. Planktonic copepods are usually the dominant members of the [[zooplankton]], and are in turn major food organisms for many other marine animals. In particular, copepods are prey to [[forage fish]] and [[jellyfish]], both of which can assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. Some copepods have extremely fast [[escape response]]s when a predator is sensed and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres (see animated image below).

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Jelly cc4.jpg|Swarms of [[jellyfish]] also prey on copepods
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Planktonic copepods are important to the [[carbon cycle]]. Some scientists say they form the largest animal [[biomass]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Johannes Dürbaum |author2=Thorsten Künnemann |lastauthoramp=yes |date=November 5, 1997 |title=Biology of Copepods: An Introduction |url=http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |publisher=[[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526164720/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |archivedate=May 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They compete for this title with [[Antarctic krill]]. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the [[secondary productivity]] of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean [[carbon sink]] than [[krill]], and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently believed to be the world's largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of [[greenhouse gas|human carbon emissions]], thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.

====Algal blooms====
Many single-celled organisms called [[phytoplankton]] live in oceans and lakes. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an [[algal bloom]]. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey R and Scott M (2010) [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Phytoplankton/page1.php What are phytoplankton] [[NASA Earth Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOAA_HAB&gt;[http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf Harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616173236/http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} 2009, [[NOAA]], Center of Excellence for Great Lakes and Human Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
Scientists have attributed swarm behavior to plants for hundreds of years. In his 1800 book, ''Phytologia: or, The philosophy of agriculture and gardening'', [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote that plant growth resembled swarms observed elsewhere in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Phytologia.html?id=YggpAAAAYAAJ|title=Phytologia: Or, The Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening. With the Theory of Draining Morasses and with an Improved Construction of the Drill Plough|last=Darwin|first=Erasmus|date=1800-01-01|publisher=P. Byrne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was referring to more broad observations of plant morphology, and was focused on both root and shoot behavior, recent research has supported this claim.

Roots, in particular, display observable swarm behavior, growing in patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and indicate the presence of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, and it is this purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciszak|first=Marzena|last2=Comparini|first2=Diego|last3=Mazzolai|first3=Barbara|last4=Baluska|first4=Frantisek|last5=Arecchi|first5=F.

Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root's apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baluška|first=František|last2=Mancuso|first2=Stefano|last3=Volkmann|first3=Dieter|last4=Barlow|first4=Peter W.|date=2010-07-01|title=Root apex transition zone: a signalling–response nexus in the root|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138510000889|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=15|issue=7|pages=402–408|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forces act to inform any number of growing "main" roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to [[stolon]] growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961862730|title=Plant behaviour and intelligence|last=J.|first=Trewavas, A.|date=2014|publisher=Oxford university press|isbn=9780199539543|oclc=961862730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organisms===

====Bacteria====
{{see also|Swarming motility|Microbial intelligence}}

Swarming is also used to describe groupings of some kinds of [[Bacteria#Predators|bacteria]] such as [[myxobacteria]]. Myxobacteria swarm together in "wolf packs", actively moving using a process known as [[bacterial gliding]] and keeping together with the help of intercellular molecular [[Signal transduction|signals]].&lt;ref name="Allison C, Hughes C 1991 403–422"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reichenbach_2001&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reichenbach H |title=Myxobacteria, producers of novel bioactive substances |journal=J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol |year=2001 |pages=149–56 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pmid=11780785 |doi=10.1038/sj.jim.7000025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical modelling of [[flocking behaviour]] is a common technology, and has found uses in animation. Flocking simulations have been used in many films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabbai |first=J.M.E. |title=Complexity and the Aerospace Industry: Understanding Emergence by Relating Structure to Performance using Multi-Agent Systems |year=2005 |publisher=University of Manchester Doctoral Thesis |place=Manchester |url=http://www.gabbai.com/academic/complexity-and-the-aerospace-industry-understanding-emergence-by-relating-structure-to-performance-using-multi-agent-systems/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Crowd simulation|generate crowds]] which move realistically. Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of a group of bats using the [[boids]] system. [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] made use of similar technology, known as [[Massive (software)|massive]], during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

An ant-based computer simulation using only six interaction rules has also been used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore R (2008) [http://computing-reports.open.ac.uk/2008/TR2008-25.pdf "A multi-agent system approach to a simulation study comparing the performance of aircraft boarding using pre-assigned seating and free-for-all strategies"] ''Open University'', Technical report No 2008/25.&lt;/ref&gt; Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by [[Douglas A. Lawson]] uses swarm theory, or [[swarm intelligence]]—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, and it turns out that that's the best solution for the airline," Lawson explains. As a result, the "colony" of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. "We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," says Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm "Planes, Trains and Ant Hills: Computer scientists simulate activity of ants to reduce airline delays"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124132227/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |date=2010-11-24 }} ''Science Daily'', 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herd behaviour]] in [[marketing]] has been used to explain the dependencies of customers' mutual behaviour. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported a recent conference in [[Rome]] on the subject of the simulation of adaptive human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Swarming the shelves: How shops can exploit people's herd mentality to increase sales? | publisher= The Economist | date= 2006-11-11 | page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shared mechanisms to increase impulse buying and get people "to buy more by playing on the herd instinct." The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including [[smart card]] technology and the use of [[RFID|Radio Frequency Identification Tag]] technology. A "swarm-moves" model was introduced by a [[Florida Institute of Technology]] researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can "increase sales without the need to give people discounts."

The application of swarm principles to [[robot]]s is called [[swarm robotics]], while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms.

Partially inspired by [[Colony (biology)|colonies of insects]] such as ants and bees, researchers are modelling the behaviour of [[Swarm robotics|swarms]] of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the [[emergent behaviour]] of the swarm is more complex.&lt;ref name=Bouffanais /&gt; The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a [[superorganism]], exhibiting [[swarm intelligence]]. The largest swarms so far created is the 1024 robot Kilobot swarm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr/projects/progSA/kilobot.html|title=Self-organizing Systems Research Group|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026212516/http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr/projects/progSA/kilobot.html|archivedate=2014-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other large swarms include the [[iRobot]] swarm, the [[SRI International]]/[[ActivMedia Robotics]] [[Centibots]] project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilerobots.com/RobotApplications/SpecialResearchProjects.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714105814/http://www.mobilerobots.com/RobotApplications/SpecialResearchProjects.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-14|title=Centibots 100-Robot Collaborative Reconnaissance Project|publisher=[[ActivMedia Robotics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarmrobot.org|title=Open-source micro-robotic project|accessdate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=149 |publisher=iRobot Corporation |title=Swarm |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191006/https://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=149 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarms are also more resistant to failure.

[[Image:SWARM-vs-guerilla.png|thumb|300px|Contrast between guerrilla ambush and true swarming (Edwards-2003)]]
{{main|Swarming (military)}}

[[Swarming (military)|Military swarming]] is a behaviour where autonomous or partially autonomous units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup. ''Pulsing'', where the units shift the point of attack, is also a part of military swarming. Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization.&lt;ref name=Edwards-2000&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Swarming on the Battlefield: Past, Present, and Future
 | author= Edwards, Sean J.A.
 | year = 2000
 | isbn= 0-8330-2779-4
 | publisher= Rand Corporation
 | series=Rand Monograph MR-1100
 | url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1100
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically military forces used principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but now active research consciously examines military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.

Merely because multiple units converge on a target, they are not necessarily swarming. Siege operations do not involve swarming, because there is no manoeuvre; there is convergence but on the besieged fortification. Nor do [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla ambushes]] constitute swarms, because they are "hit-and-run". Even though the ambush may have several points of attack on the enemy, the guerillas withdraw when they either have inflicted adequate damage, or when they are endangered.

In 2014 the U. S. [[Office of Naval Research]] released a video showing tests of a swarm of small autonomous drone attack boats that can steer and take coordinated offensive action as a group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/tech/innovation/navy-swarm-boats/ U.S. Navy could 'swarm' foes with robot boats], ''CNN'', 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==

* There is a popular myth that [[lemming]]s commit [[mass suicide]] by swarming off cliffs when they migrate. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit. This fact combined with some unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings gave rise to the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |title=Lemming Suicide Myth Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior |first=Riley |last=Woodford |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103112042/http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Piranha]] have a reputation as fearless fish that swarm in ferocious and predatory packs. However, recent research, which started "with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting", discovered that they were in fact rather fearful fish, like other fish, who schooled for protection from their predators, such as cormorants, caimans and dolphins. A researcher described them as "basically like regular fish with large teeth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/science/24obse.html?_r=1 Red-Bellied Piranha Is Really Yellow] ''New York Times'', 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
