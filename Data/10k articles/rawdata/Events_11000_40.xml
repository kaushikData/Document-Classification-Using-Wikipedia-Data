The Nobel Committee's decision drew mixed reactions from US commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum, as well as from the rest of the world.

Obama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a "[[just war]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Zeleny|first=Jeff|title=Accepting Peace Prize, Obama Evokes 'Just War'|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 10, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/world/europe/11prexy.html| accessdate= December 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120210122241/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/world/europe/11prexy.html| archivedate=February 10, 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-acceptance-nobel-peace-prize |title=Obama acceptance speech transcript |access-date=December 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213165240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-acceptance-nobel-peace-prize |archive-date=December 13, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama is the fourth [[President of the United States]] to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson#Peace Conference 1919|Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Jimmy Carter#Carter Center and Nobel Prize|Jimmy Carter]], with Carter's honor happening after leaving office).

==Nomination and announcement==
The winner is selected by the [[Nobel Committee]] from nominations submitted by committee members and others. Nominations for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize closed just 11 days after Obama took office.  There were 205 nominations for the 2009 award, which included Chinese and Afghan civil rights activists and African politicians.  Colombian Senator [[Piedad Córdoba]],&lt;ref name="re"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=avBkvKQKUpOQ|title=Colombia's Cordoba Contending for Nobel Peace Prize|publisher=Bloomberg | date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan's [[Sima Samar]],&lt;ref name="re"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5964X920091007|title=Nobel Peace prize seeks return to activist roots|publisher=Reuter | date=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese dissident [[Hu Jia (activist)|Hu Jia]] and Prime Minister of Zimbabwe [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] had been speculated to be favorites for the award.&lt;ref name="bbc article on nobel win"/&gt;

The [[Norwegian Nobel Committee#Current members|five members]] of the Nobel Committee are appointed by the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] to roughly reflect the party makeup of that body.  The 2009 Committee comprised two members of the [[Norwegian Labor Party]], one from the left-wing [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]], one from the [[Conservative Party of Norway]] and one from the right-wing [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]]. The chairman of the Committee was [[Thorbjørn Jagland]], former Norwegian Labor Party prime minister and [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]] since September 29, 2009. The panel met six or seven times in 2009, beginning several weeks after the February 1 nomination deadline. The winner was chosen unanimously on October 5.&lt;ref name=wgnyt&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/10oslo.html | work=The New York Times | first=Walter | last=Gibbs | title=From 205 Names, Panel Chose the Most Visible | date=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was initially opposed by the Socialist Left, Conservative and Progress Party members until strongly persuaded by Jagland.&lt;ref&gt;Dagbladet, "[http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/10/15/nyheter/innenriks/barack_obama/nobels_fredspris/torbjorn_jagland/8584705/ - Nobel-flertallet argumenterte mot Obama]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagland said "We have not given the prize for what may happen in the future. We are awarding Obama for what he has done in the past year. And we are hoping this may contribute a little bit for what he is trying to do," noting that he hoped the award would assist Obama's foreign policy efforts. Jagland said the committee was influenced by [[A New Beginning|a speech Obama gave]] about [[Islam]] in [[Cairo]] in June 2009, the president's efforts to prevent [[nuclear proliferation]] and [[climate change]], and Obama's support for using established international bodies such as the United Nations to pursue foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name=wp1&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/09/AR2009100900914_pf.html | accessdate = October 9, 2009 | work=The Washington Post | first=Scott | last=Wilson | title=President Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that Jagland shrugged off the question of whether "the committee feared being labeled naïve for accepting a young politician's promises at face value", stating that "no one could deny that 'the international climate' had suddenly improved, and that Mr. Obama was the main reason...'We want to embrace the message that he stands for."&lt;ref name=wgnyt/&gt;
[[File:Jagland and Obama.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Barack Obama with Thorbjørn Jagland|Barack Obama with [[Thorbjørn Jagland]] at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.]]

Obama was the fourth U.S. President to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], after [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1906) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1919)—both of whom received the award during their terms—and [[Jimmy Carter]] (2002), who received the award 21 years after leaving office. In addition, then-sitting Vice President [[Charles G. Dawes|Charles Dawes]] was a co-winner with [[Austen Chamberlain]] (1925), and former Vice President [[Al Gore]] was a co-winner with the U.N.'s [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (2007)

Obama was the first U.S. president to receive the award during his first year in office (at eight and a half months, after being nominated less than two weeks in office), although several other world leaders were awarded in the year following their election to national office, including [[Óscar Arias]] (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1987/presentation-speech.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1987 – Presentation Speech|first=Egil|last=Aarvik|accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/presentation-speech.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1991 – Presentation Speech|first=Francis|last=Sejersted|accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Barack Obama===
Obama said he was "surprised" and "deeply humbled" by the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5981JK20091009?sp=true|title=Obama is surprise winner of Nobel Peace Prize |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |date=October 9, 2009 |publisher=Reuters | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012134156/https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5981JK20091009?sp=true| archivedate= October 12, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In remarks given at the [[White House Rose Garden]] on the day of the announcement, Obama stated, "I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations."&lt;ref name=whr1&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Winning-the-Nobel-Peace-Prize/ "Remarks by the President on Winning the Nobel Peace Prize"] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100410032820/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Winning-the-Nobel-Peace-Prize/ |date=April 10, 2010 }}, October 9, 2009, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

"Throughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes," Obama said. "And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action&amp;nbsp;— a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century." He said those common challenges included the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons (which he said might not occur in his lifetime), nuclear proliferation, climate change, tolerance "among people of different faiths and races and religions", peace between and security for Israelis and Palestinians, better social conditions for the world's poor, including "the ability to get an education and make a decent living; the security that you won't have to live in fear of disease or violence without hope for the future." The United States, he said, is "a country that's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people and our allies."&lt;ref name=whr1/&gt;

The award, he said, "must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity&amp;nbsp;— for the young woman who marches silently in the streets on behalf of her right to be heard even in the face of beatings and bullets; for the leader imprisoned in her own home because she refuses to abandon her commitment to democracy [referring to [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]]; for the soldier who sacrificed through tour after tour of duty on behalf of someone half a world away; and for all those men and women across the world who sacrifice their safety and their freedom and sometime their lives for the cause of peace."&lt;ref name=whr1/&gt; He did not take questions from reporters after giving his statement.

Obama announced early that he would donate the full 10&amp;nbsp;million [[Swedish kronor]] (about US$1.4&amp;nbsp;million) monetary award to charity.&lt;ref name=abc1&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahn |first=Huma |author2=Nies, Yunji de |author3=Travers, Karen |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize/story?id=8788973  |title=Obama on Nobel Prize Win: 'This Is Not How I Expected to Wake up This Morning' |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest donations were given to the housing charity [[Fisher House Foundation]] who received $250,000, and the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]] which received $200,000. Eight organizations which support education also received a donation. $125,000 was donated to the [[College Summit]], the [[Posse Foundation]], the [[United Negro College Fund]], the [[Hispanic Scholarship Fund]], the [[Appalachian Leadership and Education Foundation]], and the [[American Indian College Fund]]. $100,000 was donated to [[Africare]], and the [[Central Asia Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/us/12nobel.html|title=Obama Lists Who Will Get Prize Money From Nobel|last=Cooper|first=Helene|date=March 11, 2010|work=New York Times |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/03/11/2010-03-11_bams_noble_gift_of_nobel_cash.html|title=President Obama donates $1.4M in Nobel Peace Prize award money to 10 charities, as promised|date=March 12, 2010|work=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=March 12, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100314034021/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/03/11/2010-03-11_bams_noble_gift_of_nobel_cash.html| archivedate= March 14, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
Obama's winning of the peace prize was largely unanticipated and called a "stunning surprise" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', though major oddsmaker [[Centrebet]] had in fact put him at 7–1 odds of winning, with [[Piedad Córdoba]] and [[Sima Samar]] at 6–1 and [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] at 7–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL7572564 |title=PREVIEW-Nobel Peace prize seeks return to activist roots |first=Wojciech|last=Moskwa |date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=October 12, 2009 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/10/09/reaction_obama_wins_nobel_peac.html |title=Reactions: Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |date=September 22, 2009 |work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''USA Today'' / Gallup Poll conducted October 16–19, 61% of American adults polled responded that they thought Obama did not deserve to win the prize, while 34% responded that he did; when asked if they were personally glad that Obama won the award, 46% of respondents said they were and 47% said they were not glad (poll [[margin of error]] +/-3%).&lt;ref name="USApoll"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/10/620000171/1|title=Poll: Most don't think Obama deserved Nobel award|work=USA Today |accessdate=December 31, 2009|date=October 20, 2009|first=David|last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was widespread criticism of the Nobel Committee's decision from commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum. ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a mildly-supportive editorial which said the prize was "a (barely) implicit condemnation of Mr. Bush's presidency. But countering the ill will Mr. Bush created around the world is one of Mr. Obama's great achievements in less than nine months in office. Mr. Obama's willingness to respect and work with other nations is another." It said that much remains to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/opinion/10sat1.html | accessdate = October 11, 2009 | work=The New York Times | title=The Peace Prize | date=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those agreeing that the award was a criticism of the Bush administration were the editorial pages of the ''Los Angeles Times'',&lt;ref name=lat1/&gt; ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=wsj1/&gt; and ''Washington Post'',&lt;ref name=wpe1/&gt; as well as [[Thomas L. Friedman]] of the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref name=tfnyt/&gt; ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' host [[Matt Lauer]] and [[Jonah Goldberg]] of the ''[[National Review]]'' said that less than a year into the first term, there have been "no major foreign policy achievements to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mrc.org/biasalert/2009/20091009104100.aspx |title=NBC's Lauer: Not to Be Rude, but Obama Hasn't Done Anything |first=Rich|last=Noyes |date=October 9, 2009|accessdate=October 12, 2009 |publisher=Media Research Center| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012011520/http://www.mrc.org/biasalert/2009/20091009104100.aspx| archivedate= October 12, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg added: "surely someone in Iran—or maybe the [[Green Revolution (Iran)|Iranian protestors generally]]—could have benefitted more from receiving the prize"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTI5NzkzNmM0MjYwN2Y2OTM3NTgzMDYyYWJjMjZjNGI= |title=Hilarious ...

[[Peter Beinart]] of the [[Daily Beast]] called the decision a "farce",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-09/obamas-nobel-farce/ |title=Obama's Nobel Farce |first=Peter|last=Beinart |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=October 12, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091011105341/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-09/obamas-nobel-farce/| archivedate= October 11, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Noam Chomsky]] said : "In defense of the committee, we might say that the achievement of doing nothing to advance peace places Obama on a considerably higher moral plane than some of the earlier recipients".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chomsky.info/talks/20091030.htm "Hopes And Prospects"], Amnesty International Lecture given in Belfast, Northern Ireland, October 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many were critical of the Nobel Committee. A ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial, noting Obama's comment that the world's problems "can't be met by any one leader or any one nation", opined, "What this suggests to us—and to the Norwegians—is the end of what has been called '[[American exceptionalism]]'. This is the view that U.S. values have universal application and should be promoted without apology, and defended with military force when necessary. Put in this context, we wonder if most Americans will count this peace-of-the-future prize as a compliment."&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703746604574463142879190358 |title=The Nobel Hope Prize: An award for the end of American exceptionalism |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 12, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091013032327/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703746604574463142879190358.html| archivedate= October 13, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington Post'' columnist [[Michael Gerson]] wrote that the committee members "have forfeited any claim to seriousness.

===In Norway===
A poll conducted by [[Synovate]] for the newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' showed that 43% of the Norwegian population believed giving Obama the prize was right, while 38% believed it was wrong. 19% had no opinion.

An '''auto show''', also known as a '''motor show''' or '''car show''', is a public exhibition of current [[automobile]] models, debuts, [[concept car]]s, or out-of-production classics. It is attended by [[automotive industry]] representatives, dealers, auto journalists and car enthusiasts. Most auto shows occur once or twice a year. They are important to car manufacturers and local dealers as a public relations exercise, as they advertise new products and promote auto brands. The five most prestigious auto shows, sometimes called the "Big Five", are generally considered to be held in [[International Motor Show Germany|Frankfurt]], [[Geneva Motor Show|Geneva]], [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit]], [[Paris Motor Show|Paris]] and [[Tokyo Motor Show|Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genevalunch.com/2010/03/05/geneva-motor-show-born-again-car-industry-moves-into-the-green/|title=Geneva Motor Show: born-again car industry moves into the green - GenevaLunch News|date=5 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are other auto/car shows that occur on a more frequent basis, almost weekly. It is not known if there is a regularly accepted term for these more frequent, informal "car rallies" or "car enthusiasts events". Some meeting events have themes, such as [[classic car]]s, [[hot rod]]s, etc. These events are more localized, typically consisting of car enthusiasts who meet to socialize and enjoy their enthusiasm with other car owners.

The [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles]] organizes many auto shows.

They are distinguishable from car shows in that auto shows typically showcase new or concept vehicles whereas car shows showcase custom, classic, or exotic cars. They also distinguish in that auto shows are almost always a major professional event whereas car shows can be either professional or amateur and many are locally organized. Auto shows always charge for admission whereas many cities have local, free car shows.

'''C.O.M.A.''' was a yearly weekend underground music festival held in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, from 2004 to 2007 featuring [[industrial music|industrial]], [[Industrial music#Power electronics|power electronics]], [[noise music|noise]] and other [[alternative electronic]] musicians and DJs. There were both independent and signed bands who were booked to play, as well as many vendors for music and related [[paraphernalia]]. Featured [[record labels]] and noteworthy companies include: [[Ant-Zen]], Geska Records, .Angle.Rec., Cyclic Law, Force of Nature Records and Bugs Crawling out of People.  In 2008, C.O.M.A. was essentially replaced by the '''Kinetik Festival''', which ran until 2013.

"'''Cabinessence'''" (originally written as "'''Cabin Essence'''") is a song written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]] for the American [[rock music|rock]] band [[the Beach Boys]] in 1966. Intended for the discarded album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', it was not released until three years later for the album ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]''.

The subject of the song is said by Wilson to be "about railroads," as he intended to encapsulate the image of Chinese laborers pounding [[rail spike]]s while their minds go "off on a different track" after noticing a crow flying overhead.{{sfn|Preiss|1979}}{{sfn|Kent|1975}} According to journalist [[Nick Kent]], the song "juxtaposed both highly-advanced Western and Eastern musical references" with an "oriental presence", making use of the [[banjo]] and [[harmonica]] as well as percussion in the chorus designed to emulate the sound of workers assembling train tracks.{{sfn|Kent|1975}}

"Cabinessence" has received much acclaim over the years as the stand-out track on ''20/20''.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Biographer [[Jon Stebbins]] observed the song's "demonic chanting" which he believed exemplified "some of the most haunting, manic, evil-sounding music the Beach Boys ever made".{{sfn|Stebbins|2011|p=90}} ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]'' described Cabinessence as "''Smile'' in microcosm. Vast in scope, unprecedented in its ambition and as much an unsolved sonic riddle as the album it had been written for, this was the misunderstood masterpiece that caused [[Mike Love]] to crack and the project to flounder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 50 Greatest Beach Boys Songs|journal=Mojo Magazine|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyricism==

Brian Wilson stated that he and [[Van Dyke Parks]] wrote the song along with "[[Heroes and Villains]]" "[[Wonderful (The Beach Boys song)|Wonderful]]" and "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]" in a giant sandbox with a piano in it that Wilson had built in his living room.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}. "Cabinessence" was one of a number of ''Smile'' tracks which contained lyrics that the other band members did not approve of,{{sfn|Nolan|1971}} being infamously oblique and replete with wordplay. The seemingly-[[surrealism|surreal]] [[couplet]] of the closing "Grand Coulee Dam" section are as follows,
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over the thresher and hovers the wheatfield&lt;/poem&gt;}}
If the listener rearranges the last half of each line, they get "''over and over the crow cries and hovers the wheatfield / over and over the thresher uncovers the cornfield''", which makes them clearer. Parks penned additional lyrics to Cabinessence not heard on any official release, nor bootlegged. They are unknown to have ever been recorded during tracking sessions.{{refn|group=nb|&lt;poem&gt;Reconnected telephone direct / Dialing / Different color cords to your / Extension / Don’t forget to mention / This is a recording

Even though the echoes through / My mind / Have filtered through the pines / I came and found my peace / And this is not a recording /

Doobie doo / Doobie doo / Or not doobie&lt;ref&gt;Frank Holmes (''Endless Summer Quarterly'', March 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
}} Clarifying the song's historical references, Parks says:

{{quote|The whole thing seems to be about the taking of the territory. Folks sing a song of the [[monastic grange|grange]]. Granges were collectives of farms that would pool their resources so they could set their own prices, so that they weren't competing so much with each other, but so they were finding a reasonable return for their endeavors. Of course, that’s almost a thing of the past, with the family farm disappearing from the country now and [[agribusiness]] the way it is, but the grange system was the backbone of the American farm. And we had to bring the Chinese into this equation, because they were working on the railroad, and the prairie was absolutely dependent on the railroads.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=69}}}}

==Recording and structure==
The song has three distinct sections: "Home on the Range", "Who Ran the Iron Horse", and "The Grand Coulee Dam" in the form of ABABC. "Home on the Range" may be seen as the verse, and "Who Ran the Iron Horse" as the chorus. While "Home on the Range" is in 4/4, or "common time", "Who Ran the Iron Horse" is a [[waltz (music)|waltz]]. "The Grand Coulee Dam" is in 3/4 time as well. The chorus features the repeated line, "''Who ran the Iron Horse?''" over "''aah''" harmonies in [[mixolydian mode]], and patterned to an I7—V7 progression in the implied [[key (music)|key]] of [[F major]]. In the second iteration of this section, there are barely-audible lyrics sung by [[Dennis Wilson]] underneath the harmonies. In 1969, Brian Wilson wrote:
{{quote|All my life I’ve been fascinated by waltzes. By this album I rolled around to doin’ what I call a rock and roll waltz with "Cabin Essence." The night I cut the instrumental part of it no one could believe that a waltz could rock that hard. I had the 6-string bass player play electric fuzz tones. This got it goin’ good. I was sure that I had recorded the most rockin’ waltz ever recorded.&lt;ref name=liner&gt;{{cite web|last=Leaf|first=David|title=Friends / 20/20 liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Friends___20_20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musician  Mark Johnson refers to the [[banjo]] in "Cabinessence" as "traditionally the Great American [[Folk music|folk]] instrument," with it being used "like part of the soundtrack to a lost ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode," and that the song "could be an exploration a la [[John Steinbeck]] of what [[music of the United States|American music]]'s function really is. To simply fill a room, while we go about our days and nights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Smile: The Magazine|journal=Fishwrap|date=Winter 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was largely mixed and completed in December 1966, lacking only a lead vocal and a coherent structure.&lt;ref name=Fusion/&gt; An alternate work-in-progress version was described by friend and ''Smile'' participant [[Michael Vosse]] in 1969.

{{quote|Van and Brian played us two things they were doing on the album: one was part of the thing that turned into "Cabinessence." This was originally part of "Who Ran the Iron Horse," which was about this Chinese cat working on the railroad; it had the "crow" line in it. And another song, "[[Do You Like Worms?|Bicycle Rider]]," was to be integrated with it; they thought they'd put together these two separate songs. . . "Cabinessence" started out as a wholly different trip—[[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] was going to sing it by himself and sound like a funky cat up in the mountains somewhere singing to a chick by a fireplace; very simple—and that's all there was to it. . . . In the original, "Who Ran the Iron Horse," he had a very definite visual image in mind of a train in motion, and suddenly he stopped in the middle of the song with the "Grand Coolie" refrain.&lt;ref name=Fusion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vosse|first=Michael|title=Michael Vosse Talks About Smile|journal=Fusion|date=April 14, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dennis Wilson sings a heavily syncopated vocal rap during the song's second chorus. He says, "I got off so much on doing that. It's mixed way down in the track, and it’s syncopated all the way through. Right there is my biggest turn-on." The lines are: "Truck-driving man, do what you can. / High-tail your load off the road, out of night-life. / It's a gas, man. I don’t believe I gotta grieve. / In and out of luck with a buck and a booth. / Catching on to the truth, in the vast past, the last gasp. / In the land, in the dust, trust that you must catch as catch can."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=69}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=The only person I had had any interchange with before that was [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], who had responded very favorably to "[[Heroes and Villains]]" and "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf’s Up]]". Based on that, I gathered that the work would be approved. But then, with no warning whatsoever, I got that phone call from Brian. And that’s when the whole house of cards came tumbling down.

A recording session for "The Grand Coulee Dam" vocal overdubs on December 6, 1966 reportedly saw tensions within the band boil over when Love was instructed by Wilson to sing the song's lyrics. Bemused, Love demanded that Wilson call lyricist Parks to the recording session to explain the meaning of the coda line "''Over and over, the crow cries, uncover the cornfield. Over and over, the thresher and hovers, the wheatfield''". Wilson complied, and asked Parks if he was willing to come down to the studio to sort out Love's complaints. Upon arriving at the studio, Love questioned the lyrics reportedly in an aggressive fashion. Unable to come up with an answer that satisfied Love and unwilling to be drawn into an argument about the quality of his work, Parks responded by simply stating he didn't know the meaning of the lyric.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=117}} Consequently, Parks left the session feeling as though he was intruding on a family feud with roots and motivations that had nothing to do with him, and would eventually leave the project in the spring of 1967.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=117, 119}} Some consider this to have [[collapse of Smile|doomed the album]].{{sfn|Nolan|1971}}{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=117}} Defending himself in later years, Love has rebutted:

{{quote|I think Van Dyke is really talented, brilliant, and fun. He’s got a sense of humor. I ask[ed] Van Dyke Parks, "What the hell does 'Over and over the crow cries, uncover the cornfield' mean?" And he said, "I haven’t a clue, Mike!"…I don’t know if he was saying that just because I was there in his face. But I always liked lyrics that are boy-girl, or made sense, or connected to the mind of people.…And who says I didn't like the words? Just because I said I didn't know what they meant didn't mean I didn't ''like'' them. I have zero against Van Dyke Parks. That’s why I said, "What the fuck does that mean?" It's not meant to be an insult. He didn't get insulted. He just said, 'I haven’t a clue!' And it wasn't like I was ''against'' his lyrics. But people don’t know the way I think. And they don’t give a fuck about the way I think, either. But that’s okay. I'm a big boy, and I can take that. I was just asking: ''What did it mean''?{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=313}}}}

During the 1990s, Love reportedly asked Parks about the lyrics again. According to Parks, "I was able to tell him, once again, 'I don’t know.' I have no idea what those words mean. I was perhaps thinking of [[Van Gogh]]'s wheat field or an idealized agrarian environment. Maybe I meant nothing, but I was trying to follow Brian Wilson's vision at that time."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 6, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|'''The New York Times''': Parks recalls he saw Love one final time when Melcher called him to Monterey to play synthesizer on the Beach Boys' final album, recorded without Brian, 1992's dreadful Summer in Paradise. A neighbor offered to fly the musician to Monterey in his one-engine plane if Parks agreed to cover gas and other expenses. When he got there, Love was meditating in Melcher's living room. "For the first time in 30 years, he was able to ask me directly, once again, 'What do those lyrics -- Over and over the crow flies, uncover the cornfield -- mean?'" Parks said about that meeting in '95. "And I was  able to tell him, once again, 'I don't know.' I have no idea what those words mean. I was perhaps thinking of Van Gogh's wheat field or an idealized agrarian environment. Maybe I meant nothing, but I was trying to follow Brian Wilson's vision at that time." Parks says Love asked if he could fly back to L.A. in the plane with him. "We had a nice chat and he insisted that he wanted to split the cost of the flight with me, so he gave me a card with his number on it. The next morning, I called to discover it was a disconnected number. And that was the last time I saw Mike Love."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;}}

===''20/20'' mixing===
In April 1969, Vosse stated: "The recording of it on ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' is new, because before his ear operation about a year ago, Brian could not hear in stereo."&lt;ref name=Fusion/&gt; Although the final ''Smile'' version would have most likely been released in [[monoaural]] sound, the track was eventually released in stereo as "Cabinessence" on their 1969 album ''20/20'', with a lead vocal overdub by [[Carl Wilson]] recorded on November 20, 1968.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}}  It was met with interest and praise upon its release in 1969 following "[[Our Prayer]]" due to its roots in the much publicized ''Smile'' project three years earlier.

{{quote|[re: "Our Prayer"] The remaking of the song "Cabinessence," all feels of which were recorded in 1966 for inclusion on ''Smile'', was more complicated. Apparently, Brian had done a great deal of preliminary assembly work but had not been able to come up with a consistent plan for final assembly. "Reportedly," writes David Leaf, "there were twenty-five different mixes and combinations of that song all put on separate acetate discs before they put out one version. To add to the confusion, the song in its released form contains portions of 'Who Ran the Iron Horse' and 'The Grand Coolie Dam.' It is true that "Cabinessence" seems lyricially disorganized and more episodic than even the alternate version of "[[Heroes and Villains]]," but it does have that aura of manic brilliance that characterized Brian's work before the collapse of ''Smile'', and thus this narration problem is easily forgiven and forgotten The contrast between these songs and Brian's five newly composed songs for ''20/20'' is stark and poignant.|''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis''{{sfn|Covach|1997|pp=51-52}}}}

==Alternate versions==
An instrumental version can be found on the Beach Boys' 1993 ''[[Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys|Good Vibrations]]'' box set. The song was rerecorded by Brian Wilson as a solo artist and released on his [[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|2004 version of ''Smile'']]. A mono mix of the Beach Boys version of the song was prepared in 2011 for ''[[The Smile Sessions]]''. This mix was released as a promotional single within the June 2011 issue of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''.

==Legacy==

Cabinessence, the Oregon-based indie band, derives their name from the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ham|first1=Robert|title=Cabinessence leaves Beach Boys behind this time around|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2010/03/cabinessence_leaves_beach_boys.html|publisher=''[[The Oregonian]]''|date=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Chaiti Festival"''' or "'''Rayagada Mahotsav'''" is the official annual mass cultural festival of [[Rayagada district]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120415/jsp/7days/story_15375490.jsp#.VKSssiuUeG4 " telegraph India"] News item in Telegraph India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://revolutionaryfrontlines.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/the-telegraph-calcutta-india-on-a-human-safari "Revolutionary frontlines"] An article in Revolutionary Frontline&lt;/ref&gt; It is one among the major tourist attractions in the district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Nov/engpdf/63-68.pdf "Orissa Review"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718010712/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Nov/engpdf/63-68.pdf |date=July 18, 2013 }} official magazine of Govt. of Orissa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rayagada.isfoundhere.com "Rayagadaisfoundhere"] Tourist attractions of Rayagada&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival started in 2005 in the district to give a boost to [[Tribe|tribal culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sambadepaper.com/Details.aspx?id=133009&amp;boxid=1263223 "Sambadepaper"] News item dtd. 27.12.2014&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural fest is observed in the Block levels and Sub divisional levels in addition to the district level. The first Chaiti Festival was organised as a mass festival by the then District Magistrate Dr. Pramod Kumar Meherda. Since then Chaiti festival has been organised every year. But for some reason it was discontinued during 2008. In 2009, Shri K.G.Mahapatra, the then Collector of the district revived the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rayagadnews.blogspot.in/2011/10/chaiti-mahotsav-meeting-held.html "Rayagadanews"] Blogspot on Rayagada News&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Child Friendly Spaces''' ('''CFS''') are [[Safety|safe]] spaces set up in [[emergency]] settings to help support and protect [[child]]ren. Their objective is to restore a sense of normality and continuity to children whose lives have been disrupted by [[war]], [[natural disaster]], or other emergencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They provide children with opportunities to [[Child development|develop]], [[Play (activity)|play]], [[Learning|learn]], and strengthen [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] either after a [[crisis]] or during a protracted emergency in a safe, [[Age appropriateness|child friendly]], and stimulating environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/CFS%20Literature%20Review%20final%20Aug%202012.pdf|title=Child Friendly Spaces: A Structured Review of the Current Evidence-Base|last=World Vision|first=|date=August 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or [[government]]s design and operate CFS in a participatory manner, often relying on community support. They are a short- to medium-term program response and often operate in tents or temporary structures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CFS are one of the most widely used [[child protection]] and [[psychosocial]] support interventions in emergencies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wvi.org/sites/default/files/Guidance%20for%20CFS%20M%26E_2.pdf|title=Evaluation of Child Friendly Spaces: Tools and guidance for monitoring and evaluating CFS|last=World Vision International|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for their popularity is that they offer potential for adaptability of activities to diverse contexts, rapid deployment, and low relative [[cost]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different agencies refer to CFS by different names including Child Centered Spaces (CCS), Safe Spaces, Safe Play Areas, and Child Friendly Spaces/Environments (CFS/E).

CFS give children an opportunity to escape the crowded living conditions they may be subject to during crises. As they are supervised, they also provide parents child-free time that can be necessary for fetching water, earning a living, or other activities. Given that [[Psychological stress|stress]] levels and incidents of [[Child abuse|abuse]] rise during emergencies, providing children with this space and parents with time can mitigate risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/child-friendly-spaces/|title=In troubled countries, 'child-friendly spaces' offer some relief|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CFC can be adapted to support young children or [[Adolescence|adolescents]], who are often neglected in emergencies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Background ==
CFS have been used widely since 1999.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/protection/A_Practical_Guide_to_Developing_Child_Friendly_Spaces_-_UNICEF_(1).pdf|title=A Practical Guide for Developing Child Friendly Spaces|last=UNICEF|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began as a rights-based approach developed by [[UNICEF]] to guarantee children’s rights to survival, development, participation and protection, especially at times of crisis or instability. UNICEF launched the first CFC during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo crisis]] in [[Albania]] in April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/FA1830A25B25810BC125757F0037FA8E-UNICEF_dec04.pdf|title=Child Friendly Spaces/Environments (CFS/E): An Integrated Services Response For Emergencies and Their Aftermath|last=UNICEF|first=|date=2004|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, CFS were used in the camps for the survivors of a [[1999 Düzce earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They then became a common part of the [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian response]] and have since been used in [[Angola]], [[Chad]], [[Colombia]], [[Denmark]], [[East Timor]], [[El Salvador]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Russia]], [[Palestinian territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]], [[Pakistan]], [[Paraguay]], [[Philippines]], [[Serbia]], [[Somalia]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Tanzania]], [[Turkey]], and [[Uganda]], among other countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caritas.org/2014/03/providing-child-friendly-spaces-syrian-refugee-children-turkey/|title=Providing child-friendly spaces for Syrian refugee children in Turkey - Caritas|date=2014-03-04|work=Caritas|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://savethechildreninternational.exposure.co/children-on-the-move-in-europe|title=Save the Children - Children on the Move in Europe|website=Exposure|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://plan-international.org/publications/child-friendly-spaces-provding-protection-and-education-mali|title=Child friendly spaces: Provding protection and education in Mali|work=Plan International|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/echo/field-blogs/photos/child-friendly-spaces-burundian-refugees-tanzania_fr|title=Child-friendly spaces for Burundian Refugees in Tanzania - Protection Civile et Operations d'Aide Humanitaire Européennes - European Commission|website=Protection Civile et Operations d'Aide Humanitaire Européennes|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Evaluation%20of%20CFS_Final%20Research%20Report_0.pdf|title=Evaluation of Child Friendly Spaces: An inter-agency series of impact evaluations in humanitarian emergencies|last=World Vision International|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://plan-international.org/paraguay/child-friendly-spaces-el-nino-floods|title=Child-Friendly Spaces for Children Affected by Floods|work=Plan International|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
CFC are integrated programs that provide children with access to a range of services or activities that may vary by context. These include structured recreational opportunities, [[Pre-school playgroup|play groups]], [[peer support]] services, and remedial classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcoo.com/pt/projects/emergency-relief-child-friendly-spaces/|title=Emergency Relief: Child friendly spaces|last=|first=|date=|website=www.worldcoo.com|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs involve [[Religion|religious]] and spiritual activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
[[World Vision International|World Vision]] and [[Columbia University]], along with [[Save the Children]], UNICEF and others, engaged in a three-year collaborative project to document the outcomes and impacts of CFS.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  They found that CFS can benefit children, but the extent of their impact varies widely. In many contexts, CFS provide a foundation for positive impact on children’s lives, but their impact is small. They also found that younger children tended to attend the CFS more and show greater impact. There have not been [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] to evaluate the long-term effects of CFS interventions on children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12769">The '''Chingay Parade''' is an annual street parade held in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the Goddess of Mercy ([[Guanyin]]) as part of the [[Chinese New Year]] festivities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/whats-on/festivals-and-events/chingay-parade-singapore.html Chingay Parade in Singapore]&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Chingay]] itself originated from the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, which is a phonetic equivalent of both the Chinese words "真艺" (''zhēnyì'') which means "true art" in the [[Penang]] version, and "妆艺," (''zhuāngyì'') which means "a decorated miniature stage" or [[Float (parade)|float]] in the Singapore version. PAYM (People's Association Youth Movement) has been an active contributor to chingay in [[Singapore]]. Today the parade is celebrated by the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities of both Malaysia and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yoursingapore.com/festivals-events-singapore/annual-highlights/chingay-parade-singapore.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:CO 1069-502-048 (7893028642) 04.jpg|thumb|right|The Campbell Street Party that took part in the Chingay procession, [[Penang]], 1937.]]
Chingay procession was held in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the [[Goddess of Mercy]] (Guanyin).  It was held to worship and enjoy with the deity. During the earliest procession in more than 100 years ago, the earliest English newspapers Echo in Malaysia adopted the word Chingay Procession for this special event.&lt;ref&gt;Penang Chingay Association (2007). [http://www.penangchingay.org, Penang Chingay Association]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chingay originated from [[China]], and the Penang Chinese first performed Chingay during deity processions.&lt;ref&gt;Penang State Tourism Development &amp; Culture (2009). [http://chingay.gov.my/ Chingay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217111205/http://www.chingay.gov.my/ |date=2009-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a street art where the performer balances a giant flag that ranges from {{convert|25|to|32|ft}} in height and about {{convert|60|lbs}} in weight.

Today, in Malaysia and Singapore, Chingay is not only performed by the Chinese, but the art has successfully attracted the Malays and Indians.  It has become a unique multiracial performance. The popularity of Chingay in [[Penang]] has made it one of the very impressive cultural landmarks as well as an important tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Penang State Tourism Development &amp; Culture (2009). [http://chingay.gov.my/ Chingay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217111205/http://www.chingay.gov.my/ |date=2009-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chingay in Malaysia==

===Penang===
[[File:Penang Chingay.jpg|left|thumb|A member of a Chingay troupe balancing a flag in the streets of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]].]]
The Chingay Parade traces its origins to a [[float (parade)|float]] decorating competition held in [[Penang]] in 1905. This practice of float decoration spread to the rest of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] by the 1960s, and eventually became associated with the Chinese New Year.

The second Chingay procession was held in 1926 in celebration of the birthday of the God of Prosperity. The third Chingay procession was held in 1957 to celebrate the centenary of the City Council of George Town.

In the pursuit of ensuring the perpetual existence of Chingay, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] community in Malaysia worked hand in hand to call for the enthusiasts of various areas in forming the liaison committee of Penang Chingay in 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Penang Chingay Association (2007). [http://www.penangchingay.org/history.html 40 years ago, a group of Chinese community leaders.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821185248/http://www.penangchingay.org/history.html |date=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Chingay parade is now held annually within the city of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] every December.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2017/12/12/parade-of-stunning-stunts-eightyearold-boy-among-chingay-performers-who-wow-crowd/|title=Parade of stunning stunts - Metro News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/12/11/a-memorable-experience-for-visiting-french-couple/|title=A memorable experience for visiting French couple - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yearly event, which has attracted locals and tourists alike, starts in the evening from Brick Kiln Road (now Gurdwara Road), snaking through the city streets before ending at the [[Esplanade, Penang|Esplanade]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mypenang.gov.my/culture-heritage/my-stories/31/|title=myPenang|website=mypenang.gov.my|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chingay in Singapore==
[[Image:Chingay.jpg|thumb|Singapore Chingay parade in 2005.]]
On 4 February 1973, the first Singapore Chingay parade was held partly as a result of the ban on [[firecrackers]] a year earlier in 1972 as a result of fire hazards. This ban was viewed unfavourably despite the safety issues involved. Some people felt that the ban would result in a much dampened festival mood for the Chinese New Year period. To address this issue, the [[People's Association]] and the [[Singapore National Pugilistic Association]] jointly organised a street parade from [[Jalan Besar]] to [[Outram Park]] featuring the signature floats, acrobatic acts, lion and dragon dances, stilt walkers, and the like, to bring back some cheer to the general public.

The largely Chinese parade became a multi-cultural one from 1977 when [[Malay people|Malay]] and [[India]]n groups started joining in the performances, which was to mark a major precedent in the overall flavour of the parade into one which has become largely multi-cultural in character, despite the continued presence of traditional Chinese acts such as lion dances and stilt walkers to this day.

In 1985, the parade marched down [[Orchard Road]] for the first time, a move which was to prevail for much of the parade's subsequent history. Although the change could be attributed to the desire of organisers in bringing it closer to tourists along the major tourist belt and for ease of organisation on a relatively long and straight stretch of road, it also further signified the increasingly desinicized character of the parade. This is further evidenced when in 1987, an international flavour was added to the parade when a group from [[Japan]] participated for the first time with their float sponsored by [[The Straits Times]].

The Chingay Parade became an evening-to-night parade in 1990, changing the overall feel of the parade towards one in which lights and pyrotechnics dominate. In 2000, the parade was shifted out of Orchard Road to the Civic District centering at [[City Hall]], an area steeped in Singaporean history and culture. Construction works at the City Hall area resulted in the parade marching through the streets of the [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown district]] for the first time. Faced with limited space for spectator stands and a much more complicated and winding route in these locations, however, the parade moved back to Orchard Road in 2004 along with an effort to introduce audience participation and involvement in the traditionally passive parade. Firecrackers were let off for the first time in the parade that year. Despite the authorities allowing the firecrackers to be let off under some safety procedures, it was decided that the Chingay be preserved. In 2008, the parade was once again held at City Hall, with the route lasting from the City Hall building to [[Esplanade, Singapore|The Esplanade]]. For the 2009 parade, it was centralised around Parliament House with the performers going around the Padang and also featured a magical Grand Finale (MAGICBOX@Chingay 2009). That year was also the first year that the telecast on television was delayed by one day. In 2010, the parade took place on part of the Formula One [[Marina Bay Street Circuit]] route.

Post-parade street parties have been held since 2004, with the exception of 2007. An estimated 150,000 spectators attended the 2009 Chingay Parade on 1 February. One million Singaporeans watched the parade on television and another 16.3 million homes and hotels across Asia received the television broadcast through [[Channel NewsAsia]].

The 2011 Chingay Parade was held on the 11 and 12 February. It opened with a Fire Party, and included the largest moving multi-ethnic performances, the first travelling dance competition within the parade, a spectacular finale where thousands of performers flooded the parade ground holding candle lights and an inaugural colourful Arts District/ Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chingay.org.sg/2011/highlights.asp Chingay 2011 Singapore highlights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731152301/http://www.chingay.org.sg/2011/highlights.asp |date=July 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included activities in which the public could participate, such as the [[Teresa Teng]] Look-Alike Photo Contest&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chingay.org.sg/teresateng/contest.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chingay Paparazzi competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chingay.org.sg/2011/paparazzi.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Chingay parade was held on 22 and 23 February. In 2014, Chingay was held on 7 and 8 February at the F1 Pit Building. Some 70,000 individuals ushered in The Year of the Horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeo|first1=Sam Jo|title=Chingay 2014 to be biggest and most colourful yet|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/lifestyle/story/chingay-2014-be-biggest-and-most-colourful-yet-20131018|accessdate=20 October 2014|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Chingay was planned to involve some 11,000 performers from 150 organisations, including 760 overseas performers from 15 groups, in the largest celebration yet. Themed "We love Singapore(SG)", the main Chingay 2015 was planned to be held at the F1 Pit Building on February 27 and 28, while a street party along Orchard Road involving youths would be held on 1 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chingay 2015 will be grandest ever|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/chingay-2015-will-be-grandest-ever|accessdate=20 October 2014|agency=The New Paper|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Chingay will involve 2,000 parade volunteers and 6,500 parade performers, and will also feature many examples of smart technology, including dancing robots and driverless cars. The 2018 Chingay will be the first year to have a free street parade and carnival as part of the celebration, and will follow a 1.5 kilometre route, double the length of the usual 720 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/chingay-2018-to-feature-dancing-robots-driverless-cars |title=Chingay 2018 to feature dancing robots, driverless cars |author=Shelina Ajit Assomull |date=28 November 2017 |website=straitstimes.com |publisher=The Straits Times |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In physiology, '''dehydration''' is a deficit of total [[body water]],&lt;ref name="Mange K 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mange K, Matsuura D, Cizman B, Soto H, Ziyadeh FN, Goldfarb S, Neilson EG | title = Language guiding therapy: the case of dehydration versus volume depletion | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 127 | issue = 9 | pages = 848–53 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9382413 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-127-9-199711010-00020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an accompanying disruption of [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]]. It occurs when free water loss exceeds free water intake, usually due to exercise, disease, or high environmental temperature. Mild dehydration can also be caused by [[immersion diuresis]], which may increase risk of [[decompression sickness]] in [[Underwater diving|divers]].

Most people can tolerate a three to four percent decrease in total body water without difficulty or adverse health effects. A five to eight percent decrease can cause fatigue and dizziness. Loss of over ten percent of total body water can cause physical and mental deterioration, accompanied by severe thirst. Death occurs at a loss of between fifteen and twenty-five percent of the body water.&lt;ref name=Ashcroft&gt;Ashcroft F, Life Without Water in Life at the Extremes. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2000, 134-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Mild dehydration is characterized by thirst and general discomfort and is usually resolved with [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]].

Dehydration can cause [[hypernatremia]] (high levels of sodium ions in the blood) and is distinct from [[hypovolemia]] (loss of blood volume, particularly plasma).

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:UOTW 59 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Ultrasound of the blood vessels of the neck that supports the diagnosis of severe dehydration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UOTW #59 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-59/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The hallmarks of dehydration include [[thirst]] and neurological changes such as [[headache]]s, general discomfort, loss of [[appetite]], decreased [[urine]] volume (unless [[polyuria]] is the cause of dehydration), [[mental confusion|confusion]], unexplained [[Fatigue (medical)|tiredness]], purple fingernails and [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]]. The symptoms of dehydration become increasingly severe with greater total body water loss. A body water loss of 1-2%, considered mild dehydration, is shown to impair cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riebl SK, Davy BM | title = The Hydration Equation: Update on Water Balance and Cognitive Performance | journal = ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 21–28 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 25346594 | pmc = 4207053 | doi = 10.1249/FIT.0b013e3182a9570f }}&lt;/ref&gt; In people over age 50, the body's thirst sensation diminishes and continues diminishing with age. Many senior citizens suffer symptoms of dehydration. Dehydration contributes to morbidity in the elderly especially during conditions that promote insensible free water losses such as hot weather. A Cochrane review on this subject defined water-loss dehydration as "people with serum osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg or more" and found that the main symptoms in the elderly were expressing fatigue, missing drinks between meals and bioelectrical impedance analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hooper L, Abdelhamid A, Attreed NJ, Campbell WW, Channell AM, Chassagne P, Culp KR, Fletcher SJ, Fortes MB, Fuller N, Gaspar PM, Gilbert DJ, Heathcote AC, Kafri MW, Kajii F, Lindner G, Mack GW, Mentes JC, Merlani P, Needham RA, Olde Rikkert MG, Perren A, Powers J, Ranson SC, Ritz P, Rowat AM, Sjöstrand F, Smith AC, Stookey JJ, Stotts NA, Thomas DR, Vivanti A, Wakefield BJ, Waldréus N, Walsh NP, Ward S, Potter JF, Hunter P | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical symptoms, signs and tests for identification of impending and current water-loss dehydration in older people | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = CD009647 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25924806 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009647.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Risk factors for dehydration include but are not limited to: exerting oneself in hot and humid weather, habitation at high altitudes, endurance athletics, elderly adults, infants, children and people living with chronic illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dehydration Risk factors - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/risk-factors/con-20030056|website = www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elderly, blunted response to thirst and/or inadequate ability to access free water in the face of excess free water losses (especially [[hyperglycemia]] related) seem to be the main causes of dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borra SI, Beredo R, Kleinfeld M | title = Hypernatremia in the aging: causes, manifestations, and outcome | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 220–4 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7731073 | pmc = 2607819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess free water or hypotonic water can leave the body in two ways - ''sensible'' loss such as [[osmotic diuresis]], [[sweating]], [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], and ''insensible'' water loss, occurring mainly through the [[skin]] and [[respiratory tract]]. In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair water [[homeostasis]] in the body. These occur primarily through either impaired thirst/water access or sodium excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindner G, Funk GC | title = Hypernatremia in critically ill patients | journal = Journal of Critical Care | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 216.e11-20 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22762930 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcrc.2012.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
=== Definition ===
Dehydration occurs when water intake is not enough to replace [[free water clearance|free water]] lost due to normal physiologic processes, including [[breathing]], [[urination]], and [[perspiration]], or other causes, including [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]]. Dehydration can be life-threatening when severe and lead to [[seizure]]s or respiratory arrest, and also carries the risk of [[osmotic cerebral edema]] if [[Fluid replacement|rehydration]] is overly rapid.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|906999|Dehydration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term dehydration has sometimes been used incorrectly as a proxy for the separate, related condition [[hypovolemia]], which specifically refers to a decrease in volume of [[blood plasma]].&lt;ref name="Mange K 1997"/&gt; The two are regulated through independent mechanisms in humans;&lt;ref name="Mange K 1997"/&gt; the distinction is important in guiding treatment.&lt;ref name="Bhave G 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhave G, Neilson EG | title = Volume depletion versus dehydration: how understanding the difference can guide therapy | journal = American Journal of Kidney Diseases | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–9 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21705120 | pmc = 4096820 | doi = 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.02.395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
For routine activities, thirst is normally an adequate guide to maintain proper hydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx|title=Dietary Reference Intakes: Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate : Health and Medicine Division|website=www.nationalacademies.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum water intake will vary individually depending on weight, environment, diet and genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Heidi | last = Godman | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-much-water-should-you-drink | title = How much water should you drink? | publisher = Harvard Health | date = September 2016 | access-date = 2018-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With exercise, exposure to hot environments, or a decreased thirst response, additional water may be required. In [[athlete]]s in competition drinking to [[thirst]] optimizes performance and safety, despite weight loss, and as of 2010, there was no scientific study showing that it is beneficial to stay ahead of thirst and maintain weight during exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noakes TD | title = Is drinking to thirst optimum? | journal = Annals of Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 57 Suppl 2 | issue = s2 | pages = 9–17 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21346332 | doi = 10.1159/000322697 | url = https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/322697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In warm or humid weather or during heavy exertion, water loss can increase markedly, because humans have a large and widely variable capacity for the active secretion of sweat. Whole-body sweat losses in men can exceed 2 L/h during [[competitive sport]], with rates of 3–4 L/h observed during short-duration, high-intensity exercise in the heat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor NA, Machado-Moreira CA | title = Regional variations in transepidermal water loss, eccrine sweat gland density, sweat secretion rates and electrolyte composition in resting and exercising humans | journal = Extreme Physiology &amp; Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23849497 | pmc = 3710196 | doi = 10.1186/2046-7648-2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When such large amounts of water are being lost through perspiration, [[electrolytes]], especially sodium, are also being lost.

In most athletes, exercising and sweating for 4–5 hours with a sweat sodium concentration of less than 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, the total sodium lost is less than 10% of total body stores (total stores are approximately 2,500&amp;nbsp;mmol, or 58 g for a 70-kg person).&lt;ref name="Edward F Coyle 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coyle EF | title = Fluid and fuel intake during exercise | journal = Journal of Sports Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–55 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14971432 | doi = 10.1080/0264041031000140545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These losses appear to be well tolerated by most people. The inclusion of some sodium in fluid replacement drinks has some theoretical benefits&lt;ref name="Edward F Coyle 2004"/&gt; and poses little or no risk, so long as these fluids are hypotonic (since the mainstay of dehydration prevention is the replacement of free water losses).

The consumption of overly sugary and/or salty foods can cause dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Graw | first1 = Michael | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Effect of Salt &amp; Sugar on Dehydrated Cells|url=https://sciencing.com/effect-salt-sugar-dehydrated-cells-20371.html|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Treatment ==
{{Main article|Management of dehydration}}
The treatment for minor dehydration that is often considered the most effective is drinking water and stopping fluid loss. Plain water restores only the volume of the blood plasma, inhibiting the thirst mechanism before solute levels can be replenished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Murray |first2=John |last2=Stofan | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Ch. 8: Formulating carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks for optimal efficacy |editor1-first=Ron J. |editor1-last=Maughan |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Murray |title=Sports Drinks: Basic Science and Practical Aspects |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bS12dnUsGJcC&amp;pg=PA197 |year=2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-7008-3 |pages=197–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid foods can contribute to fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;"Healthwise Handbook," Healthwise, Inc. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Urine concentration and frequency will customarily return to normal as dehydration resolves.&lt;ref name=mednet&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Wedro | first1 = Benjamin | name-list-format = vanc | title = Dehydration | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm | website = MedicineNet | accessdate = June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the replenishment of necessary water and [[electrolyte]]s (through [[oral rehydration therapy]] or [[fluid replacement]] by [[intravenous therapy]]). As oral rehydration is less painful, less invasive, less expensive, and easier to provide, it is the treatment of choice for mild dehydration.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Solutions used for intravenous rehydration must be [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] or [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity |hypertonic]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}  Pure water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown ([[lysis]]) of red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]).{{cn|date=January 2018}}

When [[fresh water]] is unavailable (e.g. at sea or in a desert), [[seawater]] and [[ethanol]] will worsen the condition. [[Urine]] contains a lower solute concentration than seawater, and numerous guides advise against its consumption in survival situations.&lt;ref name="NOS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/drinksw.html |title=Can Humans drink seawater? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=National Ocean Service |publisher=National Ocean Service NOAA Department of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt; If somebody is dehydrated and is taken to a hospital, [[Intravenous therapy |IVs]] are also used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplesurvival.net/articles/find_water.htm SimpleSurvival Find Water ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trackertrail.com/publications/motherearthnews/72/index.html Tracker Trail - Mother Earth News - Issue #72&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equipped.com/primer.htm EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE (tm) - A Survival Primer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventuresportsonline.com/5basic.htm Five Basic Survival Skills in the Wilderness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For severe cases of dehydration where [[fainting]], [[unconsciousness]], or other severely inhibiting symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given orally or intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status; complete resolution is the norm in all but the most extreme cases.

==Second World War==
In December 1939, Pleasence initially refused conscription into the British Armed Forces, registering as a [[conscientious objector]], but changed his stance in autumn 1940, after the attacks upon London by the [[Luftwaffe]], and volunteered with the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for D.

Midland Counties Publications, UK. {{ISBN|0-904597-91-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was captured and imprisoned in the German prisoner-of-war camp [[Stalag Luft I]], where he was treated well reciprocally (like the British treated captured Luftwaffe pilots) in similar prisoner-of-war camps. Here, Pleasence produced and acted in many plays for the entertainment of his fellow captives. 

After the war and his release, he was discharged from the R.A.F. in 1946.

==Acting career==
Returning to acting post-war Pleasence resumed working in repertory theatre companies in [[Birmingham]] and [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=indepobit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries--donald-pleasence-1571295.html|title=Obituaries: Donald Pleasence|accessdate=14 February 2012|publisher=The Independent|date=3 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Pleasence's stage work included performing as Willie Mossop in a 1952 production of ''[[Hobson's Choice (play)|Hobson's Choice]]'' at the [[Arts Theatre]] and as Dauphin in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]'' (1956).&lt;ref name=indepobit/&gt; In 1960, Pleasence won acclaim as the tramp in [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Caretaker]]'' at the Arts Theatre, a role he would again play in a 1990 revival.&lt;ref name=indepobit/&gt; Other stage work in the 1960s included Anouilh's ''Poor Bitos'' (1967) and [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]'s ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'' (1967), for which he won the London Variety Award for Stage Actor of the Year in 1968.&lt;ref name=indepobit/&gt; Pleasence's later stage work included performing in a double bill of Pinter plays, ''[[The Basement (play)|The Basement]]'' and ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'', at the [[Duchess Theatre]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=indepobit/&gt;

===Television===
Pleasence made his television debut in ''I Want to Be a Doctor'' (1946).&lt;ref name=indepobit/&gt; In 1954, he received critical acclaim as Syme in a [[BBC]] [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (UK TV programme)|adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name=indepobit/&gt; The adaptation was by Nigel Kneale and also starred [[Peter Cushing]], another British actor who would go on to find fame in many horror film roles.

Pleasence played [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in several episodes of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1956–1958). He appeared twice with [[Patrick McGoohan]] in the British spy series, ''[[Danger Man]]'', in episodes "Position of Trust" (1960) and "Find and Return" (1961). Pleasence's first appearance in America was in an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', playing an ageing teacher at a boys' school in the episode "[[The Changing of the Guard (The Twilight Zone)|The Changing of the Guard]]" (1962). In 1963, he appeared in an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled "[[The Man with the Power (The Outer Limits)|The Man With the Power]]". In 1966, he also guest starred in an episode of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' entitled "With Strings Attached"

In 1973, Pleasence played a sympathetic murderer in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'' entitled "[[Columbo (season 3)|Any Old Port in a Storm]]". He also portrayed a murderer captured by ''[[Mrs. Columbo]]'' in "Murder Is a Parlor Game" (1979). In 1978, he played a scout, Sam Purchas in an [[Centennial (miniseries)|adaptation]] of James A. Michener's ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]''. Pleasence starred as the Reverend Septimus Harding in the BBC's TV series ''[[The Barchester Chronicles]]'' (1982). In this series, his daughter [[Angela Pleasence]] played his onscreen daughter Susan.

He hosted the 1981 Halloween episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with music guest [[Fear (band)|Fear]].

In 1986, Pleasence joined [[Ronald Lacey]] and Polly Jo Pleasence for the television thriller ''Into the Darkness''.

===Film===
[[File:Donald Pleasence in Eye of the Devil trailer 1.jpg|thumb|Donald Pleasence in the trailer for the film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'' (1966).]]
Pleasence made his big-screen debut with ''[[The Beachcomber (1954 film)|The Beachcomber]]'' (1954). Some notable early roles include Parsons in ''[[1984 (1956 film)|1984]]'' (1956), his second Orwell film, and minor roles opposite [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[Barnacle Bill (1957 film)|Barnacle Bill]]'' (1957) and [[Dirk Bogarde]] in ''[[The Wind Cannot Read]]'' (1958). In [[Tony Richardson]]'s film of ''[[Look Back in Anger (1959 film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), he plays a vindictive market inspector opposite [[Richard Burton]]. In the same year, Pleasence starred in the horror films ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'' directed by [[Sidney Hayers]], playing the role of Vanet, the owner of a circus, and ''[[The Flesh and the Fiends]]'' as the real-life murderer [[Burke and Hare murders|William Hare]], alongside [[Peter Cushing]], [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]] and [[Billie Whitelaw]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/253086%7c0/Circus-of-Horrors.html|title=Circus of Horrors|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endowed with a shiny bald head, a penetrating stare, and an intense voice, usually quiet but capable of a piercing scream, he specialised in portraying insane, fanatical, or evil characters, including the title role in ''[[Dr Crippen]]'' (1962), the double agent Dr Michaels in the sci-fi hit ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (1966), the white trader who sells guns to the [[Cheyenne]] Indians in the revisionist western ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' (1970), the mad Doctor in the [[Bud Spencer]]–[[Terence Hill]] film ''Watch Out, We're Mad'' (1974), Nazi leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] in ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' (1976), and the Bond arch-villain [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967), the first film in which the villain's face is clearly seen. His interpretation of the character has become predominant in popular culture considering the popularity of the comic villain, [[Dr. Evil]] in the successful ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' film series, which primarily parodies it. In the crime drama ''[[Hell is a City]]'' (1960), shot in Manchester, he starred opposite [[Stanley Baker]], whilst he was memorably cast in the horror comedy ''[[What a Carve Up! (film)|What a Carve Up!]]'' (1961) as the “horrible-looking zombie” solicitor opposite [[Shirley Eaton]], [[Sid James]], [[Kenneth Connor]] and [[Dennis Price]].

He appeared as the POW [[forger]] Colin Blythe in the film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963), who discovers that he is slowly going blind, but nonetheless participates in the mass break-out, only to be shot down by German soldiers because he is unable to see them. In ''[[The Night of the Generals]]'' (1967), he played another uncharacteristically sympathetic role, this time as an old-school German general involved in a [[20 July plot|plot]] to kill [[Adolf Hitler]]. In 1971, he returned to the realm of the deranged, delivering a ''tour de force'' performance in the role of an alcoholic [[Australia]]n doctor in [[Ted Kotcheff]]'s nightmarish outback drama ''[[Wake in Fright]]''.

Pleasence played [[Lucifer]] in the religious epic ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965). His character taking on many dark, shadowy human disguises throughout the film was unprecedented in breathing life into the Luke 4:13 phrase "... he left Him until an opportune time ..." He was one of many stars who were given [[cameo appearance|cameos]] throughout the film.

He also acted in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'' (1966), in which he portrayed the love-sodden husband of a much younger French wife ([[Françoise Dorléac]]). In 1968, he ventured successfully into American cowboy territory, playing a sadistic self-styled preacher who goes after stoic [[Charlton Heston]] in the Western ''[[Will Penny]]''.

In his later years, he portrayed Lucas Deranian in Walt Disney's ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' (1975), the Russian seeking to start a war between the United States and the Soviet Union in ''[[Telefon (film)|Telefon]]'' (1977), [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), The teacher, Kantorek in ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1979)'','' Dr. Kobras in ''[[The Pumaman]]'' (1980) and the held-hostage President of the United States in ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981). The distinctive, rather sinister accent which Pleasence employed in this and other films may be credited to the [[elocution]] lessons he had as a child. He reprised his Dr. Sam Loomis role in ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988), ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989) and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995).

Pleasence admired [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleasence.com/BIO-DP.HTML |title=Donald Pleasence'S Biography |publisher=Pleasence.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he worked on-stage in the 1950s, and later on the film version of ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'' (1979). Two years earlier, Pleasence did an amusingly broad impersonation of Olivier in the guise of a horror-film actor called "Valentine De'ath" in the film ''[[The Uncanny (film)|The Uncanny]]'' (1977). According to the film critic [[Kim Newman]] on a DVD commentary for ''Halloween II'', the reason for Pleasence’s lengthy filmography was that he never turned down any role that was offered.

===Spoken records and voice-overs===
During the early 1960s, Pleasence recorded several children's-story records on the Atlas Record label. These were marketed as the Talespinners series in the United Kingdom. They were also released in the United States as [[Tale Spinners for Children]] by [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]. The stories included ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and the ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]''.

Pleasence provided the voice-over for the British [[public information film]], ''[[Lonely Water|The Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water]]'' (1973). The film, intended to warn children of the dangers of playing near water, attained notoriety for allegedly giving children nightmares.

===Books===
Pleasence was the author of the children's book ''[[Scouse the Mouse]]'' (1977) (London: New English Library), which was animated by Canadian animator/film director [[Gerald Potterton]] (a friend of the actor, who directed him in the Canadian film ''The Rainbow Boys'' (1973), retitled ''The Rainbow Gang'' for VHS release in the United States) and also adapted into a children's recording ([[Polydor Records]], 1977) with [[Ringo Starr]] voicing the book's title character, Scouse the Mouse.

In his book ''British Film Character Actors'' (1982), Terence Pettigrew described him as 'a potent combination of eyes and voice. The eyes are mournful but they can also be sinister or seedy or just plain nutty. He has the kind of piercing stare which lifts enamel off saucepans.'

==Awards==
Pleasence was nominated four times for the [[Tony Award]] for best performance by a leading actor in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play: in 1962 for [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Caretaker]]'', in 1965 for [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''Poor Bitos'', in 1969 for [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]'s ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'', and in 1972 for [[Simon Gray]]'s ''[[Wise Child]]''.

Pleasence was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his services to the acting profession by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994.

==Personal life==
Pleasence married four times and had five daughters from his first three marriages. He had [[Angela Pleasence|Angela]] and Jean with Miriam Raymond (m. 1941–1958); Lucy and Polly with Josephine Martin Crombie (m. 1959–1970); and Miranda with Meira Shore (m. 1970–1988). His last marriage was to Linda Kentwood (m. 1988–1995; his death)

==Death==
On 2 February 1995, Pleasence died at age 75 in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]], [[France]], from complications of [[heart failure]] following [[heart valve]] replacement surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mel Gussow |coauthors= |title=Donald Pleasence, Virtuoso Actor, Dies at 75 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/03/obituaries/donald-pleasence-virtuoso-actor-dies-at-75.html |quote=Donald Pleasence, the intense, virtuosic actor who was acclaimed in London and on Broadway for his performance in the title role of Harold Pinter's play "The Caretaker," died yesterday at his home in St. Paul de Vence in the south of France. He was 75 and also had a home in London. ...|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= 3 February 1995 |accessdate=2015-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was cremated.

==Legacy==
The 1995 film ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' was dedicated to Donald Pleasence. The 1998 film ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' also features a dedication to Pleasence in the end credits, with sound-alike voice actor [[Tom Kane]] providing a voice-over for Loomis in the film. In the 2018 film, [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'']], sound-alike comedian Colin Mahan voices Loomis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/amp/halloween-2018-dr-loomis-voice-cameo/|title=Dr. Loomis Has a Voice Cameo in Halloween 2018|date=27 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/10/21/halloween-donald-pleasence/|title=New 'Halloween' almost had a completely different beginning|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Dr. Evil]], the character played by [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' comedy films (1997–2002), and Doctor Claw from ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' are parodies of Pleasence's performance as Blofeld in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.

'''Electrocution''' is [[death]] or serious injury caused by [[Electrical injury|electric shock]], electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from "electro" and "execution", but it is also used for accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electrocute "Electrocute" from the ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary of the English Language''], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = electrocute|date = |encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionaries|publisher = Oxford University Press|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/electrocute|accessdate = 2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used to describe non-fatal injuries due to electricity.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; 

The term "electrocution" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the [[electric chair]] and originally referred only to electrical execution and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.

== Origins ==
{{further|Electric chair}}

In the Netherlands in 1746 [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]]'s lab assistant, [[Andreas Cuneus]], received an extreme shock while working with a [[leyden jar]], the first recorded injury from man-made electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awesomestories.com/pdf/make/144237 awesomestories.com, THE LEYDEN JAR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zongcheng Yang, Chinese Burn Surgery, Springer -, 2015, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century high-voltage electrical systems came into use to power [[Arc lamp|arc lighting]] for theatrical stage lighting and lighthouses leading to the first recorded accidental death in 1879 when a stage carpenter in [[Lyon]], [[France]] touched a 250-volt wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=R.C.|author2=Rudall, D.|year=1992|title=Injury Mechanisms And Therapeutic Advances In The Study Of Electrical Shock|journal=Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE|volume=7|pages=2825–2827|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5761711|doi=10.1109/IEMBS.1992.5761711}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The spread of arc light-based street lighting systems (which at the time ran at a voltages above 3,000 volts) after 1880 led to many people dying from coming in contact with these high-voltage lines, a strange new phenomenon which seemed to kill instantaneously without leaving a mark on the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Stross, The Wizard of Menlo Park: How Thomas Alva Edison Invented the Modern World, Crown/Archetype - 2007, page 171-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History pages 14-24&lt;/ref&gt; This would lead to execution by electricity in the [[electric chair]] in the late 1890s as an official method of [[capital punishment]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], thought to be a more humane alternative to [[hanging]]. After an 1881 death in [[Buffalo, New York]] caused by a high voltage arc lighting system, a local dentist named [[Alfred P. Southwick]] sought to develop this phenomenon into a way to execute condemned criminals with him basing his device on form he knew well, a dental chair.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 24&lt;/ref&gt; 

The next nine years saw promotion by Southwick, the New York state Gerry commission (which included Southwick) recommending execution by electricity, a June 4, 1888 law making it the state form of execution on January 2, 1889, and a further state committee of doctors and lawyers to finalize the details of the method used.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group - 2007, pages 102-104&lt;/ref&gt; 

The adoption of the electric chair became mixed up in the "[[war of currents]]" between [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[direct current]] system and industrialist [[George Westinghouse]]'s [[alternating current]] system in 1889 when noted anti-AC activist [[Harold P. Brown]] became a consultant to the committee. Brown pushed, with the assistance and sometimes collusion of Edison Electric and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], for the successful adoption of alternating current to power the chair, an attempt to portray AC as a public menace and the "executioners current".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA - 2009, pages 152-155&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===

In May 1889 the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] sentenced its first criminal, a street merchant named [[William Kemmler]], to be executed in their new form of capital punishment. Tabloid newspapers, trying to describe this new form of electrical execution, started settling on "electrocution," a [[portmanteau]] word derived from "electro" and "execution".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=xxii}} It was not the only choice of word people were considering. ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial column noted words such as "''Westinghouse''d" (after the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] [[alternating current]] equipment that was to be used), "''Gerry''cide" (after [[Elbridge Gerry]] who headed New York death penalty commission that suggested adopting the electric chair), and "''Brown''ed" (after anti-AC activist [[Harold P. Brown]]).{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}} [[Thomas Edison]] preferred the words ''dynamort'', ''ampermort'' and ''electromort''.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}} ''The New York Times'' hated the word electrocution, describing it as being pushed forward by "pretentious ignoramuses".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=xxii}}

== Medical aspects ==
{{Main|Electric shock}}

The health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body depends on the amount of [[electric current|current]] and the length of time for which it flows, not merely on the [[voltage]]. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fish|first=Raymond M.|last2=Geddes|first2=Leslie A.|date=2009-10-12|title=Conduction of Electrical Current to and Through the Human Body: A Review|journal=Eplasty|volume=9|issn=1937-5719|pmc=2763825|pmid=19907637}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ. 

Death can occur from any shock that carries enough sustained current to stop the heart. Low currents (70–700 mA) usually trigger [[fibrillation]] in the heart, which is reversible via [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]] but is nearly always fatal without help. Currents as low as 30 mA AC or 300-500 mA DC applied to the body surface can cause fibrillation. Large currents (&gt; 1 A) cause permanent damage via [[burn]]s and cellular damage. 

The voltage necessary to create current of a given level through the body varies widely with the resistance of the skin; wet or sweaty skin or broken skin can allow a larger current to flow. Whether an electric current is fatal is also dependent on the path it takes through the body, which depends in turn on the points at which the current enters and leaves the body. The current path must usually include either the heart or the brain to be fatal.

The '''Government Telephone Preference Scheme''' ('''GTPS''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] system for limiting outgoing calls from [[landline]]s if the [[PSTN|network]] is overloaded during an emergency. Numbers registered under the GTPS will still be able to make outgoing calls if the service is limited. All telephones will still be able to receive calls.

There are three categories of use – the most essential are called Preference Category I, and are limited to 2% of lines of a telephone exchange. According to a British government document, they are intended to be limited to "lines vital to the prosecution of war and to national survival". The second category – Preference Category II – are for lines needed for the community and these and Preference Category II are limited in total to 10% of the exchange. All other users are in Category III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/privileged-access-schemes-mtpas-ftpas-and-airwave Privileged Access Schemes: MTPAS, FTPAS and Airwave]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was established in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo971113/text/71113w13.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is now (2013) closed to addition of new numbers due to the replacement by service providers of the infrastructure over which the scheme operated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/resilient-communications]&lt;/ref&gt; A date for the full closure of the scheme has not been publicly set.

Phones on the scheme include armed forces headquarters, local authority emergency planning centres, emergency services such as police, fire and ambulance and public telephone boxes. Since 1992 the [[United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation]] and [[Royal Observer Corps]] operational lines have been deleted from the scheme.

A similar scheme limiting [[mobile telephone]] access is called [[MTPAS]] (formerly [[ACCOLC]]).

The GTPS should not be confused with the [[Telephone Preference Service]] which is an opt-out telephone list funded by the British direct marketing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/tps/ Telephone Preference Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Greek Operation'''{{Cref|a}} ({{lang-ru|Греческая Операция}}, translit. Grecheskaya Operatsiya; {{lang-uk|Грецька операція}}) was an organised mass persecution of the [[Greeks in Russia and the Soviet Union|Greeks of the Soviet Union]] that was ordered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. Greeks often use the term "[[pogrom]]" (πογκρόμ) for this persecution, though this term usually refers to mob violence rather than persecution by police acting under direct orders, as this one was.&lt;ref name="ka"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928092420/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_100073_09/12/2007_252017 Το πογκρόμ κατά των Ελλήνων της ΕΣΣΔ], ''ΕΛΛΑΔΑ'', 09.12.2007 &lt;/ref&gt;  It began on December 15, 1937 and marked the beginning of the repressions against Greeks went on for 13 years.&lt;ref name=repr&gt;[http://www.greek.ru/news/diaspora/31749/ "Репрессии в 1930-1950 гг. по отношению к грекам СССР"]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the sources, it is estimated that between 20,000&lt;ref name="Greeks of the Steppe"/&gt; and 50,000{{sfn|Agtzidis|1991|p=372—382}} Greeks died by the end of this campaign.

A wave of Greek emigrants from the Soviet Union in 1937—1939 is often considered a consequence of Stalinist persecution of the Soviet Greek national movement.{{sfn|Popov|2016|p=64}}

==History==
The [[Soviet Census (1926)|1926 Soviet census]] registered 213,765 Greeks in the country{{sfn|Vouitra|2011|p=131}} and 286,000 in the 1939 census.{{sfn|Kubiiovych|Struk|1984|p=97}} On 9 August 1937, [[NKVD]] order 00485 was adopted to target "subversive activities of [[Poles in the Soviet Union|Polish]] intelligence" in the Soviet Union, but was later expanded to also include Latvians, Germans, Estonians, Finns, Greeks, Iranians and Chinese.{{sfn|Marshall|2010|p=335}} 

The prosecution of Greeks in USSR was gradual: at first the authorities shut down the Greek schools, cultural centres, and publishing houses.&lt;ref name="ka"/&gt;  Then, the [[NKVD|secret police]] indiscriminately arrested all Greek men 16 years old or older.&lt;ref name="ka"/&gt;  All Greeks who were [[wealthy]] or [[self-employed]] [[professional]]s were sought for prosecution first.&lt;ref name="ka"/&gt;

On many occasions, the central authorities sent telegrams to police forces with orders to arrest a certain number of Greeks, without giving any individual names,&lt;ref name="ka"/&gt; and the police officers would  arrest at random any persons of Greek origin until they reached the requested total number of arrests, until the process was repeated at a later date. In all, some 50,000 Greeks died from this persecution.{{sfn|Agtzidis|1991|p=372—382}}

Some soures claim that there was no widespread counter-revolutionary activity among the Soviet Greeks,{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=91}} though there were exceptions in [[Constantine Kromiadi]], an [[anti-communist]] of Greek origin, who was became later second in command in [[Andrey Vlasov]] ''[[Abwehr]]'' detachment during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Nazi German occupation of the Soviet Union]] in [[World War II]]{{sfn|Thomas|2015|p=16}} and [[Vladimir Mikhailovich Despotuli]].

==Axis collaboration==
About one thousand Greeks from Greece and more from the Soviet Union, ostensibly avenging their ethnic persecution from Soviet authorities, joined the Waffen-SS, mostly in Ukrainian divisions. A special case was that of the infamous Ukrainian-Greek [[Sevastianos Foulidis]], a fanatical anti-communist who had been recruited by the [[Abwehr]] as early as 1938 and became an official of the Wehrmacht, with extensive action in intelligence and agitation work in the Eastern front. &lt;ref&gt; Hondromatidis, Iakovos I Mavri Skia Stin Ellada ("The Black Shadow Over Greece"), Athens 2004 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
In 1938, 20,000 Soviet Greeks arrived in Greece.{{sfn|Olson|Pappas|Pappas|1994|p=274}} Between 1965 and 1975, another 15,000 Greeks emigrated from the Soviet Union and went to Greece.{{sfn|Olson|Pappas|Pappas|1994|p=275}} A monument to all Greek victims of [[GULAG]] was unveiled in [[Magadan]] in 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ria.ru/society/20110910/433650393.html "Памятник грекам, жертвам сталинского ГУЛАГа, откроют на Колыме"]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other 'punished' ethnic groups, the Soviet Greeks were never [[On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples|officially rehabilitated]] by the Soviet legislation.{{sfn|Popov|2016|p=61}} In the early 1990s, a movement arose advocating a creation of a new Greek autonomy in the Krasnodar region, but it failed to achieve support. One Soviet Greek man, born in 1959, described this outcome with the following words:
{{quote2|When these Greek societies started emerging, I told the lads that there was a society that was reviving us, the Pontic Greeks. Do you know what their answer was? They said, that if such societies were organised then we would have to expect a repetition of 1937. So many Greeks were deported then.{{sfn|Popov|2016|p=61}}}}


Soviet Greeks were [[On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples|officially rehabilitated]], among with other ethnic groups by Russian Federation, &lt;ref&gt; [http://kremlin.ru/acts/news/50284 Внесены изменения в указ о мерах по реабилитации армянского, болгарского, греческого, крымско-татарского и немецкого народов и государственной поддержке их возрождения и развития]&lt;/ref&gt; amended by Decree no.  458 of September 12, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/40037 Указ Президента Российской Федерации от 12.09.2015 г. № 458]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] launched '''Group T4''' in 1990 to facilitate rally trucks in rally raid competitions. The regulations are included in appendix J of the [[International Sporting Code]]. 

==Competition== 
Group T4 trucks compete in the [[FIA Cross Country Rally World Cup]] since its inception in 1993. However T4 trucks can compete, the trucks are not eligible to compete for the general classification or have a group classification. The trucks can only compete for local rally raid victories or class victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIA Cross Country Rallies - Sporting Regulations - 2017|url=http://www.fia.com/file/53779/download/9254?token=8Wo7qnxu|website=FIA|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dakar Rally]], [[Baja Aragón]], [[Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge]] among other rally raids form the FIA Cross Country Rally World Cup. Group T4 vehicles are allowed to compete in other rally raid competitions as well, such as the [[Silk Way Rally]].

==Regulations==
Trucks eligible for Group T4 homologation must comply with a fixed set of rules according to Appendix J, article 287. The truck must be a production based chassis and have conventional bodywork. The laden weight has a minimum of 3.500kg. Despite certain modifications, the engine is a stock production engine. While the [[Unimog]] U500 engine is 'only' 6374cc, the engine of most trucks exceed more than 10000cc. 

Because of safety regulations, the cabs have a very strong [[roll cage]]. A diagonal bar in the rear of the roll cage is mandatory. More diagonal struts are advised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix J 2017 - Article 287 - Cross Country Truck Technical Regulations|url=http://www.fia.com/file/51650/download/12816?token=tM0eCoMq|website=FIA|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rally raids such as the Dakar Rally and the Silk Way Rally have added rules to the standard Group T4 rules. The Silk Way Rally bases its rules on the Dakar Rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silk Way Rally 2017 Car / Truck Regulations|url=http://www.silkwayrally.com/upload/medialibrary/131/1316ba8bbe8f51ef1fdc47fd7933e0f4.pdf|website=Silk Way Rally|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both rallies know sub groups to Group T4: 

;Group T4.1: Series production truck built according to FIA Group T4 regulations.
;Group T4.2: Modified truck conforming to [[Amaury Sport Organisation|ASO]] regulations and homologation.
;Group T4.3: Trucks built according to Group T4.1 or Group T4.2 regulations and serving a "rapid assistance" role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakar 2018 - Car - SxS - Truck Regulations|url=http://netstorage.lequipe.fr/ASO/dakar/2018/reglements/REG_AC_DK18_CLEAN_FINAL_FR_SP_2018_EN.pdf|website=Dakar|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harassment''' covers a wide range of [[behavior]]s of an [[wikt:offensive|offensive]] nature. It is commonly understood as behavior that demeans, humiliates or embarrasses a person, and it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness. In the legal sense, these are behaviors that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening. It evolves from [[Discrimination|discriminatory grounds]], and has an effect of nullifying or impairing a person from benefiting their rights. When this behaviors become repetitive it is defined as [[bullying]]. [[Sexual harassment]] refers to persistent and unwanted sexual advances even after gently refusing, typically in the workplace, where the consequences are potentially very disadvantageous to the victim if there is a [[Power (social and political)|power]] imbalance between the perpetuator.

==Etymology==
The word is based in English since circa 1618 as a [[loan word]] from the French, which was in turn already attested in 1572 meaning ''torment, annoyance, bother, trouble''&lt;ref&gt;J. Amyot, Œuvres morales, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; and later as of 1609 was also referred to ''the condition of being exhausted, overtired''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lescarbot, Histoire de la Nouvelle France, I, 479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/harassement harassement] in the French etymologic dictionary CNRTL (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the French verb ''harasser'' itself there are the first records in a Latin to French translation of 1527 of [[Thucydides]]’ [[History of the Peloponnesian War|History of the war]] that was between the [[Peloponnesia]]ns and the [[Athens|Athenians]] both in the countries of the Greeks and the Romans and the neighbouring places wherein the translator writes ''harasser'' allegedly meaning ''harceler'' (to exhaust the enemy by repeated raids); and in the military chant Chanson du [[franc archer]]&lt;ref&gt;The original [https://books.google.com/books?id=hMUFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Chanson+du+franc+archer+%22+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=F80UMk0A17&amp;sig=vfOYYDexxIUL2TQgl1cdcaPOpTo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA33,M1 text] of the chant&lt;/ref&gt; of 1562, where the term is referred to a gaunt [[wikt:jument|jument]] (''de poil fauveau, tant maigre et harassée'': of fawn horsehair, so meagre and …) where it is supposed that the verb is used meaning ''overtired''.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/harasser harasser] in the French etymologic dictionary CNRTL (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothesis about the origin of the verb ''harasser'' is ''harace''/''harache'', which was used in the 14th century in expressions like ''courre à la harache'' (to pursue) and ''prendre aucun par la harache'' (to take somebody under constraint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/academie9/harassant//1 |title=Centre national de ressources textuelles et lexicales |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch]], a German etymological dictionary of the French language (1922–2002) compares phonetically and syntactically both ''harace'' and ''harache'' to the interjection ''hare'' and ''haro'' by alleging a pejorative and augmentative form. The latter was an exclamation indicating distress and emergency (recorded since 1180) but is also reported later in 1529 in the expression ''crier haro sur'' (to arise indignation over somebody). ''hare'' 's use is already reported in 1204 as an order to finish public activities as fairs or markets and later (1377) still as command but referred to dogs. This dictionary suggests a relation of ''haro''/''hare'' with the old lower franconian ''*hara'' (here) (as by bringing a dog to heel).&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/haro haro]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pejorative of an exclamation and in particular of such an exclamation is theoretically possible for the first word (''harace'') and maybe phonetically plausible for ''harache'', a semantic, syntactic and phonetic similarity of the verb ''harasser'' as used in the first popular attestation (the chant mentioned above) with the word ''haras'' should be kept in mind: Already in 1160 ''haras'' indicated a group of horses constrained together for the purpose of reproduction and in 1280 it also indicated the enclosure facility itself, where those horses are constrained.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/haras haras]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin itself of ''harass'' is thought to be the old Scandinavian ''hârr'' with the Romanic suffix –as, which meant ''grey or dimmish horsehair''. Controversial is the etymological relation to the Arabic word for ''horse'' whose roman [[Romanization of Arabic|transliteration]] is [[Arabian horse|faras]].

Although the French origin of the word 'harassment' is beyond all question in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and those dictionaries basing on it, a supposed Old French verb ''harer'' should be the origin of the French verb ''harasser'', despite the fact that this verb cannot be found in French etymologic dictionaries like that of the [[:fr:Centre national de resources textuelles et lexicales|Centre national de resources textuelles et lexicales]] or the [[Trésor de la langue française informatisé]] (see also their corresponding websites as indicated in the interlinks); since the entry further alleges a derivation from ''hare'', like in the mentioned German etymological dictionary of the French language a possible misprint of ''harer'' = ''har/ass/er'' = ''harasser'' is plausible or cannot be excluded. In those dictionaries the relationship with ''harassment'' were an interpretation of the interjection ''hare'' as ''to urge a dog to attack', despite the fact that it should indicate a shout to come and not to go (''hare'' = ''hara'' = ''here''; cf. above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/harassment|title=Harassment - Define Harassment at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=harass&amp;searchmode=phrase|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harassment|title=Harass - Definition of harass by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] prudently indicates this origin only as possible.

==Types==

===Electronic===
{{Main|Electronic harassment}}
Electronic harassment is the unproven belief of the use of [[electromagnetic wave]]s to harass a victim. Psychologists have identified evidence of [[auditory hallucination]]s, [[delusional disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=KMIRNews20121112&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |title=Electronic Harassment: Voices in My Mind |last=Monroe |first=Angela |date=November 12, 2012 |newspaper=KMIR News |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213164754/http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |archivedate=February 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[mental disorder]]s in online communities supporting those who claim to be targeted.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html |title=Mind Games |last=Weinberger|first=Sharon |date=January 14, 2007 | work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Pochechueva.

===Landlord===
{{Main|Landlord harassment}}
Landlord harassment is the willing creation, by a [[landlord]] or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in order to induce willing abandonment of a [[Real estate contract|rental contract]].  Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal [[expenses]] and potential problems with [[eviction]].  This kind of activity is common in regions where [[rent control]] laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices.  Landlord harassment carries specific legal penalties in some [[jurisdiction]]s, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances.  However, when a [[crime]] is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an [[Attendant circumstance|aggravating factor]] in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

===Mobile===
{{Main|Mobile harassment}}
Mobile harassment refers to the sending of any type of [[Text messaging|text message]], [[Picture message|photo message]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|video message]], or [[voicemail]] from a [[mobile phone]] that threatens, torments, or humiliates the recipient of these messages. It is a form of [[cyber bullying]].

===Online===

{{Main|Online harassment}}
Harassment directs multiple repeating obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing photos of the victim and their families, doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media with the aim of causing emotional distress (see [[cyberbullying]], [[cyberstalking]], [[hate crime]], [[online predator]], and [[stalking]]).

===Police===
{{Main|Police harassment}}
Unfair treatment conducted by law officials, including but not limited to [[excessive force]], [[Racial profiling|profiling]], [[Intimidation|threats]], [[coercion]], and racial, ethnic, religious, gender/sexual, age, or other forms of [[discrimination]].

===Power===
{{Main|Power harassment}}
Power harassment is harassment or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious [[abuse]]s which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal [[discrimination]] and is a form of political and [[psychological abuse]], and [[bullying]].

===Psychological===
This is humiliating, intimidating or abusive behavior which is often difficult to detect, leaving no evidence other than victim reports or complaints. This characteristically lowers a person’s self-esteem or causes one to have overwhelming torment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annette B. Roter|title=Understanding and Recognizing Dysfunctional Leadership: The Impact of Dysfunctional Leadership on Organizations and Followers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTElDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=26 June 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-00517-9|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can take the form of verbal comments, engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or repeated gestures. Falling into this category is workplace harassment by individuals or groups [[mobbing]].

===Racial===
{{Main|Racial harassment}}
The targeting of an individual because of their race or ethnicity. The harassment may include words, deeds, and actions that are specifically designed to make the target feel degraded due to their race or ethnicity.

Verbal, psychological or physical harassment is used against targets because they choose to practice a specific religion. Religious harassment can also include forced and involuntary conversions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Religious terrorism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}{{Further|Sexual harassment in education|Sexual harassment in the military}}

Sexual harassment is an offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex. It can be an subtle and overt sexual nature of a person (sexual annoyance), implied sexual conditions of a job (sexual coercion), etc. It can happen anywhere, but is most common in the [[Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States|workplace]], [[Sexual harassment in education|schools]], and the [[Sexual harassment in the military|military]]. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable.

Workplace harassment is the offensive, belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group of workers.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications01/harassment.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, matters of [[workplace]] harassment have gained interest among practitioners and researchers as it is becoming one of the most sensitive areas of effective workplace management. In [[Oriental]] countries, it attracted lots of attention from researchers and governments since the 1980s, because a significant source of work stress is associated with aggressive behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani, N.

==Laws==
{{globalize|section|date=August 2015}}

===United States===

Harassment, under the laws of the United States, is defined as any repeated or continuing un-consented contact that serves no useful purpose beyond creating alarm, annoyance, or emotional distress. In 1964, the United States Congress passed Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] which prohibited discrimination at work on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and sex. This later became the legal basis for early harassment law. The practice of developing workplace guidelines prohibiting harassment was pioneered in 1969, when the U.S. Department of Defense drafted a Human Goals Charter, establishing a policy of equal respect for both sexes. In ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]],'' {{ussc|477|57|1986}}: the U.S. Supreme Court recognized harassment suits against employers for promoting a sexually [[hostile work environment]]. In 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] signed a law which prohibited the transmission of annoying messages over the [[Internet]] (''aka'' [[Spam (electronic)|spamming]]) without disclosing the sender's true identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|author-link=Declan McCullagh|url=http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance,+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html|title=Create an e-annoyance, go to jail|work=CNET news|date=9 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315091415/http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance,+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html|archive-date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination ("LAD")====
The LAD prohibits employers from discriminating in any job-related action, including recruitment, interviewing, hiring, promotions, discharge, compensation and the terms, conditions and privileges of employment on the basis of any of the law's specified protected categories. These protected categories are race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, sex (including pregnancy and sexual harassment), marital status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic information, liability for military service, or mental or physical disability, including [[HIV/AIDS]] and related illnesses. The LAD prohibits intentional discrimination based on any of these characteristics. Intentional discrimination may take the form of differential treatment or statements and conduct that reflect discriminatory animus or bias.

===Canada===
In 1984, the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] prohibited sexual harassment in workplaces under federal jurisdiction.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Harassment in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, there are a number of laws protecting people from harassment, including the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]] and the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

In Japanese culture,  '''''Hatsuyume''''' (初夢) is the first [[dream]] one has in the new year. Traditionally, the contents of such a dream would foretell the luck of the dreamer in the ensuing year. In Japan, the night of December 31 was often passed without sleeping, thus the ''hatsuyume'' is often experienced during the night of January 1. This is why the day after the night of the "first dream" is known as ''Hatsuyume''. This day is January 2 in the gregorian calendar, but was different in the traditional [[Japanese calendar]].

It is considered to be particularly good luck to dream of [[Mount Fuji]], a [[hawk]], and an [[eggplant]]. This belief has been in place since the early [[Edo period]] but there are various theories regarding the origins as to why this particular combination was considered to be auspicious. One theory suggests that this combination is lucky because Mount Fuji is Japan's highest mountain, the hawk is a clever and strong bird, and the word for eggplant (''nasu'' or ''nasubi'' 茄子) suggests achieving something great (''nasu'' 成す). Another theory suggests that this combination arose because Mount Fuji, [[falconry]], and early eggplants were favorites of the ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].

Although this superstition is well known in Japan, often memorized in the form ''Ichi-Fuji, Ni-Taka, San-Nasubi'' (一富士、二鷹、三茄子; 1. Fuji, 2. Hawk, 3. Eggplant), the continuation of the list is not as well known. The continuation is ''Yon-Sen, Go-Tabako, Roku-Zatō'' (四扇、五煙草、六座頭; 4. Fan, 5. Tobacco, 6. Blind [[acupressure]]r). The origins of this trio are less well known, and it is unclear whether they were added after the original three or whether the list of six originated at the same time.

[[Image:Paul poon 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Paul Poon]] leads Kenneth Look in his [[Honda Civic]] EP3, July 2008]]

The '''Hong Kong Touring Car Championship''' ({{zh|c=香港房車錦標賽}}) was established by the Hong Kong Automobile Association in 2002. Currently, all the races are held at the [[Zhuhai International Circuit]] in Guangdong province, China, at the [[Guangdong International Circuit]] in the same province or during the [[Macau Grand Prix]] near Hong Kong .

==The Championships==
The Super Production Class and N2000 Class Championships each consists of 8 races at Zhuhai. For the Super Production Class, each race is 12 laps of {{Convert|4.3|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} while N2000 races are 10 laps only.

Points are awarded to the top 8 finishers in Super Production Class: 10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1.

Points are awarded to the top 15 finishers in N2000 Class: 40–35–32–30–28–26–25–24–23–22–21–20–19–18–17.

==Macau Grand Prix Qualification==
===2006===
Provisionally, top 10 drivers in the Super Production Class qualifie for the Macau Cup Race.

N2000 drivers were invited to take part in the Tourism Cup Race.

1600cc cars were no longer eligible.

===2005===
In 2005, the championship was run for 1600cc cars, N2000 cars and Super Production cars. After they qualify, 1600cc drivers had to use N2000 cars when they race in the Tourism Cup in Macau. Super Production class drivers entered the Macau Cup Race instead of the [[Guia Race]].

===2002===
The championship competition had two classes of cars: 1600cc Group A and Super Production. The Macau Grand Prix event qualifiers were the 1600cc drivers and the qualified Super Production drivers entered the Guia Race.

==Super Production Class Champions==
The first ever championship for Super Production cars was won by Henry Lee Junior in a [[Ford Focus]], sponsored by [[Ashland Inc.#Ashland Consumer Markets (Valvoline)|Valvoline]] and run by GR Asia.

Paul Poon became the second champion when he won in a China Dragon Racing run Honda Civic EP3 in 2003. The car was bought by Paul from Mardi Gras Motorsport in the United Kingdom.

Kenneth Look has won the championship for 3 years consecutively, in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

==N2000 Class==
*Fong Wai-Kee won the 2006 inaugural championship for N2000 cars for KK Racing.
*Tsang Tak-Fan won the 2005 overall championship for N2000 cars for Fusion Racing Team.

== Controversies==
Championship leader Paul Poon was hit by Kenneth Look's teammate, Ronny Shum, in the fifth race of the 2004 championship and retired from the race; Kenneth Look won. The HKAA's failure to penalize Ronny Shum resulted in China Dragon Racing pulling out of the next race en masse after the warm-up lap. Kenneth Look subsequently won the 2004 title without much real opposition.

In November, China Dragon Racing had to apologize to the HKAA for bringing the sport into disrepute before being allowed to enter the Guia Race in Macau.

Phillip Yau Wing-choi, a touring car driver, was killed in a crash during qualifying at the Macau Grand Prix, one day after motorcyclist Luis Filipe de Sousa Carreira died in an accident on the same track.

'''Hot  carrier  injection''' ('''HCI''') is a phenomenon in [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] electronic devices where an [[electron]] or a “[[Electron hole|hole]]” gains sufficient [[kinetic energy]] to overcome a [[potential barrier]] necessary to break an interface state. The term "hot" refers to the effective temperature used to model carrier density,  not to the overall temperature of the device. Since the charge carriers can become trapped in the gate dielectric of a [[MOSFET|MOS transistor]], the switching characteristics of the transistor can be permanently changed.  Hot-carrier injection is one of the mechanisms that adversely affects the [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability of semiconductors]] of solid-state devices.&lt;ref name=KK2011&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/transistor-aging/0 JOhn Keane, Chris H. Kim, '' Transistor Aging'', ''IEEE Spectrum'', May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics ==

The term “hot carrier injection” usually refers to the effect in [[Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor|MOSFET]]s, where a carrier is injected from the conducting channel in the [[silicon]] substrate to the [[gate dielectric]], which usually is made of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

To become “hot” and enter the [[conduction band]] of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an electron must gain a kinetic energy of ~3.2&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volt|eV]]. For holes, the [[valence band]] offset in this case dictates they must have a kinetic energy of 4.6&amp;nbsp;eV. The term "hot electron" comes from the effective temperature term used when modelling carrier density (i.e., with a Fermi-Dirac function) and does not refer to the bulk temperature of the semiconductor (which can be physically cold, although the warmer it is, the higher the population of hot electrons it will contain all else being equal).

The term “hot electron” was originally introduced to describe non-equilibrium electrons (or holes) in semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;Conwell, E. M., High Field Transport in Semiconductors, Solid State Physics Supplement 9 (Academic Press, New York, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  More broadly, the term describes electron distributions describable by the [[Fermi function]], but with an elevated effective temperature. This greater energy affects the mobility of charge carriers and as a consequence affects how they travel through a semiconductor device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hot-Electron Effect in Superconductors and Its Applications for Radiation Sensors|journal= LLE Review|volume=87|page=134|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/lle_review/documents/v87/87_04_HotElectron.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hot electron''s can tunnel out of the semiconductor material, instead of recombining with a [[electron hole|hole]] or being conducted through the material to a collector.  Consequent effects include increased leakage current and possible damage to the encasing dielectric material if the hot carrier disrupts the atomic structure of the dielectric.

Hot electrons can be created when a high-energy photon of electromagnetic radiation (such as light) strikes a semiconductor.  The energy from the photon can be transferred to an electron, exciting the electron out of the valence band, and forming an electron-hole pair.  If the electron receives enough energy to leave the valence band, and to surpass the conduction band, it becomes a hot electron.  Such electrons are characterized by high effective temperatures.  Because of the high effective temperatures, hot electrons are very mobile, and likely to leave the semiconductor and travel into other surrounding materials.

In some semiconductor devices, the energy dissipated by hot electron phonons represents an inefficiency as energy is lost as heat.  For instance, some solar cells rely on the photovoltaic properties of semiconductors to convert light to electricity.  In such cells, the hot electron effect is the reason that a portion of the light energy is lost to heat rather than converted to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tisdale|first1=W.

== Effects on transistors==

In [[MOSFET]]s, hot electrons have sufficient energy to tunnel through the thin oxide gate to show up as gate current, or as substrate leakage current.  The hot electrons may jump from the channel region or from the drain, for instance, and into the gate or the substrate.

For instance, in a MOSFET, when a gate is positive, and the switch is on, the device is designed with the intent that electrons will flow through the conductive channel to the drain.  These hot electrons do not contribute to the amount of current flowing through the channel as intended and instead are a leakage current.

Attempts to correct or compensate for the hot electron effect in a MOSFET may involve locating a diode in reverse bias at gate terminal or other manipulations of the device (such as lightly doped drains or double-doped drains).

When electrons are accelerated in the channel, they gain energy along the mean free path.
This energy is lost in two different ways:

#The carrier hits an atom in the substrate. Then the collision creates a cold carrier and an additional electron-hole pair. In the case of nMOS transistors, additional electrons are collected by the channel and additional holes are evacuated by the substrate.
#The carrier hits a Si-H bond and break the bond. An interface state is created and the hydrogen atom is released in the substrate.

The probability to hit either an atom or a Si-H bond is random, and the average energy involved in each process is the same in both case.

This is the reason why the substrate current is monitored during HCI stress.
A high substrate current means a large number of created electron-hole pairs and thus an efficient Si-H bond breakage mechanism.

When interface states are created, the threshold voltage is modified and the subthreshold slope is degraded. This leads to lower current, and degrades the operating frequency of integrated circuit.

== Scaling ==

Advances in semiconductor manufacturing techniques and ever increasing demand for faster and more complex [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) have driven the associated Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to scale to smaller dimensions.

However, it has not been possible to scale the supply voltage used to operate these ICs proportionately due to factors such as compatibility with previous generation circuits, [[noise margin]], power and delay requirements, and non-scaling of [[threshold voltage]], [[subthreshold slope]], and [[parasitic capacitance]].

As a result, internal electric fields increase in aggressively scaled MOSFETs, which comes with the additional benefit of increased carrier velocities (up to [[velocity saturation]]), and hence increased switching speed,&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Dorf (ed) ''The Electrical Engineering Handbook'', CRC Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8493-0185-8}} page 578&lt;/ref&gt;  but also presents a major [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] problem for the long term operation of these devices, as high fields induce hot carrier injection which affects device reliability.

Large electric fields in MOSFETs imply the presence of high-energy carriers, referred to as “'''hot carriers'''”. These hot carriers that have sufficiently high energies and momenta to allow them to be injected from the semiconductor into the surrounding dielectric films such as the gate and sidewall oxides as well as the buried oxide in the case of [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) [[SOI MOSFET|MOSFETs]].

== Reliability impact ==

The presence of such mobile carriers in the oxides triggers numerous physical damage processes that can drastically change the device characteristics over prolonged periods.  The accumulation of damage can eventually cause the circuit to fail as key parameters such as threshold voltage shift due to such damage.  The accumulation of damage resulting degradation in device behavior due to hot carrier injection is called “'''hot carrier degradation'''”.

The useful life-time of circuits and integrated circuits based on such a MOS device are thus affected by the life-time of the MOS device itself. To assure that integrated circuits manufactured with minimal geometry devices will not have their useful life impaired, the life-time of the component MOS devices must have their HCI degradation well understood.  Failure to accurately characterize HCI life-time effects can ultimately affect business costs such as warranty and support costs and impact marketing and sales promises for a foundry or IC manufacturer.

== Relationship to radiation effects ==

Hot carrier degradation is fundamentally the same as the [[radiation hardening#Fundamental mechanisms|ionization radiation effect]] known as the [[radiation hardening#Resultant effects|total dose]] damage to semiconductors, as experienced in space systems due to solar [[proton]], electron, [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] exposure.

== HCI and NOR flash memory cells ==

HCI is the basis of operation for a number of [[non-volatile memory]] technologies such as [[EPROM]] cells. As soon as the potential detrimental influence of HC injection on the circuit reliability was recognized, several fabrication strategies were devised to reduce it without compromising the circuit performance.

NOR [[flash memory]] exploits the principle of hot carriers injection by deliberately injecting carriers across the gate oxide to charge the [[floating gate]]. This charge alters the MOS transistor threshold voltage to represent a [[Boolean-valued function|logic '0' state]].  An uncharged floating gate represents a '1' state. Erasing the NOR Flash memory cell removes stored charge through the process of [[Fowler–Nordheim tunneling]].

Because of the damage to the oxide caused by normal NOR Flash operation, HCI damage is one of the factors that cause the number of write-erase cycles to be limited. Because the ability to hold charge and the formation of damage [[Carrier trap|trap]]s in the oxide affects the ability to have distinct '1' and '0' charge states, HCI damage results in the closing of the non-volatile memory logic margin window over time. The number of write-erase cycles at which '1' and '0' can no longer be distinguished defines the endurance of a non-volatile memory.

'''''Humanum genus''''' is a [[papal encyclical]] promulgated on 20 April 1884 by [[Pope Leo XIII]].

Released in the ascent of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], [[Marxism]], and the aftermath of the September 20, 1870, [[Capture of Rome]] by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] military forces from the [[Papal States]], ''Humanum genus'' is principally a condemnation of [[Freemasonry]].  It states that the late 19th century was a dangerous era for the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], largely due to numerous concepts and practices it attributes to Freemasonry, namely  [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[popular sovereignty]], and the [[separation of church and state]].

Some of the strictures found in ''Humanum genus'' still remain in force today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Historical circumstances==
Following the French withdrawal of its military garrison in Rome in the anticipation of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the 1870 [[Capture of Rome]] itself was a major battle within the long process of [[Italian unification]] known as the [[Risorgimento]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Timeline of Italian unification]].&lt;/ref&gt; marking the final military defeat of the [[Papal States]] under [[Pope Pius IX]] by the Kingdom of Italy.

This unification of the Italian peninsula by [[Victor Emmanuel II|King Victor Emmanuel II]] of the [[House of Savoy]] ended the approximate 1,116 year [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal reign]] (AD 754 to 1870) of the Papal States by the [[papacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=States of the Church|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm|accessdate=8 May 2016|last=Schnürer|first=G|date=1912|origyear=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Humanum genus'' asserted that the late 19th century was a time of particular danger for Roman Catholics as the "partisans of evil" were now far less secretive, as evidenced by the new openness of Freemasonry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Freemasonry had been condemned by previous popes as being contrary to Catholic doctrine, but according to ''Humanum genus'', the nature of Freemasonry was changing as Freemasons were far more open in society with their practices and affiliations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

''Humanum genus'' specifically condemned certain practices of the Freemasons, including: religious indifference;&lt;ref name="allcreeds"&gt;HG 16: "Again, as all who offer themselves are received whatever may be their form of religion, they thereby teach the great error of this age—that a regard for religion should be held as an indifferent matter, and that all religions are alike."&lt;/ref&gt; the promotion of [[public education]] that denied the Church's role and where "the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymen";&lt;ref name="laymen"&gt;HG 21: "With the greatest unanimity the sect of the Freemasons also endeavors to take to itself the education of youth. They think that they can easily mold to their opinions that soft and pliant age, and bend it whither they will; and that nothing can be more fitted than this to enable them to bring up the youth of the State after their own plan. Therefore, in the education and instruction of children they allow no share, either of teaching or of discipline, to the ministers of the Church; and in many places they have procured that the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymen, and that nothing which treats of the most important and most holy duties of men to God shall be introduced into the instructions on morals."&lt;/ref&gt; the approval of the notion that the people are the ''only'' source of sovereignty, and that those who rule have no authority but by the commission and concession of the people.{{Unverifiable|date=May 2016}}

The [[Holy See]] has forbidden [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] from becoming Freemasons since 1738 with the issuing of the [[Pope Clement XII]]'s [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[In eminenti apostolatus]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} This prohibition remains in effect today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Background==
Several popes before Leo XIII had addressed the problems that they associated with Freemasonry and said that the principles of that [[secret society]] were incompatible with the teachings of the Church. Previous papal pronouncements on Freemasonry include:

* [[Pope Clement XII]] – ''[[In eminenti apostolatus]]'', a papal bull in 1738
* [[Pope Benedict XIV]] – ''[[Providas Romanorum]]'', an Apostolic constitution in 1751
* [[Pope Pius VII]] – ''[[Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo]]'', an Apostolic constitution in 1821
* [[Pope Leo XII]] – ''[[Quo graviora (1826)]]'', an Apostolic constitution
* [[Pope Pius VIII]] – ''[[Traditi humilitati]]'', an encyclical in 1829
* [[Pope Gregory XVI]] – ''[[Mirari vos]]'', an encyclical in 1832
* [[Pope Pius IX]] – ''[[Qui pluribus]]'', an encyclical in 1846

Leo XIII's denunciation of Freemasonry in ''Humanum genus'' can be seen as a call for Roman Catholics to oppose it, especially in the context of his examination of [[socialism]] (''[[Quod apostolici muneris]]''), his defence of Christian [[marriage]] ([[Arcanum (Catholic encyclical)|''Arcanum'']]), and his ideas about the role of government (''Diuturnum''). Because of the secrecy in Freemasonry, it was believed by the Holy See to have enormous disciplinary control over its members, which Leo viewed as enslavement.&lt;ref name="w2.vatican.va"&gt;HG 1.&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, although individual Masons may be decent people, those same individuals would be led to commit evil acts through their participation in Freemasonry.

==Two kingdoms, two cities==
''Humanum genus'' leads with the presentation of the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] [[dichotomy]] of the two cities, the City of Man and the [[City of God (book)|City of God]]. The human race is presented as "separated into two diverse and opposite parts, of which the one steadfastly contends for truth and virtue, the other of those things which are contrary to virtue and to truth. The one is the kingdom of God on earth, namely, the true Church of Jesus Christ... The other is the kingdom of Satan,"&lt;ref name="w2.vatican.va"/&gt; which was "led on or assisted" by Freemasonry:&lt;blockquote&gt;At every period of time each has been in conflict with the other, with a variety and multiplicity of weapons and of warfare, although not always with equal ardour and assault. At this period, however, the partisans of evil seems to be combining together, and to be struggling with united vehemence, led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the Freemasons. No longer making any secret of their purposes, they are now boldly rising up against God Himself. They are planning the destruction of holy Church publicly and openly, and this with the set purpose of utterly despoiling the nations of Christendom, if it were possible, of the blessings obtained for us through Jesus Christ our Saviour. Lamenting these evils, We are constrained by the charity which urges Our heart to cry out often to God: "For lo, Thy enemies have made a noise; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. They have taken a malicious counsel against Thy people, and they have consulted against Thy saints. They have said, 'come, and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation.'&lt;ref&gt;HG 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Humanum genus'' depicted the fundamental doctrine of Freemasonry as naturalism, asserting that this leads to [[deism]] and [[Gnosticism]]. This was seen as driving Freemasons headlong toward a fundamental clash with the teachings of the Church, especially in light of Freemasons' support of separation of church and state by their efforts to enact and enforce civil constitutional obstacles to the establishment of [[state church]]es.

==Freemasonry condemned==
[[File:sealglitalia.jpg|thumb|Seal of the [[Grand Lodge of Italy]].|alt=Seal of the Grand Lodge of Italy of the A.F.&amp; A.M.|150x150px]]
''Humanum genus'' criticizes a number of other Masonic principles; for example, the idea that [[popular sovereignty]] is the source of ''all'' rights and that man should bend to no authority other than himself:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then come their doctrines of politics, in which the naturalists lay down that all men have the same right, and are in every respect of equal and like condition; that each one is naturally free; that no one has the right to command another; that it is an act of violence to require men to obey any authority other than that which is obtained from themselves.&lt;ref name="para22"&gt;HG 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Section 2335 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] (1917) declares that "Those who join a Masonic sect or other societies of the same sort, which plot against the Church or against legitimate civil authority, incur ''[[ipso facto]]'' an [[excommunication]] simply reserved to the Holy See."&lt;ref name="cnsnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/pope-francis-masonic-lobbies-most-serious-problem-me|title=Pope Francis: 'Masonic Lobbies … This Is The Most Serious Problem for Me'|last=Chapman|first=Michael W|date=2 August 2015|website=CNS News|publisher=Media Research Center|access-date=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|Recommendation=To improve citation, find this in the actual CIC, not just a quotation in a news article.  Then cite from there.|date=May 2016}}
The Code of Canon Law was updated in 1983, amending the prior Section 2335 with the new Section 1374.  The revision omits any direct reference to Freemasonry: "A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an [[interdict]]."&lt;ref name="cnsnews.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Benedykt XVI (2010-10-17) 4.jpg|thumb|Benedict XVI. (October 17, 2010.)|215x215px]]
[[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], the [[Prefect]] of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] under [[John Paul II|Pope John Paul II]] and himself elected as Pope Benedict XVI on 19 April 2005, issued the 26 November 1983 ''Declaration on Masonic Associations'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19831126_declaration-masonic_en.html|title=Declaration on Masonic Associations|last=Ratzinger (Benedict XVI)|first=Joseph|date=26 November 1983|website=The Holy See|publisher=Office of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|access-date=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in part states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enroll in Masonic associations are in a state of [[grave sin]] and may not receive [[Holy Communion]]...In an audience granted to the undersigned Cardinal Prefect, the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II approved and ordered the publication of this Declaration which had been decided in an ordinary meeting of this Sacred Congregation."&lt;ref name="cnsnews.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Finally, ''Humanum genus'' condemns what it presents as the Masonic idea of the separation of religion and state:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is held also that the State should be without God; that in the various forms of religion there is no reason why one should have precedence of another; and that they are all to occupy the same place.&lt;ref name="para22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a 28 July 2013 interview with reporters on a return flight to [[Rome]], [[Pope Francis]] identified political lobbying at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], and specifically addresses the influence of "Masonic lobbying", as being a component of the "most serious problem" confronting his papacy.&lt;ref name="cnsnews.com"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Susan muses to the audience about childhood dreams ("[[I Dreamed a Dream]]").  The adult Susan, as narrator, explains that she is a shy, sometimes awkward person who doesn't know what to say to others.  But she means to tell her "fairy tale" story.  It starts with the birth of a baby girl, in Scotland on 1 April 1961, an [[April Fool's Day]] baby.  A doctor tells her parents, Bridie and Patrick Boyle, that the baby may suffer from brain damage due to deprivation of oxygen, telling them not to expect too much from her.  Bridie and Pat are worried yet hopeful ("Joy is in the Child").

Couples celebrate Susan's first communion ("[[Welcome to My World (Jim Reeves song)|Welcome to My World]]").  Guests sing ("[[Paper Roses]]" and "[[The Wild Rover]]"), but everyone is looking forward to Patrick Boyle singing his signature song, "[[Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)|Scarlet Ribbons]]", which he dedicates to Susan.  He is able to "stop a room" with his singing, and Susan hopes someday to do the same.  Susan's singing talent is discovered at school by the music teacher.  But she suffers bullying and a beating by classmates ("The Four Marys").  Her friend John drives away the bullies.  Years later, parents in tow, Susan meets John again at a parish dance, where he invites an incredulous Susan, who has never had a boyfriend, to dance with him ("[[Beautiful Sunday (song)|Beautiful Sunday]]", "[[Knock Three Times]]", "[[Paloma Blanca|Una Paloma Blanca]]").  Their comic, awkward efforts eventually turn dreamily romantic ("[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]").

Susan goes to The Happy Valley pub's karaoke night, presided over by an Elvis-imitating [[Master of Ceremonies|compere]] who fancies himself the best singer around ("Something Tells Me"). Several regulars attempt to impress ("[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]" and "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]"), and Susan's old school friend Lorraine persuades her to try.  Susan tentatively sings "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|Someone To Watch Over Me]]".  When she spots John, her confidence increases, and Susan "stops the room". The jealous compere foreshadows subsequent criticisms, saying that while Susan can sing, the only reason the pub crowd reacted as they did was because they weren't expecting it, and felt they owed her an apology for thinking she was a daftie.

Their romance budding, Susan and John talk on the phone playfully, but it ends suddenly when Susan's father slams down the phone set and tells her that she isn't ready for a boyfriend.  Susan is depressed and lost ("[[At Seventeen]]"), not knowing how to go on with her life; the only role she knows for a Blackburn girl, marriage and having kids, is taken away from her.  She decides that since singing is the only thing she's good at, she should take lessons, and goes to see voice teacher Fred O'Neil.  He signs her up for the Miner's Welfare competition, and Susan wins the £1000 prize ("[[Daydream Believer]]").

Patrick Boyle becomes ill and dies.  Grieving, Bridie and Susan express their farewells to Patrick (Medley: "[[How Great Thou Art (hymn)|How Great Thou Art]]", "[[The Prayer (Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]]" and "Scarlet Ribbons").  Susan's sister Kathleen dies unexpectedly from an asthma attack. Susan now must take care of her elderly mother.  Bridie urges Susan to get on with her life, to make something of her singing.  She is hopeful for Susan and inspires Susan to be hopeful too ("This Will Be the Year"). Then Bridie dies.  Susan is despondent, alone for the first time in her life ("Return").

===Act II===
Susan reminds the audience that this is a fairy tale.  Susan sees an ad for a national talent contest. At ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' auditions, Susan is almost turned away as she signs in. She meets her fellow audition hopefuls, a collection of clowns, blue-wigged tap dancers and musicians of several sorts ("[[Stuck in the Middle with You]]"). Susan waits as they succeed or fail, and then it is her turn.  Onstage, mic in hand, Susan answers the sceptical judges' questions. She sings "I Dreamed a Dream" and is astonished but ecstatic to hear the huge crowd's standing ovation.

Susan goes home to twelve weeks of waiting, not allowed to tell anyone about her success.  As the broadcast time approaches, Susan tries unsuccessfully to get the priest, the crossing guard, and a neighbour to be sure to watch the show Saturday night without telling them why. Lorraine watches the broadcast of Susan's audition with her, and both are caught off-guard by her sudden popularity as her YouTube video goes viral, spreading Susan's fame worldwide. The media hounds Susan and goads her into outbursts of profanity to write about in their papers, with headlines like "Hairy Angel, Never Been Kissed" ("[[Mad World]]").  Then come the broadcasts of the semi-final and final, where after seventeen agonising seconds an exhausted Susan hears that she finished as runner-up to the [[Diversity (dance troupe)|Diversity]] dance troupe.  Susan feels desolate, convinced that losing means any chance for a singing career is gone ("[[The End of the World (Skeeter Davis song)|End of the World]]").

While she is hospitalised, Andy Stephens speaks to her about starting her career as a singer, but she won't listen to him ("[[Don't Dream It's Over]]"). Her mother appears to scold her for giving in to depression and not keeping her promise to make something of herself.  Lorraine and Andy call on Susan at home, but Susan doesn't remember meeting Andy. He offers to be her manager, taking care of everything she needs. Susan is afraid of singing in front of people, but Andy tells her that she won't have to, because she'll be in the studio making an album.  Susan is happier than she's ever been as she sets to work to record her album ("[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]").

The album becomes the fastest-selling debut album in British history and races to number one on both sides of the Atlantic.  Susan goes to New York to promote it, to appear in Rockefeller Plaza before an audience of a thousand people. She is terrified, screaming and crying, telling Andy that she cannot sing in front of all those people. When Andy replies that if this is what live performing does to her, then it's not worth it, Susan realises that she has a choice.  She wants to sing and doesn't want to go back to her old life; her mother would be in a rage if she didn't go on. Susan conquers her fear and goes on ("[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]").  Her journey is not over.

== Critical reception ==
The musical received generally positive reviews following its opening in Newcastle.  Dominic Cavendish in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote in his 5-star review: "The overall shape of the show is hard to fault, and in matching the gutsy good humour of its heroine without stooping to hagiography, this is a delight that deserves to go far, and fast, as she has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Cavendish | first=Dominic | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9170944/Susan-Boyle-Musical-I-Dreamed-a-Dream-Theatre-Royal-Newcastle-review.html | title=Susan Boyle Musical: ''I Dreamed a Dream'', Theatre Royal, Newcastle, review | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=28 March 2012 | accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dixon's 5-star review in WhatsOnStage.com concluded: "The scene where Susan’s father ... dies is one of the most emotional I have seen on stage, while those backstage at the auditions for BGT are nothing short of inspirational.

[[Neil Norman]], in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', also gave a 5-star review, writing: "The script is terrific, with proper acknowledgement of the envy Boyle's success sparked in others, the toll it took on her health both mental and physical and her initial treatment by the savage apostates of the press. Smith is astonishingly good as Boyle, not impersonating her so much as capturing her essence, and she is supported by an amazingly versatile cast, among whom James Paterson stands out as Boyle's father.

In the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Patrick Marmion awarded 3 stars, writing that the show is "more than just a get-rich-quick scheme. ... It's also a jolly good knees-up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4534">In late March [[2004 in sports|2004]], at the Australian Championships in Sydney, [[Ian Thorpe]] lined up in the heats of the 400&amp;nbsp;m freestyle, but overbalanced whilst on the blocks and fell into the water, resulting in his disqualification.&lt;ref name="abc career"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200611/s1793724.htm?swimming | title = Ian Thorpe – Career at a glance| publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 2006-11-21| accessdate = 2006-11-22 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080920060154/http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200611/s1793724.htm?swimming | archivedate = 2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
An attempted appeal, asserting that a noise had caused him to make the mistake, was dismissed, ending his chance to defend the 400&amp;nbsp;m Olympic title. This prompted widespread debate, with former swimmer [[Shane Gould]] asserting that the selection policy should be relaxed to maximise Australia's chances by selecting Thorpe, while Talbot, head coach [[Leigh Nugent]] and [[Kieren Perkins]] defended the selection policy. Public debate was also widespread, with [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] describing the situation as a "tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Jacquelin|last = Magnay|title = I'm over it already, says a gracious Thorpe |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/17/1037490052340.html | publisher = ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' |date = 2004-03-24 |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Mark|last = Bannerman|title = Thorpe's tumble divides nation |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1076520.htm |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date = 2004-03-29 |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe won the 100&amp;nbsp;m and 200&amp;nbsp;m freestyle events in times of 48.83s and 1&amp;nbsp;min 45.07s respectively to ensure his selection for Athens. [[Craig Stevens (swimmer)|Craig Stevens]], who had claimed the second qualifying position in the 400&amp;nbsp;m event, subsequently faced immense public pressure to relinquish his position to Thorpe, with ''[[The Australian]]''{{'}}s front-page headline reading "Only one man can come to the rescue". Although Thorpe said that Stevens should not be pressured into stepping aside, he was also criticised by columnists who felt that he was implicitly pressuring Stevens, for not unequivocally ruling himself out. Stevens later relinquished the position, in an interview with the [[Seven Network]], who paid him A$130,000 for the rights to broadcast his announcement.&lt;ref name="abc career"/&gt; This generated ethical debate as to whether Stevens had made a decision in the national interest or sold Thorpe a gold medal, with ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s headline reading "It's your race, Ian, at $325 a metre".&lt;ref name="ABC profile"&gt;{{cite news | title=Ian Thorpe: On course to sink Athens opposition | date= 2004 |accessdate = 2006-11-14 | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | url=http://abc.net.au/olympics/2004/profiles/ianthorpe.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Mark|last = Bannerman|title = Stevens announcement raises financial questions for world sport |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1095187.htm |format = The 7.30 report, transcript |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date = 2004-04-29 |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Michael|last = Cowley|title = It's your race, Ian, at $325 a metre |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/26/1082831502124.html |publisher = ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' |date = 2004-04-27 |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe accepted the position and was further attacked by Perkins, who described the affair as "grubby" and "a very, very sad tale for Australian sport", saying the pressure put upon Stevens was "disgusting".&lt;ref&gt;Hunter (2004), pp. 354–359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Ross|last = Solly|title = O'Neill, Perkins urge Stevens to stand firm |url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1076565.htm | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date = 2004-03-29 |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Lunar Observatory''' ('''ILO-1''') is a private, scientific and commercial lunar mission to place a small observatory on the South Pole of the Moon to conduct astrophysical studies using an optical telescope.&lt;ref name="Canadyensis Aero"&gt;[http://www.canadensys.com/programs/ilo-1/ Accessible Lunar Exploration: Science &amp; Communications from the Moon].

The '''Japanese economic miracle''' was [[Japan]]'s record period of [[economic growth]] between the post-[[World War II]] era to the end of the [[Cold War]]. During the economic boom, Japan rapidly became the world's [[Economic history of Japan|second largest economy]] (after the [[United States]]). By the 1990s, Japan's [[Aging of Japan|demographics began stagnating]] and the workforce was [[Lost Decade (Japan)|no longer expanding]] as it did in previous decades, despite per-worker productivity remaining high.

== Background ==
This economic miracle was the result of [[Post-war Japan|post-World War II Japan]] and [[West Germany]] benefiting from the [[Cold War]].{{dubious|date=October 2015}} It occurred chiefly due to the economic interventionism of the Japanese government and partly due to the aid and assistance of the U.S. [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nakamura |first=Takafusa |others=trans. Jacqueline Kaninski |title=The Postwar Japanese Economy: Its Development and Structure |year=1981 |type=book |publisher=University of Tokyo Press |location=Tokyo |chapter=3: Rapid Growth |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the U.S. established a significant presence in Japan to slow the expansion of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in the Pacific. The U.S. was also concerned with the growth of the economy of Japan because there was a risk after World War II that an unhappy and poor Japanese population would turn to communism and by doing so ensure that the Soviet Union would control the Pacific.

The distinguishing characteristics of the Japanese economy during the "''economic miracle''" years included: the cooperation of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks in closely knit groups called ''[[keiretsu]]''; the powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shuntō]]''; good relations with government bureaucrats, and the guarantee of lifetime employment (''[[shūshin koyō]]'') in big corporations and highly unionized blue-collar factories.

== Governmental contributions ==
The Japanese financial recovery continued even after [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] departed and the economic boom propelled by the [[Korean War]] abated. The Japanese economy survived from the deep recession caused by a loss of the U.S. payments for military procurement and continued to make gains. By the late 1960s, Japan had risen from the ashes of World War II to achieve an astoundingly rapid and complete economic recovery. According to Mikiso Hane, the period leading up to the late 1960s saw "the greatest years of prosperity Japan had seen since the [[Amaterasu|Sun Goddess]] shut herself up behind a stone door to protest her brother [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susano-o]]'s misbehavior." The Japanese government contributed to the post-war Japanese economic miracle by stimulating private sector growth, first by instituting regulations and protectionism that effectively managed economic crises and later by concentrating on trade expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hane, Mikiso. Eastern Phoenix: Japan Since 1945. Boulder: Westview Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Brief introduction to the Japanese Economic Miracle ===
Japanese economic miracle refers to the significant increase in the Japanese economy during the time between the end of World War II and the end of the Cold War (1945-1993). The economical miracle can be divided into four stages: the recovery (1946-1954), the high increase (1955-1972), the steady increase (1972-1992), and the low increase (1992-2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fw.xinhua08.com/gjgc/201104/t20110414_461294.html|title=日德战后经济奇迹（Japanese and Germany Postwar Economic Miracle）|last=Liu|first=Haoyuan|date=|website=Finance World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though heavily destroyed by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombardment]] in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and other Allied [[air raids on Japan]], Japan was able to recover from the trauma of WWII, and managed to become the second largest economic entity of the world (after the United States) by the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.classora.com/reports/t24369/general/ranking-of-the-worlds-richest-countries-by-gdp?edition=1967&amp;fields=|title=Ranking of the World's Richest Countries by GDP (1967) - Classora Knowledge Base|website=en.classora.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Soviet Union excluded). However, after three decades, Japan had experienced the so-called "recession in growth", as the United States had been imposing economic protection policy in oppressing Japanese production and forcing the appreciation of the Japanese yen. In preventing further oppression, Japan greatly improved its technological advances and raised the value of the yen, since to devalue, the yen would have brought further risk and a possible depressing effect on trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United States' role in the postwar economic recovery of Japan|last=Nanto|first=Dick Kazuyuki|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appreciation of the yen led to significant economic recession in the 1980s. To alleviate the influence of recession, Japan imposed a series of economical and financial policy to stimulate the domestic demand. Nevertheless, [[Japanese asset price bubble|the bubble economy]] that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the subsequent deflationary policy destroyed the Japanese economy. After the deflationary policy, the Japanese economy has been through a time of low increase period which has lasted until today. For more detailed information regarding this period, see [[Economic history of Japan]] and [[Lost Decade (Japan)]].

=== The Recovery Stage (1946-1954) ===
Japan was seriously harmed in WWII. For instance, during the wartime, "the Japanese cotton industry was brought to its knees by the end of the Second World War. Two-thirds of its prewar cotton spindles were scrapped by wartime administrators, and bombing and destruction of urban areas had caused a further loss of 20 percent of spinning and 14 percent of weaving capacity".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, work and the Japanese economic miracle : the case of the cotton textile industry, 1945-1975|last=Macnaughtan|first=Helen|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2005|isbn=0415328055|location=New York|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the ability of recovery astonished the world, earning the title of "Japanese Economic Miracle". By and large, every country has experienced some degree of industrial growth in the postwar period, those countries that achieved a heavy drop in industrial output due to war damage such as Japan, West Germany and Italy, have achieved a most rapid recovery. In the case of Japan, industrial production had fallen in 1946 to 27.6% of the pre-war level, but regained this pre-war level in 1951 and reached 350% in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialization of Japan|last=Ichiro|first=Nakayama|publisher=|year=1964|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reason for Japan to recover from war trauma swiftly was the successful economic reform by the government. The government body principally concerned with industrial policy in Japan is the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The industrial policy of Japan|last=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|first=|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major economic reforms was to adopt the "Inclined Production Mode" (けいしゃせいさんほうしき). The "Inclined Production Mode" refers to the inclined production that primarily focus on the production of raw material including steel, coal and cotton. Textile production occupied more than 23.9% of the total industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrial dualism in Japan : a problem of economic growth and structural change|last=Seymour|first=Broadbridge|publisher=Alpine Publication Corporation|year=1966|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, to stimulate the production, Japanese government supported the new recruitment of labour, especially female labour. By enhancing the recruitment of female labour, Japan managed to recover from the destruction. The legislation on recruitment contains three components: the restriction placed on regional recruitment and relocation of workers, the banning of the direct recruitment of new school leavers, and the direct recruitment of non-school leavers under explicitly detailed regulations issued by the Ministry of Labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second reason that accounts for Japan's rapid recovery from WWII was the outbreak of [[Korean War]], as Japan was favored by the Special Procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/e67b837df46527d3240ce0a5.html###|title=朝鲜战争影响下的日本经济（Japanese Economy Under the Influence of Korean War）|last=|first=|date=|website=百度文库|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean War was fought on the Korean Peninsula, and the United States eventually participated in the war, providing an opportunity for the Japanese economy. The Korean Peninsula is distant from US territory, so the logistics soon became a significant problem. As one of the major supporters of the United States in Asia, Japan stood out, providing ample support to logistical operations, and also benefitting from the production of firearms. The order of mass firearms and other material by the United States greatly stimulated the Japanese economy, enabling Japan to recover from the wartime destruction and providing Japan the basis for the upcoming high increasing stage.

=== The High Increasing Stage (1954-1972) ===
After gaining support from the United States and achieving domestic economic reform, Japan was able to soar from the 1950s to the 1970s. Furthermore, Japan also completed its process toward industrialization, and became one of the first developed countries in East Asia. The Japanese Economic Yearbooks from 1967 to 1971 witnessed the significant increase. In 1967, the year book said: the Japanese economy in 1966 thus made an advance more rapidly than previously expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan Economic Year Book|last=The Oriental Economist|first=|publisher=|year=1967|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the year book said that the Japanese economy continued to make a sound growth after it had a bottom in the autumn of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Economic Year Book|last=The Oriental Economist|first=|publisher=|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "increase", "growth" and "upswing" filled with summaries of the year books from 1967 to 1971. The reasons for Japan to complete industrialization are also complicated, and the major characteristic of this time is the influence of governmental policies of the [[Hayato Ikeda]] administration, vast consumption, and vast export.

==== Influence of Governmental Policies: Ikeda administration and ''keiretsu'' ====
In 1954, the economic system MITI had cultivated from 1949 to 1953 came into full effect. Prime Minister [[Hayato Ikeda]], who Johnson calls "the single most important individual architect of the Japanese economic miracle," pursued a policy of [[Heavy industry|heavy industrialization]]. This policy led to the emergence of 'over-loaning' (a practice that continues today) in which the [[Bank of Japan]] issues loans to city banks who in turn issue loans to industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Since there was a shortage of capital in Japan at the time, industrial conglomerates borrowed beyond their capacity to repay, often beyond their net worth, causing city banks in turn to overborrow from the Bank of Japan. This gave the national Bank of Japan complete control over dependent local banks.

The system of over-loaning, combined with the government's relaxation of anti-[[monopoly]] laws (a remnant of SCAP control) also led to the reemergence of conglomerate groups called ''[[keiretsu]]'' that mirrored the wartime conglomerates, or ''[[zaibatsu]]''. Led by the economic improvements of [[Sony]] businessmen [[Masaru Ibuka]] and [[Akio Morita]], the ''keiretsu'' efficiently allocated resources and became competitive internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=vladimir|title=the world transformed 1945 to the present|date=March 5, 2017|publisher=Michael H.hunt|pages=211|edition=second }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of the ''keiretsu'' conglomerates' success lay city banks, which lent generously, formalizing cross-share holdings in diverse industries. The ''keiretsu'' spurred both [[Horizontal integration|horizontal]] and [[vertical integration]], locking out foreign companies from Japanese industries. ''Keiretsu'' had close relations with MITI and each other through the cross-placement of shares, providing protection from foreign take-overs. For example, 83% of Japan's Development Bank's finances went toward strategic industries: [[shipbuilding]], [[electric power]], [[coal]] and [[steel]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Chalmers|last = Johnson|title =MITI and the Japanese Miracle: The Growth of Industrial Policy, 1925-1975|page= 211|date = 1982|publisher = Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804712064}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Keiretsu'' proved crucial to protectionist measures that shielded Japan's sapling economy.

''Keiretsu'' also fostered an attitude shift among Japanese managers that tolerated low [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] in the [[short-run]] because ''keiretsu'' were less concerned with increasing [[Dividend|stock dividends]] and profits and more concerned about [[Debt|interest payments]]. Approximately only two-thirds of the shares of a given company were traded, cushioning ''keiretsu'' against market fluctuations and allowing ''keiretsu'' managers to plan for the [[long-term]] and maximize market shares instead of focusing on short-term profits.

The Ikeda Administration also instituted the Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy, a system of import controls designed to prevent the flooding of Japan's markets by foreign goods. MITI used the foreign exchange allocation to stimulate the economy by promoting exports, managing investment and monitoring production capacity. In 1953, MITIs revised the Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy to promote domestic industries and increase the incentive for exports by revising the export-link system. A later revision based production capacity on foreign exchange allocation to prevent foreign [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]].

==== Vast Consumption: From survival to recreation ====
During the time of reconstruction and before the [[1973 oil crisis]], Japan managed to complete its industrialization process, gaining significant improvement in living standards and witnessing a significant increase in consumption. The average monthly consumption of urban family households doubled from 1955 to 1970.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political Economy of Japan|last=Yamamura|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0804713804|location=Stanford|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the proportions of consumption in Japan was also changing. The consumption in daily necessities, such as food and clothing and footwear, was decreasing. Contrastingly, the consumption in recreational, entertainment activities and goods increased, including furniture, transportation, communications, and reading.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The great increase in consumption stimulated the growth in GDP as it incentivized production.

===== Vast Export: "Golden Sixties" and shift to export trade =====
The period of rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1961 paved the way for the "Golden Sixties," the second decade that is generally associated with the Japanese economic miracle. In 1965, Japan's nominal GDP was estimated at just over $91 billion. Fifteen years later, in 1980, the nominal GDP had soared to a record $1.065 trillion.

Under the leadership of [[Hayato Ikeda|Prime Minister Ikeda]], former minister of MITI, the Japanese government undertook an ambitious "income-doubling plan" (所得倍増). Ikeda lowered interest rates and taxes to private players to motivate spending. In addition, due to the financial flexibility afforded by the FILP, Ikeda's government rapidly expanded government investment in Japan's [[infrastructure]]: building [[highway]]s, high-speed [[Rail transport|railways]], [[Rapid transit|subways]], [[airport]]s, [[port]] facilities, and [[dam]]s. Ikeda's government also expanded government investment in the previously neglected communications sector of the Japanese economy. Each of these acts continued the Japanese trend towards a managed economy that epitomized the [[Mixed economy|mixed economic model]].

Besides Ikeda's adherence to government intervention and regulation of the economy, his government pushed [[Free trade|trade liberalization]]. By April 1960, trade imports had been 41 percent liberalized (compared to 22 percent in 1956). Ikeda planned to liberalize trade to 80 percent within three years. His plans however met severe opposition from both industries who had thrived on over-loaning and the nationalist public who feared foreign enterprise takeovers. The Japanese press likened liberalization to "the second coming of the [[black ships]]," "the defenselessness of the Japanese islands in the face of attack from huge foreign capitalist powers," and "the readying of the Japanese economy for a bloodstained battle between national capital and foreign capital." Ikeda's income-doubling plan was largely a response to this growing opposition and widespread panic over liberalization, adopted to quell public protests. Ikeda's motivations were purely pragmatic and foreign policy based, however. He moved toward liberalization of trade only after securing a protected market through internal regulations that favored Japanese products and firms.

Ikeda also set up numerous allied foreign aid distribution agencies to demonstrate Japan's willingness to participate in the international order and to promote exports. The creation of these agencies not only acted as a small concession to international organizations, but also dissipated some public fears about liberalization of trade. Ikeda furthered Japan's global economic integration by joining the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] in 1955, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] in 1964. By the time Ikeda left office, the [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]] was growing at a phenomenal rate of 13.9 percent.

In 1962, Kaname Akamatsu published his famous article introducing the [[Flying Geese Paradigm]]. It postulated that Asian nations will catch up with the West as a part of a regional hierarchy where the production of commoditized goods would continuously move from the more advanced countries to the less advanced ones. The paradigm was named this way due to Akamatsu's envisioning this pattern as geese flying in unison with Japan being an obvious leader.

=== The Steady Increasing Stage (1973-1992) ===
In 1973, the first oil-price shock struck Japan ([[1973 oil crisis]]). The price of oil increased from 3 dollars per barrel to over 13 dollars per barrel. During this time, Japan's industrial production was decreased by 20%, as the supply capacity could not respond effectively to the rapid expansion of demand, and increased investments in equipment often invited unwanted results—tighter supply and higher prices of commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Papers on Japanese Economy, 1973|last=Business Intercommunications Inc.|first=|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Second Oil Shock]] in 1978 and 1979 exacerbated the situation as the [[1979 energy crisis|oil price again increased]] from 13 dollars per barrel to 39.5 dollars per barrel. Despite being seriously impacted by the two oil crises, Japan was able to withstand the impact and managed to transfer from a product-concentrating to a technology-concentrating production form.

The transformation was in fact, a product of the oil crises and United States intervention. Since the oil price rose tenfold, the cost of production also soared. After the oil crises, to save costs, Japan had to produce products more environmentally-friendly, and with less oil consumption. The biggest factor that invited industrial changes after the oil crises was the increase in energy prices including crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Paper on Japanese Economy, 1978|last=Business Intercommunications Inc|first=|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Japan converted to a technology-concentrating program, ensuring the steady increase of its economy, and standing out beyond other capitalist countries that had been significantly wounded during the oil crises. Another factor was United States frictions with Japan, as Japan's rapid economic growth could potentially harm the economic interests of the United States. In 1985, the United States signed the "[[Plaza Accord]]" with Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. The "Plaza Accord" was an attempt to devalue the US dollar, yet harmed Japan the most. Japan attempted to expand international markets through the appreciation of the Japanese yen, yet they over-appreciated, creating a [[bubble economy]]. The Plaza Accord was successful in reducing the U.S. [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] with [[Western Europe]]an nations but largely failed to fulfill its primary objective of alleviating the trade deficit with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-30|title=Plaza Accord|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plaza_Accord&amp;oldid=757316980|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ==
The [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI) was instrumental in Japan's post-war economic recovery. According to some scholars, no other governmental regulation or organization had more economic impact than MITI. "The particular speed, form, and consequences of Japanese economic growth," [[Chalmers Johnson]] writes, "are not intelligible without reference to the contributions of MITI" (Johnson, vii). Established in 1949, MITI's role began with the "Policy Concerning Industrial Rationalization" (1950) that coordinated efforts by industries to counteract the effects of SCAP's deflationary regulations. In this way, MITI formalized cooperation between the Japanese government and private industry. The extent of the policy was such that if MITI wished to "double steel production, the neo-''[[zaibatsu]]'' already has the capital, the construction assets, the makers of production machinery, and most of the other necessary factors already available in-house". The Ministry coordinated various industries, including the emerging ''keiretsu'', toward a specific end, usually toward the intersection of national production goals and private economic interests.

MITI also boosted the industrial security by untying the imports of [[technology]] from the imports of other goods. MITI's Foreign Capital Law granted the ministry power to negotiate the price and conditions of technology imports. This element of technological control allowed it to promote industries it deemed promising. The low cost of imported technology allowed for rapid industrial growth. Productivity was greatly improved through new equipment, management, and standardization.

MITI gained the ability to regulate ''all'' imports with the abolition of the Economic Stabilization Board and the Foreign Exchange Control Board in August 1952. Although the Economic Stabilization Board was already dominated by MITI, the [[Shigeru Yoshida|Yoshida Governments]] transformed it into the Economic Deliberation Agency, a mere "[[think tank]]," in effect giving MITI full control over all Japanese imports. Power over the foreign exchange budget was also given directly to MITI.

MITI's establishment of the [[Japan Development Bank]] also provided the private sector with low-cost capital for long-term growth. The Japan Development Bank introduced access to the Fiscal Investment and Loan Plan, a massive pooling of individual and national savings. At the time FILP controlled four times the savings of the world's largest commercial bank. With this financial power, FILP was able to maintain an abnormally high number of Japanese construction firms (more than twice the number of construction firms of any other nation with a similar GDP).

== Conclusion ==
Coincidentally, the conclusion of the economic miracle coincided with the conclusion of the [[Cold War]]. While the Japanese stock market hit its all-time peak at the end of 1989, making a recovery later in 1990, it dropped precipitously in 1991. The year of the conclusion of the Japanese asset price bubble coincided with the [[Gulf War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

'''Ioannis Agorastos''' "'''John'''" '''Plagis''',{{refn|{{lang-el|Ιωάννης Αγοραστός "Γιάννης" Πλαγής}}.|group=n|name=greek}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]] (1919–1974) was a [[Southern Rhodesia]]n [[flying ace]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) during the Second World War, noted especially for his part in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|defence of Malta]] during 1942. The son of [[Greeks in Zimbabwe|Greek immigrants]], he was accepted by recruiters only after Greece joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in late 1940. Following spells with [[No. 65 Squadron RAF|No. 65 Squadron]] and [[No. 266 Squadron RAF|No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron]], he joined [[No. 249 Squadron RAF|No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron]] in Malta in March 1942. Flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] Mk Vs, Plagis was part of the multinational group of Allied pilots that successfully defended the strategically important island against numerically superior [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces over the next few months. Flying with [[No. 185 Squadron RAF|No. 185 Squadron]] from early June, he was withdrawn to England in early July 1942.

After a spell as an instructor in the UK, Plagis returned to action in September 1943 as commander of [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No. 64 Squadron]], flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France. He took command of [[No. 126 Squadron RAF|No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron]] in June 1944, and led many attacks on German positions during the [[invasion of Normandy|invasion of France]] and the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|campaign]] that followed; he was shot down over [[Arnhem]] during [[Operation Market Garden|Operation ''Market Garden'']], but only lightly wounded. After converting to [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang IIIs]], he commanded a [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] based at [[RAF Bentwaters]] that supported bombing missions. He finished the war with the rank of [[squadron leader]] and remained with the RAF afterwards, operating [[Gloster Meteor]]s at the head of No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron.

Plagis was the top-scoring Southern Rhodesian ace of the war, and the highest-scoring ace of Greek origin, with 16 confirmed aerial victories, including 11 over Malta. Awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and other medals, he was also one of Rhodesia's most decorated veterans. The Southern Rhodesian capital, [[Harare|Salisbury]], honoured his wartime contributions by naming a street in its northern [[Alexandra Park, Harare|Alexandra Park]] neighbourhood after him. On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in 1948, he set up home at 1&amp;nbsp;John Plagis Avenue, opened a [[liquor store|bottle store]] bearing his name, and was a director of several companies, including [[Central African Airways]] in the 1960s. He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1962|general election]], running for the [[Rhodesian Front]], but failed to win. He died in 1974, reportedly by suicide.

==Early life==
John Plagis was born on 10 March 1919 in [[Gadzema]],{{sfn|Government of Southern Rhodesia|1945|pp=38–42}}{{sfn|Who's Who of Southern Africa|1973|p=1230}} a mining village near [[Chegutu|Hartley]], about {{convert|110|km}} south-west of the [[Southern Rhodesia]]n capital [[Harare|Salisbury]]. His parents, Agorastos and Helen Plagis, were [[Greeks in Zimbabwe|Greek immigrants]] from the island of [[Lemnos]];{{sfn|Charousis|2010|p=115}} he had five siblings.{{sfn|St John|2008|p=145}} Christened with the Greek name Ioannis Agorastos, Plagis used the English form of Ioannis, John, from childhood, and attended [[Prince Edward School]] in Salisbury.{{sfn|Who's Who of Southern Africa|1973|p=1230}}

Having been interested in aviation since he was a boy,{{sfn|Charousis|2010|p=115}} Plagis volunteered for the [[Rhodesian Air Force|Southern Rhodesian Air Force]] (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down because he was the son of foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded]] Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the [[Royal Air Force]], which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted.{{sfn|Shores|Williams|1966|p=247}} Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of [[flight sergeant]] in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.{{sfn|Shores|Williams|1966|p=247}}{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}}

Though he was officially in the RAF as a Greek (he became a Rhodesian citizen only after the war), Plagis considered himself a Rhodesian flyer and wore shoulder flashes on his uniform denoting him as such.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=20}} He named each aircraft he piloted during the war after his sister Kay,{{sfn|Government of Southern Rhodesia|1945|pp=38–42}} and painted that name on the side of each cockpit.{{sfn|Price|2004|p=41}} After briefly flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] with [[No. 65 Squadron RAF]], Plagis joined [[No. 266 Squadron RAF|No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron]], an almost all-Rhodesian Spitfire unit, on 19 July 1941.{{sfn|Salt|2001|p=93}} He served in the UK for about half a year, during which he was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]], before being posted to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]] in January 1942.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}}

==Air war in Europe and the Mediterranean==

===First tour of operations===
[[File:HMS EAGLE and HMS MALAYA in the Mediterranean during Operation 'Spotter', which delivered 16 RAF Spitfire Mk Vs to Malta on 7th March 1942. A7840.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[HMS Eagle (1918)|HMS ''Eagle'']] ''(left)'' and [[HMS Malaya|HMS ''Malaya'']] during Operation ''Spotter'', the first of 13 reinforcements of Malta with [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and pilots, on 7 March 1942. Plagis flew one of the Spitfires from ''Eagle''.|alt=An aircraft carrier loaded with fighter aircraft. Another ship follows.]]

Plagis's first major operation was Operation ''Spotter'', the first of many British [[Malta Convoys|endeavours]] to reinforce the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|besieged island of Malta]] in the face of German and Italian assaults during the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]. Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance, and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942. ''Spotter'' was a plan to strengthen its British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs, which would be carried part of the way from [[Gibraltar]] on the aircraft carrier [[HMS Eagle (1918)|HMS ''Eagle'']], then flown to Malta; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted [[No. 249 Squadron RAF|No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron]]. The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen, four Australians, two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians—Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1991|p=109}}

The operation, carried out on 7 March 1942, was largely successful and 15 of the 16 Spitfires reached Malta.{{refn|The 16th was found to be faulty just before take-off, so it was left behind along with its pilot, Australian Flight Sergeant Jack Yarro.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=15}}|group=n|name="yarro}} Plagis and Leggo arrived to find a third Rhodesian, Flight Officer George "Buck" Buchanan, already attached to the squadron.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|pp=19–20}} A further delivery of 16 Spitfires, Operation ''Picket I'', was attempted on 21 March, but this was less successful; only nine of the planes arrived.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=15}} Thirteen Spitfire reinforcement operations were ultimately launched between March and October 1942, playing a key role in the siege.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=50}} The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and the Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' meanwhile attempted to bomb Malta into submission, turning the airfields into "a wilderness of craters, the docks&amp;nbsp;... a shambles, [[Valletta]] a mass of broken limestone&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|O'Hara|2012|p=54}}

The ''Luftwaffe'' launched a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, who had not slept for over 24&amp;nbsp;hours, returned to the airfield in the early hours having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as part of a group of four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its [[slipstream]], causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|pp=19–20}} In his journal, he vowed to "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it takes me a lifetime".{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1991|p=130}}

[[File:Spitfire VBs 40 Sqn SAAF over Tunisia 1943.jpg|thumb|left|A Spitfire Mk V, as flown by Plagis over Malta with [[No. 249 Squadron RAF|No. 249 Squadron]]|alt=A Spitfire with SAAF markings, flying against a blue sky]]
Plagis shot down his first enemy aircraft on 25 March 1942, and on 1 April achieved four more aerial victories in a single afternoon, thereby becoming the Siege of Malta's first Spitfire [[flying ace|ace]].{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}} His downing of four enemies in a few hours won him much praise from superiors and reporters, and contributed to his growing reputation as an aggressive but skilful combat pilot.{{sfn|Government of Southern Rhodesia|1945|pp=38–42}} He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 1 May 1942, the citation noting that he had "destroyed 4 and probably destroyed a further 3 hostile aircraft". "With complete indifference to odds against him, he presses home his attacks with skill and courage," it continued—"He has set an outstanding example."&lt;ref name=lg010542&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35542|supp=y|pages=1903–1904|date=1 May 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May, Plagis attempted to down an Italian [[Reggiane Re.2001]] by flying straight at it to ram it; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres, the Italian aircraft [[Stall (flight)|stall]]ed and almost crashed into the sea. Thinking he had downed the enemy, Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot,{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=35}} but the Italian flight reported no losses. Plagis's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement, and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely; he landed with only three gallons (14 litres) of fuel left.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1991|p=260}} On 16 May, Plagis and an English ace, Pilot Officer Peter Nash, destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared kill that became No. 249 Squadron's 100th victory over Malta.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=90}} Amid the continuing siege, the need for a major supply convoy to Malta was becoming urgent; the Governor [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]] warned Britain in early June that if no supplies came by August, he would have to surrender to prevent a famine.{{sfn|O'Hara|2012|p=57}}

Plagis was [[battlefield promotion|promoted in the field]] to [[flight lieutenant]] on 4 June 1942 and transferred to [[No. 185 Squadron RAF|No. 185 Squadron]] to [[Flight commander (position)|command]] "B" Flight. He shot down two Re.2001s two days later to bring his tally of victories to ten (thereby fulfilling his pledge following Leggo's death), and destroyed a Bf 109 on 7 June.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}} A month later, he received a [[medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC, having been adjudged to have shown "exceptional skill and gallantry in combat&amp;nbsp;... Undeterred by superior numbers of attacking aircraft, he presses home his attacks with great determination."&lt;ref name=lg070742&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35621|supp=y|pages=2979–2980|date=7 July 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plagis left Malta when his tour expired on 7 July 1942, flying first to Gibraltar, then the UK.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}} The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with [[Operation Pedestal|Operation ''Pedestal'']] (known in Malta as the "Santa Marija Convoy").{{sfn|Latimer|2002|p=87}}

[[File:Plagis and Hancock, No. 64 Sqn RAF, at Hornchurch c1943.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plagis ''(left)'' as commander of [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No. 64 Squadron]], with fellow Malta veteran A&amp;nbsp;J Hancock. [[RAF Hornchurch]], England, c. 1943–44|alt=Two men in air force uniforms stand in front of a fighter aircraft]]
On arriving in England, Plagis was found to be suffering from [[malnutrition]], [[scabies]] and physical and mental fatigue. He briefly convalesced in a nursing home,{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=52}} then spent a year as an instructor in England.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}} He was promoted to probationary [[flying officer]] on 1 October 1942.&lt;ref name=lg111242&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35819|supp=y|pages=5395–5396|date=11 December 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second tour of operations===
Plagis returned to action in September 1943, when he was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No. 64 Squadron]], then flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France from [[RAF Coltishall]] in [[Norfolk]]. Plagis downed a Bf 109 over France on 24 September 1943, then a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] on 23 November,{{sfn|Shores|Williams|1966|p=247}} and formally received the rank of flight lieutenant on 8 December 1943.&lt;ref name=lg101243&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36280|supp=y|pages=5383–5384|date=10 December 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of June 1944, Plagis assumed command of [[No. 126 Squadron RAF|No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron]], flying Spitfire Mk IXs that had recently been moved from Malta to assist in the [[invasion of Normandy]]. Six of the squadron's planes had been purchased by the Persian Gulf Spitfire Fund, and duly named after the donating sheikdoms; Plagis's aircraft, which he chose because of the large letter "K" on its tail (echoing his sister's name), had "[[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]" painted in English and Arabic script on its side. He added to this a full rendering of "Kay" and other personal decorations.{{sfn|Price|2004|p=52}}

After leading No. 126 Squadron on raids into Normandy during the Allied invasion, Plagis took part in many of the attacks on German positions in northern France and the [[Low Countries]] that [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|followed]] over the next few months.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}} He was shot down over [[Arnhem]] in the Netherlands during [[Operation Market Garden|Operation ''Market Garden'']] in September 1944, but suffered only minor injuries and quickly returned to action.{{sfn|St John|2008|p=145}} He received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 3 November for his "participat[ion] in very many sorties during which much damage has been inflicted on&amp;nbsp;... [German] shipping, radio stations, oil storage tanks, power plants and other installations".&lt;ref name=lg031144/&gt; The citation particularly stressed an engagement in which a small group of Allied fighters led by Plagis had taken on a far superior force of enemy aircraft and shot down five of them, Plagis himself downing two. Plagis was described as "a brave and resourceful leader whose example has proved a rare source of inspiration".&lt;ref name=lg031144&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36777|supp=y|pages=5034–5035|date=3 November 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagis converted to [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang IIIs]] along with the rest of his squadron at [[RAF Bentwaters]] in [[Suffolk]] during December 1944 and January 1945, and spent the rest of the war flying bomber escort missions at the head of Bentwaters Wing, which included No. 126 Squadron.{{sfn|Nichols|2008|p=92}}{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1991|p=657}} He was promoted to [[squadron leader]] on 28 March 1945.&lt;ref name=lg110545&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37074|supp=y|pages=2483–2484|date=11 May 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[German instrument of surrender|Germany surrendered]] on 7 May, [[end of World War II in Europe|ending the war in Europe]].{{sfn|King|1947}}

Plagis finished the war with a tally of 16 enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed (including two shared victories counted as half a kill each), two shared probably destroyed, six damaged and one shared damaged.{{sfn|Price|2004|p=52}} This made him Southern Rhodesia's highest-scoring ace of the war,{{sfn|Shores|Williams|1966|p=73}} as well as the top-scoring ace of Greek origin.{{sfn|Charousis|2010|p=117}} He was one of the most-decorated Southern Rhodesian servicemen of the war.{{sfn|MacDonald|1976|loc=Appendix, p. i}}

==Post-war service and later life==

Plagis stayed with the RAF following the end of hostilities, and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron in England and Germany, flying [[Gloster Meteor]] F.3s.{{sfn|King|1947}}{{sfn|Thomas|1993}} He was awarded the [[Airman's Cross]] by the government of the Netherlands in October 1946.&lt;ref name=lg151046&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37758|supp=y|pages=5079–5080|date=15 October 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from the military with the rank of [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]], Plagis returned home to Southern Rhodesia in 1948.{{sfn|St John|2008|p=145}} A street in the north Salisbury suburb of [[Alexandra Park, Harare|Alexandra Park]] had been named after him in recognition of his wartime exploits; he moved into the house at the end of the road, 1&amp;nbsp;John Plagis Avenue.{{sfn|Parker|1972|p=104}} He married in 1954 and had three sons and a daughter.{{sfn|Who's Who of Southern Africa|1973|p=1230}}

Plagis set up and ran a [[liquor store|bottle store]] bearing his name in Salisbury,{{sfn|Parker|1972|p=104}} and was involved in several businesses during the next three decades, serving as a director on company boards, including [[Central African Airways]] from 1963 to 1968.{{sfn|Who's Who of Southern Africa|1973|p=1230}} He joined the [[Rhodesian Front]] on its formation in 1962, and was its candidate in Salisbury City in that year's [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1962|general election]], losing to the [[United Federal Party]]'s John Roger Nicholson by 631 votes to 501.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=202}} According to a report published by the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] in 1969, Plagis was by then working in the office of the Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] ([[military service of Ian Smith|himself]] a Second World War Spitfire pilot), with responsibility for the premier's written correspondence.{{sfn|ZANU|1969|p=29}}

In later life, Plagis became a friend of British ace [[Douglas Bader]], a prominent supporter of Rhodesia's  [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965. Bader, Smith and Plagis often socialised.{{sfn|Francis|2008|p=193}}{{sfn|Lucas|1981|p=262}} Plagis also knew [[L.

[[File:Indonesian farmer shows coffee beans already digested by Asian Palm Civet, but before cleaning and roasting.jpg|thumb|Sumatran kopi luwak farmer gathers up the droppings of civet cats which eat [[coffee cherry|coffee cherries]], digest them, then egest them in their feces.]]

'''Kopi luwak''' ({{IPA-may|ˈkopi ˈlu.aʔ|id}}), or '''civet coffee''', is [[coffee]] that includes part-digested [[coffee cherry|coffee cherries]] eaten and [[defecation|defecated]] by the [[Asian palm civet]] (''Paradoxurus hermaphroditus'').&lt;ref name="Onishi" /&gt; Fermentation occurs as the cherries pass through a civet's [[intestines]], and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.

Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection – civets choosing to eat only certain cherries – and digestion – biological or chemical mechanisms in the animal's digestive tract altering the composition of the coffee cherries.

The traditional method of collecting feces from wild civets has given way to [[intensive farming]] methods in which civets in [[battery cage]] systems are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets due to "horrific conditions" including isolation, poor diet, small cages and a high mortality rate.&lt;ref name= "Milman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZK-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20130913"/&gt;

Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching {{€|550}} / {{US$|700}} per kilogram.&lt;ref name= "AutoZK-3" /&gt;

Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Bali]] and [[Sulawesi]] in the [[Indonesia]]n Archipelago. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in the farms in the islands of the [[Philippines]] (where the product is called ''kape motit'' in the Cordillera region, ''kapé alamíd'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] areas, and ''kapé melô'' or ''kapé musang'' in Mindanao island), and in [[East Timor]] (where it is called ''kafé-laku''). ''Weasel coffee'' is a loose English translation of its [[Vietnam]]ese name ''cà phê Chồn''.

== History ==
The origin of kopi luwak is closely connected with the history of [[coffee production in Indonesia]]. In the early 18th century the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] established the [[cash-crop]] coffee plantations in their colony in the [[Dutch East Indies]] islands of Java and Sumatra, including Arabica coffee introduced from Yemen.  During the era of ''[[Cultuurstelsel]]'' (1830–70), the Dutch prohibited the [[native Indonesians|native]] farmers and plantation workers from picking coffee fruits for their own use.  Still, the native farmers wanted to have a taste of the famed coffee beverage. Soon, the natives learned that certain species of ''musang'' or ''luwak'' (Asian palm civet) consumed the coffee fruits, yet they left the coffee seeds undigested in their droppings. The natives collected these luwaks' coffee seed droppings, then cleaned, roasted and ground them to make their own coffee beverage.&lt;ref name="AutoZK-4"/&gt; The fame of aromatic civet coffee spread from locals to Dutch plantation owners and soon became their favourite, yet because of its rarity and unusual process, the civet coffee was expensive even during the colonial era.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Production ==
[[File:Luwak.jpg|thumb|An [[Asian palm civet]]]]

{{quote|text=The luak, that's a small catlike animal, gorges after dark on the most ripe, the best of our crop. It digests the fruit and expels the beans, which our farm people collect, wash, and roast, a real delicacy. Something about the natural fermentation that occurs in the luak's stomach seems to make the difference. For Javanese, this is the best of all coffees—our Kopi luak.|sign=Doyo Soeyono Kertosastro, Indonesian Coffee Farmer|source=March 1981 [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/coffee/article1.html|title=The bonanza bean: Coffee|first=Ethel A.|last=Starbird|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Kopi'' is the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word for coffee. ''Luwak'' is a local name of the [[Asian palm civet]] in Sumatra.&lt;ref name="Onishi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cluwak"/&gt; Palm civets are primarily [[Frugivore|frugivorous]], feeding on berries and pulpy fruits such as [[Ficus|figs]] and [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Civets also eat small vertebrates, insects, ripe fruits and seeds.&lt;ref name="AutoZK-6"/&gt;

Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection and digestion. Selection occurs as the civets choose which cherries to eat – i.e. those that are most ripe and flawless. Digestive mechanisms may improve the flavor profile of the coffee beans that have been eaten. The civet eats the cherries for the fleshy pulp, then in the digestive tract, fermentation occurs. The civet's [[protease|protease enzymes]] seep into the beans, making shorter [[peptide]]s and more free [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name="marcone1" /&gt;

Early production began when beans were gathered in the wild from where a civet would defecate as a means to [[territorial marking|mark its territory]]. On farms, civets are either caged or allowed to roam within defined boundaries.&lt;ref name="Onishi" /&gt;

Coffee berries are eaten by a civet for their fruit pulp. After spending about a day and a half in the civet's [[digestive tract]] the beans are then [[defecated]] in clumps, having kept their shape and still covered with some of the fleshy berry's inner layers.

Despite being in contact with faeces and pathogenic organisms, the beans contain negligible amounts of the enteric (pathogenic) organisms associated with feces. Moreover, the "cherry" or endocarp surrounding the bean is not completely digested by the luwak, and after being collected, the farmer performs thorough washing and removes the endocarp.&lt;ref name="uoguelph"/&gt; The final roasting of the beans would, additionally, eliminate any remaining bacteria.

[[Sumatra]] is the world's largest regional producer of kopi luwak. Sumatran civet coffee beans are mostly an early [[Coffea arabica|arabica]] variety cultivated in the Indonesian archipelago since the 17th century. The major Sumatran kopi luwak production area is in [[Lampung]], [[Bengkulu]] and [[Aceh]] especially the Gayo region, [[Takengon]]. [[tagalog people|Tagalog]] kape alamid comes from civets fed on a mixture of coffee beans and is sold in the [[Batangas]] region along with gift shops near airports in the [[Philippines]].

Vietnam has two farms with 300 wild civets in Dak Lak, while in Mindanao island of the Philippines, has two farms with 200 (in Davao City) and 100 (Iligan City) wild civets. But the archipelago of Indonesia where the famous ''kopi luwak'' was first discovered and produced is leading in supplying the world market for almost three centuries, where many small-scale civet farms are proliferating in the countryside.

[[File:Kopi Luwak already digested by Asian Palm Civet.jpg|thumb|Defecated luwak coffee berries, [[East Java]]]]

Several studies have examined the process in which the animal's stomach acids and enzymes digest the beans' covering and ferment the beans.&lt;ref name="uoguelph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trnguyen"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.trung-nguyen-online.com/legendee.html | title = Legendee: The Legend of the Weasel | publisher = trung-nguyen-online.com | accessdate = 18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usda1" /&gt; Research by food scientist Massimo Marcone at the [[University of Guelph]] in Ontario, Canada showed that the civet's [[Endogeny|endogenous]] [[digestive tract|digestive]] secretions seep into the beans. These secretions carry [[Protease|proteolytic enzymes]] which break down the beans' proteins, yielding shorter [[peptide]]s and more free [[amino acid]]s. The proteins also undergo non-enzymatic [[Maillard reaction|Maillard browning]] reactions in the later roasting process. Moreover, while inside a civet the beans begin to [[germinate]] by [[malt]]ing which also lowers their bitterness.&lt;ref name="marcone1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marcone2"/&gt; Marcone also conducted an analysis on the volatile compounds which are responsible for the coffee's flavour and aroma, showing that there are significant differences from regular coffee. He concluded that:&lt;ref name="uoguelph"/&gt; 
# Protein structure had been altered, reducing bitterness and potentially impacting flavour.
# Volatile compounds had significant differences compared to regular coffee, indicating there are changes in flavour.

According to Dr. Davila Cortes, the altered protein structure degrades the effectiveness of the coffee as a diuretic.&lt;ref&gt;Davila Cortes, Glenda "The International Guide to Coffee" 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taste ==
[[File:Kopi Luwak Gayo, Takengon, Aceh.jpg|thumb|right|A cup of Kopi Luwak from Gayo, Takengon, Aceh.]]
Few objective assessments of taste are available. Kopi luwak is a name for any beans collected from the excrement of civets, hence the taste may vary with the type and origin of beans ingested, processing subsequent to collection, roasting, aging and brewing. The ability of the civet to select its berries, and other aspects of the civet's diet and health (e.g. stress levels) may also influence the processing and hence taste.&lt;ref name="Onishi" /&gt;

In the coffee industry, kopi luwak is widely regarded as a gimmick or novelty item.&lt;ref name="Kubota"/&gt; The [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] (SCAA) states that there is a "general consensus within the industry ... it just tastes bad". A coffee professional cited in the SCAA article was able to compare the same beans with and without the kopi luwak process using a rigorous [[coffee cupping]] evaluation. He concluded: "it was apparent that Luwak coffee sold for the story, not superior quality...Using the SCAA cupping scale, the Luwak scored two points below the lowest of the other three coffees. It would appear that the Luwak processing diminishes good acidity and flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem to note as a positive to the coffee.”

Tim Carman, food writer for the ''Washington Post'' reviewed kopi luwak available to US consumers and concluded "It tasted just like...[[Folgers]]. Stale. Lifeless. Petrified dinosaur droppings steeped in bathtub water. I couldn't finish it."&lt;ref name="AutoZK-5"/&gt;

Some critics claim more generally that kopi luwak is simply bad coffee, purchased for novelty rather than taste.&lt;ref name="Kubota" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZK-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hetzel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinclair"/&gt; Massimo Marcone, who performed extensive chemical tests on the beans, was unable to conclude if anything about their properties made them superior for purposes of making coffee. He employed several professional coffee tasters (called "cuppers") in a blind taste test. While the cuppers were able to distinguish the kopi luwak as distinct from the other samples, they had nothing remarkable to appraise about it other than it was less acidic and had less body, tasting "thin". Marcone remarked "It's not that people are after that distinct flavor. They are after the rarity of the coffee".&lt;ref name="New Scientist"/&gt;

== Imitation ==

Several commercial processes attempt to replicate the digestive process of the civets without animal involvement.

Researchers with the [[University of Florida]] have been issued with a patent for one such process.&lt;ref name="usda1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faqspatent"/&gt; Brooklyn-based food startup Afineur has also developed a patented fermentation technology that reproduces some of the taste aspects of Kopi Luwak while improving coffee bean taste and nutritional profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrey Smith|first1=Peter|title=Better Coffee Through Bacterial Chemistry|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-21/afineur-better-coffee-without-the-civet-poop|website=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimberoff|first1=Larissa|title=How a New Startup Is Refining the Flavor of Coffee via Microbial Fermentation|url=http://www.eater.com/drinks/2015/8/3/9090701/how-a-new-startup-is-refining-the-flavor-of-coffee-via-microbial|website=Eater|publisher=Eater|accessdate=7 July 2016|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WURGAFT|first1=BEN|title=Vegan Kopi Luwak?

Vietnamese companies sell an imitation kopi luwak, made using an [[enzyme]] soak which they claim replicates the civet's digestive process.&lt;ref name="trnguyen" /&gt;

Imitation has several motivations. The high price of kopi luwak drives the search for a way to produce kopi luwak in large quantities. Kopi luwak production involves a great deal of labour, whether farmed or wild-gathered. The small production quantity and the labor involved in production contribute to the coffee's high cost.&lt;ref name="AutoZK-8"/&gt; Imitation may be a response to the decrease in the civet population.&lt;ref name="AutoZK-7"/&gt;

== Animal welfare ==
[[File:Luwak (civet cat) in cage.jpg|thumb|right|Civet in a cage]]

Initially, civet coffee beans were picked from wild civet excrement found around coffee plantations. This unusual process contributed to its rarity and subsequently, its high price. More recently, growing numbers of intensive civet "farms" have been established and operated across Southeast Asia, confining tens of thousands of animals to live in [[battery cage]]s and be force-fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/19/civet-cat-coffee-worlds-most-expensive-brew-made-sustainably-kopi-luwak|title=Civet cat coffee: can world's most expensive brew be made sustainably?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 September 2014|last1=Wild|first1=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-12/cruelty-claims-and-civet-cat-coffee-luwak-from-bali/6386544|title=Civet cat coffee: A delicious beverage or a case of animal cruelty?|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150301/plus/coffee-civets-and-conservation-137440.html|title=Coffee, civets and conservation|date=28 February 2015|work=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were raised over the safety of civet coffee after evidence suggested that the SARS virus originated from palm civets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'"The conditions are awful, much like battery chickens", said Chris Shepherd, deputy regional director of the conservation NGO, [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] south-east Asia. "The civets are taken from the wild and have to endure horrific conditions. They fight to stay together but they are separated and have to bear a very poor diet in very small cages. There is a high mortality rate and for some species of civet, there's a real conservation risk. It's spiralling out of control. But there's not much public awareness of how it's actually made. People need to be aware that tens of thousands of civets are being kept in these conditions. It would put people off their coffee if they knew"'.&lt;ref name="Milman" /&gt;

A 2013 investigation by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) Asia found wild-caught civets on farms in Indonesia and the Philippines. The animals were deprived of exercise, a proper diet, and space. Video footage from the investigation shows abnormal behaviours such as repeated pacing, circling, or biting the bars of their cages. The animals often lose their fur.&lt;ref name="Kopi Luwak Investigation"/&gt; A [[BBC]] investigation revealed similar findings.&lt;ref name="BBC20130913"/&gt;

Tony Wild, the coffee executive responsible for bringing kopi luwak to the Western world, has stated he no longer supports using kopi luwak due to animal cruelty and launched a campaign called "Cut the Crap" to halt the use of kopi luwak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/sep/13/civet-coffee-cut-the-crap|title=Civet coffee: Why it's time to cut the crap|first=Tony|last=Wild|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers using caged civets in Takengon, north Sumatra, confirmed to the BBC that they supplied kopi luwak beans to exporters whose produce ends up in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="BBC20130913"/&gt;

Intensive farming is also criticised by traditional farmers because the civets do not select what they eat, so the cherries which are fed to them in order to flavor the coffee are of poor quality compared to those beans collected from the wild.&lt;ref name= "AnimalCoffee.Com"/&gt; According to an officer from the [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC conservation programme]], the trade in civets to make kopi luwak may constitute a significant threat to wild civet populations.&lt;ref name="AutoZK-2" /&gt;

The price of farmed (considered low-grade by connoisseurs) kopi luwak in large Indonesian supermarkets is from US$100 per kilogram (five times the price of a high quality local arabica coffee).

The price paid to collectors in the Philippines is closer to US$20 per kilogram.&lt;ref name="Onishi" /&gt;

Some specialty coffee shops sell cups of brewed kopi luwak for US$35–80.&lt;ref name="AutoZK-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZK-13"/&gt;

==Authenticity and fraud==

Investigations by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] and the BBC found fraud to be rife in the kopi luwak industry, with producers willing to label coffee from caged civets with a "wild sourced" or similar label.&lt;ref name="Kopi Luwak Investigation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kopi Luwak Investigation|url= http://action.petaasiapacific.com/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=110&amp;ea.campaign.id=22769 |publisher=PETA Asia |accessdate= 17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20130913"/&gt;

Genuine kopi luwak from wild civets is difficult to purchase in Indonesia and proving it is not fake is very difficult – there is little enforcement regarding use of the name "kopi luwak", and there's even a local cheap coffee brand named "Luwak", which costs under US$3 per kilogram but is occasionally sold online under the guise of real kopi luwak.

== Variations ==
There are reports of a kopi luwak type process occurring naturally with [[muntjac]] and birds. Bat coffee is another variation that is in demand. Bats feed on the ripest coffee and fruits and spit out the seeds. These seeds are dried and processed to make coffee with a slight fruity flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://otterscreek.in/coorg-home-stay/wild-bat-coffee/ | title=Bat Coffee Coorg |publisher=Otters Creek River Resort Coorg Nagarhole| date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/10/22/are_you_fancy_enough_for_bird_poop_coffee|title=Are you fancy enough for bird poop coffee?|first=Lindsay|last=Abrams|publisher=Salon.com|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition''' (LIMA) is a maritime and aerospace exhibition that takes place once every two years in [[Langkawi]], [[Malaysia]]. The last event took place in 2017.

The event is one of the largest maritime and aerospace exhibitions in the [[Asia-Pacific]], and is focused mainly on the [[defence industry]], but also supports civilian industries. In 2013, LIMA recorded an overall growth of 10%, with 433 exhibitors from 31 countries, 333 defence delegations from 38 countries, 632 media personnel from 127 agencies, 68 ships and 78 aircraft attending the show. The 5 day event also saw 38,421 trade visitors from both defense and commercial sectors from all around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lima.com.my/GUI/pdf/LIMA13-Show%20Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110091740/http://www.lima.com.my/GUI/pdf/LIMA13-Show%20Report.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 135,691 public visitors.

The exhibitors involved in the event exhibit their products inside the purpose built Mahsuri International Exhibition Centre (MIEC), adjacent to the terminal at [[Langkawi International Airport]]. The maritime exhibitions take place at [[Resorts World Langkawi|Resort World]] Langkawi while the aerospace exhibitions take place at the [[Langkawi International Airport]]. The venues are all in close proximity to each other.

The event is supported by the [[Malaysia]]n government and industry associations.

==History==
LIMA began in 1991 with slightly over 100 exhibiting companies with the aim of making Langkawi the venue for light and experimental aircraft to fly unhampered by heavy traffic, modeled after the [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|EAA Air Venture]] in the United States. LIMA has now expanded into maritime exhibitions and is also one of [[Asia-Pacific]]'s largest maritime and air exhibitions. Nowadays, a four-hour flying display is held daily throughout the show.

=== LIMA 2003 ===
The LIMA '03 exhibition generated business totaling RM 2.182 Billion (USD 575 million) through 30 contracts, letters of offer and acceptance or intent and memorandums of understanding.

=== LIMA 2005 ===
LIMA 05' witnessed a signing of RM4 billion worth of contracts in maritime and aerospace items. According to the then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Haji [[Najib Razak]] that the amount included defense contract RM3.2 billion, letters of offer worth RM403 million and letters of intent worth RM344 million. Najib Razak said that a major portion of the contracts sealed this time was related to the purchase of A400M aircraft for the Royal Malaysian Air force which amounted to RM2.8 billion including the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Archives.

{{Hillary Clinton series}}

Most Democratic voters supported [[Hillary Clinton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/populism-democrats-best-shot-regaining-power-article-1.2866874|title=Populism is Democrats' best shot at regaining power|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-path-victory-rust-belt/story?id=43407209|title=Donald Trump's Path to Victory Through the Rust Belt|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some traditionally Democratic counties in the [[Rust Belt]] voted for [[Donald Trump]]. One reason given for Trump winning counties in Eastern Ohio in the [[Ohio Republican primary, 2016]] was Democratic voters opposed to [[free trade]] who had voted in the Republican primary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/11/22/daily-202-rust-belt-dems-broke-for-trump-because-they-thought-clinton-cared-more-about-bathrooms-than-jobs/58339cf3e9b69b7e58e45f1b/?wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1 The Daily 202 in the Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt; In general CNN exit polls showed Ohio Democratic voters with slightly less support for Clinton than the national average,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/ohio/president|title=2016 election results: Ohio Exit polls|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Trump receiving higher support among Democratic voters in Ohio than Romney had in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/OH/president/|title=2012 election results: Ohio Exit polls|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillary Clinton had relatively low support in Appalachia from Democratic voters. In interviews with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Appalachian Democrats voting for Trump cited concerns about [[NAFTA]] and coal-mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-west-virginia-appalachia|title=Trump country: why Democratic strongholds are turning red|first=Arne|last=Hoel|date=October 2, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exit poll showed Donald Trump receiving 22% of the Democratic vote in [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/kentucky/president|title=2016 election results: Kentucky Exit polls|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state Clinton had won overwhelmingly in the [[Kentucky Democratic primary, 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P08/KY-D.phtml|title=Kentucky Democratic Delegation 2008|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elliott County, Kentucky]], which had the longest unbroken streak of voting Democrat of any county in the United States, went for Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcnky.com/articles/2016/11/09/covington-chooses-change-meyer-elected-mayor-williams-back-commission|title=Covington Chooses Change: Meyer Elected Mayor, Williams Back on Commission|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Appalachian states, such as [[Tennessee]] and [[West Virginia]], did not have exit polls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/2016-exit-polls-used-in-which-states-230892 Politico]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Overall CNN exit polls indicated Clinton received 89% of the Democratic vote,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/national/president CNN exit polls for President]&lt;/ref&gt; compared with House Democrats receiving 92% of the Democratic vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/national/house CNN exit polls on House voters]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between percentage of Republicans voting for a Republican representative and voting for Trump was six points. 

The Democrats who voted for Trump have been labelled "Trumpocrats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2016-10-04/trumpocrats-are-they-the-next-reagan-democrats|title=Trumpocrats: Are They the Next Reagan Democrats?|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2016|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were also Democratic voters who favored [[Jill Stein]]. In Oregon, Stein received one percent of the Democratic vote according to CNN exit polls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/oregon/president|title=2016 election results: Oregon Exit polls|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; equal to the total for all third-party voting among Democrats in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/OR/president/|title=2011 election results: Oregon Exit polls|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Ming Conquest of Yunnan}}

The '''Luchuan–Pingmian Campaigns''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|麓川|平|緬|戰爭}}|p={{linktext|Lùchuān| Píng| miǎn| Zhànzhēng}}}}) (1436–49) were punitive expeditions carried out by the [[Ming dynasty]] under the rule of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] against the [[Shan people|Shan]] state of [[Mong Mao]], on the [[Burma]]-[[Yunnan]] frontier.

Luchuan–Pingmian was a Chinese military and civilian pacification commission on the Burmese frontier, corresponding roughly to the modern districts of [[Longchuan County, Yunnan|Longchuan]] and [[Ruili]], including part of the [[Gaoligong Mountains]], along the upper reaches of the [[Shweli River]].{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=164}}

== Background ==

A year after the [[Ming intervention in Mong Mao (1397–1398)|Ming–Mong Mao Intervention]] of 1398, the [[tusi]] Si Lunfa died and a new generation of elites rose to power in Mong Mao. His son Si Xingfa, together with Dao Hun and Dao Cuan, conducted short lived raids on Ming territory before military retaliation by the Yunnan guard led a stop to that.{{sfn|Fernquest|2006|p=48}} The territory of Mong Mao was partitioned into five new administrative divisions each with their own tusi. Thereafter Si Xingfa paid regular annual tribute to the Ming until he was removed from office in 1413 for failing to observe proper tribute ceremonies, and offended an imperial envoy. His brother Si Renfa succeeded him.{{sfn|Liew|1996|pp=167–69}}

In the following 20 years from 1413 to 1433 Mong Mao, [[Hsenwi State|Hsenwi]], and the [[Kingdom of Ava]] regularly lodged complaints of incursions by neighboring states to the Ming. However no action was taken except to send imperial envoys to persuade them to cease encroachment on foreign territories.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=169}}

In March 1436 Si Renfa petitioned for an exemption of 2,500 taels in taxes, which was the amount Mong Mao was in arrears. [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming]] granted the petition approval despite objections from his officials.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=170}}

In November 1437 Si Renfa attacked the tusi of Nandian and annexed his land. A petition was sent to the Ming court requesting assistance in returning land that had been taken from it by [[Mong Mao]]. The regional commander of Yunnan, Mu Sheng, was requested to make an investigation into the matter. His report arrived on 28 June 1438, stating that Mong Mao
had "repeatedly invaded [[Nandian, Yunnan|Nandian]], [[Ganyai]], [[Tengchong]],...[[Lujiang]],
and [[Jinchi]]". Another report arrived on 14 July, 1438, stating that the Mong Mao ruler had "appointed local
chieftains of the neighboring regions subordinate to him without
asking for the approval of the Ming court and that some of these
men joined forces with him to invade Jinchi." {{sfn|Liew|1996|p=170}}

In preparation for a punitive expedition, the Ming court issued an imperial edict to Hsenwi asking for their assistance in surrounding Mong Mao.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=170}}

The strategy of divide and conquer had failed on the Yunnan-Burma frontier. Rather than making the [[Tai people|Tai]] and Shan peoples easier to manage, it had balkanized the region and contributed to the endemic chaos and warfare that plagued the various tusis the Ming had created. In 1438 a total of 199 tusi offices were abolished and the regional commander of Yunnan, Mu Sheng, received orders to carry out a punitive campaign on 8 December, 1438.{{sfn|Fernquest|2006|p=57}}

== First Campaign (1438-1439) ==

The first punitive expedition was led by Fang Zheng, Zhang Rong, Mu Sheng, and Mu Ang.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=173}}

Mu Sheng, Mu Ang, and Fang Zheng reached the garrison town of Jinchi, located east of the [[Salween River]] on 8 December 1438. There they encountered Si Renfa's defensed on the opposite side of the river, where palisades had already been erected. Mu Sheng attempted to negotiate Si Renfa's surrender and sent the commander Che Lin to reach a compromise. Si Renfa agreed to the terms, however his general Mianjian attempted to challenge the Ming troops. Seeing that Mu Sheng had no intention to fight, the exasperated Fang Zheng took his troops as well as his son Fang Ying across the river at night and defeated the enemy, forcing them to retreat. Si Renfa retreated to Jinghan stockade while his forces fled as far as the [[Gaoligong Mountains]].{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=173}}

On 17 January 1439, Fang Zheng attacked Si Renfa's stockade and forced him to retreat further south, after which he continued in pursuit. However by this time his troops were exhausted and his supply lines were cut off. He requested reinforcements but Mu Sheng only sent a small number as he was angry that Fang Zheng had disobeyed orders. Fang Zheng was then defeated at Kongni where he had pursued Si Renfa, and "fell into an ambush of the elephant phalanx of his enemy", at which point he ordered his son to escape, and died with his troops.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=173}} 

Upon receiving news of Fang Zheng's defeat, Mu Sheng dismantled his camps and retreated to [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] as late spring was approaching and along with it the hot summer.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=173}} When Mu Sheng reached [[Chuxiong City]], he was reprimanded by an imperial envoy for Fang Zheng's failure. Fearing that the emperor would blame him for the loss at Kongni, Mu Sheng sent back 45,000 troops, but died soon after from an illness on 2 May 1439. Emboldened by the Ming failure to suppress him, Si Renfa continued his military expansion against his neighbors.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=174-175}}

== The Second Campaign (1441-1442) ==

In December 1440 Mu Ang petitioned for a second campaign involving at least a combined army of 120,000 men from [[Huguang]], [[Sichuan]], and [[Guizhou]]. The Vice Minister of Justice, He Wenyuan, was against a second campaign and petitioned the court on 7 February 1441, in an attempt to persuade them not to squander their resources in capturing land that is "not inhabitable to us."{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=176}} The war party, led by the Minister of War, Wang Ji, and the Duke of Yingguo, Zhang Fu, argued that to let Si Renfa do as he pleased would show weakness to the neighboring Hsenwi and Ava, and would result in a loss of prestige and encourage further rebellions. The second campaign was authorized by the young Zhengtong Emperor under the influence of the palace eunuch [[Wang Zhen (eunuch)|Wang Zhen]].{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=177}}

The second expedition was led by Jiang Gui, Li An, Liu Ju, and Wang Ji. Before the expedition was carried out,Liu Qiu, a member of the [[Hanlin Academy]] as well as an imperial tutor, presented a memorial in opposition of the campaign. Liu Qiu argued that the southern rebels had already retreated into hiding in the southernmost zone of Yunnan, and did not warrant such a large expenditure as mobilizing 150,000 men. Wang Zhen had him arrested and executed by dismemberment.{{sfn|Dardess|2012|p=7}} The second Ming campaign to the Yunnan frontier was officially launched on 27 February 1441.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=178}}

In June 1441 a Ming contingent of 8,000 engaged with a small Mong Mao party and defeated them in battle, inflicting 150 casualties.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=178}}

In September 1441 the Ming army met with a Mong Mao force of 30,000 and 80 elephants. The Mong Mao advance was repelled, suffering 352 casualties.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=179}}

In November 1441 a Ming army of 20,000 was ambushed by Si Renfa. However the ambush was unsuccessful and Si Renfa was forced to retreat with 1,000 casualties. The Ming army pursued the defeated Shan forces to their stronghold in Shangjiang and besieged them. When the Ming set fire to their stockades, Si Renfa's forces attempted to escape through a watergate, but were attacked by the Ming, and suffered heavy casualties. Although Si Renfa managed to escape, his side reportedly suffered 50,000 casualties in total.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=180}}

In December 1441 a Ming contingent of 8,000 engaged in battle with an armed Mong Mao force of 20,000 and defeated them.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=180}}

In January 1442 the Ming army finally attacked Si Renfa's base and captured it. The defending garrison was said to have suffered 2,390 casualties.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=181}}

Si Renfa fled to [[Kingdom of Ava|Ava]] where he was arrested by the king and held for ransom in return for Ming land, however the Ming were reluctant to deal with Ava.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=182}}

== Third Campaign (1443-1444) ==

Si Renfa's son Si Jifa escaped and continued independent action in another corner of southwest Yunnan. He sent his younger brother Zhaosai to seek pardon from Ming while at the same time he attacked Ming troops in early 1443. However they were defeated and he was forced to flee to [[Mongyang State|Mong Yang]]. Zhaosai was kept as a hostage and the Ming retreated from Mong Mao. Seeing that Mong Mao was no longer occupied, Si Jifa returned to his father's base of power and began attacking neighboring tribes once again.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=182}}

The third punitive expedition was led by Wang Ji and launched in March 1443. Although the mission was to capture Si Jifa, negotiations on the return of Si Renfa had fallen ill. Ava demanded Ming territory for itself and Hsenwi in return of Si Renfa. Furthermore Ava had made peace with Si Jifa. Therefore, although the Ming army quickly defeated Si Jifa's base of power and captured his family, Si Jifa managed to escape to Mong Yang, and the Ming army decided not to pursue out of consideration of a combined Ava-Hsenwi attack on Ming forces.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=184}}

A compromise was finally reached between Ava and Ming in April 1445. Ava agreed to hand over Si Renfa in return for Ming support in annexing part of Hsenwi's territory. Si Renfa came into Ming custody in August 1445 and was executed in January 1446.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=185}}

== Fourth Campaign (1449) ==

Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. 

In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=190}}

The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;(Mangrai,
1969, xx)&lt;/ref&gt; While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=198}}

The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed. Some soldiers committed suicide due to the conditions prevalent in the army.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=192}}

== Consequences of the Wars ==

As the historian Wang Gongwu observes:

{{quotation|This war had disastrous consequences for the Ming state, it disrupted the economies of all the southwestern provinces involved in sending men and supplies in fighting a war of attrition against a small tribal state and it cost the Ming state the respect of its tribal allies on the border, who saw how inept and wasteful the Ming armies were. Moreover, the war drew commanders, officers, men, and other resources from the north which might have been vital to the defence of the northern borders. It is significant that the end of the Lu-ch'uan campaigns early in 1449 was followed immediately by extensive tribal uprisings and other revolts in five provinces south of the Yangtze river, and, on the northern frontiers, by the spectacular defeats later in the year which virtually destroyed the imperial armies in the north and led to the capture of the emperor himself by the Mongols. The year 1449 was a turningpoint in the history of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;(Wang Gungwu, 1998, 326)&lt;/ref&gt;|Wang Gongwu}} 

The four southern punitive expedition and the capture of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] during the following [[Tumu Crisis]] are considered the turning point into decline for the Ming dynasty.{{sfn|Liew|1996|p=200}}

The '''''Manx Independent''''' is a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] weekly [[newspaper]] in the [[Isle of Man]]. It is published every Friday.

It is owned by [[Isle of Man Newspapers]], which is now part of [[Tindle Newspapers]].

Its sister weekly newspapers are the ''[[Isle of Man Courier]]'' and the ''[[Isle of Man Examiner]]''.

==History==
It was founded as a [[broadsheet]] in 1987 after a strike that closed the ''[[Isle of Man Examiner]]'', the ''Isle of Man Times'', the Isle of Man Gazette and the Manx Star. The Isle of Man Examiner title was later revived by the Halifax Courier Group, owner of the ''[[Isle of Man Courier]]''.

The original concept for the Manx Independent came from a local Manx man named Harold Stanley Corlett, affectionately known as Stan Corlett (1934-1992) son of Edith Isabel (Taggart) and James Stanley Corlett. Stan Corlett (Director at Mercantile) previously served as a councillor for Wokingham and had also taught economics at [[Ashridge Business School]] in Hertfordshire returned to the Isle of Man in 1976 at the age of 43 with the mission of finding a way to "Give a voice to the Manx people". Later he was to join the Mercantile Group and see his dream become a reality in developing a newspaper that was unafraid to cover current issues affecting the island's residents.

For a short time the ''Manx Independent'' was published three times a week, produced by the former IOM Weekly Times staff and edited by Simon Richardson. It then became a twice-weekly tabloid, originally owned by Mercantile Publishers and then sold to Morton Newspapers from Northern Ireland in the early 1992.

It was sold to rival newspaper group [[Isle of Man Newspapers]] in 1993, resulting in closure and the redundancy of all staff. It was later revived in that year in its current weekly format.

[[File:Earth-lighting-equinox EN.png|thumb|right|300px|[[daylight|Illumination]] of [[Earth]] by [[Sun]] on the day of an [[equinox]]]]

The '''March equinox'''&lt;ref name="SerwayJewett2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Command1972"/&gt; or '''Northward equinox'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/mar21.htm |first=Irv |last=Bromberg |title=Churches take March 21st as the Ecclesiastical Vernal Equinox in calculating the date of Easter.

The March equinox is known as the '''vernal equinox''' in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and as the '''autumnal equinox''' in the Southern.&lt;ref name="Command1972"&gt;{{cite book |author=United States Naval Training Command |title=Navigation compendium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKrcr0hdC6oC |year=1972 |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Govt.

On the [[Gregorian calendar]], the Northward equinox can occur as early as 19 March or as late as 21 March. For a [[common year]] the [[Gregorian calendar#Calendar seasonal error|computed time slippage]]  is about 5 hours 49 minutes ''later'' than the previous year,  and for a leap year about 18 hours 11 minutes ''earlier'' than the previous year. Balancing the increases of the common years against the losses of the leap years keeps the calendar date of the March equinox from drifting more than one day from 20 March each year.

The March equinox may be taken to mark the beginning of [[spring (season)|spring]] and the end of [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere but marks the beginning of [[autumn]] and the end of [[summer]] in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/aboutseasons.html |title=Defining Seasons |publisher=timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the March equinox is the zero point of [[sidereal time]] and, consequently, [[right ascension]].&lt;ref name="zeilikgregory"&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. |last1=Zeilik |first2=S. A. |last2=Gregory |title=Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |edition=4th |date=1998 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=0030062284 |pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as a reference for calendars and celebrations in many human cultures and religions.

==Constellation==
The point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator northwards is called the [[First Point of Aries]].  However, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], this point is no longer in the [[constellation]] [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]], but rather in [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. By the year 2600 it will be in [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The Earth's axis causes the First Point of Aries to travel westwards across the sky at a rate of roughly one degree every 72 years. Based on the [[88 modern constellations|modern constellation boundaries]], the northward equinox passed from [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] into Aries in the year −1865 (1866 BC), passed into Pisces in the year −67 (68 BC), will pass into Aquarius in the year 2597, and will pass into [[Capricornus]] in the year 4312. It passed by (but not into) a 'corner' of [[Cetus]] at 0°10′ distance in the year 1489.

==Apparent movement of the Sun==
{{See also|Equinox#Length of equinoctial day and night}}In its apparent motion on the day of an equinox, the Sun's disk crosses the Earth's horizon directly to the east at dawn—rising; and again, some 12 hours later, directly to the west at dusk—setting. The March equinox, like all equinoxes, is characterized by having an almost exactly equal amount of daylight and night across most latitudes on Earth.

Due to [[refraction]] of light rays in the Earth's atmosphere the Sun will be visible above the horizon even when its disc is completely below the limb of the Earth. Additionally, when seen from the Earth, the Sun is a bright disc in the sky and not just a point of light, thus sunrise and sunset can be said to start several minutes before the sun's geometric center even crosses the horizon, and extends equally long after. These conditions produce differentials of actual durations of light and darkness at various locations on Earth during an equinox. This is most notable at the more extreme latitudes, where the Sun may be seen to travel sideways considerably during the dawn and evening, drawing out the transition from day to night. At the north and south poles, the Sun appears to move steadily around the horizon, and just above the horizon, neither rising nor setting apart from a slight change in [[declination]] of about 0.39° per day as the equinox passes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|first= Irv |last= Bromberg |publisher= University of Toronto, Canada |url= http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/leap/Solar-Year-Length-Variations.pdf |title= Solar Year Length Variations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{See also|September equinox#Culture}}
===Calendars===
The [[Babylonian calendar]] began with the first full moon after the vernal equinox, the day after the Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]]'s return from the underworld (later known as [[Ishtar]]), in the [[Akitu]] ceremony, with parades through the [[Ishtar Gate]] to the [[Eanna]] temple, and the ritual re-enactment of the marriage to [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], or Sumerian [[Dummuzi]].

The [[Persian calendar]] begins each year at the northward equinox, observationally determined at [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="utoronto1"&gt;{{cite web|first= Irv |last= Bromberg |publisher= University of Toronto, Canada |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/seasons.htm |title=The Lengths of the Seasons |date= |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian national calendar]] starts the year on the day next to the vernal equinox on 22 March (21 March in leap years) with a 30-day month (31 days in leap years), then has 5 months of 31 days followed by 6 months of 30 days.&lt;ref name="utoronto1"/&gt;

====Julian calendar====
The [[Julian calendar|Julian calendar reform]] lengthened seven months and replaced the intercalary month with an intercalary day to be added every four years to February. It was based on a length for the year of 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 d), while the mean tropical year is about 11 minutes and 15 seconds less than that. This had the effect of adding about three quarters of an hour every four years. The effect accumulated from inception in 45 BC until the 16th century, when the northern vernal equinox fell on 10 or 11 March.

The date in 1452 was 11 March, 11:52 (Julian) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ivan |last= Smith |url=http://ns1763.ca/equinox/vern1452-1811.html |title=Vernal Equinox, 1452–1811 |publisher=Ns1763.ca |date=10 May 2002 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2547 it will be 20 March, 21:18 (Gregorian) and 3 March, 21:18 (Julian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ivan |last= Smith |url=http://ns1763.ca/equinox/vern2188-2547.html |title=Vernal Equinox, 2188–2547 |publisher=Ns1763.ca |date=10 May 2002 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemorations===

====Abrahamic tradition====
* The Jewish [[Passover]] usually falls on the first [[full moon]] after the northern hemisphere vernal equinox, although occasionally (currently three times every 19 years) it will occur on the second full moon.
* The [[Christian Church]]es [[computus|calculate]] [[Easter]] as the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the March equinox. The official church definition for the equinox is 21 March.  The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es use the older [[Julian calendar]], while the western churches use the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the western full moons currently fall four, five or 34 days before the eastern ones.  The result is that the two [[List of dates for Easter|Easters]] generally fall on different days but they sometimes coincide.  The earliest possible Easter date in any year is 22 March on each calendar. The latest possible Easter date in any year is 25 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/ |title=Keith's Moon Facts |last=Cooley |first=Keith | publisher=Hiwaay.net personal pages |date=2001}}{{sps|certain=yes|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Asia====
* The northward equinox marks the first day of various calendars including the [[Iranian calendar]]. The ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] new year's festival of [[Nowruz]] can be celebrated 20 March or 21 March. According to the ancient Persian mythology Jamshid, the mythological king of Persia, ascended to the throne on this day and each year this is commemorated with festivities for two weeks. These festivities recall the story of creation and the ancient cosmology of Iranian and Persian people. It is also a holiday celebrated in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Albania]], and various countries of Central Asia, as well as among the [[Kurds]]. As well as being a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] holiday, it is also a holy day for adherents of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and the [[Isma'ilism|Nizari Ismaili Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/232/Navroz | title=Navroz | work=The Ismaili| publisher=Islamic Publications Limited |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bahá'í Naw-rúz is calculated using astronomical tables—the new year always starts at the sunset preceding the vernal equinox calculated for Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahai.us/2011/03/20/with-spring-comes-the-bahai-new-year/ |title=With Spring comes the Baha'i New Year |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States |accessdate=4 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151857/http://www.bahai.us/2011/03/20/with-spring-comes-the-bahai-new-year/ |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In many [[Arab countries]], [[Mother's Day]] is celebrated on the northward equinox.

====North Africa====
* [[Sham el-Nessim]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian holiday which can be traced back as far as 2700 BC. It is still one of the [[public holidays in Egypt]]. Sometime during Egypt's Christian period (c. 200–639) the date moved to [[Easter Monday]], but before then it coincided with the vernal equinox.

====South and Southeast Asia====
{{main|South and Southeast Asian New Year}}
According to the [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]] solar calendar, celebrations which originally coincided with the vernal equinox now take place throughout South Asia and parts of Southeast Asia on the day when the Sun enters the [[Aries (constellation)|sidereal Aries]], generally around 14 April.

====East Asia====
* The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s (节气, literally "climatic segments"), and the vernal equinox (''[[Chunfen|Chūnfēn]]'', {{CJKV|t=春分|s=春分|j=春分|k=춘분|v=Xuân phân}}) marks the ''middle'' of the spring. In this context, the [[Chinese character]] 分 means ''"(equal) division"'' (within a season).
* In Japan, [[Vernal Equinox Day]] (春分の日 ''Shunbun no hi'') is an official [[Holidays of Japan|national holiday]], and is spent visiting family graves and holding family reunions.&lt;ref name="Meyer1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sugita2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yoneyuki Sugita|title=Social Commentary on State and Society in Modern Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI7gDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|date=18 August 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-10-2395-8|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Higan]] (お彼岸) is a Buddhist holiday exclusively celebrated by Japanese sects during both the Spring and Autumnal Equinox.&lt;ref name="Meyer1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Walter Meyer|title=Japan: A Concise History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABHbatbyK6kC&amp;pg=PA246|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8226-3018-0|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in the United States, boatyard employees and sailboat owners celebrate the spring equinox with the '''Burning of the Socks''' festival. Traditionally, the boating community wears socks only during the winter. These are burned at the approach of warmer weather, which brings more customers and work to the area. Officially, nobody then wears socks until the next equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/strange/news-article.aspx?storyid=54143 |title= Annapolis Welcomes Spring by Burning Socks |work= First Coast News}}{{Failed verification|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Diane |title=Hillsmere Joins in Sock Burning Tradition |url=http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/can/2011/03/25-08/Around-Annapolis-Hillsmere-joins-in-sock-burning-tradition.html |work=[[The Capital]] |location=Annapolis, Maryland |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Odesa Grets'ka st 48-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Theatre building on the Hretska Street]]
The '''Odessa Academic Russian Dramatic Theatre named A. Ivanov''' ({{lang-ru|Одесский Академический
Русский Драматический Театр им. A. Иванова }}) is the oldest theatre in southern [[Ukraine]].

The theatre was constructed in 1874 at the initiative of A. C. Velikanov, a local merchant. Velikanov also intended to hire for [[Nikolai Miloslavsky]]’s company as the main performer for the theatre. Initially the theatre was called  ‘’Theatre Velikanova’’ after his owner. However, in 1875 Velikanov sold the theatre to F. Rafalovich who renamed it “Russian Theatre”, name which it kept up to present.

In the years before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] the theatre hosted the main theatrical events of the city. Many  Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Italian, drama, opera and оperetta companies performed on its stage among which [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Eleonora Duse]], [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin]], [[Jean Mounet-Sully]], [[Maria Savina]], [[Vladimir Davydov]], [[Maria Zankovetskaya]], [[Panas Saksagansky]] and [[Mark Kropivnitsky]].

After the [[Russian Civil War]], the “State Odessa Russian Drama Theatre” was officially registered in 1926 and the building was allocated to this government owned entity. In 1927, the Executive Political Committee of the Odessa [[Guberniya|Governorate]]  (Gubispolkom) appointed [[opera singer]] [[Andrei Alekseyevich Ivanov]] as director of the theatre. Today the theatre is also called the Ivanov Theatre. Important actors started their activity at the Odessa Russian Theatre, among which [[Mikhail Astangov]], [[Darya Zerkalova]] and [[Vladimir Samoilov]]. Among the actors which spent most of their acting activity on the theatre’s stage are [[Nikolai Komissarov]], [[Nikolai Volkov the elder]], [[Liya Bugova]], Pavel Mikhaylov, Boris Zaydenberg, Leonid Marennikova, Yevgeny Kotov, Lidiya Polyakova and Igor Shelyugin. Important Russian and Ukrainian directors mounted productions at the Odessa Russian Theatre, among which: Abram Rubin, [[Alexey Gripich]], Аvraam Teplev, Aleksandr Solomarsky, Vladimir Bortko the elder, Viktor Terentyev, Konstantin Chernyadev, Viktor Strizhov, Eduard Mitnitsky, Aleksandr Dzekun and many other things
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the theatre maintained its status as Russian-language theatre. Being closed for renovation for about two years, the theatre opened in 2003 after extensive reconstruction and major overhaul. A team of young actors has been hired, which interact with well-known visiting actors. An art management of theatre is coordinated by a board consisting of three directors. At present, these positions are held by Alexey Girba, Sergey Golomazov and Alexey Litvin.

In December 2009, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of  Ukraine awarded the Odessa regional Russian drama theatre the rank of [[academic theatre]]. In the Soviet Union and the new states created after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this title is awarded to the theatres considered to be most prestigious in the country.

The debut season of '''''[[One in a Million (Malaysian TV series)|One in a Million]]''''' premiered on 26 May 2006 and was aired on [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]]. It was aired until the grand finale held on 22 September 2006. The inaugural season was won by [[Suki Low Sook Yee]] with [[Faizal Tahir]] coming in as first runner-up and [[Muhammad Alif bin Mohd Satar]] coming in third place.

==Early Process==

=== Auditions ===
Auditions were held in April 2006 at:
* Le Meridien Hotel, [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]]
* Berjaya Times Square, [[Kuala Lumpur]]

Participants performed before two judges, [[Paul Moss]] and [[Syafinaz Selamat]]. Contestants who impressed the judges made it through the next round. Contestants whom the judges were unsure of were placed under the 'maybe' category where they performed again for the judges.

===Central Eliminations===
The contestants who got through to the next round, the Central Eliminations, were split into groups of guys and girls. The girls went first. The contestants were split to five groups with eight in each group and only four from every group moved on. The same rule applied to the guys and only forty contestants moved on to the next round.

Then, the Top 40 contestants went through two more rounds of elimination called the 'Blind Test' and 'Style/Presentation' Test. In the 'Blind Test', the contestants had to perform behind a screen. In the 'Style/Presentation' round, two guest judges also judged the style &amp; presentation of each contestant. Only 20 contestants moved on to the knock-out stage.

===Knock-Out &amp; Second Chance===
The Top 20 contestants were then ranked according to their past performances. The contestants who were ranked in the Top 10 got the opportunity to pick one of the Bottom 10 contestants to sing against. No.1 contestant [[Suki Low Sook Yee]] was cut after she chose No.11 [[Muhammad Alif bin Mohd Satar|Alif]] to sing against and No.3 [[Zaihanee binti Zainal Abidin|Zai]] got cut after she chose to compete against No.20 [[Shahmeen Shah bin Halim Shah|Ameen]].

In The Second Chance Show, the 10 contestants who got cut in the knock-out stage performed for 2 final spots in the Top 12. [[Suki Low Sook Yee|Suki]] was Malaysia's choice through viewers' votes and [[Zaihanee binti Zainal Abidin|Zai]] was the judges' pick.

A special episode titled "Circle of 12" was aired. No eliminations were made. The viewers got to know a lot about the top 12 and why should they vote for them. It also showed the contestant in flashbacks scenes.

==Finals==
In the finals, the Top 12 would have to select a song which they had to sing in front a live audience. In the first top 12 eliminations, two contestants were eliminated. Each show that followed eliminated one contestant each week. The grand finale was held on 22 September 2006 at [[Putra World Trade Centre]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

[[Suki Low Sook Yee|Suki]] emerged as the winner of the One Million Ringgit while [[Faizal Tahir|Faizal]] and [[Muhammad Alif bin Mohd Satar|Alif]] came in second and third place respectively. Earlier at the beginning of the grand finale show, hosts [[Marion Caunter]] and [[Awal Ashaari]] announced that [[Faizal Tahir|Faizal]] has the lowest number of votes for that week, but he was given a chance to perform for the grand prize as it was part of the pre-planned non-elimination.

==Top Twelve Finalists==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3132">'''Rally Championship''' is a series of loosely related [[rallying|rally]] [[video games]], focused on [[rally racing]] and based on what is now known as the [[Rally GB]]. The series began in 1988 with Europress' ''Lombard RAC Rally'' game and ended in 2002. Each game in the series had many different front covers.

==''Lombard RAC Rally'' (1988) ==
{{anchor|lombardracrally}}
{{main|Lombard RAC Rally (video game)}}
In 1988, Europress released ''Lombard RAC Rally'' for the [[Atari ST]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-lombard-rac-rally_22603.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amiga]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonamiga.com/?game_id=1581&lt;/ref&gt; under their [[Mandarin Software]] label. This was based on the same rally (under the earlier sponsors' names) as the later ''Network Q RAC Rally'' games.

The game prominently featured an animated driver, seen from behind moving the steering wheel, with the road seen through the car's windscreen.

==''Network Q RAC Rally'' (1993)==
{{Main|Network Q RAC Rally (video game)}}

Five years after ''Lombard RAC Rally'', in 1993 Europress released '''[[Network Q RAC Rally (video game)|Network Q RAC Rally]]''' for [[MS-DOS]].

==''Network Q RAC Rally Championship'' (1996)==
{{Main|Network Q RAC Rally Championship (1996)}}

The next game in the series was called '''[[Network Q RAC Rally Championship]]'''. It was released for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Windows]] in 1996. This new version has more tracks, cars, and better graphics.

A 1997 version also came, which included a ''X-Miles add-on'' and some newer features. This version was published by Actualize instead of [[Europress]].

==''International Rally Championship'' (1997)==
{{Main|International Rally Championship}}

'''[[International Rally Championship]]''' came in November 1997, and became available for [[Windows]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. New features arrived, such as Track Editor and playable up to 8 players via [[LAN]].

==''Mobil 1 Rally Championship'' (1999)==
{{Main|Mobil 1 Rally Championship}}

'''[[Mobil 1 Rally Championship]]''' came in December 1999, for [[Windows]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The Windows version of the game has been viewed as one of the most realistic game, due to very high quality graphics for its time, unlike the unsuccessful PlayStation version.

==''Rally Championship Xtreme'' (2001)==
{{Main|Rally Championship Xtreme}}

'''[[Rally Championship Xtreme]]''' came in November 2001 for [[Windows]]. It was not really as successful as its predecessor.

==''Rally Championship'' (2002)==
{{Main|Rally Championship (video game)}}

The sixth game of the series was called '''[[Rally Championship (video game)|Rally Championship]]'''. It was released for [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] in May 2002. It was the last of the series.

'''Shitty Media Men''' was a [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] [[Google Sheets|Google spreadsheet]] created during October 2017 that collected allegations and rumors of [[sexual misconduct]] against approximately 70 men&lt;ref name="Nation12Jan2018"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/what-moira-donegan-did-for-young-women-writers/|title=What Moira Donegan Did for Young Women Writers|last=Rosenfeld|first=Jordana|date=12 January 2018|work=The Nation|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Mass media|media industry]], particularly in New York City. Moira Donegan, a former assistant editor at ''[[The New Republic]]'', initially began the spreadsheet online anonymously.

==Initial creation==

In October 2017, Donegan posted the spreadsheet, which allowed anonymous contributions to supplement existing "[[Whisper network|whisper networks]]" about allegations of sexual harassment and violence in the media industry.&lt;ref name="thecut_20180110"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning that [[BuzzFeed]] intended to publish an article about it, Donegan took it down.

==Reaction in the industry==

On October 16, 2017, alt-right social media personality [[Mike Cernovich]] tweeted that he was willing to pay $10,000 for a copy of the list. Cernovich later said that a source sent him the list but "…was insistent on not accepting anything." On October 21, Cernovich promised to publish the listed names, but after identifying two journalists he consulted his lawyer and held back the rest.&lt;ref name="politico_20171025"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2017—after obtaining a copy of the list—''[[Politico]]'' contacted several publications with writers on the list. ''[[The New York Times]]'' explained that since there had been no internal complaints connected to people on the list, there were no investigations. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's publisher, New York Media, said that in the case of its employees on the list, "We have reviewed whether any type of action is appropriate and have acted accordingly. It is New York Media's policy not to disclose publicly any findings or actions taken as a result of this process so as to preserve the confidential and sensitive nature of these matters." As for BuzzFeed writers on the list, one staffer said the names weren't a total surprise to many, and that the reputations of those men preceded them.&lt;ref name="politico_20171025" /&gt;

The list also contained the names of multiple employees at ''The New Republic'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' who had multiple accusations levied against them as indicated by their entries in the list being highlighted in red. 
As [[Vox (website)|Vox]] pointed out "…none of the men who appear on the Shitty Media Men list, even those who were accused of multiple counts of rape, have faced criminal charges."&lt;ref name="vox_20180111"&gt;{{cite web

==Impact and fallout==

On October 27, 2017, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' terminated the employment of prominent editor [[Leon Wieseltier]], who was among those named in the list, due to allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="theatlantic_20171024"&gt;{{cite web

In November 2017, BuzzFeed began an investigation of employees from their staff named on the list, including its White House correspondent, Adrian Carrasquillo. In December 2017—following a new complaint of inappropriate comments sent to a coworker—Carrasquillo was fired by BuzzFeed for violating their code of conduct.&lt;ref name="businessinsider_20171227"&gt;{{cite web

On December 6, 2017, [[Lorin Stein]], editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]'', resigned amid an internal investigation into his behavior toward female employees and writers. He had informed board members that his name was on the list of anonymous allegations of harassment and misconduct by men in publishing and media. He also resigned as editor at large of [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_20171206"&gt;{{cite news

==Purported ''Harper's'' article==

In January 2018, while the list was still being discussed in the media, it was rumored that ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' planned to publish the name of the list's creator in an article written by [[Katie Roiphe]], which elicited concern of [[doxing]]—and the general safety—of the list's creator. The rumors prompted Moira Donegan to preemptively come forward as the list's creator.&lt;ref name="nytimes_20180110"&gt;{{cite news

{{History of Spain}}

The '''Siege of Burriana''' was one of the battle actions that occurred during the [[Conquest of Valencia]] by [[James I of Aragon]]. [[Burriana]] was an important [[Muslim]] city, being the capital  of [[La Plana, Valencia]].  It was known as the "Green City". The city was besieged for two months, finally falling to the forces of James I in July 1233.

== Context ==
In 1229, the city of [[Valencia]], known to the Muslims as "Balansiya", had fallen to the forces under the command of [[Zayyan ibn Mardanish]], a local leader who was opposed to the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohades]].  In capturing that city, he dethroned [[Zayd Abu Zayd]], who subsequently fled to the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].  [[James I of Aragon]] used this as a [[casus belli]] to intervene in the Muslim civil war on the side of the Almohades, but in reality with the pretext of expanding his own territory.

Two Aragonese knights, [[Hugo de Follalquer]], Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and [[Blas de Aragón]], who had just returned from a period of exile in Valencia, met with Jaime I at [[Alcañiz]]. They recounted stories of the prosperity of the Muslim kingdom and encouraged the king to conquer it in 1233.

== Consequences ==
After taking Burriana, the castles to the north continued to fall into Aragonese hands one by one including; [[Peniscola]], [[Castelló de la Plana]], [[Borriol]], [[Cuevas de Vinromá]] and [[Villafamés]]. Three years later, the decisive [[Battle of the Puig]] sealed the conquest in 1236.

}}
'''The Theatre''' in [[Hunslet]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, England, was a theatre for summer shows, built in 1771 by [[Tate Wilkinson]] and redeveloped in 1867. [[Sarah Siddons|Mrs Siddons]]&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt; and [[Ching Lau Lauro]] appeared here in 1786 and 1834 respectively.&lt;ref name="Playbill 22 Sep 1834" /&gt; It was the only drama theatre in Leeds until 1864, after which business was challenged by competition. It became shabby and was partially rebuilt in 1867 to create the smarter '''Royal Theatre''', which was to burn down in 1875. No theatre was built again on this site, and its surviving [[Victorian era|Victorian]] successors are the [[Leeds City Varieties]] of 1865 and the [[Grand Theatre, Leeds|Grand Theatre]] of 1878.

==Building and location==
The Theatre of 1771 was a fairly basic brick building of {{convert|86|x|40|ft|m}}. It was on the east side of Meadow Lane, Hunslet, Leeds, near [[Leeds Bridge]]. In his ''Memoirs'' of 1790, Tate Wilkinson described it as "quite a palace."&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" &gt;''Leeds Times'' 28 September 1867: "Local news"&lt;/ref&gt; However ''[[The Leeds Guide]]'' of 1806 despaired of it: "Its form inconvenient, and utterly unworthy of the populous and flourishing town to which it belongs." By 1867 it was remembered as a "dingy little theatre" and a "barn out of repair," although it hosted fine plays.&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" /&gt; It had a [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], [[Theater (structure)#Basic elements of a theater structure|gallery]], [[Box (theatre)|boxes]] and pit, and an audience of 600 could be crammed in, but the stage and auditorium were the same size. It was said by the actress [[Dorothea Jordan]] that the [[green room]] "was miserable and cold, half the upper part of it admitting the wind and the rain," although advertisements in the ''[[Leeds Intelligencer]]'' said the stage was "elegantly illuminated by wax candles." The New Theatre Royal and Opera House of 1867 had grander pretensions, having all facilities.&lt;ref name="Leodis" &gt;[http://www.leodis.net/discovery/discovery.asp?pageno=&amp;page=2003218_251720608&amp;topic=2003219_253704250&amp;subsection=2003625_449382961 Leodis, Discovering Leeds: The Theatre] Retrieved 17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Theatre Royal Leeds.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Theatre, 1867–1875. Confusingly the nameboard still says "Theatre Royal".]]

===Theatre or Theatre Royal===
The Theatre was built in 1771 by actor-manager Tate Wilkinson (1739–1803). It was part of his [[Repertory theatre|repertory]] company's York Theatre Circuit which included [[York]], [[Doncaster]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Pontefract]], and [[Wakefield]]. These theatres were built to Wilkinson's order from 1768 to 1803.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Wakefield.htm ArthurLloyd.co.uk: the music hall and theatre history website] Retrieved 19 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There followed various other managers, including his son John. Sometime after 1834 its name was changed to the Theatre Royal, not to be confused with the Royal Theatre which was a later development of the same building. Business was difficult due to the small size of the theatre, its poor condition, its inconvenient location away from the city centre and the heavy industry surrounding the site.&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt;

Encouraged by the new railways which gave opportunity for a [[Northern England|northern]] theatre circuit, the actor John Coleman bought the theatre in 1863. It was successful until 1864, when the new Amphitheatre was built in Lands Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leodis.net/discovery/discovery.asp?pageno=&amp;page=2003218_251720608&amp;topic=2003219_253704250&amp;subsection=2003625_66524685 Leodis: Amphitheatre, Theatre Royal] Retrieved 17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman responded by refurbishing the interior. It was successful, but not enough for Coleman, who attempted and failed to purchase land to build another city-centre theatre.&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradford Observer 29 May 1875" /&gt;

===Royal Theatre===
[[Image:Playbill Royal Theatre Leeds 1868.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Theatre playbill for 1868. Confusingly it is still called the "Theatre Royal".]]
Coleman developed the New Royal Theatre and Opera House (later the Royal Theatre) from the remains of the partly demolished Theatre Royal (previously The Theatre) in 1867.&lt;ref name="Bradford Observer 29 May 1875" /&gt; ''Johnson's New Guide to Leeds'' was happy with this building; it was "replete with every modern appliance, both before and behind the curtain."&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt; It had a simple frontage "of the Italian Style," and the ''Leeds Times'' described it thus:&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[box office|box]] entrance is the central avenue; the foyer is lofty, spacious and well-lighted; the floor is inlaid with [[Tessellation|tesselated tiles]]; there is a large and handsome fireplace, with a radiating hearth-[[stove]] ... and over the magnificent marble [[Fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]] is a large mirror; whilst exquisite statues line the niches on either hand. A large stone staircase leads to the grand tier. The ladies' saloon is a perfect [[boudoir]], for here are ranged round luxurious [[couch|settees]] of [[maple]]wood covered with silk [[velvet]]. Abutting upon the saloon is the lavatory, which is replete with every comfort and convenience requisite for a public place of amusement. Immediately adjacent are the gentlemen's saloons, coffee rooms etc., which are to be fitted up in a very elegant manner. The [[Auditorium|dress circle]] is estimated to seat one hundred, and the [[Auditorium|balcony]] one hundred persons; there are twenty private [[Box (theatre)|boxes]], each of which will accommodate eight visitors, and these are provided with settees of silk velvet with [[Upholstery coil springs|spring]] cushions ... The pit is approached by a long and spacious corridor, and will provide ample accommodation for nearly eleven hundred spectators. The entrance to the [[Auditorium|gallery]] is from the back of the theatre, through Waterloo Street, and in this part of the house, seats have been provided for upwards of eleven hundred people ... The staircases are of stone, and, in the event of an alarm of fire ever taking place, there are several exits, so that the building can be cleared in an inconceivably short time. Every convenience has been provided for the accommodation of the visitors to the pit and gallery, each of which have their separate saloons, coffee-rooms etc.&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" /&gt;

The decorations which are carried out by Mr Andrew Jackson, are of the most artistic and ''[[wikt:recherche|recherche]]'' description, Mr Coleman having been fortunate as to obtain them from designs of the decorations of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The designs in [[terracotta]], and the elaborate [[proscenium]], are from the studio of Mr Walker, of this town. Messrs Singleton and Tennant have provided all the ornamental and other [[ironwork]]; the plumbers' work has been executed by Messrs Lindley and Johnson. Many other contracts have been carried out by other tradesmen in the town, and the whole building has been erected by Messrs Nicholson &amp; Son, under the personal superintendence of the architect Thomas Angelo Moore, (of Thomas Moore &amp; Son, [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]) . . .&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Angelo Moore also designed York circuit of theatres including [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Sunderland.htm People's Palace Theatre, Sunderland], Sunderland Bridge and [http://riba.sirsidynix.net.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=KdanP19ddv/MAIN_CAT/268790018/123 1848 conversion of Monkwearmouth Station into a transport museum]. Also see [https://books.google.com/books/about/Directory_of_British_Architects_1834_191.html?id=GkThQYLb3ZUC&amp;redir_esc=y Directory of British Architects vol.2 L-Z, p.205]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Angelo Moore (1839–1891) Birth cert. Mar 1840, Sunderland XXIV/233; death cert. Dec 1891, 51, Sunderland 10a/426; his obituary is in ''Builder'', vol.120, 1891, p.408&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete as the building is in front, behind the stage it is really wonderful. There are upwards of twenty dressing and retiring rooms, in each of which hot and cold water has been laid on. The stage is simply marvellous. Every square inch of it takes up like the pieces of a child's puzzle. There are [[Trapdoor|traps]], [[Playground slide|slides]], [[Groove (engineering)|slotes]], [[wikt:scruter|scruter]] work, [[fly system|counterweights]] and scores of other complicated arrangements which we do not understand, and cannot therefore attempt to describe. Suffice it that Mr Huby, the clever machinist, who has invented the stage, alleges that he can either draw up or sink down pieces of scenery thirty feet wide and thirty feet high. Hence, in pantomime time, we may expect to see groups of fairies floating about in mid air, descending from the heights above, or ascending from the abyss beneath. To add to effects of this kind, a magnificent gas apparatus has been laid on by Mr Smith, the celebrated gas engineer, from Birmingham, in addition to which an illuminating machine has been obtained in the shape of a new limelight apparatus, by means of which upwards of thirty different colours of lights can be thrown upon the stage at one time. Above the whole of the machinery is the lofty and commodious carpenter's shop. Over the roof of the pit, the large property store-room, and immediately adjacent the painting-room, which is, without exception, the very best we have ever seen; we doubt whether any metropolitan theatre has one equal to it. ''&lt;sub&gt;Leeds Times 28 September 1867&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref name="Leeds Times 28 Sep 1867" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However on 28 May 1875 the Royal Theatre was destroyed by fire, and it was never rebuilt.&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Destruction of the Theatre Royal, Leeds'''

The Theatre Royal, Leeds, the property of J. Coleman, was last night completely destroyed by fire.  Fortunately the performance last night had been concluded, and the large audience had been dispersed scarcely five minutes before the fire was discovered. About twenty minutes to eleven flames were suddenly seen issuing from the high building forming the stage portion of the theatre. An alarm was at once given, and in a short time the fire brigade from the Town Hall and the [[History of firefighting#Europe|fire brigades]] connected with the insurance offices were on the spot.

Meanwhile the flames had burst forth in the most alarming manner, threatening destruction not only to the theatre itself, but to the thickly clustered dwelling-houses in the adjoining [[Cul-de-sac|courts]]. The [[Fire hose|hose]] connected with the theatre had been brought into use immediately on the fire being discovered, but those using it were soon compelled to retreat to the outside of the building. Burning [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] and timber rained down upon the stage, and soon filled the spacious auditorium with suffocating fumes. Some minutes before the arrival of any of the brigades, the flames, bursting through the roof, shot in terrible grandeur into the sky. The [[Pub|public-houses]] and other places of resort were just at this time closing, and in a few minutes [[Briggate, Leeds|Briggate]], [[Leeds Bridge]], and the narrow streets converging upon Hunslet Lane, in the vicinity of the theatre, were crowded with many thousands of spectators. It was obvious from the first that the entire structure was doomed. Showers of sparks falling upon the roof of the auditorium soon set fire to this portion of the premises. Slight as the wind was, it was sufficient to fan the flames, travelling in the direction of the principal entrance in Hunslet Lane. Within an hour from the discovery of the first outbreak the entire building was one mass of flame.

Seeing the utter hopelessness of attempting to save anything within the theatre itself (some loose properties in the front hall appeared to be all that was recovered) Mr Henderson, the [[chief constable]], and Mr Baker, the superintendent of the Corporation Fire Brigade, wisely concentrated their efforts upon protecting the neighbouring property. By twelve o'clock the flames seemed to have exhausted all that was really in the theatre. The damage, at a rough estimate by Mr Coleman, the [[wikt:lessee|lessee]], is said to amount to between £30,000 and £35,000. This is partially covered by insurance spread over a number of offices. Seven or eight years ago the theatre, which was originally opened in 1771, was partially rebuilt, considerably enlarged, and generally improved. The scenery, [[Stage clothes|dresses]], and [[Theatrical property|property]] are described as having been exceedingly valuable. All are destroyed. In addition to the scenery and dresses required in the representation of ''[[The Two Orphans (play)|The Two Orphans]]'',&lt;ref&gt;based on the 1872 French play ''Les Deux Orphelines'', by Adolphe D'Ennery and Eugene Cormon&lt;/ref&gt; there was an accumulation of the most valuable scenery, which had been painted as the requirements of different seasons called for it by the most eminent [[Scenic painting|scenic artists]]. These it will be impossible to replace.

As to the origin of the fire, the accounts of some of those who were in the building at the time when the flames were first discovered seem to point to the property room. The fire originated in the neighbourhood of the ''[[Fly system|flys]]'' or immediately above them, all concur in stating; and also that the first intimation of the fire was the falling onto the stage of portions of scenery, the upper parts of which were in flames. The actors and actresses and others who were engaged at the theatre lose the whole of their properties, which they had left in the building at the conclusion of last night's performance.''&lt;sub&gt;Bradford Observer, 29 May 1875&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref name="Bradford Observer 29 May 1875" &gt;''Bradford Observer'', 29 May 1875: "Fires"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site is now empty except for a bus shelter and trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukstreetmap.info/map-leeds-bridge-end-street.html Streetmap view of top of Meadow Lane near Bridge End]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==
[[Image:Ching Lau Lauro 1834.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ching Lau Lauro]] was top of the bill in 1834.]]
The Theatre was not a full-time theatre. Opening hours were six to seven pm, usually in May to July only, with three or four performances per week. This arrangement filled the gap while London theatres closed in summer, and famous actors could appear here, for example [[Sarah Siddons]] in 1786. [[Comic opera]]s, adapted versions of [[Shakespeare's plays]] and [[pantomime]] were presented here. Often there were two dramas per night with singing or dancing in the interval. After John Coleman took over in 1863, his own company and touring companies were performing here, and he presented new dramas. The management attempted to increase income by letting in the poorer members of the public for half-price during the third [[Act (drama)|act]], but this caused disturbance and complaints.  The New Royal Theatre opened every evening, hosting touring companies and putting on Christmas pantomimes.&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt;

The very first play at The Theatre was ''[[A Word to the Wise]]'' by [[Hugh Kelly (poet)|Hugh Kelly]] on 24 May 1771.&lt;blockquote&gt;On Wednesday last was open'd in this town, the new Theatre, with the Comedy of ''A Word to the Wise'', to a numerous and [[Bourgeoisie|polite]] audience, who express'd the greatest satisfaction at the [[Morality|moral tendency]] of the piece, and the merit of the performers. Mr Wilkinson (proprietor of the new Theatre in this town) has subscribed four [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] annually, to the [[Leeds General Infirmary|General Infirmary]].''&lt;sub&gt;Leeds Intelligencer, 30 July 1771&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;''Leeds Intelligencer'', 30 July 1771: "Leeds July 30"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On June 20th 1817 during the performance of The Tragedy of Jane Shore by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] leading actor Mr Cummins died during the performance. Playing the part of Dumont he fell down on stage and instantly expired of ossification of the heart. The performance was of course terminated at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=21 June 1817|title=Died|url=|journal=Leeds Mercury|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15–19, 22 and 23 September 1834, [[Ching Lau Lauro]] played here.&lt;ref name="Playbill 22 Sep 1834" &gt;Playbill for Theatre, Leeds, Monday 22 September 1834. See [[:File:Ching Lau Lauro 1834.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Playbill for Theatre, Leeds, Tuesday 23 September 1834. See [[:File:Ching Lau Lauro 23 Sep 1834.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Over this period he presented his [[ventriloquism]], a piece called "Seraglio" and some new "Surprising Feats." alongside various plays.&lt;ref&gt;''Leeds Times'', 13 September 1834: "Theatre, Leeds" (promotion)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[melodrama]] version of ''[[It Is Never Too Late to Mend (novel)|It Is Never Too Late to Mend]]'' was presented in February 1865 to great acclaim.&lt;ref name="Leodis" /&gt;

'''Tradex Technologies Inc.''' was a developer of [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based [[B2B e-commerce]] software. It primarily operated in the industries of [[financial services]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[plastic]]s, and [[foodservice]]. It offered a platform for vertical trading hubs, another for large enterprises, and a third for the distributor channel segment. The software used [[JavaBeans]] technology.

At the peak of the [[dot-com bubble]] in March 2000, [[SAP Ariba]] acquired Tradex for 19 million shares of Ariba stock, then worth $5.6 billion.&lt;ref name=completes&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.m2.com/m2/web/story.php/20005B84CD3BD59D1B65802568A200357F59 | title=Ariba completes acquisition of Tradex; Enhances B2B eCommerce platform with addition of industry-leading marketplace solution; extends expertise in delivering B2B eCommerce solutions with addition of over 250 'marketplace specialists | publisher=M2 Communications | date=March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company received 60% of revenue from licensing its software, 30% from support services, and 10% from transaction fees. [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] was the largest customer of the company and [[VerticalNet]] was also a customer.&lt;ref name=enabler/&gt;

==History==
The company was founded by [[Daniel Aegerter]] as an Internet-based system for automating the purchase of computer [[peripheral]]s for [[electronic publishing]], which were distributed by his company, Dynabit.&lt;ref name=enabler&gt;{{cite news | last=Moran | first=Susan | title=The Enabler | url=http://citebm.business.illinois.edu/emba/references/mod7/b2b_tradex.htm | work=[[Business 2.0]] | date=September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At first, in 1996, Tradex offered a wholesale marketplace for computer equipment, with 40 vendors offering 15,000 products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/readings-in-modern-marketing/9789629962401 | title=Readings in Modern Marketing | first=John A. | last=Quelch | publisher=[[The Chinese University Press]] | date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the company had 180 employees and 480 customers.&lt;ref name=expand&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ariba-to-expand-net-market-role-with-tradex/ | title=Ariba to expand Net market role with Tradex | work=[[CNET]] | date=January 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, it received an award from the [[Gartner Group]] and [[InformationWeek]] as the best [[Internet]] [[B2B e-commerce]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=TRADE'ex Announces 100% Pure Java Certification for Distributor &amp; Market Maker | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/TRADE%27ex+Announces+100%25+Pure+Java+Certification+for+Distributor+%26...-a019603062 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=July 23, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenues in 1998 were estimated to be less than $5 million.&lt;ref name=trades/&gt;

By September 1999, the company had raised $28 million from investors including [[Internet Capital Group]], Sigma Partners, Apex Investment Partners, [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]], First Analysis Corporation, Imlay Investments, and [[United Parcel Service]].&lt;ref name=trades/&gt;&lt;ref name=enabler/&gt;

In 1999, it was negotiation a headquarters move to [[Atlanta]]. It also had offices in [[Boston]], [[Dallas]], Tampa, [[San Francisco]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[London]] and [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=trades&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/1999/08/30/story4.html | title=Net firm trades Tampa for Atlanta | first=Caroline | last=Hubbard | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=August 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999, Ariba announced the acquisition of Tradex for stock then valued at $1.86 billion.&lt;ref name=expand/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/12/16/deals/ariba/ | title=Ariba buys Tradex for $1.9B | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=December 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/17/business/fi-44773 | title=Ariba to Buy Tradex for $1.97 Billion | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/containers/fix049/1084755/0000912057-99-010554.txt | title=Ariba FORM 8-K | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=December 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ariba-buys-tradex-for-1-86-billion/ | title=Ariba buys Tradex for $1.86 billion | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=December 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://adage.com/article/btob/ariba-buys-competitor-tradex/248697/ | title=ARIBA BUYS COMPETITOR TRADEX | work=[[Advertising Age]] | date=December 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-12-17/business/9912170358_1_ariba-net-markets-tradex-technologies | title=Ariba, Tradex Deal Joins Internet Commerce Firms | agency=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] | date=December 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, the company reached a reselling agreement with [[JD Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/90254/j_d_edwards_strikes_deal_tradex/ | title=J.D.

On March 8, 2000, at the height of the [[dot com bubble]], Ariba completed the acquisition.&lt;ref name=completes/&gt; Ariba shares had tripled since the announcement of the acquisition 4 months earlier and Tradex was therefore valued at $5.6 billion, making Daniel Aegerter a [[billionaire]] on paper.

'''''Vase de Noces''''' (also known as '''''Wedding Trough''''' and '''''The Pig Fucking Movie''''') a 1974 Belgian [[avant-garde]] [[Art film|art]] [[exploitation film]] directed by [[Thierry Zéno]] and starring Dominique Garny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Wedding Trough|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 April 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film deals openly, and sometimes graphically, with [[zoophilia]]. It features both real and simulated animal killings and [[coprophagia]], and has been labeled obscene by many sources, notably by the OFLC of Australia.&lt;ref name="Refused"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_V.htm|title=Film V|publisher=Refused-Classification.com|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was banned in Australia by the [[Australian Classification Board]] in the mid 1970s with two failed attempts, according to the Australian Classification Board. The film went before the Australian Classification Board on April 1, 1977, and was banned again for the third time. The ban status on the film in Australia has remained largely unchanged since then, due to in part that the film violates Australian [[obscenity]] laws.

==Plot==
The film follows a man, who has an intellectual or mental disorder, living alone on a farm in rural Belgium. He demonstrates bizarre behavior from the beginning, such as fastening doll's heads to pigeons, collecting his feces in glass jars and beheading a hen for his own amusement. He is also obsessed with a [[pig|sow]] who lives on the farm.

We see him gleefully rolling around in the manure with the sow, and then he rapes her, which his behavior suggests he sees as an intimate and mutually agreeable act. Later, the sow gives birth to a litter of piglets. The man attempts to spoon-feed milk to the piglets, but the piglets prefer to drink directly from the milk bowl. In general, the piglets prefer their mother's company, repeatedly scorning the man's advances. Taking this rejection as an unforgivable personal slight, the man hangs the piglets and leaves their bodies strung up in the open. When the sow discovers the remains of the piglets, she runs madly around the farm squealing. The sow slips into a deep patch in the mud and drowns there.

The man searches for the sow, and becomes visibly distraught when he discovers her dead. He drags the body from the mud, buries it on the farm grounds, and crudely attempts to bury himself on a patch of ground nearby. He gets up, and his grief turns to rage. He rushes around the farm scattering and smashing his belongings from the house, including his jars of waste. 

He prepares and vigorously consumes a "tea" made of feces and urine, determinedly climbs a ladder in the barn and hangs himself with a rope. In the final scene is his spirit floating skyward.

==Distribution==
Better known by the English title '''''Wedding Trough''''', the film has never had an official theater release, but has been shown in film festivals around the world, notably at the Perth International Film Festival in 1975, with the screening upsetting Australian censors. 

Because there was no official theatrical, VHS, or until recently DVD release, ''Wedding Trough'' is one of the most obscure movies that is not a [[lost film]]. 

Its last film festival appearance was at the 61st [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in "Tribute to the [[Cinematek|Royal Belgian Cinémathèque]] / Experimental film Competitions of Knokke le Zoute".

German video distributor Camera Obscura&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/forums/showthread.php?t=40946|title=German DVD Release of Vase de Noces}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Swedish distributor Njuta Films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melonfarmers.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/vase-de-nocesdangerous-pictures-of-pigs-in-a-new-swedish-dvd|title=Swedish DVD Release of Vase de Noces}}&lt;/ref&gt; each released the film on DVD.

==Censorship in Australia==
In [[Australia]], the Perth International Film Festival scheduled a screening of ''Vase de Noces'' in 1975. At the time, film festival submissions did not require approval from Australian censors, however the Western Australian government pressured censors to review the film before the screening. The censors did so, and subsequently refused to classify the film on grounds of obscenity. Festival chairman David Roe and director Thierry Zéno appealed to the censors to reconsider. Their appeal was successful, and the film was shown in the festival after all.&lt;ref name="Refused"/&gt; The Western Australian Government was not happy that the festival went ahead with the screening, and this incident created a precedent for animosity between the two groups for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stummfilmfestival.de/2009/film.php?film=2720 Solo für Licht – Vase de noces].&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Western Australian urged the Perth Film Festival to discontinue their plans to screen [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'', threatening that future festivals would be subject to thorough censorial review in advance, if they went ahead with the screening. As a result of this pressure, the Perth Film Festival decided not to screen Oshima's film. Film festivals in Melbourne and Sydney went on to screen ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' without incident.&lt;ref name="Refused"/&gt; On December 17, 1976, ''Vase de Noces'' went before the Australian censors again, and again received a judgment of "refused classification". A third such attempt was made a third time on April 1, 1977. But, the Australian censors rejected the film once again, effectively banning its reproduction and dissemination throughout Australia. This ruling has not been successfully appealed.

The '''World Scrabble Championship''' ('''WSC''') is the most-prestigious title in competitive [[English-language Scrabble]]. It was held every second year after 1991 until 2013 when it began to be held annually. It has been an open event since 2014. Although the official brand name and organizations of the event have changed over recent years, many Scrabble enthusiasts from more than 30 countries compete to become World Scrabble Champion. The reigning World Scrabble Champion is [[Nigel Richards (Scrabble player)|Nigel Richards]], who won his fourth title at the 2018 Mattel World Scrabble Championships by winning the final in London in 2018.

=={{anchor|About the World Scrabble Championship}} Overview==
Sponsorship of the World Scrabble Championship (WSC) formerly alternated between [[Hasbro]] and [[Mattel]], the North American and global owners of the Scrabble trademark, respectively. However, after Hasbro declined to sponsor [[World Scrabble Championship 2005|WSC 2005]], Mattel has organized and sponsored all championships. [[Mind Sports International]] (MSI) began sponsoring the event in 2013 after successfully organizing their own major Scrabble tournament in Prague in 2012. As of 2018, it is now sponsored by Mindsports Academy.

The number of players competing in the tournament has risen steadily over time, from 48 in [[World Scrabble Championship 1991|1991]] to 108 in [[World Scrabble Championship 2009|2009]]. Each country is allocated seats for the championship, and individual countries' national associations determine which of their players represent them. This is typically done by means of a national rating system or qualifier tournaments. A good performance by a national team according to specific criteria will earn further permanent places for that country.

The official dictionary, used in the majority of English-language Scrabble-playing countries and colloquially known as SOWPODS (an anagram of OSPD and OSW), was used until 2007. It is a combination of two dictionaries: OSPD (Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), published in the US, and OSW (Official Scrabble Words), published in the UK. Local tournaments used only their respective dictionary for the tournament, and each contains words chiefly used and spelled in [[American English|US English]] and [[British English|UK English]]. Since 2007, Collins supplies the only dictionary used in the WSC, [[Collins Scrabble Words]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007589166/collins-official-scrabble-words Collins Scrabble Words]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scrabble.org.au"&gt;http://scrabble.org.au/events/15WSC/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scrabbleplayers.org/w/SOWPODS&lt;/ref&gt; which is published in the UK. It was updated on 21&amp;nbsp;May, 2015 before later being approved by the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) for tournaments on 1&amp;nbsp;September.

On May 17, 2013, Mattel announced&lt;ref name="msi2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.mindsportsinternational.com/yaf_postst349_PRESS-RELEASE---SCRABBLE-r--CHAMPIONS-TOURNAMENT-2013.aspx |title=PRESS RELEASE **SCRABBLE® CHAMPIONS TOURNAMENT 2013** - News and Announcements - Mind Sports International Forums |publisher=Forum.mindsportsinternational.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the event would be renamed the Scrabble Champions Tournament, and the tournament would be held annually as part of Mind Sports International's Prague Mind Sports Festival. MSI introduced a 'Last Chance Qualifier' tournament, giving players a last opportunity to qualify for 5 places in the main event if they failed to achieve a place on their national team.

In 2014 the Scrabble Champions Tournament continued in London, but it became an open event, with all players invited to compete.

In 2015 Mattel and MSI agreed to allow WESPA to organize their own traditional unofficial World Championship, branded the WESPA Championship (WESPAC). It was held in Perth, Australia and followed the invitational format of earlier WSCs. 130 players qualified to play.&lt;ref name="scrabble.org.au"/&gt; Wellington Jighere of Nigeria emerged as WESPA Champion after beating Lewis Mackay 4–0 in the final.

In 2016, the tournament was branded as the MSI World Championships&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wespa.org/tournaments/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and was split into two divisions based on players' rankings. MSI also hosted world championships in other languages, including French, German, Spanish and Catalan, alongside the French Duplicate Championship.

The 2017 MSI World Championships were to be held in Doha, Qatar in August 2017, but on 13&amp;nbsp;June it was announced that the tournament was to be relocated to Nottingham, United Kingdom. It was also split into two divisions based on players' rankings. The second WESPA Championships (first held in 2015) were held in Nairobi, Kenya in November and won by Akshay Bhandarkar.

The 2018 event, the Mattel World Scrabble Championships, was organised by Mindsports Academy. The main event was held in Torquay, Devon, but the best-of-5 final was held in London to celebrate the game’s 70th anniversary. The event was won by Nigel Richards.
