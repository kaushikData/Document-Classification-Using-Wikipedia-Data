'''''Agony in the Garden''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1483-1493, and housed in the  [[Uffizi Gallery]],  [[Florence]]. 

==History==
The work was painted for the church of the convent of San Giusto alle mura together with the ''[[Pietà (Pietro Perugino)|Pietà]]'' and a ''[[Crucifixion (Perugino)|Crucifixion]]''. Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] saw them in side altars  of the church of San Giovanni Battista alla Calza, after the original location had been destroyed during the [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|Siege of Florence]] in 1529. It was moved to the Uffizi in the 20th century.

The dating of the work is disputed: it varies from 1482, the year of Perugino's return from Rome, to a slightly later period, although before the end of the century, when the artist started to use only line oil, which in these works is used only at an experimental level.

The painting was restored in 1998.
==Description==

Christ is portrayed in center of the panel above a clear sky, kneeling in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] and receiving by an angel a divine chalice. His figure forms a triangle with the three sleeping apostles at the bottom (from the left, [[John the Apostle|John]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]); the triangle is connected to the painting's sides by the symmetrical line of the hills. Behind Jesus is a lake landscape, a typical element of the Italian painting at the time, with a fortified city and an ancient bridge. 

At the sides, two groups of soldiers, led by [[Judas Iscariot]], are closing to arrest Jesus.

[[File:Ashoka Chakra.svg|right|thumb|200px|Illustration of the [[Ashoka]] Chakra, as depicted on the [[flag of India]].]]
[[File:Jain 24-Tirthankaras.jpg|thumb|The 24 spokes on Ashoka Chakra represent the 24 [[Tirthankaras]]|220px]]
[[File:Indian relief from Amaravati, Guntur. Preserved in Guimet Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|Depiction of a [[chakravartin]], possibly [[Ashoka]], with a 16-spoked wheel (1st century BCE/CE)]]

The '''Ashoka Chakra''' is a depiction of the [[dharmachakra]]; represented with 24 [[spoke]]s. It is so called because it appears on a number of [[edicts of Ashoka]], most prominent among which is the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the [[Flag of India]] (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a [[navy blue]] colour on a white background, replacing the symbol of ''[[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]]'' ([[spinning wheel]]) of the pre-independence versions of the flag.

India's highest peacetime [[Military orders, awards and decorations|military decoration]] awarded for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice away from the battlefield is also called [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]].

== Symbolic history ==
As per one study, 24 spokes of Ashoka chakra represent 24 [[Jain]] [[Tirthankaras]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/emperor-ashoka-jain-a-study-658696
&lt;/ref&gt;
When [[Gautama Buddha]] achieved [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] at [[Bodh Gaya]], he came to [[Sarnath]], on the outskirts of [[Varanasi]]. There, he found his five disciples [[Assaji]], [[Mahānāman|Mahānāma]], [[Kaundinya|Kondañña]], [[Bhaddiya]] and [[Vāṣpa|Vappa]], who had earlier abandoned him. He introduced his first teachings to them, thereby establishing the [[dharmachakra]]. This is the motive taken up by Ashoka and portrayed on top of his pillars.

According to the Puranas of Hinduism, Ashoka Chakra represent the 24 Rishis or Sages who managed the whole power of the Gayatri Mantra. The 24 letters of the Gayatri Mantra depict those 24 Rishis. Those Rishis represent all the Rishis of the Himalayas, of which the first was Maharshi Vishvamitra and the last was Rishi Yajnavalkya, the author of Yājñavalkya Smṛti which is a Hindu text of the Dharmaśāstra tradition.

However, 12 out of the 24 spokes represent the twelve causal links taught by the Buddha and [[paṭicȧcasamuppāda]] (Dependent Origination, Conditional Arising). The first 12 spokes represent 12 stages of suffering. Next 12 spokes represent no cause no effect. So, due to awareness of mind, formation of mental conditioning stops. This process stops the process of birth and death i.e. nibbāna.  The twelve causal links, paired with their corresponding symbols, are:
# [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Avidyā]] ''ignorance''
# [[Saṅkhāra|Sanskāra]] ''conditioning of mind unknowingly''
# [[Vijñāna]] ''consciousness''
# [[Namarupa|Nāmarūpa]] ''name and form'' (constituent elements of mental and physical existence)
# [[Ṣalāyatana]] ''six senses'' (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind)
# [[Sparśa]] ''contact''
# [[Vedanā]] ''sensation''
# [[Taṇhā]] ''thirst''
# [[Upādāna]] ''grasping&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 149;  and, Gombrich (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;''
# [[Bhava]] ''coming to be''
# [[Jāti (Buddhism)|Jāti]] ''being born''
# [[Jarāmaraṇa]] ''old age&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 279, entry for "Jarā," retrieved 19 Nov 2008 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:1721.pali{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} . More than simply "old age," the PED provides the additional meanings of "decay, decrepitude"; and, these additional translations are reflected in the Buddha's reputed words in the Jarā Sutta (below). However, for the sake of semantic conciseness, the compound term jarā-maraṇa is here represented as "old age and death."&lt;/ref&gt; and death&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 524, entry for "Maraṇa," retrieved 19 Nov 2008 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3896.pali{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} . The PED further contextualizes maraṇa with "death, as ending this (visible) existence, physical death...." That is, in Buddhism, maraṇa does not refer to death of the conscious process or the end of the associated suffering.&lt;/ref&gt;'' – ''corpse being carried''.
These 12 in reverse represent a total 24 spokes representing the [[dharma]].

'''Australian regional rivalries''' refers to the rivalries between Australian cities or [[List of regions in Australia|regions]].

==Sydney–Newcastle rivalry==
The oldest Australian regional rivalry dating back to 1804. Some people state that Sydney has traditionally been politically right-winged compared to Newcastle being politically centre-left. However, in actual fact almost all [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Labor premiers]] have come from Sydney suburbs, and the NSW Labor Party has a long and proud history in Sydney. Newcastle's population was traditionally working class whereas Sydney was home to a mix of people including the working class, politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats. The Royal Australian Navy has been based at Sydney since it was founded. Even after more than 200 years, Newcastle's culture is still very independent from Sydney's culture even though they are only approximately 160&amp;nbsp;km apart.

==Sydney–Melbourne rivalry==

[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge night.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Sydney, New South Wales]]
[[File:Melbourne Night Skyline (2013).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Melbourne, Victoria]]
There has been a long-standing rivalry between the cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], the two largest cities in Australia. The rivalry between the cities was the reason that neither Sydney (the oldest and now largest city) nor Melbourne (the largest city at the time) was chosen as the [[capital of Australia]] when the nation was [[Federation of Australia|federated]] in 1901. Because of this disagreement, section 125 of the [[Australian Constitution]] specified that Melbourne would initially serve as the seat of government on a temporary basis, while the permanent capital of the new Commonwealth must be located within the area of New South Wales but at least 100 miles from Sydney. This city became [[Canberra]]. Melbourne operated as the ''[[de facto]]'' capital city from 1901 until 1927, when Canberra's historic [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] was opened, remaining in use until it was replaced with the current [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in 1988. Various Commonwealth governmental bodies continued to operate principally from Sydney or Melbourne after 1927. Most civil service departments were moved to Canberra in the 1950s, and the [[High Court of Australia]] was finally moved from Melbourne to Canberra in 1980.

Rivalry and differences between the colonies was a feature of life in Pre-Federation Australia. There was a real rivalry between the most powerful colonies, [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], on trade matters. Both the two largest colonies believed that the new nation should follow their trade model. New South Wales had a policy of [[free trade]] where all goods coming that came into the state were not tariffed. Victoria had an opposite policy of [[protectionism]] with [[tariff]]s imposed on goods coming into the state from other colonies. This rivalry delayed the process of [[Federation of Australia|federation]]; eventually the two colonies agreed that trade between the colonies would be tariff free, but tariffs would be placed on goods from overseas (excluding the [[British Empire]]).

[[Rugby league]] ([[National Rugby League|NRL]]) in Australia is traditionally based in Sydney, while [[Australian rules football]] ([[Australian Football League|AFL]]) was invented and traditionally based in Melbourne. While both sports have extended their popularity beyond their own state, the historic and spiritual centre of both sports has remained in Sydney and Melbourne respectively, and neither city has been quick to embrace the other city's dominant football code. There is also an increasing rivalry between the city's two [[A-League]] teams, [[Sydney FC]] and [[Melbourne Victory FC]], with matches between the two sides known as "[[The Big Blue (A-League)|The Big Blue]]". Finally, there is also a growing rivalry between the [[ANZ Championship]] netball teams the [[New South Wales Swifts]] (previously [[Sydney Swifts]]) and [[Melbourne Vixens]] (previously [[Melbourne Phoenix]]). Also, there is a rivalry between the Sydney Kings and the Melbourne Tigers in Basketball (NBL).

Sydney, with a population of 4.84 million, is the largest city in Australia, and has been named the world's best city eight consecutive times by [[Condé Nast Traveler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etravelblackboard.com/showarticle.asp?id=98335&amp;nav=13 |title=Australia's Number One Industry Newsletter |publisher=Travel Blackboard |date= |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne is the second largest city in Australia with a population of 4.44 million, is the current and has been named seven consecutive times [[World's most livable cities|world's most liveable city]] by [[Economist Intelligence Unit|''The Economist'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Calla Wahlquist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/16/melbourne-worlds-most-liveable-city-for-seventh-year-running |title=Melbourne 'world's most liveable city' for seventh year running &amp;#124; Australia news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often regarded as the fashion, arts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.org.au/328.0.html The Committee for Melbourne: 9.

While Sydney has been recently overtaken by Melbourne in terms of domestic tourism income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/news/now-sydney-loses-its-tourism-ascendancy/2008/05/16/1211049134065.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Now Sydney loses its tourism ascendancy | date=19 May 2008 | first=Annabel | last=Stafford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney still remains the leading tourism destination for international tourists.

Founded 47 years after Sydney, Melbourne was established by free settlers, and the colony of Victoria never possessed any convict settlements; however, Sydney's original founding was based upon convicts and was the first settlement of the English in Australia. Today Sydney still maintains the most historic settlement site in Australia, called 'The Rocks'. Melbourne transformed rapidly thanks to the [[Victorian gold rush]] in the 1850s, and became Australia's largest and most important city by 1865. This golden age, referred to as 'Marvellous Melbourne', was crushed by the banking collapse and depression of the 1890s, and Sydney overtook Melbourne as the largest Australian city in the early 20th century. Sydney is currently the largest and most populous city in Australia, however Sydney's growth has been curtailed by policies of the New South Wales government, including restrictions on land release for housing. Sydney's infrastructure development is also hampered by its challenging geography. If current trends continue, Melbourne may become the most populous city in Australia sometime in the mid-21st century.

==Queensland and the other eastern states==
[[Queensland]] is distant from the main population and political centres of southern Australia, namely Sydney, Melbourne and [[Canberra]]. At the same time it has long contributed a significant proportion of Australia's most lucrative export commodities, such as coal, beef and sugar. The disparity between Queensland's economic contribution and political influence has long caused tension. The relationship is complicated by the migration since the 1970s of many people from the southern states, who are both welcomed for the economic benefits they bring, and occasionally disparaged as "Mexicans" because they come from "south of the border". This sentiment was epitomised by [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]]'s parochialism and frequent promotion of the idea of [[secession]] of Queensland from Australia during his term as premier.

Queenslanders, especially north of Brisbane, were marginalised by the "[[Brisbane Line]]", a controversial defence proposal allegedly formulated during World War II.  Under the proposal, Australia would concede the northern portion of the Australian continent in the event of an invasion by the Japanese.
People from the southern states sometimes refer to Queensland as "The Deep North", in allusion to the [[Deep South]] of the United States and the socio-political stereotype associated with it. This was notably the case during the 1970s and early 1980s, when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was Premier, and again in the 1990s, when [[One Nation (Australia)|Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party]] from Queensland became a significant force in Australian politics.

===New South Wales–Queensland rivalry===
The rivalry between the states of New South Wales and Queensland goes back over 100 years, stemming from the attitude that New South Wales was the "Mother Colony" while Queensland was viewed as a poorer cousin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020611204840/http://rl1908.com/Origin/States.htm State of Origin History]&lt;/ref&gt;

This rivalry has been played out through sport over the years. In Queensland there has been a general ill-feeling over the number of sports people leaving their home state for New South Wales, particularly [[rugby league]] football players who left to play for the richer Sydney clubs. These players would then play against Queensland in interstate matches. In 1980, as a solution to this problem, the [[State of Origin series]] was created to allow Queensland players to play for their original state, and an immediate stop was put to New South Wales' dominance at the time. This sporting contest played three times a year now exemplifies this rivalry, dominating the media and public attention states during the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=14265 Rugby League News :: League Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005033357/http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=14265 |date=5 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also this rivalry has a political component, with Queensland traditionally tending to state-centered conservatism and populist left politics, while New South Wales traditionally tending to classical-liberal conservatism, modern (small-l) liberal centrism, and social democratic left politics.

==Western Australia and other states==
{{Main|Secessionism in Western Australia}}
Western Australia has the largest land area of any state of Australia, encompassing a third of the continent.  It is the least densely populated and the furthest removed from the [[eastern states of Australia|Eastern States]] centres of population and from the Federal Government's home in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The state has the fourth largest population of the Australian States and Territories with 9.8% of the national total, and about one-third the population of Victoria and New South Wales. Some Western Australian towns are located closer to its South East Asian neighbours to the North than to cities interstate; the capital Perth is closer to Jakarta than to Sydney or Melbourne. At the same time, it has abundant natural resources and primary industries that contribute a significant part of Australia's economy, particularly in the mining sector. As at June 2006 it contributed 11.7% of the [[Gross State Product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/ABS@Archive.nsf/log?openagent&amp;5220001_Annual_Gross_State_Product_All_States.xls&amp;5220.0&amp;Time%20Series%20Spreadsheet&amp;EA12DD28F5551158CA257221001A0D89&amp;0&amp;2005-06%20Reissue&amp;13.11.2006&amp;Latest |title=Australian National Accounts: State Accounts, 2005–06 Reissue |date= |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a belief that too much of the wealth of Western Australia is lost to the federal system and redistributed among the Eastern States. Only 6% of the total goods and services tax (GST) allocations to the states and territories is distributed to Western Australia. Many Western Australians believe they are actually subsidising and paying for the other states, which they derisively call "poor states."

Some Western Australians consider their state to be a "forgotten" [[Cinderella State]]. Often sporting and concert events bypass the state for financial reasons because of its isolation. Western Australians have long complained of being ignored and / or taken advantage of by the other states and the Commonwealth over political and economical issues. In regards to sport, most animosity is directed to Victoria, whose more powerful Victorian Football League evolved into a pseudo-national league rechristened as the [[Australian Football League]] at the detriment to the WAFL and South Australia's SANFL. It was Western Australia who came up with the State of Origin football concept that was so successful in the 1980s and continues to be in the rugby league version.

Western Australia is the most successful cricketing state behind New South Wales yet the state team only debuted in the interstate [[Sheffield Shield]] in 1947, 55 years after the other colonies started. WA was only allowed to enter the competition after agreeing to pay the other states. Ill feeling because of the unfair financial burden was somewhat soothed by WA winning the shield in their first season. Such unfair financial conditions were also put onto the ill-conceived [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] in the [[Australian Rugby League]]. The club was forced to pay for the accommodation and airfares of visiting teams along with their own when they were the greatest travelling club in the league. Though the club performed solidly on the field, financial conditions caused it to fold at the end of 1997. The club's licence and the core of the playing group moved to Melbourne where that [[Melbourne Storm|new club]] won the premiership in its [[1999 Melbourne Storm season|second season]].

Western Australia was the last colony to agree to join the [[Federation of Australia|federation]], participating only after pressure from other states. In fact, the state is not mentioned in the preamble to the ''[[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]]'' (1900) as its support was given too late for the document to be redrafted. On several occasions, [[secession]]ism has been seriously proposed and was even formally pursued in a [[Western Australian secession referendum, 1933|1933 referendum]] which received 68% popular support, but to no effect due to the unwillingness of the British parliament to overturn the legislation enabling the formation of the [[Federation of Australia]].

==Other regions==

===Illawarra and other parts of New South Wales===
The [[Illawarra]] region of New South Wales lies only a short distance south of Sydney; however, the socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds of its citizens has allowed for the development of bitter rivalries between the Illawarra and Sydney, the Illawarra and Newcastle, and the Illawarra and Far South Coast.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The Illawarra vs. Sydney Rivalry is founded in historical, political and, for many, personal aspects. The Illawarra northern suburbs centred on Thirroul and Corrimal have seen drastic development resulting from overpopulation in the Sydney Cumberland Basin with many local residents upset about being encroached upon by the metropolis.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

This same reason was one of the reasons for the 1885 [[Charcoal Creek riots]] (now Unanderra), when 18 homes built by migrants from Sydney were demolished and razed by angry Illawarrian farmers who claimed they were built illegally by "ignorant city siders who don't know our country."&lt;ref&gt;Illawarra Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; The desire of Illawarrians to show differences between themselves and Sydneysiders has shown itself many times. In the early days of the Iraq War, [[Wollongong]] Lord Mayor [[Alex Darling]] led a delegation to the Consul General of France asking them to accept Wollongong's defection to France in protest at Sydney (and Canberra's) stance.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, Wed. 5 March 2003 "Going Gallic"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, when the Commonwealth was looking for a port for Canberra, the Illawarra shires unanimously volunteered to become part of the territory, however the state government in Sydney refused to allow it because it would be too close to Sydney's ports and far too competitive.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Jervis Bay]] was eventually made the site, however territorial separatism is still felt in the region today. Illawarra politicians are often very supportive of new states movements elsewhere in the state, including [[New England (Australia)]], [[Riverina]] and [[Bogong High Plains|Bogong]] states movements, however no current Illawarra new state movement is known to exist.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] vs. Wollongong rivalries exist mainly due to the history of each city, to their similar populations, to both being steel towns, and also to their similar distances from Sydney.

===South Australia–Victoria rivalry===

Much of the rivalry is played out in sport, and primarily Australian rules football. The very first [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|interstate match]] was held between the two states in 1879. "Kick a Vic" became the later South Australian catchcry in [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] football. South Australians became bitter when the AFL canned the State of Origin series, which has increased with the reluctance to allow South Australia to once again compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22827664-23211,00.html |title=Cornes blasts all-star match |publisher=Foxsports.com.au |date=2017-04-28 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are even some South Australians who dispute the Victorian origin of Australian Rules and claim that the game is a South Australian invention, pointing to an earliest recorded football match which was played in South Australia in 1840, nearly two decades before the first rules of the game were written, although historians later argued that this early match was instead the Irish game of [[Caid (sport)|caid]]. Nevertheless, Australian rules in South Australia was the first to form a true governing body and the SANFL remains the oldest league in the game (founded as the SAFA just over two weeks before the [[Victorian Football League|VFA]] in early 1877). Many [[SANFL]] supporters resent the expansion of the VFL to become the [[Australian Football League]], and in particular, the poaching of players from South Australia before the first teams from [[Adelaide]] were admitted into the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.news.com.au/adelaidenow/yourshout/index.php/adelaidenow/comments/is_the_afl_still_the_vfl/ |title=Is the AFL still the VFL ? |access-date=5 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821103834/http://blogs.news.com.au/adelaidenow/yourshout/index.php/adelaidenow/comments/is_the_afl_still_the_vfl/ |archive-date=21 August 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many South Australian supporters also resent the Melbourne-based AFL for not recognising its history and low representation in the official Australian Football Hall of Fame. [[Port Adelaide Football Club]]'s bid to defect to the AFL in 1990 was seen as a major scandal and an act of betrayal by South Australians. Many of the club's supporters resent being forced to drop its jumper design and record number of premierships to change leagues upon its final admission in 1997. 
Another source of this rivalry goes back to how these states were settled. Neither state was formed as a penal colony however South Australia was self-governing (as opposed to a crown-colony). South Australia was a freely settled state that had no settlers when it was first settled. because of this it received many of its settlers from Germany and Austria and German was the de facto second language in South Australia until the First World War. Early Victoria settlers, on the other hand, were almost entirely English or Gaelic speakers from Great Britain and Ireland. As a result of South Australia's early German connection, a feeling of resentment was held towards the state during the First World War, a feeling which still exists, albeit on a much less intense level, today.

There is also a quite intense rivalry in the A-League between [[Adelaide United FC]] and [[Melbourne Victory]].

===North Queensland–Brisbane rivalry===
There is a regional rivalry between [[North Queensland]] and Brisbane (or South East Queensland). This is partially because the distance between them, which is similar to the distance between Brisbane and other state capitals. There has been continuing proposals in the past for a separate North Queensland state. However many people of North Queensland (NQ) would prefer to be independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21915209-3102,00.html Up north they're in revolt] from couriermail.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; Rugby league games between the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] attract large crowds.

===Cairns–Townsville rivalry===
There has been a long-standing rivalry between the North Queensland Cities of [[Cairns]] and [[Townsville]]. This is partly due to the similar size of the two cities, distance and slightly different local cultures. Both cities have sought to be known as the capital of the region, the major population centre and port. Cairns is considered the aviation, agricultural &amp; tourism hub of North Queensland whilst Townsville the administrative, financial and industrial hub.

Each city is home to a national sports team, the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] located in Townsville, and the [[Cairns Taipans]]. Because of the inter-city rivalry it generally takes longer for these teams to win the hearts and minds of potential supporters in the rival city.

===Ballarat–Bendigo rivalry===
The cities of [[Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo]] in Victoria have an ongoing rivalry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vicpolicenews.com.au/more-news/2240-the-challenge-begins-for-bendigo-and-ballarat-.html The challenge begins for Bendigo and Ballarat ]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NINO BUCCI31 Mar 2010, 11:15 a.m. |url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-pips-us-by-1-abs-figures-reveal-population-growth/1791721.aspx |title=Ballarat pips us by 1: ABS figures reveal population growth |publisher=Bendigo Advertiser |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dates back to the [[Victorian Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bendigoweekly.ezyzine.com/ThreadView.aspx?tid=16882{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries the two cities have been of almost identical size in terms of population and commercial importance, as well as claims to being the 'capital' of the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]]. Ballarat has remained slightly ahead in population terms, although growth rates between the two cities have fluctuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcsport.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/01/2204377.htm |title=Bendigo population growth just ahead of Ballarat |publisher=ABC News |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population figure for the [[local government area]] of the [[City of Greater Bendigo]] (which includes sizeable nearby towns) is larger, and therefore often cited by Bendigonians in favour of their city. Bendigo remains the larger financial centre and Bendigonians also claim the warmer climate. Bendigo also claimed superior gold production. Both Ballarat and Bendigo have used their history and architectural heritage as major tourist drawcards and directly vie for the tourist dollar. In tourism Ballarat has traditionally drawn more visitors due to its geographic position and also to the presence of popular Sovereign Hill, a re-creation of 1850's Ballarat town and mines. Ballarat was also the site of the 1854 Eureka rebellion, when armed miners and government troops fought over the miners' demands for fairer tax and license laws. Visitors are also drawn to the attractions related to the rebellion.

The modern Ballarat vs. Bendigo rivalry extends to sport with Australian rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/victoria/2008/04/roosters-rivalr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706123114/http://blogs.abc.net.au/victoria/2008/04/roosters-rivalr.html |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and basketball&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18 Jun 2009, 2:08 p.m. |url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/sport/general/ballarat-v-bendigo-whats-in-a-rivalry/1545071.aspx |title=Ballarat v Bendigo: What's in a rivalry? |publisher=The Courier |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; teams from each town having notable contests drawing interest from the media and spectators.

===Latrobe Valley===
Long standing rivalries between towns and cities in the [[Latrobe Valley]] that make Latrobe City go back to 1880s, particularly between similarly sized [[Morwell, Victoria|Morwell]] and [[Traralgon, Victoria|Traralgon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/news/local/news/general/calls-to-stop-intertown-squabbling-in-the-valley/1867797.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062429/http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/news/local/news/general/calls-to-stop-intertown-squabbling-in-the-valley/1867797.aspx |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent [[Moe, Victoria|Moe]]. Latrobe City is a fairly rare case of an urban area formed incrementally from multiple similarly sized cities without a single central core. Both Morwell and Traralgon continue to claim the civic centre and most dominant in the region and the municipality [[City of Latrobe]] was partly formed to settle rivalries between the cities. This rivalry extends to sports, particularly local Australian rules football matches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mp3.news.com.au/hwt/cfpdf/West%20Gippsland%20Latrobe%20FL/Morwell%20&amp;%20Traralgon.pdf |format=PDF |title=Morwell |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/19/1058545626433.html |location=Melbourne |work=The Age |title=Topsy-turvy times lead to changing of guard |date=20 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also soccer.

===Tasmania: North vs South===

[[File:Tasmanian beer map.png|thumb|Screenshot of Simon Bags beer map from facebook (public file)]]

The North and South rivalry generally follows the historical division of the state along the 42nd parallel.  This division was formalised between 1804–1812 when the Northern county was known as Cornwall and the Southern county was Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagehighway.com.au/o/attraction/landmarks_and_buildings/42nd_parallel#.U8n-5hbNZSU ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728233231/http://www.heritagehighway.com.au/o/attraction/landmarks_and_buildings/42nd_parallel |date=28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The population of Tasmania is nearly evenly split between the North and the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/N/North-south.htm |title=North-south relations |publisher=Utas.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The North-South rivalry manifests in various ways such as preference of beer; [[Cascade Brewery|Cascade]] in the South vs [[Boag's Brewery|Boags]] in the North,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/australia/tassie-beer-wars/2007/01/04/1167777194951.html |title=Tassie beer wars |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2007-01-04 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which newspaper is more widely read, ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'' in the South vs ''[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]'' in the North. It is a longstanding battle between the two areas, and the mayors of Launceston and Hobart symbolically "buried the hatchet" in 1959 . However, the current mayors dug the hatchets back up in 2012 whilst dressed in full pirate regalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-20/north-south-rivals-unearth-buried-hatchets/4143176 |title=Hatchet job to end north-south rivalry |publisher=ABC News |date=2012-07-20 |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divide has extended to the state's maximum security [[Risdon Prison Complex|Risdon Prison]], where northern and southern inmates are being separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/risdon-inmates-split-by-great-northsouth-divide/story-fnj4f7k1-1227113997552|title=Risdon inmates split by great North-South divide|publisher=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=6 November 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The north-south divide was referenced in an episode of Australian comedy TV series ''[[Utopia (Australian TV series)|Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2578095/stadium-fight-not-in-interests-of-unity/|title=Stadium fight not in interests of unity|publisher=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoonist Christopher Downes makes light of the rivalry in the cartoon ''The Great Divide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheCartoonsOfChristopherDownes/photos/a.484963088220469.130701.484961151553996/1409864709063631/?type=3&amp;theater |title=Today's The Mercury Newspaper cartoon:... - The Cartoons of Christopher Downes |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the newspaper of the Southern division, ''The Mercury''.

Facebook cartographer Simon Bags recently created this map to document the division of beer drinking in Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213974060372521&amp;set=a.2980760564969.156381.1440591422&amp;type=3&amp;theater |title=Simon Bags - fun rainy day activities for map nerds like... |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some controversy exists over the exact boundaries of the red and blue section of this map.

===Hobart: North vs South (of the Flannelette Curtain)===
There is also an intense rivalry between residents of the Greater Hobart area between those living North and South of the "Flannelette Curtain", an imaginary socioeconomic boundary running along Creek Road, [[Moonah, Tasmania|Moonah]]. The Curtain, also known as the Flannel Curtain or the Latte Line by those to the North of it, is so called due to the supposed propensity of [[flannel]]ette shirts North of the border, and is meant to distinguish the [[bogan]] regions of the North from the Southern regions, though even those living South of the Curtain admit the existence of many "bogan enclaves" in the South.
In recent times, the Curtain has been observed to be migrating North.

The story centers on the lives of creatures called Bakugan and the battle brawlers who possess them. It debuted in 2007, and though initially a failure in Japan, the series became popular in the United States and Canada, prompting the creation/order of several follow-up seasons (''New Vestroia'' and ''Gundalian Invaders''), which aired in other countries before Japan. The fourth and final season, ''Mechtanium Surge'', was never broadcast in Japan and instead aired in Canadian and U.S. markets.

{{Main|List of Bakugan Battle Brawlers characters|List of Bakugan}}

=== Season 1: ''Rise of  The Battle Brawlers'' ===
Dan Kuso's life changed one day when random cards fell out of the sky with special powers. He and his friend Shun invented a game called Bakugan with these. Together with his friends Runo, Marucho, Shun, Julie, and Alice, they form the Bakugan Battle Brawlers and its members are accidentally dragged into fighting for the fate of Vestroia (the Bakugan's home dimension).

The season is the story of a dimension called Vestroia which loses its natural balance and merges with the Earth and many other worlds. An evil Bakugan called Naga was tempted to take the power of the Infinity and Silent Cores, which formed the Perfect Core that balanced Vestroia, but absorbed too much negative energy and thus was trapped within the Silent Core and destabilised Vestroia. So Dan and the brawlers decided to bring back balance by meeting new friends and allies in the other worlds, learn more about the origin of the Bakugan; and facing Naga, a rogue bakugan who seeks the mighty Infinity Core so that he could complete the all-powerful Perfect Core and have [[Omnipotence|almighty power]] and absolute control over Earth and Vestroia.

=== Season 2: ''New Vestroia'' ===
The two of the six Battle Brawlers (Dan and Marucho) return to New Vestroia and discover that it has been colonized by an alien race called Vestals, who are unaware that the Bakugan are intelligent beings. Three Vestals: Mira, Ace and Baron, however, encounter Shun, who was an old friend of Dan and Marucho, so he knew the truth about Bakugan and formed the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance. While battling against the evil Vexos, the top Vestal brawlers, who follow the rules of their Prince. The Brawlers destroy each of the three Dimension Controllers that keep the Bakugan in their ball form, liberating New Vestroia. The Resistance part but reunite six months later when they discover that King Zenoheld of Vestal has attacked the Six Ancient Warriors in an attempt to steal the Attribute Energies. The Six Ancient Warriors engage in a 6-on-1 battle with Zenoheld, but are unable to defeat Zenohelds Mechanical Bakugan, Farbros. In desperation, the Ancient Warriors give the Resistance Bakugan their attribute energies to protect them from Zenoheld, who has the Bakugan Termination System, a machine built to wipe out all Bakugan but needs the Attribute Energies to power it. These energies result in the 6 Bakugan evolving. After losing half the energies, the Brawlers decided to attack instead, engaging a temporary alliance with Spectra Phantom, the former leader of the Vexos, along with his sidekick Gus Grav. However, the remaining energies are taken and the Brawlers rush to New Vestroia to evacuate all the Bakugan. Drago, however, refuses to give up and manages to destroy the BT System by absorbing all 6 Attribute Energies and evolves again into Helix Dragonoid. Things quiet down until Spectra resurfaces again to battle Dan and when he loses, he concedes that Dan is number one and joins the Brawlers, returning to his original self, Keith Clay. Keith reveals that Zenoheld is working on a powerful weapon called the Alternative System and helps construct Battle Gear for Drago. Meanwhile, the Vexos begins crumbling from within as both Volt, Lync and Shadow decide to leave, feeling that Zenoheld and his son Hydron have finally gone too far but are quickly disposed of by Prince Hydron. In the final battle, the Brawlers with Gus, who joins as their newest member, manage to destroy the Alternative and the Resistance go their separate ways.

=== Season 3: ''Gundalian Invaders'' ===
After defeating Zenoheld, the Brawlers return to Earth and with the help of newcomer Ren, they set up Bakugan Interspace. However, Ren is not all that he seems to be and reveals that he is a Gundalian in need of help, saying that his planet Gundalia, is under attack by Neathia. Shun is not convinced and discovers, that Ren is lying once Princess Fabia showed and proved Ren's story wrong. The Brawlers agree to help Fabia and head to Neathia to help fight off the Gundalians. Meanwhile, Ren begins showing signs of distrust for Barodius (Gundalia's Tyrannical Emperor) and eventually defects to rejoin the Brawlers. Unfortunately, Jake is captured by Kazarina (Gundalia's leading Bakugan biologist) and brainwashed, so the Brawlers head to Gundalia to rescue him along with Ren's imprisoned teammates(who were imprisoned for failure), joined by Nurzak (a former advisor to Barodious, who turned against him when he saw he would lead Gundalia to ruin) and Mason Brown(a teammate who had escaped imprisonment, who have also sided with Neathia. Once they do, the Twelve Orders mount a final attack on Neathia. The Brawlers rush back in time to defend the planet while Dan and Barodius engage in their final battle. Ren and Mason's teammates Jesse Glenn, Lena Isis and Zenet Surrow are freed from their brainwashed state after Kazarina's demise. Linehalt uses his Forbidden Powers to restore the war torn Neathia, while Barodius and Dharak are destroyed by an overload of vast energy and power from the Sacred Orb (which they tried to take anyway, despite Dan and Drago defeating them), which grants Drago new strength and abilities and evolves into Titanium Dragonoid and granting him the status of ruler over ''all'' Bakugan.

=== Season 4: ''Mechtanium Surge'' ===
==== Part 1 ====
The Brawlers' reign as number one in Bakugan Interspace is ended by two new powerful teams: Team Anubias and Team Sellon. To make matters worse, Dan and Drago continuously suffer from visions sent to them by Mag Mel and Razenoid. These cause them to lose fans rapidly when Drago loses control in battle several times, threatening the lives of all the children in Interspace. Shun and Marucho find themselves unable to help as Dan is keeping everything to himself. When Dan loses control once again and nearly kills Anubias in battle, all of Dan's fans abandon him and he leaves for New Vestroia to train. Shun, meanwhile, takes the reins of leader of the Battle Brawlers and charges himself with the task of returning the Brawlers to their former glory. He becomes more and more uncaring and brushes off all opinions but his own while Marucho tries to help him be a better leader. Paige and Rafe show up to learn from them, but find them in disarray. Meanwhile, Dan and Drago fix their problem and prepare to come back. Eventually, Dan controls Drago's powers as Marucho and Shun reunite and join up with Paige and Rafe. When the Chaos Bakugan start destroying Interspace, Spectra appears out of nowhere to help the Brawlers out and destroys many of the Chaos Bakugan. Afterwards, Dan returns, but is out of sync and accidentally defeats his fellow brawlers with Zenthon. He tells them later about Mag Mel (Spectra left beforehand, disappointed in Dan having changed). Shun walks out and dismisses Taylean's words. Dan later has a vision (which is true) about Gundalia being attacked by Mag Mel (who is now free). Dan arrives and tells them about Gundalia, which Paige confirms unexpectedly. The Brawlers dismiss Dan and don't let him go, but Dan says somewhat angrily that he's not asking; he's telling them that he is an original brawler and isn't gonna be cut from this fight. They let him come along and save Ren's home world.

Then they face Mag Mel and discover Interspace being destroyed, so they go back to Earth to save it but they are trapped and must figure a way to save the gate, the key, the battlers and Interspace. Just then, Anubias and Sellon reveal themselves as artificial life forms created by Mag Mel to assure his resurrection and succeeded in taking Dan's Key. In a new battle, Dan finds out that Mag Mel is actually Barodius, who survived his last encounter on Neathia after being transported to the dark reversed dimension created by Code Eve. He later plans to destroy Earth, Gundalia, Neathia, Vestal and New Vestroia by sending every civilization to the dark reversed dimension. Dan and Drago have a final brawl against Mag Mel and Razenoid with Drago evolving one more time into the legendary Fusion Dragonoid. They manage to win, but before "disappearing", Mag Mel says that his final demise will cause another disaster to befall on Dan and Drago.

==== Part 2 ====
A few months later, Bakugan City is shown to have a peaceful start as humans have now communed with the Bakugan from New Vestroia. Not all is well when 4 Mechtogan led by Coredegon, who have broken free from their bakugan, start terrorizing the place. Not only that, but some new enemy called Wiseman has appeared with ancient Bakugan called the Nonets. At the beginning, The Brawlers get confused because Wiseman somehow had the appearance of Gunz Lazar, the new Haos Brawler who disappeared after the four Mechtogan attacked Bakugan City. But it was later revealed that Wiseman was actually Coredegon in disguise while the real Gunz was put in a coma so his negative energy was absorbed. After Coredegon alongside his pals (in his combined form as a Mechtogan Destroyer) sent the Brawlers to the Doom Dimension, he completely destroyed the Earth and New Vestroia. With Gunz back to his normal state, Dan and the others travel through time in order to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from killing every human and Bakugan. In the final battle, Dragonoid Destroyer, who is Drago's last Mechtogan, acquires an infinite power that comes from the bond between Bakugan and humans all over the world, which gave them a chance to defeat the Nonet Mechtogan and send them back between dimensions. Dan's friends throw him a party, but soon discover Dan is missing. Shun sees Dan and Drago sailing off using a boat borrowed from Kato. Dan says that another adventure is waiting for him and Drago, and that he had enough time in the spotlight, such that he wants to let other Brawlers to rise to his rank.

A strategic game called ''Bakugan'' was developed by [[Sega|Sega Toys]] and [[Spin Master]] and released in conjunction with the anime series, albeit beginning a year before the anime even started (2006). The game uses spherical, spring-loaded miniature figures, representing the Bakugan, which pop open when rolled onto special metal Gate cards. The objective of the game is to capture three Gate cards. 

====Attributes====
There are a total of 6 attributes: '''Pyrus''' (Fire), '''Aquos''' (Water) and '''Haos''' (Light) make the '''power triangle'''. Opposite them, the trio of '''Darkus''' (Darkness)
, '''Ventus''' (Wind) and '''Subterra''' (Earth) make the '''triangle of power'''. Battle gear and Bakunano come in gold, silver, and copper.

====Power Sources====
There is the Infinity Core, Silent Core, The Sacred Orb, The Attribute Energies, The Code Of Eve and others. They are power sources. They contain enough power in them to bring life to anything in the Bakugan world. They contain light and darkness to keep the world balanced.

=====Special Treatment=====
Special Treatment Bakugan exist, such as Clear, Dual Attribute, Pearl, Translucent, and White. In the game, most Special Treatment Bakugan have multiple attributes or can take on the attribute of an opposing Bakugan under certain circumstances. Note that special effects are NOT attributes except for Clear and White.

==== Reception ====
Bakugan marbles have been one of the top rated toys for children, winning awards and selling thousands of marbles a year.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The original series 1 and 2 (B1 Bakugan) were smaller, and all Bakugan after series 3 called Bakupearl (B2 Bakugan) are larger and the current size.

According to IGN, it was one of the leading kids games for the Nintendo DS in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/105/1054985p1.html |title=Activision's Bakugan Battle Brawlers One of the Leading Kids Games for 2009 Holiday - Nintendo DS News at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toy Industry Association]] gave Bakugan Battle Brawlers the 2009 [[American International Toy Fair|Property of the Year]] award, recognizing the property that has had the greatest success spreading its brand throughout the industry that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyassociation.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TOTY_Awards |title=TIA TOTY Awards |accessdate=2009-03-28 |date=2009-03-28 |publisher=[[Toy Industry Association|Toy Industry Association, Inc.]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224171857/http://www.toyassociation.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TOTY_Awards| archivedate= 24 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The card game is played with a deck of 56 cards, consisting of 5 each of ranks 1-10, plus six additional cards which have special abilities in addition to a rank.  There is no suit distinction.  Although it's conceptually a trick-taking game, the player who wins the trick only saves one card on his score pile, discarding the rest; this allows for special cases where there is no single winner.  At the beginning of each hand, each player rolls one die to determine the target number of captures.  At the end of the hand, that player accumulates a penalty score equal to the difference between the target number and the actual number captured.  The game lasts until some player has scored ten points, and the lowest score is the winner.

The interviewer's voice is heard only faintly in the background of these recordings.  The sessions were conducted as [[Sociolinguistic]]s interviews, and are essentially monologues. The speech has been orthographically transcribed and phonetically labeled. The audio and text files, together with time-aligned phonetic labels, are stored in a format for use with speech analysis software (Xwaves and Wavesurfer). Software for searching the transcription files is also available at the project web site. The corpus is available to researchers in [[academia|academics]] and [[industry]].

The project was funded by the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] and the Office of Research at Ohio State University.

'''Chattel house''' is a [[Barbadian English|Barbadian]] [[word]] for a small moveable wooden [[house]] that [[working class]] people would occupy. The term goes back to the [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] days when the home owners would buy houses designed to move from one [[property]] to another. The word "[[Personal property|chattel]]" means movable [[property]] so the name was appropriate.&lt;ref name="A-Z Barbados History"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrington |first1=Sean |authorlink1= |last2=Fraser |first2=Henry |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |trans-title=|url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2003 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean, |location=  |isbn=0-333-92068-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=43 |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Chattle House |chapterurl= |quote=After [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]], the slaves were still landless, since most of the land was still owned by the plantations. Through the Located Labours Act of 1840 former slaves were allowed to build their humble homes on marginally productive plantation lands, at 'peppercorn' rent, but the plantation owners reserved the right to evict tenants from these tenantries at short notice. Houses therefore had to be 'chattel', which means 'movable possession', and for this reason were built of timber, and so constructed that they could be easily dismantled in sections, moved to another spot on an ox-cart (today a truck), and reassembled in a single day, and yet be able to survive this with minimal damage.) |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 April 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Chattel houses are set on [[cement blocks|blocks]] or a [[Foundation (engineering)|groundsill]] rather than being anchored into the ground. In addition, they are built entirely out of wood and assembled without nails. This allowed them to be disassembled (along with the blocks) and moved from place to place. This system was necessary historically because home "owners" typically did not own the land that their house was set on. Instead, their employer often owned the land. In case of a [[landlord]] [[leasehold estate|tenant]] (or employer/employee) dispute, the house could be quickly moved to a new property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbados.org/chattel.htm Chattel Houses in the Barbadian Tourism Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been customary for people in Barbados to build additions onto their chattel houses. As such, the house may look as though different sections are at slightly different heights or in a different pattern due to each part being constructed at different stages.

Modern chattel houses tend to have a greater degree of permanence, as they are often connected to the electricity mains, and may either have a permanent septic tank or be connected to a public sewer system.

As the dimensions changed the style of roofs also changed.  These earlier styles gave way to the four-sided roof called the 'hip'. or the steep two-sided gable'.  Since then many homes have also transitioned to a more 'flat top' roof with a minimal slope.&lt;ref name="A-Z Barbados History" /&gt;

Chattel houses are still in use on several [[Caribbean|West Indian islands]], although they have become much less common in areas still affected by seasonal [[hurricane]]s (Barbados and Trinidad lie outside of the Caribbean hurricane belt).

The '''cloud swing''' (not to be confused with the '''Mexican cloud swing''') is an aerial act that usually combines static and swinging trapeze skills, drops, holds and rebound lifts.

The apparatus itself is a soft rope about 25-30mm thick. It can be made from a single rope, or from a cotton-filled sheath. On its simplest level the cloud swing resembles a [[Spanish web]] in length and width, with each end braided and spliced-lashed with a thimble, forming a loop. Two high-caliber swivels are required to support the weight; the swivels are anchored to a crane bar or a stationary rig, with the swing itself hanging in a "V" shape. Generally, the motion provided to swing the performer is supplied by an assistant pulling on a tether at the bottom of the "V". "Cloud swing" is often performed at lower altitudes relative to "Mexican cloud swing". This is what distinguished "cloud swing" from "Mexican cloud swing".

The cloud swing is a relatively new apparatus, and many of the figures performed on it are borrowed or adapted from static and swinging [[trapeze]].

[[File:SD-006.jpg|thumb|right|261px|Parque Colón 1960 (Christopher Columbus) in [[Santo Domingo]].]]
The '''culture of the [[Dominican Republic]]''' is a diverse mixture of different influences from around the world. The [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican people]] and their customs have origins consisting predominately in a [[European culture|European cultural basis]], with both [[African culture|African]] and native [[Taíno]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Esteva Fabregat}}, Claudio «[http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/QUCE/article/view/QUCE8181120099A/1896 La hispanización del mestizaje cultural en América]» Revista Complutense de Historia de América, [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]. pp. 133 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dominican Republic was the site of the first European [[European colonization of the Americas|settlement]] in the Western Hemisphere, namely [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] founded in 1493. As a result of over five centuries of Spanish presence in the island, the core of Dominican culture is derived from the culture of [[Spain]]. The European inheritances include ancestry, language, traditions, law, the predominant religion and the colonial architectural styles. Soon after the arrival of Europeans, [[Black people|African]] people were imported to the island to serve as slave labor. The fusion of European, native [[Taino]], and African traditions and customs contributed to the development of present-day Dominican culture.

== Language ==
{{Main article|Dominican Spanish}}
Spanish is the predominant language in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The country has a variety of accents most of which derive from the Spanish spoken in the [[Canarian Spanish|Canary Islands]] and western [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusia]] of southern [[Spain]]. The accent spoken in the [[Cibao|Cibao region]] is a mixture of two dialects: that of the 16th- and 17th-century [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists in the Cibao valley, and that of the 18th-century [[Canarian]] settlers. Dominican Spanish also has borrowed vocabularies from the Arawak language. Some common words derived from the [[Taino]] natives include: ''barbecue'', ''canoe'', ''caribbean'', ''hammock'', ''hurricane'', ''iguana'', ''manatee'', ''mangrove'', ''savannah'', and ''tobacco'' among others.

Schools in the [[Dominican Republic]] are based on a Spanish educational model. Both English and French are taught as secondary languages on private and public schools. [[Haitian Creole]] is spoken by the population of Haitian origin. There is a community of about 8,000 speakers of [[Samaná English]] in the Samaná Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly enslaved [[Africans]] who arrived in the nineteenth century. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country's economic ties with the United States motivates other Dominicans to learn English.

The nation has two patroness saints: ''Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia'' (Our Lady Of High Grace) and ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' (Our Lady Of Mercy).

The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of support programs. During the same time, the Protestant [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement began to gain support. Religious tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has been rare.

There has always been religious freedom throughout the entire country. Not until the 1950s were restrictions placed upon churches by Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was even put into place, with his assassination.

During World War II, a group of Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of [[Sosúa]]. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haggerty |first=Richard |title=Dominican Republic – Religion |work=Dominican Republic: A Country Study |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |year= 1989 |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/33.htm |accessdate=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
{{Main article|Music of the Dominican Republic|List of Dominican singers}}
[[File:Juan Luis Guerra.jpg|thumb|220px|Dominican singer/songwriter [[Juan Luis Guerra]] in concert, 2005]]
Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the creation of multiple musical styles and genres but is mostly recognized for ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'', a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like African drums, brass, piano, chorded instruments, and traditionally the accordion, as well as some elements unique to the [[Dominican Republic]], such as the ''[[tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]]'' and ''[[güira]]''. Its [[Syncopation|syncopated beats]] use [[Latin percussion]], [[brass instruments]], bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Chapuseaux and Damiron "Los Reyes del Merengue", Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well-known merengue performers include [[Johnny Ventura]], singer/songwriter [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chichí Peralta]]. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Harvey2006"&gt;{{cite book

The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], Florida and Massachusetts contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.&lt;ref name="Harvey2006"/&gt;{{rp|378}}

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness", or "bitter music", or blues music), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.
[[File:Merengue dancing.jpg|thumb|200px|Dominican Merengue dance.]]
[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found through the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies - usually coinciding with saint's days - as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo Basin|Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies. Palos are related to Dominican folk Catholicism, which includes a pantheon of deities/saints (here termed misterios) much like those found in the African derived syncretic religious traditions of Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, and elsewhere. Palos are usually associated with the lower class, black and mixed populations. They can be seen in different regions of Dominican Republic, but with variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican native [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the famed [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the music's development and popularization, and is also credited for coining the term "Salsa" to denote the genre.

[[Dominican rock]] is also popular among younger and not so younger crowds of the Dominican Republic. Dominican rock is influenced by British and American rock, but also has its own sense of unique style. The rock scene in the Dominican Republic has been very vibrant in recent years, spanning genres of rock such as [[pop rock]], reggae/rock, and [[punk rock|punk]]. There are also several underground Metal concerts occurring occasionally mainly in the cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago, where teenagers and young adults usually not satisfied with the other genres express themselves.

== Cuisine ==
{{Main article|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}

[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|220px|Chicharrón mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]
Dominican Republic cuisine is predominantly made up of a combination of Spanish, indigenous Taíno, and African influences. Many Middle-Eastern dishes have been adopted into Dominican cuisine, such as the "Quipe" that comes from the Lebanese kibbeh. Dominican cuisine resembles that of other countries in Latin America, those of the nearby islands of Puerto Rico and Cuba, most of all, though the dish names differ sometimes.

A traditional breakfast would consist of mangú, sauteed onions, fried eggs, fried salami, fried cheese and sometimes avocado. This is called "Los Tres Golpes" or "The Three Hits". As in Spain, the largest, most important meal of the day is lunch. Its most typical form, nicknamed La Bandera ("The Flag"), consists of rice, red beans and meat (beef, chicken, pork, or fish), sometimes accompanied by a side of salad.

Meals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad).

Other favorite Dominican foods are ''[[chicharrón]]'', ''[[Cassava|yuca]]'', ''[[Tapioca|casabe]]'', ''[[Cuban pastry|pastelitos]]''&lt;!--really?--&gt; ([[empanada]]s), ''[[Sweet potato|batata]]'', [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]],  ''chaca'' (also called ''maiz caqueao/casqueado'', ''maiz con dulce'' and ''maiz con leche''), ''[[chimichurris]]'', ''[[tostones]]''. Some treats Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Rice pudding|arroz con leche]]'' (or ''arroz con dulce''), ''bizcocho dominicano'' (lit. Dominican cake), ''[[habichuelas con dulce]]'', [[flan]], ''[[Snow cone|frío frío]]'' (snow cones), [[dulce de leche]], and ''caña'' ([[sugarcane]]). The beverages Dominicans enjoy include ''[[Morir Soñando]]'', [[rum]], beer, ''[[Mama Juana]]'', ''batida'' (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), ''[[Mauby|mabí]]'', and coffee.

[[File:Albert Pujols4.jpg|thumb|150px|Dominican native and [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Albert Pujols]].]]

Baseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. The country has a baseball league of six teams. The Milwaukee Brewers have a summer league here called the baseball academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lidom.com/equipos.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610172002/http://lidom.com/equipos.htm|archivedate=2008-06-10|title=Liga de Béisbol Profesional de la República Dominicana |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baseball season usually begins during October and ends in January. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second-highest number of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) players. [[Ozzie Virgil, Sr.]] became the first Dominican-born player in the MLB on September 23, 1956. [[Juan Marichal]] is the first Dominican-born player in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseballhall.org/node/1255 |title=Marichal, Juan |work= Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three [[List of largest sports contracts|highest paid]] baseball players of all time [[Alex Rodriguez]], [[Albert Pujols]], and [[Robinson Canó]] are of Dominican descent. Other notable baseball players from the Dominican Republic are: [[Julian Javier]], [[Pedro Martínez]], [[Francisco Liriano]], [[Manny Ramírez]], [[José Bautista]], [[Hanley Ramírez]], [[David Ortiz]], [[Ubaldo Jiménez]], [[José Reyes (shortstop)|José Reyes]], [[Alcides Escobar]], [[Plácido Polanco]] and [[Sammy Sosa]]. [[Felipe Alou]] has also enjoyed success as a manager,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sobreeldiamante.com/dominicana-busca-corona-en-clasico-mundial.html |title=Dominicana busca corona en el clásico mundial |work=Sobre el Diamante |author=Puesan, Antonio |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214549/http://www.sobreeldiamante.com/dominicana-busca-corona-en-clasico-mundial.html |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Omar Minaya]] as a general manager. In 2013, the Dominican team went undefeated en route to winning the [[2013 World Baseball Classic|World Baseball Classic]].

In boxing, the Dominican Republic has produced scores of world-class fighters and several world champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Illustrated History of Boxing |last=Fleischer |first=Nat |author2=Sam Andre |author3=Don Rafael  |pages=324, 362, 428 |publisher=Citadel Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8065-2201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball also enjoys a relatively high level of popularity. [[Al Horford]], [[Felipe López (basketball)|Felipe Lopez]], and [[Francisco García (basketball)|Francisco Garcia]] are among the Dominican-born players currently or formerly in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).

== Architecture ==
[[File:DOMREP-s-dom-panteon-innen.jpg|thumb|right|National pantheon in [[Santo Domingo]].]]

The architecture in the [[Dominican Republic]] represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526 Colonial City of Santo Domingo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&amp;language=S Comisiones Nacionales: UNESCO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.

[[File:USMC, 1922, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic 20 of 26 (6227519514).jpg|thumb|200px|A ''bohío'' near Santo Domingo. Many Dominicans —especially those in rural areas— used to live in ''bohíos'' until well into the mid-20th century, like the native [[Taíno]]s.&lt;ref name=Cordero&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Clío|editor-last=Arthur|editor-first=Víctor|last1=Cordero|first1=Walter|title=El Bohío Dominicano: de lo Real a lo Simbólico|date=January–June 2003|volume=71|issue=165|pages=105, 126–127|url=http://es.calameo.com/books/000530775fb835e19096f|accessdate=15 June 2015|place=Imprenta J.R. vda. García, sucs.|publisher=Academia Dominicana de la Historia|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Taino]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees give buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island’s surroundings.

Lately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now began to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasized luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implemented new styles, while still offering new takes on the old.

[[File:Interior de la Residencia Mastrolilli.jpg|thumb|left|Mastrolilli residence interior by Dominican architect [[Rafael Calventi]].]]
This new style, though diverse, is characterized by simplified, angular corners, and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic’s rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.

== Visual arts ==
[[File:Dario Suro 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Lluvia en el mercado (English: Rain in the Market), 1942 (Museo de Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo).]]

Dominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.

Historically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles. The artists of the times were [[Celeste Woss y Gil]] (1890-1985), [[Jaime Colson]] (1901-1975), [[Yoryi Morel|Yoryi O. Morel]] (1906-1979) and [[Darío Suro]] (1917-1997).

The 1940s represent an important period in Dominican art. President [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] provided asylum for [[Spanish Civil War]] refugees and a group of Europeans (including famous artists) subsequently arrived to the DR. They became an inspiration to young Dominican artists who were given a more international perspective on art. The art school Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes was founded as the first official center for teaching art. The country went through a renaissance heavily inspired by the trends happening in Europe.

Between 1950 and 1970 Dominican art expressed the social and political conditions of the time. A need for a renewal of the image language emerged and as a result paintings were created in non-figurative, abstract, geometric and cubistic styles. The most notable artists included [[Paul Giudicelli]] (1921-1965), [[Clara Ledesma]] (1924-1999), [[Gilberto Hernández Ortega|Gilberto Hernandez Ortega]] (1924-1979), Gaspar Mario Cruz (1925-2006), Luichy M. Richiez (1928-2000), [[Eligio Pichardo]] (1929-1984), Domingo Liz (1931-), Silvano Lora (1934-2003), [[Cándido Bidó]] (1936-2011) and José Ramírez Conde (1940-1987).

During the 1970s and 1980s artists were experimenting again with new styles, forms, concepts and themes. Artists such as Ada Balcácer (1930-), Fernando Peña Defilló (1928-) and Ramón Oviedo (1927-) count as the most influential of the decade.

== Cinema ==
Dominican cinema is an emerging film industry, being one of the first countries in Latin America where the [[Lumière brothers]] first brought the Curiel theater in [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata]] at the beginning of the century in the year 1900, with the industry's beginnings dating back to 1915 in which the first film is produced in Dominican territory. 

The Dominican Film Market is officially the first film market in the history of the Caribbean Region, DFM was created and produced by filmmakers Roddy Pérez and Nurgul Shayakhmetova, executives of Audiovisual Dominicana. In its first edition, DFM had the support of important international brands such as Panasonic, Nikon and Blackmagic Design, as well as the co-sponsorship of the Directorate General of Cinema DGCINE, the Center for Export and Investment of the Dominican Republic CEI-RD and the Ministry of Tourism of the Dominican Republic.

== Fashion ==
[[File: Oscar de la Renta by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|150px|Dominican native, fashion designer and perfume maker [[Oscar de la Renta]].]]
In only seven years, the [[Dominican Republic]]'s [[fashion week]] has become the most important event of its kind in all of the Caribbean and one of the fastest growing fashion events in the entire Latin American fashion world. The country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Diseño de Altos de Chavón, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design.

World famous fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932 and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] and then worked with the house of [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] in Paris. Then by 1963, de la Renta had designs carrying his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcax.com/story/7036793/fashion-oscar-de-la-renta-dominican-republic Fashion: Oscar de la Renta (Dominican Republic)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116205803/http://www.wcax.com/story/7036793/fashion-oscar-de-la-renta-dominican-republic |date=2013-01-16 }} WCAX.com – Retrieved October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica de la Renta"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/764644/Oscar-de-la-Renta Oscar de la Renta]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America where it became very popular. He remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Cristóbal Colón.&lt;ref name="Britannica de la Renta"/&gt;

== Festivals ==
[[File:Cojuelo03.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Traditional cojuelo mask of the Dominican carnaval.]]
[[Carnival]] celebrations are held in the [[Dominican Republic]] each February with parades, street dancing, food festivals, and music. Festivities also take place in the week leading up to [[Easter Sunday]]. Parades, beauty pageants, and different festivals in each town throughout the country fill the week. In June the country celebrates Espíritu Santo to honor the island's [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] heritage with nationwide festivals featuring African music.

Concerts, dance troupes, arts and crafts booths, and chefs also celebrate Dominican heritage with an annual cultural festival in [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]] each June. Fiesta Patria de la Restauración, or Restoration Day, celebrates the Dominican Republic's day of independence from Spain, which occurred in 1863. Nationwide events include parades, music festivals, street festivals, and food festivals.

[[File:Poetas y artistas en el festival Internacional de Poesia Grito de Mujer 2013.jpg|thumb|Grito de Mujer poetry and art festival.]]
Three days each June are set aside for the Latin Music Festival in [[Santo Domingo]]. Both local and international Latin musicians and bands take the stage. During the last week of July and first week of August Santo Domingo hosts some of the world's top [[merengue music|merengue]] bands at the Festival del Merengue. Other events during the two-week-long party include and food festival and an arts and crafts festival.

The [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]] festival takes place in July in both [[Santo Domingo]] and Puerto Plata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Culture and Customs of the Dominican Republic|last = Brown|first = Isabel Zakrzewski|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0-313-30314-2|location = Westport, CT|pages = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week-long bacchanal raises the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;merengue&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the costumes worn by the dancers to an art form. The dancers dance in the street and on open stages and compete for an array of honors that recoqnize originality, fluidity, and beauty of the chorography. Posters that are designed to advertise the festival compete for originality and beauty. The crowds who come to watch the dancing and the parades that take place in the evening also dance.

October's Puerto Plata Festival brings musicians from around the country together to perform live music in a variety of genres. Blues, jazz, folk, salsa, and merengue are the most common. Another musical event takes place in October during Columbus Day Weekend: the Dominican Republic Jazz Festival. Concerts are held in Puerto Plata, Sosua, and Cabarete, and feature some of the country's top jazz musicians and bands.

Other festivals include the Festivales del Santo Cristo de Bayaguana on [[New Years Day]]. Events leading up to Mass include a parade, music, and dance. Each January the Dominican Republic honors [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] with gun salutes in [[Santo Domingo]] and numerous carnivals throughout the country. Duarte is celebrated as the man who gained independence from Haiti for the Dominican Republic. The premier culinary event in all of the Caribbean is Taste SD, which takes place in October of each year.

During the event, hundreds of restaurants, food vendors, chefs, and others on the culinary scene host a series of presentations, tastings, and more. The event stretches out over several days and venues and is known to attract several thousand guests.  The main event, unveiled in 2012, is the Culinary Cup of the Americas in which chefs participate in several cooking and baking events hoping to win the top prize. Another event is the Dominican Republic International Film Festival. During four days each December, independent films, shorts, and documentaries are screened.

'''Day in the life''' (or '''a day in the life''', or '''day in the life of''') is a [[genre]] of [[storytelling]] in which the events occurring in the life of the subject or subjects are those occurring in single day of their life. 

Such storytelling is sometimes used as a form of [[journalism]], where "[a] day-in-the-life story records the activities of someone through a period of time—such as the length of a day. The videojournalist shoots everything in hopes of capturing revealing details".&lt;ref name="Kobre"&gt;Kenneth Kobre, ''Videojournalism: Multimedia Storytelling'' (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre can be used to give the reader or viewer the sense of a typical day in the life of the subject without actually taking a day to present this material:

{{quote|A film such as 'A Day In the Life of...' does, however, demonstrate one very important point. Though the passage of time can itself be the theme of the story, film time is not real time. A day in the life of an animal is presented in thirty or fifty minutes of film time. The film is a compressed, a speeded-up, account of a day. Yet the moving pictures of which the film is composed—the shots themselves—happen in real time. A shot of a ten-second event must last ten seconds. Even when slowed down or speeded up, we perceive the film time as if it were real time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kriwaczek, ''Documentary for the Small Screen'' (2016), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although a day in the life story may present a distinct crisis arising and being dealt with, "some of the writers of these stories feel they are an exploration into the human condition and relationships, that a day in the life of a character, without a Climax and Resolution, is just as valid a storytelling model".&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Lynn Schmidt, ''Story Structure Architect'' (2005), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A "day in the life" story could therefore also be a [[slice of life]] story, depicting the routine events of the life of the subject, although a slice of life story is not necessarily restricted to events occurring in the course of a single day.&lt;ref name="Kobre"/&gt;

"'''Dead Man's Chest'''" (also known as ''Fifteen Men On The Dead Man's Chest'' or ''Derelict'') is a &lt;!--NOTE: see footnote for what is meant by "fictional sea-song"--&gt;fictional&lt;ref&gt;''fictional sea-song'' - in this sense means a sea-song that first appeared in a work of fiction, and not an authentic [[sea song (genre)|sea song]]; however, this does not mean the song was not later sung in real life by real sailors. For a full treatment of the fictional origin of the song, "wholly original with Stevenson", see {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfAS7NMHyeEC |title=Buried Caesars |year=1923 |pages=189–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sea song (genre)|sea song]],&lt;ref&gt;Many sources call "Dead Man's Chest" a [[sea chanty]], however Stevenson himself never called it that, rather the novel says it's a "sea-song" and a "sailor's song". ''Sea-song'' is described in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as "A song such as is sung by sailors." (sea-song, n.; Second edition, 1989). The OED defines ''shanty'' as "A sailor's song, esp. one sung during heavy work." The OED has no entry for ''sailor's song''. Since the terms Stevenson used are oblique, it is a matter of interpretation if Stevenson meant it to be a shanty, or not.&lt;/ref&gt; originally from [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).  It was expanded in a poem, titled "Derelict" by [[Young E. Allison]], published in the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' in 1891. It has since been used in many later works of art in various forms.

==Background==
Stevenson found the name "Dead Man's Chest" among a list of Virgin Island names in a book by [[Charles Kingsley]], possibly in reference to the [[Dead Chest Island, British Virgin Islands|Dead Chest Island]] off Peter Island in the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=hersey&gt;{{cite book |last=Hersey |first=Frank Wilson Cheney |url=https://archive.org/stream/stevensonstreasu00stevrich#page/214/mode/2up |title=Stevenson's Treasure Island |location=Boston |publisher=Ginn |year=1911 |pages=214–215 |quote=…the Dead Man's Chest is the name of one of the Virgin Islands in the West Indies.}}  Note: Hersey incorrectly says Stevenson derived the song from Billy Bones's Fancy, rather Billy Bones's Fancy is derived from Stevensons original chorus in ''Treasure Island''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The relevant quote from ''At Last''&lt;blockquote&gt;the first of those numberless isles which Columbus, so goes the tale, discovered on St. Ursula's day, and named them after the Saint and her eleven thousand mythical virgins.  Unfortunately, English buccaneers have since then given to most of them less poetic names. The Dutchman's Cap, Broken Jerusalem, The Dead Man's Chest, Rum  Island, and so forth, mark a time and a race more prosaic, but still more terrible, though not one whit more wicked and brutal, than the Spanish Conquistadores&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is also a [[Caja de Muertos|Dead Man's Chest Island]] in Puerto Rico, not one of the Virgin Islands but close to them, and with the same name.&lt;/ref&gt; As Stevenson once said, "''Treasure Island'' came out of Kingsley's ''At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies'' (1871); where I got the 'Dead Man's Chest'—that was the seed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10669 |title=At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies |first=Charles |last=Kingsley |authorlink=Charles Kingsley |publisher=[[CreateSpace]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-1481278324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cordingly&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Cordingly |authorlink=David Cordingly |title=Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates |isbn=0-679-42560-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert Louis |last=Stevenson |chapter=To Sidney Colvin. Late May 1884 |title=Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson |url={{Google books|pa7Ewcv49NkC|page=263|plainurl=yes}} |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, Stevenson saw the three words "Dead Man's Chest" in Kingsley's book among a list of names, germinating in Stevenson's mind it was the "seed", which then grew into the novel.

In ''Treasure Island'' Stevenson only wrote the chorus, leaving the remainder of the song unwritten, and to the reader's imagination:

{{poemquote|Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—
...Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of [[rum]]!
Drink and the devil had done for the rest—
...Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!}}

Another lyric in the novel, near its end:

{{poemquote|But one man of her crew alive,
What put to sea with seventy-five.}}

Stevenson does not make clear if this lyric is part of Dead Man's Chest or another fictional song entirely. Regardless, the words of the lyric help advance the storyline.

Other variations of the poem were printed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that [[fakelore|claimed to be folklore]], but in reality were nothing more than new extensions from Stevenson's original.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; One appeared in the Chicago ''Times-Herald'' named "Stevenson's Sailor Song" by an anonymous author, who claimed to hear it being sung on the "wharfs of Chicago"&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; by a group of "old time sailors",&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; who when asked where they learned it, replied 'We never learned it nowhere, we allers knowed it.'&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; The story was meant as a hoax but some took it seriously.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite book |first=Vincent |last=Starrett |authorlink=Vincent Starrett |title=Buried Caesars: Essays in Literary Appreciation |year=1923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qK3kwD46TMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Buried%20Caesars&amp;pg=PA189 |pages=189–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another appeared in print as "Billy Bones's Fancy",&lt;ref name=hersey/&gt; supposedly pieced together from various "fragments",&lt;ref name=hersey/&gt; suggesting an antiquated origin, but in fact it was an adaptation of the ''Times-Herald'' piece.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; As Stevenson's stepson Osbourne once said, "'Fifteen-Men' was wholly original with Stevenson,"&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; and as Stevenson himself said, the book ''At Last'' by Kingsley was "the seed"&lt;ref name=cordingly/&gt; of his invention.

&lt;!--NOTE: Do not turn this paragraph into a bullet list or it will get deleted. Do not add unimportant entries, only major ones. See the talk page.--&gt;
The song has been widely used in the arts for over a century. In 1901 music was added to the lyrics of "Derelict" by [[Henry Waller (composer)|Henry Waller]] for a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] rendition of ''Treasure Island''. In the 1954 film ''Return to Treasure Island'', starring Robert Newton, the song was sung in the opening credits, and instrumentally as the thematic background to the action. In the 1959 television series ''The Adventures of Long John Silver''—again starring Robert Newton—it was, although only in instrumental version, the series' theme song played both at the beginning and the end of each episode. In 1967, writers for the [[Walt Disney]] film company found inspiration in "Derelict" for the sea-song "[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]]", which was played in the "[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]" theme ride at [[Disneyland]]. [[Astrid Lindgren]] expanded Stevenson's couplet differently in the script for the 1969 ''[[Pippi Longstocking (1969 TV series)|Pippi Longstocking]]'' TV series; the two resulting verses were sung to a West Indian sea shanty. [[Alan Moore]] made a play on the song in the 1986 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Watchmen]]''; the chapter is called "One man on fifteen dead men's chests." In 1993, the contemporary "pirate" vocal group, [[The Jolly Rogers]], recorded Mark Stahl's arrangement of Young E. Allison's lyrics, re-released in 1997 on their CD titled "Pirate Gold". A rendition was recorded by the [[steampunk]] band [[Abney Park (band)|Abney Park]] as "The Derelict". In the second ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film, Master Gibbs sang the original version from ''Treasure Island''—a [[fourth wall]] joke, as the film was called ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''.

In German, the song is sometimes known as "17 Mann auf des toten Manns Kiste", so it mentions two more men, or sometimes as "13 Mann", mentioning two fewer, most prominently in [[Michael Ende]]'s [[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver|Jim Knopf]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=DJfOPLqfv3E|title="Jan Fedder - 17 Mann auf des toten Mannes Kiste"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Nz6P-swQ3W0|title="Stalin-17 Mann auf des Totenmannskiste"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, in the Hungarian translation of ''Treasure Island'', the phrase is "seven (men) on a dead man's chest"; apparently these numbers provided the closest effect to the original regarding rhyme and syllables in English.

Many authors have written prequels and sequels to ''Treasure Island''. One such example is [[R. F. Delderfield]]'s ''The Adventures of Ben Gunn'', in which [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben]] tells [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] that the song is a reference to "an island of the Leewards" which "was little more than a long, high rock, shaped like a coffin" which was nicknamed "Dead Man's Chest". In Delderfield's story, the song is about 15 pirates who shipwrecked there who had salvaged many barrels of rum but almost no food, and were "all raving drunk" upon their rescue.

The '''ducat''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|k|ə|t}} was a gold or silver coin used as a [[trade coin]] in Europe from the later Middle Ages until as late as the 20th century. Many types of ducats had various metallic content and purchasing power throughout the period. The gold ducat of Venice gained wide international acceptance, like the medieval Byzantine [[hyperpyron]] and the Florentine [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]], or the modern British [[Pound sterling]] and the [[United States dollar]].&lt;ref&gt;The two concepts of money: implications for the analysis of optimal currency areas, Charles A. E. Goodhart,  European Journal of Political Economy, Vol 14 (1986) page 407&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early ducats==

}}

The word ''ducat'' is from Medieval Latin ''ducalis'' = "relating to a duke (or [[duchy|dukedom]])", and initially meant "duke's coin" or a "duchy's coin".&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=ducat&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of [[scyphate]] [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] coins modelled on Byzantine ''[[Trachy (currency)|trachea]]'' was made by King [[Roger II of Sicily]] as part of the [[Assizes of Ariano]] (1140). It was to be a valid issue for the whole kingdom. The first issue bears the figure of Christ&lt;ref&gt;Byzantine Coins, Philip Grierson, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin inscription ''Sit tibi, Christe, datus, quem tu regis iste ducatus'' (meaning "O Christ, let this duchy, which you rule, be dedicated to you") on the obverse.&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Numismatics, Volumes 50, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; On the reverse, Roger II is depicted in the style of a Byzantine emperor and his eldest son, Duke [[Roger III, Duke of Apulia|Roger III of Apulia]], is depicted in battle dress.&lt;ref&gt;M. F. Hendy, "Michael IV and Harold Hardrada", ''The Numismatic Chronicle'', Seventh Series, Vol. 10 (1970), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The coin took its common name from the [[Duchy of Apulia]], which the younger Roger had been given by his father.

Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] of Venice introduced a silver ducat which was related to the ducats of Roger II.  Later gold ducats of Venice, however, became so important that the name ducat was associated exclusively with them and the silver coins came to be called [[Venetian grosso|grossi]].&lt;ref&gt;Coins In History, John Porteous, pages 84 and 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gold ducat of Venice==

In the 13th century, the Venetians imported goods from the East and sold them at a profit north of the Alps.&lt;ref name=Porteous86&gt;Coins In History, John Porteous, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; They paid for these goods with Byzantine gold coins but when the Byzantine emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]  backed a rebellion called the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in 1282, he debased the [[hyperpyron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Coins of Medieval Europe'', Philip Grierson, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; This was just one more in a series of debasements of the hyperpyron and the [[Great Council of Venice]] responded with its own coin of pure gold in 1284.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantine Coins, P. D. Whiting, page 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Porteous86 /&gt;

Florence and Genoa had introduced gold coins in 1252 and the [[florin]] of Florence had become the standard European gold coin.  Venice modeled the size and weight of their ducat on the florin, with a slight increase in weight due to differences in the two cities′ weight systems.  The Venetian ducat contained 3.545 grams of 99.47% fine gold, the highest purity medieval metallurgy could produce.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Economic History, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold ducat types derive from silver ducat types, which were ultimately Byzantine. The obverse shows the [[Doge of Venice]] kneeling before [[St. Mark]], the patron saint of Venice. Saint Mark holds the gospel, which is his usual attribute, and presents a [[gonfalone]] to the doge.  The legend on the left identifies the saint as S M VENET, i.e. Saint Mark of Venice, and the legend on the right identifies the doge, with his title DVX in the field. On the reverse, Christ stands among a field of stars in an oval frame.  The reverse legend is the same as on Roger II’s ducats.&lt;ref&gt;''Historic Gold Coins of the World'', Burton Hobson, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Succeeding doges of Venice continued striking ducats, changing only their name on the obverse.  During the 15th century, the value of the ducat in terms of silver money was stable at 124 Venetian soldi, i.e. schillings. The term ducat became identified with this amount of silver money as well as the gold coin.  Conflict between England and Spain in 1567, however, increased the price of gold and upset this equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;''Coins in History'', John Porteous, page 174&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the coin was called the ''ducato de zecca'', i.e. ducat of the mint, which was shortened to ''zecchino'' and corrupted to ''[[sequin (coin)|sequin]]''.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; [[Leonardo Loredan]] extended the coinage with a half ducat and subsequent doges added a quarter, and various multiples up to 105 ducats.  All of these coins continued to use the designs and weight standards of the original 1284 ducat. Even after dates became a common feature of western coinage, Venice struck ducats without them until [[Napoleon]] ended the Venetian Republic in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;''Gold Coins of the World'', Robert Friedberg, listings for Italy-Venice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imitations of the ducat of Venice==
When the Roman Senate introduced gold coinage either the florin or the ducat could have provided an advantageous model to imitate{{when|date=May 2018}}, but the Florentines who controlled the Senate’s finances ensured that their city’s coin was not copied.&lt;ref&gt;Coins In History, John Porteous,  106.&lt;/ref&gt;   Instead, the Roman coin showed a senator kneeling before St. Peter on the obverse and Christ amid stars in oval frame on the reverse in direct imitation of the Venetian ducat.  The Popes subsequently changed these designs, but continued to strike ducats of the same weight and size into the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coins of the World, Robert Friedberg, listings for Vatican City-The Roman Senate&lt;/ref&gt;

Most imitations of the Venetian ducat were made in the [[Levant]], where Venice spent more money than it received.  The Knights of Saint John struck ducats with grand master [[Dieudonné de Gozon]], 1346-1353,  kneeling before Saint John on the obverse and an angel seated on the Sepulcher of Christ on the reverse. Subsequent grand masters, however, found it expedient to copy the Venetian types more exactly, first at Rhodes and then on Malta.&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coins of the World, Robert Friedberg, listings for Rhodes and Malta&lt;/ref&gt;  Genoese traders went farther.  They struck ducats at [[Chios]] that could be distinguished from the Venetian originals only by their workmanship.  These debased ducats were problematic for Venice, which valued its money's reputation for purity.  The rarity of ducats that Genoese traders struck at Mytilene, Phocaea, and Pera suggests that Venetians melted those they encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, pages 108 and 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hungarian ducats==
[[File:Hungary 1629 100 Ducats.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] depicted on a 100 Hungarian Ducat (1629)]]
In Western Europe, Venice was an active trader but they sold more than they bought so their coins were less used than the florin.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, pages 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Henckel von Donnersmarck|Henckels]] assassinated [[Amadeus Aba]] in 1311, [[Charles I of Hungary]] began a gold coinage exploiting ores of Aba's ancient gold mines.  His son, [[Louis I of Hungary]] changed the designs by replacing the standing figure of Saint John from the florin with a standing figure of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Saint Ladislaus]] and later changing the lily of Florence to his coat of arms, but he maintained the purity of the gold.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, illustration 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 15th century, a distinction was made between pure gold florins and debased imitations of the florin by calling the pure coins ducats and the debased coins gulden or goldgulden.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, pages 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] recognized this distinction in 1524 when he made ducats of the Venetian standard valid money in the Empire with a value 39% higher than the gulden.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin Atlas, Cribb, Cook and Carradice, page 99&lt;/ref&gt;  His younger brother and eventual successor, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], brought this system to Hungary in 1526, when he inherited its throne. The still-pure gold coins of Hungary were henceforth called ducats.&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coins of the World, Friedberg, section on Hungary-Habsburg Rulers&lt;/ref&gt;  Their purity made the Hungarian ducat acceptable throughout Europe.  Even the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland left records of the ones his king used for gambling.&lt;ref&gt;Coins of Medieval Europe, Philip Grierson, page 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary continued to strike ducats with 3.53133 grams of 98.6% fine gold.  Unlike the unchanging designs of the ducats in Venice, the coat of arms on the reverse of the ducats of Hungary was frequently modified to reflect changed circumstances.  In 1470, [[Matthias Corvinus]] replaced the coat of arms by a Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;Coins of Medieval Europe, Philip Grierson, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hungary struck ducats until 1915, even under Austrian rule.  These were used as trade coins and several of the later dates have been restruck.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Catalog of World Coins, Chester Krause and Clifford Mishler, Trade Coinage section of the listings for Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ducats of the Netherlands==
The [[Dutch Revolt]] gave its seven northern provinces control of their coinage.  The collapse of the government of [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis of Anjou]] in 1583, however, left them without a constitutional ruler to name on those coins.  They fell back on the longstanding regional tradition of imitating well accepted foreign coins. In this case they avoided political complications by copying obsolete coins.  The gold coins [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] issued to the standards of the ducat were widely copied and called ducats.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, pages 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also imitated the Hungarian ducat and those coins had more influence on the subsequent coinage of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  Since the Netherlands became a dominant international trader, the influence of these ducats was global.&lt;ref&gt;A Companion to the Global Renaissance, G. Singh ed., page 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nederland gouden dukaat 1724 VOC scheepswrak Akerendam.jpg|thumb|right|Netherlands, 1724 Gold ducat, Utrecht]]
At first, ducats of Hungarian type struck in the Netherlands had a standing figure on the obverse with the crown and battle axe that St. Ladislaus carried on the Hungarian prototype, but naming him with a different legend.  Like the original, but not contemporary, Hungarian ducats, the reverse had a shield, which now showed the coat of arms of the issuing province.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, page 187 and illustration 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  These types evolved into a standing knight holding a sword and seven arrows representing the seven provinces in the union.  The legend, CONCORDIA RES PARVÆ CRESCUNT, shortened in a variation of ways, says “by concord small things increase”.  It also names —or shows a symbol representing— the province that issued the coin.  The reverse had a tablet inscribed and always shortened in the same way: MOneta ORDInum PROVINciarum FOEDERatorum BELGicarum AD LEGem IMPerii, gold money of the federated provinces of Belgium in accordance with the law of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;Historic Gold Coins of the World, Burton Hobson, page 88 and illustration 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Napoleonic period, the [[Batavian Republic]] and [[Louis Bonaparte]] continued to strike ducats with these designs.  These coins were not issued during the annexation of the Netherlands into the French Empire. Since Napoleon’s defeat, the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] has continued to issue them as trade and bullion coins. The text in the table on the reverse now says MOneta AURea REGni BELGII AD LEGEM IMPERII.&lt;ref&gt;Historic Gold Coins of the World, Burton Hobson, page 187 and illustration 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of the ducat==
[[Image:Österreich - Dukat (vierfach), 1915 (Nachprägung).JPG|thumb|Austrian four ducats, c. 1915 (official restrike)]]
During the 15th century, international traders in Western Europe shifted from the florin to the ducat as their preferred currency.  As rulers reformed their currencies, they most frequently used the ducat as a model.  The Mamluk [[Gold Ashrafi|ashrafi]], the Ottoman altun, and the Castilian ducat are examples.&lt;ref&gt;Global Financial System 1750-2000, Larry Allen, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinage reforms of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|The Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian]] initiated coinage of gold ducats in Austria in 1511.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin Atlas, Cribb, Cook and Carradice, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austria continued to strike ducats until 1915, and has continued to restrike the last of them,&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coins of the World, Robert Friedberg, listings for Austria&lt;/ref&gt; including some four ducat coins illustrated here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coinquest.com/cgi-bin/cq/coins?main_coin=1510 Austria 4 Ducat 1867 to 1915]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, bullion for Spain's American colonies allowed the [[Spanish dollar]] to supersede the ducat as the dominant currency of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;A companion to the Global Renissance, Juotsna G. Singh ed., page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1913, the gold ducat was worth the equivalent of "nine shillings and four pence sterling, or somewhat more than two dollars. The silver ducat is of about half this value."&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://dictionary.x10host.com/?w=ducat | title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary | publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam Co | author=Webster, Noah | year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now some national mints produce batches of ducats made after old patterns as [[bullion]] gold and banks sell these coins to private investors or collectors.

'''Duck tours''' are tours that take place on purpose-built [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] tour buses or military surplus [[DUKW]]s and [[LARC-V]]s. Duck tours are primarily offered as [[tourist attraction]]s in harbor, river and lake cities.

== Origin ==
[[File:WisconsinDellsDucks.jpg|thumb|upright|Original Wisconsin Duck from [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]] ]]

The first "duck tour" company was started in 1946 by Mel Flath and Bob Unger in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]]. Flath's company has changed ownership since, but it is still in operation under the name Original Wisconsin Ducks. His family continues to operate a duck company called the Dells Army Ducks in the Wisconsin Dells Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amusementtoday.com/2015/05/original-wisconsin-ducks-celebrates-70-years-of-operation/ |title=Original Wisconsin Ducks celebrates 70 years of operation |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 8, 2015 |website=Amusement Today |publisher= |accessdate=July 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Duck'.JPG|right|thumb|A Singapore "tour-duck" in water]]The [[Seafair Pirates]] in [[Seattle]] use a DUKW "Moby Duck" modified to look like a Spanish [[Galleon]] as their primary means of amphibious transport.

Windsor Duck Tours operates a new build version of on a DUKW type Amphibious Passenger Vessel (APV) called a Seahorse which looks like the old Wartime DUKW but has many new safety features. There are plans for new tours using the Seahorse APVs both at the Falkirk Wheel and in Glasgow.

Viking Splash Tours in [[Dublin]] operate 6 Dukws in Dublin City using a Viking theme as a basis for the tour encouraging passengers to wear Viking helmets and 'raid' the city by roaring at 'the Celts'.

Almost all have since been repainted and given modern diesel engines, and some have enclosed tops, making them more resemble conventional buses. Others are warm-weather only, open-air vehicles, with an optional canopy.  Most require a bus-type Public Service Vehicle [[license]] and a passenger-use boat license.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In Australia at the [[Rainforestation Nature Park]] at Kuranda in Queensland a fleet of DUKWs are used to take visitors through a typical rain forest environment. The DUKWs travel along a tight twisty track through the forest before entering a small lake where their amphibious capabilities are demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainforest.com.au |title=Rainforestation Nature Park, Kuranda Wildlife Park |publisher=Rainforest.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A heavily modified DUKW called "Normandie" has been in use at the [[Koksijde]] seaside ([[Belgium]]) for a number of decades, as a tourist sea excursion vehicle.

San Francisco's 'Bay Quackers' operated from 2004 until 2011, splashing into San Francisco Bay near AT&amp;T Park in modified DUKWs. They were targeted in a lawsuit by 'Ride the Ducks' for use of the quacker kazoos in a sound mark infringement case, however the lawsuit was later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/us/03quack.html|title=A Quack Sets Off a Legal Squabble in San Francisco|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Liverpool's 'Yellow Duckmarine' tours had 4 DUKWs in 2014, of which one saw service in the [[D-day landings]]. These are no longer operating due to the liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-23009846|title=BBC News – Yellow Duckmarine firm put into administration|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a Duck offering rides at [[Instow]] in [[Devon]]. It was built on [[Jersey]] in 1998 and operated as a ferry taking passengers to [[Elizabeth Castle]] until 2006. The operator in Jersey had three – the other two have gone to [[Krakow]] and [[Berlin]].

{{anchor|London Duck Tours}}London's "London Duck Tours limited" owned 13 vessels prior to 2017, of which some saw action in D-day. They were operating DUKWs in the UK but closed on 18 September 2017.

=== Fatal incidents ===
On May 1, 1999 a DUKW called the Miss Majestic sank in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], killing 13 of the 20 people on board. The [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] listed the cause of the accident as a loose rubber seal near the drive shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dunaway |first1=Jaime |title=In 1999, duck boat sank in Arkansas lake, killing 13 |url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/jul/20/nearly-20-years-ago-duck-boat-sank-hot-springs-lak/ |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Medina |first1=Regina |title=Recalling Arkansas Duck-boat tragedy from 1999, and the NTSB report |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20100723_Recalling_Arkansas_Duck-boat_tragedy_from_1999__and_the_NTSB_report.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Philadelphia Daily News |date=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2002, the ''Lady Duck'', a custom-built vehicle converted from a [[Ford F-350]] [[pickup truck]], sank while on a cruise on the [[Ottawa River]] in [[Ontario, Canada]]. Six passengers, the driver, and the tour guide escaped, but four passengers were trapped under the sunken vehicle's canopy and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bst.gc.ca/en/publications/reflexions/marine/2005/issue_22/marine_issue22_sec1.asp The Lady Duck Marine Reflexions Magazine Issue 22, July 2005]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071109181300/http://www.bst.gc.ca/en/publications/reflexions/marine/2005/issue_22/marine_issue22_sec1.asp |date=2007-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review found problems with regulating such vehicles and defects in the makeshift design and the emergency procedures.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On September 17, 2007, a duck boat operated by Alaska Amphibious Tours in [[Ketchikan]], [[Alaska]] struck and killed a woman walking on the dock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/20/us/ap-us-missouri-boat-accident-duck-boats.html |title=Duck Boats Linked to More Than 40 Deaths Since 1999 - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2010, a regulated and modern [[Ride the Ducks]] amphibious bus (based on the original DUKW design and using an original DUKW chassis), was disabled by an engine fire and later run over by a barge on the [[Delaware River]] in [[Philadelphia]].  The operator of the tug pushing the barge was on his personal [[cell phone]]. Before the accident the Ride The Ducks captain made numerous calls to the tug to get the tug to change course.  Those calls were heard and rebroadcast by other vessels, but there was no response from the operator of the tug.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90038835?NTSB%3A%20Tugboat%20mate%20on%20phone%20during%20fatal%20crash%20with%20duck%20boat{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-three passengers and two crew members were quickly recovered, but two passengers, a 20-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, both part of a tour group from Hungary, were killed. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the tugboat mate's (responsible for driving the tug at the time) inattention to his duties.  The tugboat mate was sentenced to 366 days in federal prison.

On May 8, 2015, a modern Ride the Ducks boat with an original DUKW chassis struck and killed a woman crossing the street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's Chinatown section. Witnesses at the scene say that the woman was distracted by her handheld tablet device and walked into the street against the red light and was struck while in the boat's front center blind spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://6abc.com/news/woman-struck-killed-by-duck-boat-in-philadelphias-chinatown-idd/707319/|title=Woman struck, killed by duck boat in Philadelphia's Chinatown section ID'd|date=2015-05-09|access-date=2018-07-20|website=6abc.com|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the police determined the driver was not at fault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A timeline of deadly duck boat-related accidents |url=https://abc7.com/a-timeline-of-deadly-duck-boat-related-accidents/3793587/ |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=ABC News |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the victim's husband sued the company and the city, saying that the blind spots of the vehicle and the placement of the traffic light contributed to her death.

On April 30, 2016, in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the Penelope Pru, a modern Boston Duck Tours vehicle with an old military jeep chassis based off the original DUKW design struck a [[motor scooter]] as both vehicles were turning right onto Beacon Street adjacent to the [[Boston Common]]. The 29-year-old woman operating the motor scooter was killed, and her male passenger was injured. A post-accident visibility study found that the motor scooter was not visible over the bow of the amphibious vehicle when the two vehicles were very close, but was visible in two convex blind spot mirrors mounted to the bow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR1602.pdf|title=Amphibious Passenger Vehicle DUCK 6 Lane Crossover Collision with Motorcoach

In the [[Elizabethan era]] (1558–1603), there was a wide range of leisure activities entertaining both the nobility and the common classes. Among these leisure activities were [[animal fighting]], [[team sports]], [[individual sports]], [[game]]s, dramatics, [[Renaissance music|music]] and [[the arts]].

==Blood sports==
A variety of pastimes which would now be considered [[blood sports]] were popular. [[Cock fighting]] was a common pastime, and the bets on this game could amount to thousands of pounds, an exorbitant amount of money in those days, and many respectable gentlemen lost all their money this way.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had a [[Cockpit-in-Court|royal cockpit]] built at one of his palaces.

Young boys on Shrove Tuesday would normally bring in their own [[Cockfight|fighting rooster]] and would spend the afternoon at school placing bets on which rooster would win{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. The most famous cock-pit in London was in [[Drury Lane]], and most towns and villages had their own pit. 

There were other common animal sports: [[bear-baiting]], [[bullfighting]], [[dog fighting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-sports.htm|title=Elizabethan Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cock throwing]].
Bowls was also extremely popular in the Elizabethan era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Hunting== 
Various types of hunting were popular with the nobility. The stag, boar, roe, buck, badgers, otters, hares, and foxes were also hunted. Greyhounds and Irish Wolfhounds were common for hunting.

For the upper class, [[Falconry|hawking]] was a popular sport. Much time was spent on training a hawk or falcon, and keeping it in good condition, requiring many pieces of expensive, specialized equipment, making it too expensive for the lower classes.  &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alchin|first1=Linda|title=Elizabethan Hawking|url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-hawking.htm|website=Elizabethan Era|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Elizabeth I was very fond of both hunting and hawking &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Team sports==
Elizabethan style [[football]] was comparable to the present-day sports of [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]. Two teams rushed against each other, trying to get the "ball" in through the goalposts. "Cudgels" was also a popular sport among young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearma.org/essays/wasters.htm|title=wasters and wooden swords}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type of [[stick fighting]], it was a sport effectively training for sword fighting, but using wooden [[waster]]s or simple [[cudgel]]s.

==Individual sports==
Running, jumping, fencing, [[jousting]], [[archery]], and [[skittles (sport)|skittles]] were also practiced, with fishing as the most relaxing and harmless pastime.

Children enjoyed playing [[leap-frog]], blind man's bluff and hide-and-seek, which are enjoyed by many children throughout Britain even today.

==Games==
Elizabethans enjoyed playing cards, with a game called ''triumph'' (modern day [[whist]]) being popular. [[Dice]], [[backgammon]] and [[draughts]] were also played. Men mostly played these games as it was deemed inappropriate for a woman to gamble; however, Queen Elizabeth the first enjoyed playing cards and was an avid gambler.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Music and dance===
Music was greatly enjoyed throughout this era, as seen through quite a few family evenings including musical performances. Children were taught to sing and dance at a very early age and became used to performing in public during such evenings. Keyboard instruments such as [[harpsichord]]s, [[clavichord]]s, [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]]s and [[virginals]] were played. Woodwind instruments like woodys, [[crumhorn]]s, [[flute]]s and stringed instruments such as [[lute]]s and [[rebec]]s were also widely used.

Court dances included the [[Pavane]] and [[Galliard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-dance.htm | title=Elizabethan Dance | publisher=Elizabethan Era | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Allemande|Almain]] and the [[Lavolta]], whilst among popular dances were the [[Branle]], ''The [[Barley-Break]]'' (a setting by [[William Byrd]] is in [[My Ladye Nevells Booke]]), ''Nobody’s Jig'' (of which a version was set by [[Richard Farnaby]]) and the ''Shake-a-Trot''.

===Theatre===
{{main|English Renaissance theatre}}
The plays were an extremely popular pastime, with [[William Shakespeare's]] plays taking the lead in audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} Quite a few theatres were built in and around London at this time including "[[Globe Theatre|The Globe]]", "[[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]]" and "[[Fortune Playhouse|The Fortune]]". Little scenery was used but props were used widely. The props were quite realistic, with innards of pigs being strewn across the stage when a man's body was shown to be cut open.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

'''''Essays in French Literature and Culture''''' is an annual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[University of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanities.uwa.edu.au/home/els |title=European Languages and Studies |publisher=The University of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1964 by James R. Lawler, the Foundation Chair of French Studies at this university. The journal focuses on French Studies, in a broad sense. From its inception, the journal’s main aim has been "to draw attention to broader aspects of French literary culture".&lt;ref&gt;Boak, Denis. "Reminiscences of a past editor" Essays in French Literature and Culture, 2013, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal is currently available in print and online.

==History==
The journal was established in 1964 by James R. Lawler.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Academy of the Humanities. Annual report 2013–14, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1975, the journal's editorship passed on to Denis Boak who, in a commemorative issue celebrating the journal's fiftieth anniversary, argues that ''Essays in French Literature'' was a "free-standing intellectual endeavour" providing "an extra outlet for young scholars to publish".&lt;ref&gt;Boak, Denis. "Reminiscences of a past editor" Essays in French Literature and Culture, 2013, vii.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Andrew Hunwick in 1995. Hélène Jaccomard took over in 2007.&lt;br&gt;A growing interest in cultural studies in the field of French studies led to a widening of the scope of the journal and its renaming in 2008. The new title reflects this wider emphasis on culture.&lt;br&gt;
In the context of the crisis in academic publishing,&lt;ref&gt;Joanie Lavoie and Dominique Bérubé, Crisis in academic publishing, June 19, 2012.https://phys.org/news/2012-06-crisis-academic-publishing.html&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of only two French Studies academic journals in Australia, '''''Essays in French Literature and Culture''''' has shown a remarkable ability to survive thanks to the quality of the articles it stringently selects, and its widening readership which is its only financial means of support.&lt;br&gt;
The journal's importance is acknowledged by the Australian Society of French Studies&lt;ref&gt;ASFS.https://australiansocietyforfrenchstudies.com/2017/10/09/essays-in-french-literature-and-culture-54/&lt;/ref&gt; and Informit database.&lt;ref&gt;Informit.http://search.informit.com.au/browseJournalTitle;res=IELHSS;issn=1835-7040&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
A log-in box appears against black background on a [[screencast|video screen capture]]. In the recording, an unknown [[Silhouette|silhouetted]] user, seen via [[webcam]], clicks through the computer's start-up functions. The user plugs in a [[USB flash drive]], begins the transfer of a video file to the desktop, and opens the [[web browser]], searching for "drop the mike". The user surfs through [[clickbait]] articles delivering news regarding the recent disappearance of controversial vlogger-of-the-macabre, DropTheMike (Matthew Solomon), whose last [[Vlog|vlogs]] chronicle his stay at the Hotel Lennox, a reputably haunted hotel in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The user follows the link to the vlogger's website and watches the last few of his video uploads on the site.

Before his stay, DropTheMike is offered a $250,000 sponsorship from clothing retailer ''Haute Gothic'' if he can gain 50,000 subscribers by Halloween night in two weeks. He recruits three of his friends, Chris (Tim Drier) as director of photography, Danni (Sam Valentine) as Sound/Additional Camera, and Nic (Caitlin Grace) as on-site editor, to help him document a Halloween-special vlog at the Hotel Lennox. After an expository visit with Wallace Fleischer ([[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]]), an author on the subject, Mike, Danni, Nic and Chris drive to the hotel where they attempt to stay for three nights.

DropTheMike shows his subscribers where some of the historically famous deaths took place, and reveals that they will be staying in the same room that 1980's serial killer, David Olmos (Ethan Alexander) lived while committing his murders. DropTheMike also unsuccessfully attempts to break into the hotel basement where just three years earlier Canadian tourist, Meghan Kim's body was found dehydrated and burnt in the hotel's heating system after complaints of a bad smell coming from the vents. There they meet a security guard (Christopher Martin) who happens to be a fan of DropTheMike's and promises to try to steal the basement key from the manager so that Mike can vlog in the boiler room. When DropTheMike asks if he can tell them anything about Meghan Kim's death, he suggests they research the [[Elevator game|Elevator Game]].

DropTheMike researches and plays the [[Elevator game|Elevator Game]], an urban legend that if one enters an elevator alone and goes to different floors in a specific sequence, one can communicate with, or even find themselves in, another dimension. The game was played by Meghan Kim (Sarah Chang) who was photographed by elevator surveillance by pressing the specific sequence of floor buttons of the game backwards before she was found dead. DropTheMike plays the game alone and encounters what seems to be her ghost.

Unsure if the encounter was really her ghost or a plant to make him think that, DropTheMike returns to the hotel room where he shows Danni and Chris the footage. As the friends debate the authenticity of the sighting, a phantom stranger bangs on their doors immediately followed by DropTheMike getting a [[Videotelephony|video chat]] call from his fiancee Jess ([[Kelsey Griswold|Kelsey Paul)]] telling him that she's pregnant.

After a brief celebration of the news, the crew hear what sounds like fingernails digging into the wall from next door, where Nic has been ostracizing herself to edit the vlogs. Chris investigates, finding Nic in a disturbed, self-harmful state. Nic tells him to leave her alone and when he returns to Danni and DropTheMike, the team are haunted by a succession of increasingly hostile entities.

Chris, Danni and Nic leave the hotel one-by-one as their lives become increasingly in danger and by the third day, DropTheMike is left alone at the hotel while still holding onto the hope of finishing the series to procure the final subscriber count required by Haute Gothic. The security guard provides DropTheMike the key to the basement and in a 10-minute-long live recording, DropTheMike descends to the lowest level of the hotel where he finds a laptop watching his [[live broadcast]] in real-time. Mike is pursued by what seem like ghosts in the basement and escapes through the lobby, running into Skid Row where the broadcast feed is cut off.

In one more live broadcast recorded a few days after his stay at the Lennox, DropTheMike announces he will take a sabbatical from filming the vlog to pursue filming a documentary on the [[Homelessness in the United States|homelessness issues in Los Angeles]].  Mid-apology the lights shut off and DropTheMike hears a banging on the door. He follows the sound of Jess screaming at him to "get out". The entities that pursued him in the basement appear at the door, holding a decapitated head in hand. The live feed is again cut short as DropTheMike screams, realizing that the head they are holding belongs to Jess.

The computer user, having reached the conclusion of the DropTheMike video uploads, clicks on a video recommended by the website's casting service. It goes to the website of a teen vlogger who goes by the handle TerribleTyler (David Nesler). In the vlog, TerribleTyler crosses police tape into DropTheMike's house promising his subscribers information on what happened to DropTheMike. The user subscribes to the channel and types in the comment section: "Can't wait to meet you, Tyler :)". The comment's user handle is TheRealDropTheMike.

The computer user logs out as the comment is flooded with likes and reply comments. The user leans into the webcam revealing their identity at which point the screencast and movie end abruptly.

Producers, Antoine Le, [[Todd Klick]], Matthew Brewbaker and Greg Berlant developed the story together basing ''Followed'''s fictional Lennox Hotel on the [[Cecil Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cecil Hotel]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Popcorn Talk|title=Cast &amp; Crew of 'Followed' Interview {{!}} Horror Movie News Ep 40|date=2018-08-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW2Cc8Lpa0E&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; famous for its many instances of [[List of deaths and violence at the Cecil Hotel|death and violence]], including the death of [[Death of Elisa Lam|Elisa Lam]], as well as murders by serial killers [[Jack Unterweger]] and [[Richard Ramirez]]. The producers were also inspired by [[Creepypasta]], and based the main character, DropTheMike, on famous vloggers such as [[Logan Paul]] and [[PewDiePie]], who seemingly use controversy to attract subscribers to their platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/logan-paul-youtube-video-latest-dead-body-suicide-apology-career-over-social-media-stars-money-rich-a8138716.html|title=Who is Logan Paul and what will happen to him now?|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hub.packtpub.com/is-youtubes-ai-algorithm-evil/|title=Is YouTube's AI Algorithm evil? {{!}} Packt Hub|date=2018-09-30|work=Packt Hub|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/27/eight-biggest-youtube-controversies-alfie-deyes-lands-hot-water-7665033/|title=Eight of the biggest YouTube controversies as Alfie Deyes lands in hot water|date=2018-06-27|work=Metro|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
In order to accurately depict realistic personalities needed for a [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] film, the producers auditioned and cast Matthew Solomon as DropTheMike, Caitlin Grace as Nic and Tim Drier as Chris before the script was written. Once these roles were cast, writer, [[Todd Klick]], then used the actors’ specific mannerisms and approach to the characters as a guideline for his script.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Filming ===
''Followed'' was filmed in 12 days on a 144-page script.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two separate hotel locations were used to depict the ''Hotel Lennox'': the Hayward Manor Apartments in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], and the [[Hotel Normandie]] in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Locations also included [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]] where homelessness was used as both a literal and thematic backdrop for the story.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Release ==
''Followed'' had its world premiere on September 7, 2018 at the 2018 [[Burbank International Film Festival]] in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was subsequently selected into the 2018 Hollywood Independent Filmmaker Awards and 2018 Sydney Indie Film Festival where it won Best Horror/Thriller Feature Film at both festivals. Its wide release is expected in 2019.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Reviews from initial critics were overall positive, praising the film for its social commentary on Millennials and social media as well as its unique take on the found-footage genre.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Audiences at initial screenings at festivals responded very positively, particularly regarding the relatable characters and suspenseful final act of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chauncey K.

__NOTOC__
The '''Gadara Aqueduct''', also called Qanat Fir'aun (Pharaoh's Watercourse), was a [[Roman aqueduct]] water supply for some of the [[Decapolis]] Cities. It serviced Adraha (known today as [[Daraa|Dera'a]] in [[Syria]]), [[Abila (Decapolis)]] at Wadi Queilebh in Jordan, and the city of [[Umm Qais|Gadara]] (modern-day Um Qais in [[Jordan]]). The aqueduct has the longest known tunnel of the [[Classical Antiquity|Classical Era]].

There was one section of more than 106&amp;nbsp;km, constructed with [[Qanat]] technology. In this special case, nearly all the shafts were diagonal with 45-60 degrees downwards with stairs to the real water channel inside the mountain. The line went along steep slopes and collected water from sources around the area. The first visitor who rode along the "Kanatir" was [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen|U. J. Seetzen]] in 1805.

There are gradients of 0.3 meters per mile for the underground tunnel section, resulting in a fall of 30 centimeters for each mile of tunnel. The aqueduct starts at a Roman dam in Dilli. From there, this part of the aqueduct line crosses several [[Wadi]]s via 5-10m high bridges. During the last few decades, more the 3 kilometers of the remaining substructions were demolished on the Plains between Dilli and Deraa near the [[Borders of Jordan|Jordanian Border]].

East of Adraha was a 35 meter high bridge. The remains of the bridge now can be found on the ground of the new Al Saad Dam located at the eastern suburbs of Dera'a. After a junction point with a side channel from the [[Muzayrib]] lake, the underground aqueduct begins. Near Gadara (Umm Qais), 3 different water systems have been found. The first and second were built with [[Qanat]] technology and the 3rd&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Döring: "Qanat Fir'un - Documentation of the 100 Kilometres Aqueduct Tunnel in Northern Jordan. Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, Amman/Jordan 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;153–165.&lt;/ref&gt; was built as a channel along a street. It is believed that all 3 systems were used, but each at a different period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dekapolis-aquaedukt.de|title=Qanat Fir'aun / Dekapolis Aquädukt {{!}} Qanat Fir'aun|website=www.dekapolis-aquaedukt.de|language=de|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of underground city==
Beneath the classical city of Adraha was an underground city, and was also part of the aqueduct. The inhabitants of the city collected water by jars on ropes, from the underground channel. Today, however, there is no sign of the "underground city" which was described by Wetzstein in 1860 and [[Gottlieb Schumacher|G.Schumacher]] in 1896.

'''''Here Lies Love''''' is a [[concept album]] and [[rock musical]] made in collaboration between [[David Byrne]] and [[Fatboy Slim]], about the life of the former [[First Lady of the Philippines]] [[Imelda Marcos]] along with the woman who raised her—Estrella Cumpas—and follows Marcos until she and her family were forced to leave the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbyrne.com/here_lies_love/about.php |title=About "Here Lies Love"; Here Lies Love |publisher=David Byrne |date= |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features 22 guest vocalists and was released on 5 April 2010, under [[Nonesuch Records]] and [[Todomundo]] in several formats, including a deluxe double-Compact Disc set with a DVD of music videos from the album and a 120-page book.

The album was adapted as a [[Here Lies Love (musical)|rock musical]] that premiered in 2013 [[off-Broadway]] at [[The Public Theater]] and ran again at the Public in 2014–2015. It also played at the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s Dorfman Theatre in 2014–2015 and the [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clement|first1=Olivia|title=Here Lies Love to Play at Seattle Rep|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/here-lies-love-to-play-seattle-rep|accessdate=15 May 2017|publisher=Playbill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The title of the album is taken from a comment made by Imelda during a visit to her husband [[Ferdinand Marcos]]'s embalmed body. Imelda expressed that she would like the phrase "Here Lies Love" to be inscribed on her tombstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|nti69D0mG74}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Byrne released the following statement regarding this album:

{{Quote|The story I am interested in is about asking what drives a powerful person—what makes them tick? How do they make and then remake themselves? I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if—as this piece would be principally composed of clubby dance music—one could experience it in a club setting? Could one bring a "story" and a kind of theatre to the disco? Was that possible? If so, wouldn't that be amazing!{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}

The studio album features female singers including [[Florence Welch]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Nellie McKay]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Martha Wainwright]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Sia Furler]], [[Santigold]], [[Charmaine Clamor]], [[Nicole Atkins]], [[Sharon Jones (singer)|Sharon Jones]] and [[Kate Pierson]], alternately playing the roles of Imelda Marcos and Estrella Cumpas. "It's a series of 22 very danceable songs…" wrote Byrne, "…and is sung by 20, count 'em, 20, amazing singers. A theater piece for your ears."&lt;ref&gt;email from herelieslove@davidbyrne.com, 06/04/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne described [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s performance as "amazingly fine-tuned" and "very impressive." The only male vocalists are [[Steve Earle]] on "A Perfect Hand", and Byrne himself on "American Troglodyte" and "Seven Years", the latter a duet with [[Shara Worden]] from [[My Brightest Diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/12/14/david-byrne-announces-upcoming-album-with-fatboy-slim/|title=David Byrne Announces Upcoming Album With Fatboy Slim|date=14 December 2009|first=Michael D.|last=Ayers|publisher=Spinner|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first promotional single was "Please Don't", featuring [[Santigold]] on vocals. The single became available on Byrne's website as a free high-quality MP3 download on 19 January 2010.

==Stage adaptation==
{{Main|Here Lies Love (musical)}}

The album was adapted into a stage musical, directed by [[Alex Timbers]], that premiered [[off-Broadway]] at [[The Public Theater]] in New York City in 2013.  It starred [[Ruthie Ann Miles]] in the title role, with [[Jose Llana]] as Ferdinand Marcos and [[Conrad Ricamora]] as Ninoy Aquino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/david-byrne-here-lies-love-premiere-nyc-public-theater-april-2013-2012-04-09 |publisher=[[Nonesuch Records]] |title=David Byrne's "Here Lies Love" to Premiere at NYC's Public Theater in April 2013 |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Howieson’s Poort Shelter''' is a small [[rock shelter]] in [[South Africa]] containing the archaeological site from which the [[Howiesons Poort]] period in the [[Middle Stone Age]] gets its name. This period lasted around 5,000 years, between roughly 65,800 BP and 59,500 BP.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1162219 | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Z | last2 = Roberts | first2 = RG | last3 = Galbraith | first3 = RF | last4 = Deacon | first4 = HJ | last5 = Grün | first5 = R | last6 = Mackay | first6 = A | last7 = Mitchell | first7 = P | last8 = Vogelsang | first8 = R | last9 = Wadley | first9 = L.| year = 2008 | title = Ages for the Middle Stone Age of southern Africa: implications for human behavior and dispersal | url = | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5902| pages = 733–5 | pmid = 18974351  |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This period is important as it, together with the [[Stillbay]] period 7,000 years earlier, provides the first evidence of human symbolism and technological skills that were later to appear in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].

==Naming==
The poort was named after a “Mr Howison” but it was misspelt by Stapleton and [[John Hewitt (herpetologist)|Hewitt]] as Howieson&lt;ref name="Deaconmispelling"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3889060 | last1 = Deacon | first1 = J. | year = 1995 | title = An Unsolved Mystery at the Howieson's Poort | jstor =3889060 | journal = South African Archaeological Bulletin | volume = 50 | issue = 162| pages = 110–120 }} pp. 110-111 “Father P. Stapleton … and Dr John Hewitt… excavated a small rock shelter .. The poort was named after a Mr Howison, but Stapleton and Hewitt (1927) spelled it Howieson in their publication and this spelling has been applied ever since to the stone tool industry that they first described there (Goodwin &amp; Van Riet Lowe 1929).”&lt;/ref&gt; and their error has been used ever since for the stone tool industry named after it.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3889060 | last1 = Deacon | first1 = J. | year = 1995 | title = An Unsolved Mystery at the Howieson's Poort | jstor =3889060 | journal = South African Archaeological Bulletin | volume = 50 | issue = 162| pages = 110–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;Goodwin AJH. van Riet Lowe C. (1929). The Stone Age cultures of South Africa. Annals of the South African Museum, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
Note the site is always spelled with an apostrophe but the period can be spelt variably with and without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minichillo | first1 = T | title = Raw material use and behavioral modernity: Howiesons Poort lithic foraging strategies | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 359–64 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16469361 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rock shelter occurs in a hill on the north side of the Howieson's Poort containing the main road into Grahamstown from [[Port Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;A ''poort'' in [[South African English]] is a mountain pass or gap, usually cut by a stream or river. {{OED|Poort}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cave is halfway up a cliff and is {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide at the mouth, with a large [[Real Yellowwood]] tree growing in the deposit and “bent horizontal with the floor to allow its branches to spread into the open at the mouth of the shelter”.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt;  The original Howiesons Poort period remains were covered very slowly due to the cave’s position halfway up the cliff and to wind clearance. 20,000 years ago, however, a rock fall acted to protect the deposits near the front from wind erosion.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt;

==Excavation==
It was excavated in the late 1920s,&lt;ref name="Stapleton27"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapleton | first1 = P | last2 = Hewitt | first2 = J. | year = 1927 | title = Stone implements from a rock shelter at Howieson's Poort near Grahamstown | url = | journal = S. Afr. J. Sci. | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 574–587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stapleton28"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapleton | first1 = P | last2 = Hewitt | first2 = J | year = 1928 | title = Stone implements from a Howieson's Poort, near Grahamstown | url = | journal = S. Afr. J. Sci. | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 399–409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in 1965 by [[Hilary Deacon|Hilary]] and [[Janette Deacon]].&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt; There are very little ''in situ'' deposits left.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt;

All the artifacts at the Howieson’s Poort site were found below a barren layer about a foot thick in a black layer also about a foot thick.&lt;ref name="Stapleton27"/&gt; The stone tools were mostly large segments or 'crescents', obliquely backed blades and unifacial and bifacial points.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt;   There are no [[rock painting]]s, nor bone or shell artifacts, though bone&lt;ref name="Backwell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Backwell | first1 = L | last2 = Errico | first2 = F | last3 = Wadley | first3 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Middle Stone Age bone tools from the Howiesons Poort layers, Sibudu Cave, South Africa | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 1566–1580 | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2007.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and shell artifacts&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = I | year = 2002 | title = Ochre in the Middle Stone Age of southern Africa: ritualized display or hide preservative? | jstor =3889102 | journal = S. Afr. Archaeol. Bull. | volume = 57 | issue = 175| pages = 64–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   are found in the deposits elsewhere of the Howiesons Poort period.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt;  Stone tools similar to those in the cave have been collected from hillsides above the rock shelter.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt;

Originally, and until the mid-1970s, the remains at Howiesons Poort Shelter were thought to belong to the  [[Magosian]] period and so intermediate in time and technology between the Middle Stone Age and [[Late Stone Age]]. However, [[optically stimulated luminescence]] dating pushed back dates for occupation by this period to 65,800 BP and 59,500 BP.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

Apart from the Howiesons Poort period, Deacon proposed that the cave may have been occupied more recently for several very short periods (ca. 18-19000 BP, ca. 9-10000 BP and ca. 3-4000 BP) by people who made fires but left few or no artefacts.&lt;ref name="Deacon95"/&gt; However, this explanation is presented only as one of a number of possible scenarios.

'''''Independence Day''''' (also known as '''''ID''''' and '''''ID4''''') is a franchise of [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] [[Action film|action]] [[Horror film|horror]] films that started with ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' in 1996, which was eventually followed by the sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'' in 2016, with a planned third and fourth installment on the way. The franchise revolves around extraterrestrials invading Earth and seeking to eradicate mankind while the remaining human resistance uses everything at their disposal to defeat the invaders and take back the planet. Now considered to be a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], the original film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) on limited release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film grossed over $817.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996 and, briefly, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide of all time behind 1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Currently, it ranks 69th on the [[list of highest-grossing films]], and was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]].

==Films==
===''Independence Day'' (1996)===
{{Main article|Independence Day (1996 film)}}
The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch a last-ditch counterattack on July 4—[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.

====''Independence Day UK'' (1996)====
{{Main article|Independence Day UK}}
On August 4, 1996, [[BBC Radio 1]] broadcast the one-hour play ''[[Independence Day UK]]'', written, produced, and directed by [[Dirk Maggs]], a spin-off depicting the alien invasion from a British perspective.&lt;ref name="ID4UK"&gt;[http://www.dswilliams.co.uk/dirk%20maggs/Independence%20Day%20Dirk%20Maggs.htm "Independence Day UK."] ''dswilliams.co.uk''. Retrieved September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the original cast was present. Dean Devlin gave Maggs permission to produce an original version, on the condition that he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that the British were not depicted as saving the day.&lt;ref name="ID4UK" /&gt; ''Independence Day UK'' was set up to be similar to the 1938 radio broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]—''the first 20 minutes were presented as if live.&lt;ref name="ID4UK" /&gt;

===''Independence Day: Resurgence'' (2016)===
{{Main article|Independence Day: Resurgence}}
The film takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, during which the [[United Nations]] has collaborated to form Earth Space Defense (ESD), an international military defense and research organization. Through [[reverse engineering]], the world has harnessed the power of alien technology and laid the groundwork to resist a second invasion.

===Future===
In May 2015, Deadline reported that ''Independence Day 3'' and ''Independence Day 4'' were being planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/independence-day/35567/independence-day-3-and-4-also-being-planned&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, during an interview with ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine, Emmerich stated that a third film could be made, depending on the success of the second one. He also said that audiences would not have to wait as long as they did for the second in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/independence-day-director-shares-plot-902399 |title= 'Independence Day' Director Shares Plot of the Movie's Original, Unmade, Sequel |last= McMillan |first= Graeme |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate= June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmerich, the third film will depict an intergalactic journey, possibly set a year or two later since he wants to maintain the same group of people, especially the young characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/independence-day-3-will-intergalactic-journey-says-roland-emmerich/ |title= Independence Day 3 will be 'an intergalactic journey' says Roland Emmerich |last=Semlyen |first= Phil De |work= [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date= June 22, 2016 |accessdate= June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2018, LRM Online reported that, after having met producer Dean Devlin at WonderCon and asking about the status on ''Independence Day 3'', Devlin told them "I don’t know. I don’t know. Currently, I personally have no plans on doing another one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lrmonline.com/news/exclusive-independence-day-resurgence-producer-has-no-plans-to-do-another-film-anytime-soon/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Independence Day: Resurgence Producer Has No Plans To Do Another Film Anytime Soon|first=Joseph Jammer|last=Medina|website=lrmonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Ryan Scott at MovieWeb translated the poor reception of the second film and Devlin's comments as meaning ''Independence Day 3'' will likely not happen, also noting that 20th Century Fox merging with The Walt Disney Company (meaning Disney will be in control of Fox's franchises) would make it even less likely that a third film would be pursued and that we may not see another reboot of the brand for another 15-20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://movieweb.com/independence-day-3-no-plans-producer-dean-devlin/ |title= Independence Day 3 Is Completely Dead for Now |work= MovieWeb |date= March 27, 2018 |accessdate= May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katabasis''' or '''catabasis''' ({{lang-grc|κατάβασις}}, from {{lang|grc|κατὰ}} "down" and {{lang|grc|βαίνω}} "go") is a descent of some type, such as moving downhill, the sinking of the winds or sun, a military retreat, a trip to the [[underworld]], or a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast. The term has multiple related meanings in poetry, rhetoric, and modern psychology.

==A trip to the coast==
The term catabasis can refer to a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast (for example, following a river), in contrast to the term "[[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]]", which refers to an expedition from a coastline up into the interior of a country.

The main meaning given for catabasis by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') describes "A going down; a military retreat, in allusion to that of the ten thousand Greeks under [[Xenophon]], related by him in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|''Anabasis'']]:
{{quotation|1837 [[Thomas De Quincey|DE QUINCEY]] ''Revolt Tartars Wks''. 1862 IV. 112 The Russian anabasis and catabasis of Napoleon. 1899 ''Westm. Gaz.'' 17 May 4/1 Little space is devoted to the ''Anabasis''; it is, as in the story of Xenophon, the ''Catabasis'' which fills the larger part.| [[Oxford English Dictionary]] - catabasis}}

In the opening of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'', [[Socrates]] recounts "going down" to the port city of [[Piraeus]], located south of his native [[Athens]].  Several scholars, including [[Allan Bloom]], have read this first word, {{lang|grc|κατέβην}} ("I went down") as an allusion to [[Odysseus]]' journey into the [[underworld]].

==Arts==
In [[poetry]] and [[rhetoric]], the term ''katabasis'' refers to a "gradual descending" of emphasis on a theme within a sentence or paragraph, while ''anabasis'' refers to a gradual ascending in emphasis. John Freccero notes, "In the ancient world, [the] descent in search of understanding was known as katabasis",{{sfn|Freccero|1988|p=108}} thus endowing mythic and poetic accounts of katabasis with a symbolic significance.

==Modern psychology==
In modern psychology, the term ''katabasis'' is sometimes used to describe the [[depression (mood)|depression]] some young men experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.org.uk/picasso/jung_article.html Jung's 1932 Article on Picasso]&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Robert Bly]] proposes in his book ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' several reasons for the "catabasis phenomenon", amongst them the lack of Western [[initiation rite]]s and the lack of strong [[father figure]]s and [[role model]]s.

==Trip into the underworld==
The trip to the underworld is a [[mytheme]] of [[comparative mythology]] found in a diverse number of religions from around the world. The [[hero]] or upper-world deity journeys to the [[underworld]] or to the land of the dead and returns, often with a [[quest]]-object or a loved one, or with heightened knowledge. The ability to enter the realm of the dead while still alive, and to return, is a proof of the classical hero's exceptional status as more than mortal. A deity who returns from the underworld demonstrates [[Eschatology|eschatological]] themes such as the cyclical nature of time and existence, or the defeat of death and the possibility of [[immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2005|p=98}}; {{harvnb|Edmonds III|2004||loc=''passim''}}; {{harvnb|Collins|Fishbane|1995|loc=''passim''}}; and {{harvnb|Louden|2011|pp=197–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Katabasis'' is the epic convention of the hero's trip into the [[underworld]].{{sfn|Serrano|1999|pp=129–179}} In [[Greek mythology]], for example, [[Orpheus]] enters the underworld in order to bring [[Eurydice]] back to the world of the living.

Most ''katabases'' take place in a supernatural underworld, such as [[Hades]] or [[Hell]] —  as in [[Nekyia]], the 11th book of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', which describes [[Odysseus]]'s descent to the underworld. However, ''katabas''is can also refer to a journey through other ''dystopi''c areas, like those Odysseus encounters on his 10-year journey back from [[Troy]] to [[Ithaca]]. Pilar Serrano{{sfn|Serrano|1999|pp=129–179}} allows the term ''katabasis'' to encompass brief or chronic stays in the underworld, including those of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], and [[Castor and Pollux]].  In this case, however, the ''katabasis'' must be followed by an ''[[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]]'' (a going or marching up) in order to be considered a true ''katabasis'' instead of a death.

=== The ''Odyssey'' ===
[[File:Alessandro Allori - Odysseus questions the seer Tiresias.jpg|thumb|Odysseus consults the soul of the prophet Tiresias in his ''katabasis'' during the 11th book of the ''Odyssey.'']]
In the 11th book of the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus follows the advice of Circe and consults Tiresias in the land of the dead.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=10: 504 – 11: 50}} During Odysseus' visit, the souls of many appear to him. The first to appear to Odysseus is [[Elpenor]], his crew member who died prior to leaving Circe's island. Elpenor asks Odysseus to give him a proper burial, and Odysseus agrees.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 51–83}}  The next to appear to Odysseus is his mother, [[Anticlea]]. As Odysseus has been away fighting the Trojan War for nearly 20 years, he is surprised and saddened by the sight of her soul.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 84–89}}

[[Tiresias]], the soul whom Odysseus came to see, next appears to him. Tiresias gives him several pieces of information concerning his ''[[nostos]]'' (homecoming) and his life after. Tiresias details [[Poseidon|Poseidon's]] anger at Odysseus' blinding of [[Polyphemus|Polyphemos]] (and the coming troubles as a consequence), warns Odysseus not to eat the livestock of the god [[Helios]], and prophesies Odysseus' return home to [[Ithaca]] and his eventual death at sea at an old age.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 90–137}} After Tiresias instructs Odysseus to allow the spirits he wants to talk to drink the sacrificial blood he used to find Tiresias, he is again given the chance to see his mother, and she tells him of the suffering of his family as they await his return home.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 145–224}} As his mother leaves, Odysseus is then visited by a string of souls of past queens. He first sees [[Tyro]], the mother of [[Pelias]] and [[Neleus]] by Poseidon.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 235–259}}

He next talks to [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]], the mother of [[Amphion and Zethus]] (the founders of Thebes) by [[Zeus]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 260–265}} Then, he is visited by [[Alcmene]], the mother of [[Heracles]] by Zeus, and Heracle's wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 266–270}} He is also visited by [[Jocasta|Epicaste,]] the mother of Oedipus, and [[Chloris]], the queen of [[Pylos]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 271–285}} Odysseus is then visited by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], the mother of [[Castor and Pollux|Castor and Polydeuces]] and [[Iphimedeia]], mother of the [[Aloadae]] by Poseidon.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 298–320}} Odysseus then sees a list of women whom he only briefly mentions: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Ariadne]], Maera, [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]], and [[Eriphyle]], all also lovers of gods or heroes.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 321–332}} Next to visit Odysseus is [[Agamemnon]], the king of [[Mycenae]]. Agamemnon tells Odysseus of his death by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover [[Aegisthus]]. He warns Odysseus to return to Ithaca in secret and be wary of his own wife.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 385–461}}

Odysseus then encounters [[Achilles]], who asks after the well being of his father, [[Peleus]], and his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. Odysseus reassures Achilles of his son's bravery in fighting the Trojans.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 466–540}} Odysseus then begins seeing figures of dead souls who do not talk directly to him: [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], [[Minos]], [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], [[Tityos]], [[Tantalus]], and [[Sisyphus]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 550–600}} Odysseus ends his visit with Heracles, who asks about Odysseus' intention in Hades. Odysseus begins to get fearful as he waits for more heroes and leaves.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 601–640}}
[[File:Scene from Virgil's Aeneid; the Cumaean Sibyl leads Aeneas t Wellcome V0042049.jpg|thumb|The Cumaean Sibyl leads Aeneas to the Underworld for his katabasis in the ''Aeneid.'']]

=== The ''Aeneid'' ===
The ''katabasis'' of Virgil's ''Aeneid'' occurs in book 6 of the epic. Unlike Odysseus, Aeneas seeks to enter the underworld, rather than bring the spirits of the dead to him through sacrifice. He begins his journey with a visit to the Cumaean Sibyl (a priestess of Apollo) and asks for her assistance to journey to the underworld and visit his father.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 1–124}} The priestess tells him to find a golden branch, and if the branch breaks off in his hands, he is fated to go to the underworld. She also tells Aeneas to bury his dead friend and prepare cattle for sacrifice.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 125–155}} When Aeneas reaches the forest to find the golden branch, he is guided by birds to the tree, and the branch breaks into his hand. The branch, however, does not easily break off as the Sibyl said would happen to a person fated to go to the Underworld - the branch is described as "cunctantem" ("hesitant"). The implications of this have been debated by scholars - some arguing that it means that Aeneas is not as heroic as he needs to be, others arguing that Aeneas has not yet fulfilled his destiny, and several arguing that he is still a hero, with this section added purely for drama. Aeneas buries Misenus and he and the Sibyl prepare a sacrifice to enter the underworld.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 176–267}} Aeneas first encounters several beings and monsters as he enters: Sorrows, Heartaches, Diseases, Senility, Terror, Hunger, Evil, Crime, Poverty, Death, Hard Labor, Sleep, Evil Pleasures of Mind, War, Family Vengeance, Mad Civil Strife, [[Scylla]], [[Hekatonkheires|Briareus]], Hydra, [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimaera]], [[Gorgon]]s, [[Harpy|Harpies]], and [[Cerberus]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 268–294}} Next, Aeneas encounters [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], the ferryman who leads souls into the underworld, and the mass of people who are unburied.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 295–332}} His first conversation is with Palinurus, a man of his crew who fell overboard and died on their journey. Palinurus begs Aeneas to bury him so he can enter the underworld.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 337–383}} The Sibyl convinces Charon to carry them across the river Styx in exchange for the golden bough.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 384–416}} Aeneas encounters Minos pronouncing judgment on souls and the souls that died for love: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Eriphyle]], [[Evadne]], [[Pasiphaë|Pasiphae]], [[Laodamia]], [[Caeneus]], and [[Dido]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 426–451}} Next, Aeneas sees heroes of battle: [[Tydeus]], Parthenopaeus, [[Adrastus]], [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], [[Medon]], Thersilochus, [[Polybotes|Polyboetes]], Idaeus, [[Agamemnon]], and [[Deiphobus]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 477–534}} The Sibyl then leads Aeneas to Elysium, the place for the blessed. On the way, they pass the place for tortured souls and the Sibyl describes some of the tortured's fates. Tityos has his liver eaten by a vulture daily. Pirithous and Ixion have a rock constantly hanging over them at all times. Many others face the punishment of moving rocks, being stretched, and being tied to wheels.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 548–636}} The two then enter the Estates of the Blessed, where they see a utopian land where heroes and good people reside. There, Aeneas finds his father, who tells him of the rich history of Rome to come.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 637–901}}

=== The Metamorphoses ===
In Ovid's poetic collection of mythological stories, he includes accounts of ''katabasis'' as well. In book 4, he includes an account of Juno's descent to Hades to bring her perceived justice to Ino.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 578–617}} Ovid describes Juno's path to the underworld, noting Cerberus' presence.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 594–617}} Juno seeks the Furies (Tisiphone, Megara, and [[Alecto]]) to destroy the house of [[Cadmus]], namely Ino and her husband [[Athamas]]. While in the underworld, Juno passes several souls who are being punished in Hades. Hades is also a person, and he needs to get rid of those souls because he needs them to fully recover. –[[Tantalus]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Ixion]], and the [[Daughters of Danaus|Belides]].{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 624–634}} When the Furies agree to Juno's request, she happily returns to the heavens where she is purified by Iris.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 649–659}}

[[File:Orpheus &amp; Euridice.jpg|thumb|Orpheus travels out of the underworld followed by the shade of his wife, Eurydice.]]
The next major ''katabasis'' in the ''Metamorphoses'' occurs in book 5 by [[Proserpina]], the daughter of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] who is kidnapped by [[Saturn (mythology)|Dis]]. As Proserpina is picking flowers, Dis falls in love with her and decides to grab her and take her to the underworld in his chariot. Worried about her now-missing daughter, Ceres becomes distraught and searches for Proserpina.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 552–615}}

When Ceres discovers the kidnapping, she goes to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] to attempt to get Proserpina back. He agrees that she should be returned as long as Proserpina has not touched any food in the underworld. However, she has eaten pomegranate seeds, and cannot be returned to Ceres.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 658–712}} To ensure compromise between Ceres and Dis, Jove divides the year into halves and commands that Proserpina must spend equal parts of the year between her mother and her husband. From that point on, Proserpina makes annual trips to the underworld, spending half the year there.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 739–746}}

Ovid also briefly mentions the ''katabasis'' of Hercules in book 7. Ovid is telling the etiological story of [[Medea|Medea's]] poison for [[Theseus]]. When Hercules travelled to the underworld to capture Cerberus as one of his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve Labours]], Cerberus spread white foam from his mouths which grew poisonous plants.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=7: 575–595}}

The ''katabasis'' of [[Orpheus]] in book 10 is the last major inclusion of the theme by Ovid in the ''Metamorphoses''. Orpheus is distraught by the death of his wife, [[Eurydice]]. He enters the underworld through the Spartan Gates and visits Dis and Proserpina to beg for the return of his bride. Overcome by the heartfelt song of Orpheus, Proserpina calls Eurydice to leave with her husband–on the condition that he does not look back until he reaches the exit. When he looks back, his wife disappears, and he is pained by grief for her death a second time.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=10: 1–110}}

==Wind==
{{main|Katabatic wind}}
Air cooled by a glacier flows down the glacier and generates wind movement known as a ''katabatic wind''. In Antarctica, katabatic winds perpetually flow off the Antarctic plateau and are channelled through mountain passes, descending down steep glaciers to the oceans. They blow at storm force year round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/southpole/577 Climate: The South Pole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918055013/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/SouthPole/577 |date=2008-09-18 }} [http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html Stanford Humanities Lab], Retrieved 2008-10-01   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920222812/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurdification''' is a cultural change in which non-ethnic Kurds or/and non-ethnic Kurdish area becomes [[Kurds|Kurdish]]. This can happen both naturally (as seen in [[Turkish Kurdistan]]) and deliberately (as seen in Iraq after [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|the invasion of Iraq]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Ali,  Pratt|first=Nadje Sadig, Nicola Christine|title=What kind of liberation?: women and the occupation of Iraq|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25729-0|pages=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KnoG_52Jh8C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preti Taneja, Minority Rights Group International|title=Assimilation, exodus, eradication: Iraq's minority communities since 2003|year=2007|publisher=Minority Rights Group International|pages=19|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22553,4565c25f653,469cbf9d0,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=10562 "Overcrowding and Kurdification threaten Christians in northern Iraq"] (AsiaNews, October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNHCR’s ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES FOR  ASSESSING THE INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION  NEEDS OF IRAQI ASYLUM-SEEKERS|page=11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46deb05557.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of kurdification is different from country to country. In [[Turkish Kurdistan]], many ethnic [[Armenians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mehrdad Izady|date=The Kurds: A Concise History And Fact Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulgarians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harmen van der Wilt|title=The Genocide Convention: The Legacy of 60 Years|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Circassians]],&lt;ref name="cerkes" /&gt; [[Chechens]],&lt;ref name="checheningush" /&gt; [[Georgians]],&lt;ref name="georgian" /&gt; [[Ingushs]],&lt;ref name="checheningush" /&gt; and [[Ossetians]] have become kurdified, as a result of fleeing to the region and having subsequently interacted with ethnic [[Kurds]]. In [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], currently the minorities like [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmens]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Yazidis]] and [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] are undergoing a process of Kurdification in the [[Disputed territories of Northern Iraq|disputed territories of northern Iraq]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/11/10/vulnerable-ground/violence-against-minority-communities-nineveh-provinces-disputed|title=On Vulnerable Ground {{!}} Violence against Minority Communities in Nineveh Province’s Disputed Territories|date=2009-11-10|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caucasian refugees (1860s-1910s)===
{{main|Chechen Kurds}}
When refugees from Caucasus reached the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople decided not to settle these in Kurdistan due to the extreme poverty and lack of material resources for the refugees. Yet after some time, the Ottomans started seeing the refugees as a chance to diminish the Kurdish claim to the region and allowed the refugees to settle in the region.&lt;ref name="klein" &gt;{{cite book|author1=Janet Klein|title=The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone|date=2011|isbn=9780804777759}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Circassian refugees from the [[Shapsug]] tribe arrived in the Kurdish areas of [[Ahlat]] and [[Adilcevaz]] and settled in the three Kurdish villages of Yoğurtyemez, Xanik (Çukurtarla), Develik and founded the village of Koxiş (Yolçatı).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unutulmuş Ahlat Çerkesleri-1|url=http://www.cerkesfed.org/2016/08/16/unutulmus-ahlat-cerkesleri-1/|accessdate=11 December 2016|agency=Cerkes-Fed|date=16 August 2016|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first big wave of Caucasian refugees to Kurdistan was in 1864 when 15,000 to 20,000 refugees settled in [[Sarıkamış]], founding new villages and settling in abandoned Greek and Armenian villages.&lt;ref name="chochievkoc" &gt;{{cite journal|author1=Georgi Chochiev and Bekir Koç|title=Migrants from the North Caucasus in Eastern Anatolia: Some Notes on Their Settlement and Adaptation|journal=Journal of Asian History|date=2006|volume=40|issue=183|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; These refugees included [[Circassians]], [[Chechens]], [[Laks (Caucasus)|Laks]] and [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kars - Index Anatolicus|url=http://nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Kars&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of refugees were Circassias who fled the [[Circassia]] region (part of the [[Russian Empire]]) during the [[ethnic cleansing of Circassians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anita L.

===Until 2011 (end of main U.S. military presence)===

On 21 August 2006, Shabak Democratic Party leader Hunain Qaddo, proposed the creation of a separate province within the borders of the Nineveh Plain, in order to combat the Arabization and Kurdification of Iraqi minorities. The Iraqi government voted against the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BAGHDAD3283_a.html|title=Cable: 06BAGHDAD3283_a|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ismail|first1=Mirza|title=The Kurdish Threat to The Yezidis of North Iraq|url=http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20081201015903.htm|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency|accessdate=26 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223112315/http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20081201015903.htm|archivedate=2008-12-23|date=2008-12-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2015/01/12/hizballah-cavalcade-quwat-sahl-ninawa-iraqs-shia-shabak-get-their-own-militia/|title=Hizballah Cavalcade: Quwat Sahl Nīnawā: Iraq’s Shia Shabak Get Their Own Militia|work=JIHADOLOGY: A clearinghouse for jihādī primary source material, original analysis, and translation service|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20050828120403.htm|title=Iraq's Shabaks Are Being Oppressed By Kurds|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/06/tastekin-iraqi-turkmen-isis-kirkuk-mosul-arms-itf.html|title=Iraqi Turkmen take up arms in Kirkuk - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/10/a-yazidi-super-hero-who-won-t-go-away.html|title=The Hero Yazidis Hope Will Save Them|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/inside-the-christian-militias-defending-the-nineveh-plains-fe4a10babeed|title=Inside the Christian Militias Defending the Nineveh Plains — War Is Boring|author=Matt Cetti-Roberts|work=Medium|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restoreninevehnow.org/?page_id=153|title=The Nineveh Plain Protection Units|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There have been reports that some Arabs are being displaced in previously mixed Kurdish-Arab villages in Northern Iraq.&lt;ref name="rebeccacollard/makhmour"/&gt;

The Kurdish government defended the Kurdification with the [[Kirkuk status referendum#The Iraqi Constitution|implementation of article 140 of the Iraqi constitution]] which ensured the restoration of the situation as it was before [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Anfal genocide|genocide]] and [[Arabization]] policies against the Kurdish population during the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]] and the [[Persecution of Feyli Kurds under Saddam Hussein|Kurdish Feyli genocide]].

Intensified tensions between Kurds and [[Sunni Arabs]] led to violent clashes between both of them since Saddam's Arabization and genocide campaigns against the Kurdish population in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. On 21 August 2006, Shabak Democratic Party leader Hunain Qaddo proposed the creation of a separate province within the borders of the [[Nineveh plains|Nineveh Plains]], in order to combat the "Arabization" and "Kurdification" of Iraqi minorities. The Iraqi government voted against the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BAGHDAD3283_a.html|title=Cable: 06BAGHDAD3283_a|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2015/01/12/hizballah-cavalcade-quwat-sahl-ninawa-iraqs-shia-shabak-get-their-own-militia/|title=Hizballah Cavalcade: Quwat Sahl Nīnawā: Iraq’s Shia Shabak Get Their Own Militia|work=JIHADOLOGY: A clearinghouse for jihādī primary source material, original analysis, and translation service|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/10/a-yazidi-super-hero-who-won-t-go-away.html|title=The Hero Yazidis Hope Will Save Them|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/inside-the-christian-militias-defending-the-nineveh-plains-fe4a10babeed|title=Inside the Christian Militias Defending the Nineveh Plains — War Is Boring|author=Matt Cetti-Roberts|work=Medium|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 2011===

Kurdification or re-Kurdification (post-Saddam) has been an open policy of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq since 2003, according to Gareth Stansfield, a professor of Middle East politics at the University of Exeter.&lt;ref name="rebeccacollard/makhmour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3182347/kurds-sunni-arabs-iraq-isis-erbil/|title=Kurds and Sunni Arabs Fall Out in the Wake of ISIS Fight|author=Rebecca Collard / Makhmour|work=TIME.com|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Assyrians sources claimed that the Kurds have clear plans for the annexation of the Nineveh Plains to the Kurdish control and it is claimed by Assyrian activists that they have "always sent their followers to international forums to interrupt international protection for Assyrians".&lt;ref name="middleeastmonitor.com"&gt;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/14007-assyrians-need-protection-from-islamisation-and-kurdification&lt;/ref&gt; The Hareetz newspaper had reported on 24 December 2014 that the Kurds object to the establishment of a protected Christian enclave, because they want to annex the Nineveh Valley, most of whose residents are Christians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/14007-assyrians-need-protection-from-islamisation-and-kurdification, Haaretz newspaper on 24 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aina.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20110930190835.htm|title=Assyrians of Iraq and the Nineveh Plain Conspiracy|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian activist from the Assyrian Patriotic Movement claimed that the entire Assyrian Triangle (between Greater Zab and the River Tigris) has been "occupied by Kurdish intruders".&lt;ref name="middleeastmonitor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aina.org"/&gt; Some Assyrians in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq also complained that construction plans are "aimed at affecting a demographic change that divides Assyrian blocs". Also some Yazidis, Shabaks and Turkmens have reported that they are facing a policy of cultural and security control against them, especially in areas which belonged to the Kurds before Saddam's [[Al-Anfal Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/09/iraq-kurdistan-region-protect-minority-rights.html|title=Iraqi Kurdistan Must Ensure Minority Rights - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, David Romano, Professor of Middle East Politics, said that without the [[YPG]] and [[Peshmerga]], the Assyrians of northern Syria and Iraq would likely all be dead, lying in some [[Jihadism|jihadist]]-dug mass grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/21012016?ctl00_phMainContainer_phMain_ControlComments1_gvCommentsChangePage=3_20|url=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/21012016?ctl00_phMainContainer_phMain_ControlComments1_gvCommentsChangePage=3_20|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=rudaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that the Kurdish militia (Peshmerga) quickly abandoned their positions at the beginning of the [[ISIL]] occupation of the city of [[Mosul]], and that the Peshmerga, who had disarmed Assyrians and left them defenseless, retreated without informing the indigenous Christian population, leaving them uninformed and unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ned|last2=Coles|first2=Isabel|last3=Salman|first3=Raheem|title=Special Report: How Mosul fell - An Iraqi general disputes Baghdad's story|url=http:// uk.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-gharawi-spe- cial-report-idUSKCN0I30Z820141014|agency=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|date=14/10/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum published news which argued that the Yazidis have frequently been pressured to assimilate to both Arab and Kurdish ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/cases/iraq/background/people-of-the-book|title=The People of the Book and the Hierarchy of Discrimination|website=www.ushmm.org|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have stated that Yazidis already speak [[Northern Kurdish]] which is one of the two major dialects of Kurdish language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yezidisinternational.org/abouttheyezidipeople/glossary/|title=Yezidi Language|work=Yezidis|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi civil war]], Iraqi army troops fled their posts around the Nineveh Plains while ISIL attacked. Later, [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]] forces, with the support of coalition airstrikes, captured these areas from ISIL. Since then, there have been disputes between pro-government Assyrians and Kurds, as the former have either asked the Kurds to leave or promised them autonomy.

In 2011, some Yazidi activists voiced their "concern over forced assimilation into Kurdish identity". Some have accused the Kurdish and Iraqi parties of diverting US $12 million of reconstruction funds allocated for Yazidi areas in [[Sinjar|Jebel Sinjar]] to a Kurdish village and marginalizing them politically.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to Sweden-based economist David Ghanim, the goal of some tactics of the KRG had been to push [[Shabak people|Shabak]] and [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] communities to identify as [[Kurds]], which has been strongly denied by KRG authorities. He also claimed that the Kurdish authorities are working to impose Kurdish identity on the Yazidis and the Shabaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghanim|first1=David|title=Iraq's Dysfunctional Democracy|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZ076ls9unQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Iraq%27s+Dysfunctional+Democracy&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qsHsU9n8I4rmyQPLs4DYCg&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Iraq's%20Dysfunctional%20Democracy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian International News Agency claimed that the Kurds have annexed Assyrian, Yazidi and Shabak villages and which now under Kurdish Control in North Iraq,&lt;ref name="aina.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140614185547.htm|title=Assyrian, Yezidi and Shabak Villages Are Now Under Kurdish Control in North Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20150810104756.htm|title=Kurds Build Cemetery, Park in Heart of Assyrian Area in Turkey|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in Iraqi Kurdistan, Assyrian politicians of some towns have been replaced with Kurdish ones.&lt;ref name="aina.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140614185547.htm|title=Assyrian, Yezidi and Shabak Villages Are Now Under Kurdish Control in North Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria==

Assyrians have claimed that Kurdish nationalists have enforced revisionist curricula in schools with a Kurdish-nationalist bias. This is controversial since it has been noted they ""alter historical and geographical facts"", including Assyrian place names which are changed to Kurdish names, and students are taught that King Nebuchadnezzar from the Old Testament married a Kurdish woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article155513600/Ein-Krieg-um-Schulbuecher-bestimmt-Syriens-Zukunft.html WELT] [http://www.aina.org/news/20160524145527.htm AINA]. According to Aboona, due to the very obscure history of the Kurds and the lack of historical sources, ""Kurds have been forced to look for what they wanted in others' nations sources" [such as Assyrian history]. "Most of the inhabitants of today's Kurdistan region were Christians and were later displaced or absorbed by Kurdish tribes. The scholarly consensus is that Kurdish tribes were living in nomadic and pastoral societys, living in their tents, divided into tribes and subtribes, and were "less disposed to adopt civilisation than the Persians or Turks". Between 1055 and 1536, many Assyrian worship centers in northern and northeastern ancient Assyrian "were raided and attacked by Kurds who killed, looted and enslaved the indigenous population." "During these times Kurds were moving into Assyrian regions." Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. . {{ISBN|978-1-60497-583-3}}. page 89-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish news claimed that Ossama Telcu, member of the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]], had claimed that the PYD forces set ablaze civil registry and land registry buildings in Manbij shortly after taking city from ISIL. According to Turkish AA source, PYD forces set ablaze civil registry and land registry buildings in [[Manbij]]. In addition, it was claimed that the PYD had also been sending away Sunni Arabs and [[Syrian Turkmens|Turkmen]] residents who want to return to their homes in [[Manbij]] on the pretext that ISIL has planted mines inside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/syria-pyd-accused-of-changing-demography-in-manbij/628495|title=Syria: PYD accused of changing demography in Manbij|publisher= Anadolu Agency|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.antiwar.com/2016/08/14/kurds-accused-of-changing-demography-in-manbij/|title=Kurds Accused of Changing Demography in Manbij|publisher= Antiwar.com|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/12/report-u-s-backed-kurdish-rebels-may-have-committed-war-crimes-in-syria/?postshare=7521444690898402|title=Report: U.S.-backed Kurdish rebels may have committed war crimes in Syria|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Reuters, Kurdish and US sources reported that civilians had returned to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands return to Manbij after IS militants flee city|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-manbij-idUSKCN10O0S2|accessdate=12 September 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story itself was originally supposed to appear in the spin-off comic  [[Earthside 8]], but this title was never published. However, this was not the end of the problems as the move to ''2000 AD'' happened when Mills felt his relationship with the editors was breaking down and he came to believe that "''Dinosty'' suffered from covert and non-verbalised editorial opposition, or maybe just disinterest."{{sfn|Bishop|2007|p=167}} The story would eventually run in 1994, in issues #873 - 882.

[[Tharg]] ([[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt]] to his friends) wanted a stonking big space war story that would suit the universe of the Mega-Cities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Interviews/Dan-Abnett-on-Insurrection.html Dan Abnett on ''Insurrection''] at 2000 AD Review (March 7, 2009)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908000957/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Interviews/Dan-Abnett-on-Insurrection.html |date=September 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was drawn by artist [[Colin MacNeil]], who has also worked on a number of Warhammer 40K stories, and one reviewer notes the similarities suggesting "MacNeil is reprising exactly the same art style that he used on the "[[Bloodquest]]" strip in the [[Warhammer Monthly]] comic."&lt;ref name=meg280rev&gt;[http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Megazine-2009-2010/Judge-Dredd-Megazine-280.html#insurrection ''Insurrection'' review from ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #280] at 2000 AD Review  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308074103/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Megazine-2009-2010/Judge-Dredd-Megazine-280.html#insurrection |date=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reception has been positive with reviews of the first episode suggesting "With cracking art and a storming first episode I have to say ‘Insurrection’ has the potential to be the best Dredd off world spin-off ever" and "This was as good a first episode as I can remember reading and I can see Insurrection having the legs to deliver on that initial promise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Megazine-2007-2008/Judge-Dredd-Megazine-279.html#insurrection ''Insurrection'' review from ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #279] at 2000 AD Review  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119102816/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Megazine-2007-2008/Judge-Dredd-Megazine-279.html#insurrection |date=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews only got better after that, including: "Quite simply, this is the best non-Dredd story ever to run in the Megazine"&lt;ref name=meg280rev /&gt; and "glorious"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Megazine-2009-2010/Judge-Dredd-Megazine-281.html#insurrection ''Insurrection'' review from ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #281] at 2000 AD Review  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225200455/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/site/index.php/Megazine-2009-2010/Judge-Dredd-Megazine-281.html#insurrection |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnett had tried to repeat the success of ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' by seeing what worked and basing another story on those elements:

{{bquote|I looked at what was popular with Sinister Dexter - extreme violence and witty dialogue, catchphrases galore and as many puns as you can fit in. Then I added heavy artillery action, something Henry did well. It should have been a blast, but wasn't popular...

The story had been on Carey's mind for seven years before appearing in the comic. The writer has said "I wanted to do a story that was an insane, over-the-top space opera combined with the seventies paranoid thriller.

''Witch World''&lt;ref&gt;[http://2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&amp;page=profiles&amp;choice=witch ''Witch World''] at 2000 AD online&lt;/ref&gt; is a series that appeared twice in ''2000 AD'', written by [[Gordon Rennie]], with art provided by [[Siku (comics)|Siku]], [[Paul Johnson (artist)|Paul Johnson]], [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]] and [[John M. Burns]].

Rennie describes the origins of the story (one of his first in ''2000 AD'' after stories being published in ''Judge Dredd Megazine''): "It came about when I and a number of other writers were asked to put together pitches for a new fantasy strip, with guidelines suggested by the editor".&lt;ref name=28daysrennie /&gt; However, he does not rate the story highly:

{{bquote|I didn't think my idea was much cop when I came up with it, I still didn't think much of it when I pitched it, and I absolutely fucking hated it while I was writing it. [...] Chopping and changing artists every few episodes didn't help, but the fact that the series was generally just crap to begin with was probably the biggest drawback. Of everything I've ever written, ''Witch World'' is easily the one thing I wish I hadn't done. One or two [[Vector 13]]s aside, it was the first thing I did for ''2000 AD'', a comic that's been part of my life for 25 years, and the fact that it was hackneyed old rubbish is still a source of eternal mortification.&lt;ref name=28daysrennie /&gt;}}

&lt;!-- Info to be given: Area/country; described by; language; style of music; image (s); reference &lt;span id="word"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;--&gt;
'''[[Ornament (music)|Ornaments]]''' are a decorative embellishment to music, either to a [[melody]] or to an [[accompaniment]] part such as a [[bassline]] or [[chord (music)|chord]]. Sometimes different symbols represent the same ornament, or vice versa. Different ornament names can refer to an ornament from a specific area or time period. Understanding these ornaments is important for [[historically informed performance]] and understanding the subtleties of different types of music. This list is intended to give basic information on ornaments, with description and illustrations where possible. Ornaments are used in [[Western classical music]], Western [[popular music]] e.g., [[rock music]] and [[pop music]]) and [[traditional music]] (e.g., [[folk music]] and [[blues]]) and in other [[world music]] and [[classical music]] from the eastern and Southern Hemisphere continents.

==V==
*'''{{Anchor|Vibrato}}[[Vibrato]]''' Italian, a fluctuation in pitch, volume, or both, generally applied to vocal music. Later used for left-hand technique on bowed strings, and with breath vibrato on wind instruments. It is either used constantly or used as an ornament, depending on repertoire. When used as an ornament, it is generally improvised, although some 17th-century English and French sources indicate a dot over a note should be used. [[Giuseppe Tartini]] discussed it as one of the four Graces. There are many terms which can be understood to refer to what is now called vibrato. It is believed that vibrato has been used in European music since medieval times, and went through several cycles of popularity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Grove, Vibrato&lt;/ref&gt;

==W==

*'''{{Anchor|Warble}}[[Native American flute#The Warble|Warble]]'''. A distinctive ornament of some Native American flutes, particularly traditional flutes, that is created by steady breath pressure on the fundamental note of the instrument.

'''Ronald''' "'''Mac'''" '''McDonald''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[FX Network|FX]] series ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]''. Mac is [[Charlie Kelly (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Charlie Kelly]]'s childhood friend and [[Dennis Reynolds]]'s high school friend and later roommate.

==Character overview==
Mac is a co-owner of Paddy's, the self-proclaimed "Sheriff of Paddy's," and is generally the pub's most active manager. Mac is played by [[Rob McElhenney]].

Mac frequently uses his signature line, "What's up, bitches?" throughout the series. In many episodes, Mac will enter the bar announcing "I've got news" or a variation of the phrase, to set the episode's plot in motion. The others rarely share his enthusiasm, but he usually convinces one of them to follow him, though often reluctantly. Throughout the series, Mac uses a "puppy-dog look" when he is ashamed or when he proposes something reprehensibly shameful.

==Name==
For the first six seasons Mac's full name was kept anonymous as a running joke, though in the season four episode "Mac &amp; Charlie Die," Mac's father's name is listed as "Luther Mac" on his parole papers and his mother is referred to as Mrs. Mac.  In the episode "Who Got Dee Pregnant?," one of the McPoyle brothers refers to Mac as "Macwell." In the episode "The Gang Cracks the Liberty Bell" Mac, or at least Mac's 18th Century counterpart, is called "McDonald," suggesting that this is his surname. Mac's full real name, Ronald McDonald, is revealed in the season seven episode "The High School Reunion". Mac hates the name due to its connection with [[Ronald McDonald|the spokesman]] of the popular fast food chain [[McDonald's]] as well as his old nickname, "Ronnie the Rat," which he obtained from ratting on fellow drug dealers in high school. Mac "ratted" on drug dealers so he could become the main drug dealer of the school. He prefers to be simply called "Mac".

==Description==
Mac comes from a [[wikt:broken home|broken home]]; his father has been [[prison|incarcerated]] for dealing [[methamphetamine|meth]] and his mother is extremely [[Apathy|apathetic]] and unemotional. Mac and his mother also own a dog named Poppins, who despite being extremely old and prone to eating poisonous objects appears to be practically indestructible. He sees himself as a [[karate]] expert and total "badass". Mac constantly seeks the acceptance of others, especially his parents, but his over-earnest efforts do not endear him to others. Earlier, under the impression that his father would possibly murder him after being paroled, Mac later receives a warm letter from his father, specifically requesting that Mac stay away from him. This letter is written as Mac's father fears that Mac's destructive tendencies could harm him. Dennis notes that the only reason Mac hung out with the popular kids in high school was because he sold them all [[Marijuana|weed]] and even then was considered an "asshole." Though Dennis reigns supreme as selfish and arrogant, Mac has made his fair share of selfish, inconsiderate decisions and observations.

Mac is considered by every member of The Gang to be a "jerk" and is nearly always the first to start betraying the others, though he does usually stick with Dennis, who is his best friend and has known him longer than anybody in The Gang other than Charlie. Like Dennis, Mac sees himself as superior to the rest of The Gang and often attempts to prove his supremacy. For instance, in an attempt to impress Charlie and Dennis, he makes a series of "Project Badass" videotapes that consist of various idiotic stunts [[Here I Go Again|set to music]]. He had a sexual relationship with a pre-op transgender woman named Carmen, for whom he claimed he was just "putting in time" as he waited for Carmen's [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgery]].

Mac sincerely believes that he is an adept [[martial artist]] with "cat-like reflexes" and usually wears sleeveless shirts to draw attention to his physique and exhibit his [[Tattoo|tribal tattoos]]. Despite his apparent fitness, Mac generally focuses his workout time on developing his, as Dennis called them, "glamor muscles" and is largely the weakest member in The Gang, behind everyone but Dennis. Despite his enthusiasm towards karate, he is shown to have no real skills in the sport.

===Religion===
A [[Catholicism|Catholic]], Mac is the only member of The Gang to profess a [[Religious faith#Faith in world religions|religious faith]]. In "[[The Gang Exploits a Miracle]]," Mac fears that the Lord will show his wrath if they continue to exploit a water stain in the bar that appears to depict the Virgin Mary. Throughout the series, Mac refuses to wear a condom during sex because, as he explains to Charlie, he went to Catholic school. Though Mac seems to care more about issues such as abortion, [[activism|community activism]], and [[parenting]] than the rest of The Gang, his views on such subjects are invariably twisted, ignorant, or prejudiced and his actions regarding them are always hypocritical and selfish. For instance, after pretending to be adamantly pro-life in order to attract a female activist, Mac later demands that she get an abortion when he thinks she has become pregnant by him. In another instance, Mac discovers that Carmen has married and had the operation to remove her penis. He then belittles Carmen and her husband by quoting the Bible to them and calling them gay; however, he only reacts so because he expected Carmen to call him after the operation so they could date again. Mac constantly drinks [[Ethanol|alcohol]], like the rest of The Gang, and abuses other substances, such as [[poppers]] and [[inhalants|glue]]. In recent seasons, Mac has sometimes expressed [[Anti-Semitism]], from his rant about [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and "his Jews" using Facebook and other social media to take over the world in "The Anti-Social Network" and, in "The Gang Group Dates," telling a disgusted Frank and Charlie that he wants to make sure any women he might date are not Jewish.

===Sexuality===
While Mac has sexual exploits with various women, including two models in immediate succession ("America's Next Top Paddy's Billboard Model Contest"), there have been throughout the series insinuations that Mac may be homosexual. This is manifested by his obsession with men's physiques and his reactionary religious views on homosexuality. In the final scene of the season 4 episode "Mac's Banging the Waitress," Charlie says to Dennis, "Do you still get the feeling he wants to bang us? That's what this is all about," after Mac tries to demonstrate how "badass" he is by falling from the roof onto a pile of mattresses. In the season 9 episode "Mac Day," Charlie says, "I know we've never said this as a group, but Mac's gay," to which the rest of The Gang readily agrees. In Season 10, when Dennis is listing all of the delusions The Gang has about themselves, he tells Mac that "you think that you're tough, and that you're straight." After a pause, Mac retorts "I AM tough!" Further, in episode 6 of season 10, "The Gang Misses the Boat," Mac convinces The Gang that he is sleeping with an attractive woman; however, they later discover that he merely paid her with angel dust to pretend they were together. She tells them that he "couldn't even get it up" for her.

In episode 9 of season 11, Mac, while on a Christian cruise, discovers that two other male passengers are gay and sets out to "convert" them. The two, however, "convert" Mac within minutes. This supposed realization of his repressed homosexuality results in the end of his belief in God. After The Gang is informed by Mac of his new identity, they tell him they've known since the first day they met him and proceed to move on with their self-involved lives. In the season 11 finale, Mac and the rest of The Gang are trapped inside the ship's brig and Mac tries one last time to pray to God to save all of them from imminent death (as the ship has presumably capsized and the room is filling with water). They are released in the nick of time. Mac later explains to The Gang and an insurance claim agent that God does exist and he, Mac, is indeed straight, because his prayer was answered and no loving God "would make" him gay. In episode 6 of season 12, the gang uses Mac's altered workout bike as evidence of his homosexuality during a legal arbitration. Mac is forced to admit his sexuality to win the dispute, but the gang expects him to return to the closet after the process is over. However, when given an opportunity to retract his admission, Mac finally decides to embrace his identity.

==Weight gain==
At the start of season 7, Mac has gained at least 60 pounds of fat, which he saw as a step to developing muscle ("cultivating mass" in his words) to go from "a tiny twink to [a] muscle-bound freak." In the episode "How Mac Got Fat," he goes into greater detail about his intentions, explaining that earlier, the Gang had decided to replace themselves with avatars to run Paddy's Pub so they could slack off. Mac's avatar was a bodybuilder. When Dee points out that the avatar doesn't look like him because he has more muscle, Mac starts gaining weight in an attempt to become the same size as the bodybuilder. Eventually the Gang drops the avatar plan and everything goes back to normal, but Mac is stuck with his dangerous weight gain. The rest of The Gang agrees he looks unhealthy—Dennis is personally outraged by the sight of his gut—but Mac is indifferent to their opinions despite developing [[diabetes]] as a result of his new eating habits.

The weight gain was real. Rob McElhenney has stated in interviews that he wanted to make Mac fat as his own way of fighting the trend of actors on TV shows getting more attractive as a show gains success (he specifically talked about ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and how the nerdy lead characters were better-dressed and had trendier hairstyles as the show became a huge hit for CBS), and that it also made sense that Mac would be aging badly thanks to the reckless, selfish, and stupid lifestyle of which he and the rest of the characters are so proud.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

To gain the weight for Season 7 in the healthiest way possible, McElhenney worked with a nutritionist recommended by professional baseball player [[Chase Utley]] (who had played himself in the Season 6 episode "[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 6)#ep68|The Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/dnhollywood/Utley-tip-helped-Sunny-star-pack-on-pounds.html|title=Utley tip helped 'Sunny' star pack on pounds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ate an average of 5,000 calories a day during the weight gain, and lost the weight by returning to his normal eating and workout routines.

[[File:Nalaswan barley shoots.jpg|thumb|200px|Nalāswān or barley shoots]]

'''Mohani''' ([[Devanagari]]: मोहनि) is one of the most important festivals among the [[Newar]]s which involves a packed itinerary of religious services, pilgrimages, family gatherings and outdoor celebrations lasting several days. Special dinners known as Nakhtya (नख्त्या), to which all the relatives are invited, continue for weeks later. Mohani is the equivalent of [[Nepal]]'s biggest festival [[Dasain]], and there are similarities and differences between the two.

The festival has been variously described as a celebration of [[Hindu]] Goddess [[Durga]] slaying the demon [[Mahisasur]], Goddess [[Chamunda]] destroying the demon Chunda and Indian emperor [[Ashoka]] renouncing arms in disgust after a particularly bloody battle and becoming a [[Buddhist]]. Mohani is celebrated according to the [[lunar calendar]], so the dates are changeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Anderson |first= Mary M. |title= The Festivals of Nepal |year=2005 |publisher= Rupa &amp; Company |location= |isbn=9788129106858 |pages=142–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Mitra |first=Kalyan |title= Mohani Nakha|url= |newspaper= Sandhya Times |date=11 October 2013 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main celebrations last for four days from the 8th to the 11th days of the bright half of [[Kaula (month)|Kaulā]] (कौला), the twelfth month in the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar.

==Family events==

Mohani starts with Nalāswane (नःलास्वने), the planting of barley seeds, on the first day of the fortnight. The seeds are planted in sand in earthen basins and small bowls. This is done in the shrine room at one's home and at the Agam Chhen (आगं छेँ) the house where the family's [[tutelary deity]] is installed.

A week later, a family feast known as Kuchhi Bhoy (कूछि भ्वय्) is held on the day of [[Ashtami]], the eighth day of the fortnight as per the [[lunar calendar]]. Family members sit in a row for the feast with the eldest taking the place of honor at the top and the youngest at the bottom.

The next day, known as Syākwa Tyākwa (स्याक्व त्याक्व), is [[Navami]], the ninth day of the fortnight in the lunar calendar. Sacred rituals are performed at the shrine room of the tutelary deity. People also make sacred offerings to their tools of the trade, weighing scales, looms, machinery and vehicles. The Taleju Temple located at [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]] and [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]] are opened to the public on this day only, and devotees visit the temple to offer worship to the goddess, who is also the tutelary deity of Nepal's [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] kings of old. The day ends with another grand family feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoek|first1= Bert van den|last2=Shrestha |first2= Balgopal |title=Guardians of the Royal Goddess: Daitya and Kumar as the Protectors of Taleju Bhavani of Kathmandu |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_19_02_03.pdf |accessdate=4 October 2013 |newspaper=CNAS Journal|page=191 |date=July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day is Chālan (चालं), which occurs on [[Dashami]], the tenth day of the fortnight. Family members go to the shrine room of their tutelary deity for a service. They receive bunches of barley shoots planted on the first day as sacred gifts. Dabs of red paste are put on their foreheads as a blessing.

Other ceremonies consist of chopping up an ash gourd painted with the face of the devil at the shrine house of the tutelary deity. In some localities, participants parade through the streets holding ceremonial swords aloft prior to the event. The procession is known as Pāyā (पाया). The festivities end with another family feast in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pradhan |first=Ishwar Man |year=2001 |title=Jheegu Tajilajii Nakhah Wa Jatra |edition=1st |publisher=Nepal Bhasa Academy |location=Kathmandu |language=Newari|trans-title=Festivals and Processions in Our Culture |pages=40–52|chapter=Mohani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community events==

The Pachali Bhairav Jātrā is a procession held in [[Kathmandu]] to honor the deity Pachali [[Bhairava|Bhairav]] whose shrine is located at the southern part of the historic section of the city. The parade takes place on the fifth day of the fortnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Anderson |first= Mary M. |title= The Festivals of Nepal |year=2005 |publisher= Rupa &amp; Company |location= |isbn=9788129106858 |pages=156–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikāli Jātrā is a sacred masked dance festival which is held as part of the celebrations of Mohani. It takes place in [[Khokana]], a village to the south of Kathmandu, on the seventh day of the fortnight. The festival consists of dance performances and religious rituals, and continues for five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sikali Jatra lights up Khokana|url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/10/10/nation/sikali-jatra-lights-up-khokana/254618.html |newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhaktapur]], the masked dance of Nava Durgā is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nepa.com.np/jhinewa/article.php?type=festivals&amp;id=navadurga |title= Nava Durga Dance - Bhaktapur |last= Manandhar |first= Jnan Kaji | date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nava Durga means group of nine goddesses who are believed to protect the city from external harm. Nine shrines dedicated to the deities mark the city's perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Teilhet |first= Jehanne H. |title= The Tradition of the Nava Durga in Bhaktapur, Nepal |url= http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/kailash/pdf/kailash_06_02_01.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2013 |newspaper=Kailash|pages=82–98 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a courtyard inside the old royal palace at [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]], masked dancers representing [[Matrikas|Asta Matrikā]] (eight mother goddesses) reenact the victory of Goddess Durga over the demon Mahisasur. The performances were begun in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wright |first= Daniel |title= History of Nepal |url= https://www.google.com.np/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:8120605527 |accessdate= 5 October 2013|year=1877 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |isbn=9788120605527 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asta Matrika dance is also performed to remove obstacles in the city caused by bad spirits. Worshipping the eight goddesses is believed to bring good to the country and the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shakya |first= Min Bahadur |title= The Astamatrika Dance |url= http://buddhim.20m.com/6-5.htm |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Himalayan Times |url=http://epaper.thehimalayantimes.com//PUBLICATIONS/THT/THT/2013/10/08/ArticleHtmls/08102013001027.shtml?Mode=1 |newspaper= |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bungamati|Bunga]], 9&amp;nbsp;km south of Kathmandu, a festive parade of Goddess [[Manakamana]] is held on the ninth day of the fortnight. A dance featuring a masked man riding a [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]] is also shown, among other performances.

Asanbhalu Dyah Jātrā, also known as Annapurna Jatra, is held on the 11th day of the fortnight. An image of the goddess Asanbhalu Ajimā, the patron deity of [[Asan, Kathmandu]], is placed on a palanquin and carried around town accompanied by musical bands. The Asan Pāyā sword procession is also held on this day, with the youngest member of the community leading the parade. The day is the last day of Mohani for the locals of Asan, and is known as Asan Chālan.

The sacred [[Kumha Pyakhan dance]] used to be performed at Durbar Square and Asan as symbolic protection of the image of the goddess Taleju when it is brought out of her temple during Mohani.

==Music of the season==

The [[Malshree dhun]](मालश्री धुन) is played and heard during this time. The joyous melody is one of the six seasonal tunes in traditional [[Newa music|Newar music]].

==Kite flying==

Flying kites is the most popular sport that people engage in on the sidelines of Mohani. This is the season for flying kites because of the pleasant weather and windy conditions. Rooftops and open fields are crowded with revelers, and dogfights in the sky in which kite fliers try to cut the opponent's line with one's line are keenly watched. The kites are highly maneuverable, and are flown using a spindle. The line is coated with [[Manja (kite)|mājā]], a sticky paste mixed with powdered glass to help cut the opponent's line.

The most common social belief regarding the tradition of flying kites is that kites go up to the heavens carrying a message to the gods to stop sending rain for the year. Another belief says that it brings prosperity to the family. Flying kites is also believed to be a way of communicating with one's ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~et3m-tkkw/nepal-01.html |title= Kite-Flying Heritage in Nepal |last= Tuladhar |first= Nirmal Man |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations outside Nepal==
[[File:Paya lhasa 1950s.jpg|thumb|200px|Paya procession in Lhasa, ca. 1950s]]
Newar expatriates in [[Tibet]] used to celebrate Mohani like in Kathmandu, and they held the Paya procession on the 10th day of the fortnight. In [[Lhasa]], the participants holding swords paraded around the [[Barkhor]] accompanied by musical bands playing nāykhin (नायखिं) drums. They went to the Nepalese Legation for the ceremony where they chopped up a radish. After the ceremony, they returned to their own places in a similar procession.

There was another pageant in which the merchants carried a huge demon mask. The parade was led by a few men dressed in women's clothes. The Paya ceremony was also celebrated in other towns in Tibet like [[Shigatse]] and [[Gyantse]] where there were [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newar]] merchants and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Nhuchhe Bahadur |editor-first=Kesar |editor-last=Lall |title=The Newar Merchants in Lhasa |publisher=[[Ratna Pustak Bhandar]] |date= 2001 |page=98 |chapter=A Tibetan Odyssey |isbn=99933-0-187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuladhar |first= Kamal Ratna| title=Caravan to Lhasa |year= 2011|publisher=Lijala &amp; Tisa |location=Kathmandu |isbn=99946-58-91-3 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, with Nepalese migrating to various parts of the world to work or settle, they have been celebrating their festivals wherever they reside with community feasts and cultural programs.

'''NOOMA''' is a series of short films produced by Flannel promoting spiritual reflections on individual life experiences. The name NOOMA comes from a [[phonetic]] spelling of the Greek word {{lang|el|πνευμα}} ([[pneuma]]), meaning "wind", "spirit", or "breath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compassion/Nooma Film Creates Powerful Message of Unfair Grace|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/compassion-nooma-film-creates-powerful-message-of-unfair-grace-1234134.htm|publisher=Market Wire|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The video series consists of 24 videos created from 2002-2009 featuring Christian teacher [[Rob Bell]].

==Format==
Each film is about 10 to 14 minutes of Christian teaching related to real-life situations. Each short story covers a specific topic, usually by relating various experiences from a Christian perspective. Each NOOMA video features the teaching of former [[Mars Hill Bible Church]] teaching pastor [[Rob Bell]]. The NOOMA videos are subtitled in English,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013|reason=are they subtitled in English or are they available with described text or closed captioning in English?}} Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Mandarin and Korean.

The executive director of Flannel, the producer of NOOMA, announced in 2009 plans to feature additional Christian teachers in future NOOMA films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCellan|first=Scott|title=Producer Spotlight: NOOMA|url=http://echohub.com/posts/video/producer-spotlight-nooma/?from=collide|publisher=EchoHub|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable locations==
Most NOOMAs featuring are shot on location in [[Western Michigan]] or the Chicago area. However, NOOMAs "Today | 017" and "Name | 018" were both filmed in the [[Jacksonville]], Florida area. The [[Amway Grand Plaza Hotel]] is prominent in "Trees". A restaurant called The Rainbow Grill in [[Grandville, Michigan]] was used for "Sunday". The [[Gerald R. Ford International Airport]] is featured in "Luggage". The [[Van Andel Arena]] is featured in "Bullhorn". A beach along [[Lake Michigan]] is featured in "Kickball". "Breathe" is shot in the [[Lake/State (CTA)|Lake]] station on the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red Line]] in downtown Chicago. "Open" was filmed at the new Metro Health Hospital in [[Wyoming]], Michigan three months before the hospital opened its doors. "Shells" was filmed primarily at the Pew Campus of [[Grand Valley State University]] with several shots of Rob Bell sitting in the Steelcase Library.

==History==
Originally, the [[non-profit]] company Fringe began making the NOOMA films in September 2001. The first film in the series was titled "Rain", and made in collaboration with co-writer, director Adam Stielstra and producer Brett Van Til. Fringe later changed its name to Flannel and is located in Grandville, Michigan. Since November 2002, Flannel has distributed the films through their website, NOOMA.com. A soundtrack featuring music from the first ten films (plus "Flowers" from 013) became available in December 2005 through NOOMA.com and digital music outlets.

In March 2005, [[Zondervan]] started distributing the series, making it available to retail markets. The entire look of the NOOMA series changed when Zondervan began distributing the films. Previously, the first 10 NOOMAs had been available as DVDs in clear and light blue plastic packaging. New packaging which accompanied the re-release of 001–010 and all subsequent episodes features a paper case and a 32-page discussion book. The books feature [[Scripture]], stills from the film, questions related to the film's topic, and a single fun fact for each episode, usually about some production aspect of the film.

A '''naturalistic planned language''' is a [[constructed language]] specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary from a group of closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be relatively easier to use passively -- in many cases, without prior study -- by speakers of one or more languages in the group.

The term is most commonly used to apply to pan-[[Romance languages|Romance]] planned languages, though there have also been a few pan-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]], pan-[[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and even pan-[[Celtic languages|Celtic]] naturalistic planned languages.

Since the creation of such a language often includes shared idiosyncrasies from the source languages, active use seems to be generally more difficult to learn than for [[schematic planned language|schematic planned languages]], though because of grammatical simplification considerably easier than for ethnic languages of the same type.

The best known languages of this type are [[Occidental language|Occidental]] and [[Interlingua]]. These two also are designed as [[international auxiliary language]]s.

'''Needle time''' was created in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] to restrict the amount of recorded music that could be transmitted by the [[BBC]] during the course of any 24-hour period.  The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]] and the [[Independent Local Radio]] stations until 1988.

The result was that the BBC had to use "cover" versions of popular songs by groups such as [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]] recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours.

The term "needle time" comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a [[magnetic cartridge|gramophone needle]].

==Needle time notice==
Unlike American records, British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: "Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited."

===Radio Luxembourg===
Although the record industry in [[UK|Britain]] wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The "208" shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the ''[[Decca Records]] Show'' or the ''[[Capitol Records]] Show''. These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as [[Infomercials]], because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label.

Because all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented.

===The "pirate stations"===
Unlike the [[BBC]] or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore [[pirate radio]] stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of [[territorial waters]], but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as [[Wonderful Radio London]] which introduced [[top 40]] radio to Britain, the ship was actually registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which of course did not recognize "needle time". [[Payola]] operated on several of these stations.

'''''Parable of the Sower''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Octavia E. Butler]], the first in a two-book series. It was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Octavia E. Butler, Science Fiction Writer, Dies at 58|author=Fox, Margalit|date=March 1, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/books/01butler.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the 2020s where society has largely collapsed due to climate change, growing wealth inequality, and corporate greed, ''Parable of the Sower'' centers on a young woman named Lauren Oya Olamina who possesses what Butler dubbed hyperempathy or "sharing" – the ability to feel pain and other sensations she witnesses. As a teenager growing up in the remnants of a [[gated community]] near Los Angeles, she begins to develop a new belief system, which she comes to call Earthseed. When the community's security is compromised, her home is destroyed and her family is murdered, and she travels north with other survivors. Society outside the community walls has reverted to chaos due to resource scarcity and poverty, and mixed race relationships are stigmatized amid attacks against religious and ethnic minorities. Lauren believes that humankind's destiny is to travel beyond Earth and live on other planets, forcing humankind into its adulthood, and that Earthseed is preparation for this destiny. She gathers followers along her journey north and founds the first Earthseed community, Acorn, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Proposed third ''Parable'' novel==
Butler had planned to write a third ''Parable'' novel, tentatively titled ''Parable of the Trickster'', which would have focused on the community's struggle to survive on a new planet. She began this novel after finishing ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]'', and mentioned her work on it in a number of interviews, but at some point encountered [[writer's block]]. She eventually shifted her creative attention, resulting in ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'', her final novel. The various false starts for the novel can now be found among Butler's papers at the [[Huntington Library]], as described in an article at the ''Los Angeles Review of Books''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/theres-nothing-new-sun-new-suns-recovering-octavia-e-butlers-lost-parables | title="There's Nothing New / Under The Sun, / But There Are New Suns": Recovering Octavia E.

==Adaptations==

''Parable of the Sower'' was adapted as ''Parable of the Sower: The Concert Version'', a work-in-progress opera written by American folk/blues musician [[Toshi Reagon]] in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]]. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll]], and [[folk music]] into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was performed as part of [[The Public Theater]]'s [[Under the Radar Festival]] in New York City in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Grace.

==In popular culture==
''Parable of the Sower'' was referred to in hip-hop artist [[Talib Kweli]]'s song "Ms. Hill" off his mixtape ''[[Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD]]''. In the song, which is about [[Lauryn Hill]], Kweli references how Lauryn Hill used to come into [[Nkiru]] (a bookstore Kweli owns in [[Brooklyn]], New York) and liked to buy [[Octavia Butler]] books, namely ''Parable of the Sower''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} "We used to chill at Nkiru / her moms was a customer / she used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler / Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ms. Hill|work=Anysonglyrics.com|url=http://www.anysonglyrics.com/lyrics/t/talib/Ms-Hill-Lyrics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lauren Beukes]]' 2013 novel ''[[The Shining Girls]]'', the body of one of the victims, Jin-Sook Au, a social worker, is found with a copy of ''Parable of the Sower''.

Part of the central verse of [[Earthseed]], "All that you touch you change, all that you change changes you", is included in track 2 and 6 of Sugar Candy Mountain's album ''666''.

The work of hip hop/R&amp;B duo [[THEESatisfaction]] was influenced by Octavia Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://fryemuseum.org/blog/?p=845#more |title=Attention Earthlings! |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher =|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third track from their 2012 album ''[[awE NaturalE]]'', "Earthseed", contains themes from the ''Parable'' series: "Change there are few words / That you can say / We all watch things morphing everyday."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://genius.com/Theesatisfaction-earthseed-lyrics| title=Earthseed - lyrics |last=| first=| date=| website=| publisher=| access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number '''{{pi}}''' ({{IPAc-en|p|aɪ}}) is a [[mathematical constant]].  Originally defined as the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]], it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].  It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter "{{pi}}" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as "'''pi'''". It is also called '''Archimedes' constant'''.

Being an [[irrational number]], {{pi}} cannot be expressed as a [[common fraction]] (equivalently, its [[decimal representation]] never ends and never [[repeating decimal|settles into a permanently repeating pattern]]). Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to [[Approximations of π|approximate]] {{pi}}. The digits appear to be [[random sequence|randomly distributed]]. In particular, the digit sequence of {{pi}} is conjectured to satisfy a [[normal number|specific kind of statistical randomness]], but to date, no proof of this has been discovered. Also, {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]]; that is, it is not the [[Root of a polynomial|root]] of any [[polynomial]] having [[Rational number|rational]] [[coefficient]]s. This transcendence of {{pi}} implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of [[squaring the circle]] with a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]].

[[History of mathematics|Ancient civilizations]] required fairly accurate computed values to approximate {{pi}} for practical reasons, including the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]]. Around 250 BC the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archimedes]] created an algorithm for calculating it. In the 5th century AD [[Chinese mathematics]] approximated {{pi}} to seven digits, while [[Indian mathematics]] made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The historically first exact formula for {{pi}}, based on [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], was not available until a millennium later, when in the 14th century the [[Leibniz formula for pi|Madhava–Leibniz series]] was discovered in Indian mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Functions |first1=George E. |last1=Andrews |first2=Richard |last2=Askey |first3=Ranjan |last3=Roy |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-78988-2|page=58|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=R.

Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle, {{pi}} is found in many formulae in [[trigonometry]] and [[geometry]], especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres. In more modern [[mathematical analysis]], the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the [[real number]] system, as an [[eigenvalue]] or a [[periodic function|period]], without any reference to geometry.  It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as [[number theory]] and [[statistics]], as well as in almost all areas of [[physics]]. The ubiquity of {{pi}} makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community. Several books devoted to {{pi}} have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of {{pi}} often result in news headlines. Attempts to [[Piphilology|memorize the value of {{pi}}]] with increasing precision have led to records of over 70,000 digits.

===Name===
The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is the lowercase [[Pi (letter)|Greek letter {{pi}}]], sometimes spelled out as ''pi,'' and derived from the first letter of the Greek word ''perimetros,'' meaning circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boeing |first=Niels |date=14 March 2016 |url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-wissen/2016/02/pi-tag-mathematik-pi-kreiszahl |title=Die Welt ist Pi |trans-title=The World is Pi |language=de |journal=Zeit Online |quote=''Die Ludolphsche Zahl oder Kreiszahl erhielt nun auch das Symbol, unter dem wir es heute kennen: William Jones schlug 1706 den griechischen Buchstaben π vor, in Anlehnung an perimetros, griechisch für Umfang. Leonhard Euler etablierte π schließlich in seinen mathematischen Schriften.'' [The Ludolphian number or circle number now also received the symbol under which we know it today: William Jones proposed in 1706 the Greek letter π, based on perimetros [περίμετρος], Greek for perimeter. Leonhard Euler firmly established π in his mathematical writings.] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317050313/http://www.zeit.de/zeit-wissen/2016/02/pi-tag-mathematik-pi-kreiszahl |archivedate=17 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, {{pi}} is [[English pronunciation of Greek letters|pronounced as "pie"]] ({{IPAc-en|p|aɪ}}, {{respell|py}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pi?s=t|title=pi|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|date=2 March 1993|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728121603/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pi?s=t|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematical use, the lowercase letter {{pi}} (or π in [[sans-serif]] font) is distinguished from its capitalized and enlarged counterpart {{math|∏}}, which denotes a [[product of a sequence]], analogous to how {{math|∑}} denotes [[summation]].

The choice of the symbol {{pi}} is discussed in the section [[#Adoption of the symbol π|''Adoption of the symbol {{pi}}'']].

===Definition===
[[File:Pi eq C over d.svg|alt=A diagram of a circle, with the width labeled as diameter, and the perimeter labeled as circumference|thumb|right|The circumference of a circle is slightly more than three times as long as its diameter. The exact ratio is called {{pi}}.]]
{{pi}} is commonly defined as the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] {{math|''C''}} to its [[diameter]] {{math|''d''}}:&lt;ref name="Arndt"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \frac{C}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
The ratio {{math|''C''/''d''}} is constant, regardless of the circle's size. For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio {{math|''C''/''d''}}. This definition of {{pi}} implicitly makes use of [[Euclidean geometry|flat (Euclidean) geometry]]; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any [[Non-Euclidean geometry|curved (non-Euclidean) geometry]], these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula {{math|{{pi}} {{=}} ''C''/''d''}}.&lt;ref name="Arndt" /&gt;

Here, the circumference of a circle is the [[arc length]] around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], a concept in [[calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tom |last=Apostol |authorlink=Tom Apostol |title=Calculus, volume 1 |publisher=Wiley |edition=2nd |year=1967}}. p. 102: "From a logical point of view, this is unsatisfactory at the present stage because we have not yet discussed the concept of arc length."  Arc length is introduced on p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one may directly compute the arc length of the top half of the unit circle, given in [[Cartesian coordinates]] by the equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}, as the [[integral]]:&lt;ref name="Reinhold Remmert 1991 129"&gt;{{citation|first=Reinhold|last=Remmert|chapter=What is {{pi}}?|title=Numbers|publisher=Springer|year=1991|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
An integral such as this was adopted as the definition of {{pi}} by [[Karl Weierstrass]], who defined it directly as an integral in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Remmert|1991}}.  The precise integral that Weierstrass used was &lt;math&gt;\pi=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{1+x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of {{pi}} such as these that rely on a notion of circumference, and hence implicitly on concepts of the [[integral calculus]], are no longer common in the literature.  {{harvtxt|Remmert|1991}} explains that this is because in many modern treatments of calculus, [[differential calculus]] typically precedes integral calculus in the university curriculum, so it is desirable to have a definition of {{pi}} that does not rely on the latter.  One such definition, due to [[Richard Baltzer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard |last=Baltzer |authorlink=Richard Baltzer |title=Die Elemente der Mathematik |language=de |trans-title=The Elements of Mathematics |year=1870 |page=195 |url=https://archive.org/details/dieelementederm02baltgoog |publisher=Hirzel |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914204826/https://archive.org/details/dieelementederm02baltgoog |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Edmund Landau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Edmund |last=Landau |authorlink=Edmund Landau |title=Einführung in die Differentialrechnung und Integralrechnung |language=de |publisher=Noordoff |year=1934 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the following: {{pi}} is twice the smallest positive number at which the [[cosine|cosine function]] equals 0.&lt;ref name="Arndt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinhold Remmert 1991 129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudin 1976"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|ref=harv}}, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cosine can be defined independently of geometry as a [[power series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Real and complex analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1986|ref=harv}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or as the solution of a [[differential equation]].&lt;ref name="Rudin 1976"/&gt;

In a similar spirit, {{pi}} can be defined instead using properties of the [[complex exponential]], {{math|exp(''z'')}}, of a [[complex number|complex]] variable {{math|''z''}}.  Like the cosine, the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways.  The set of complex numbers at which {{math|exp(''z'')}} is equal to one is then an (imaginary) arithmetic progression of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\{\dots,-2\pi i, 0, 2\pi i, 4\pi i,\dots\} = \{2\pi ki\mid k\in\mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;
and there is a unique positive real number {{pi}} with this property.&lt;ref name="Reinhold Remmert 1991 129"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Lars |last=Ahlfors |authorlink=Lars Ahlfors |title=Complex analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1966 |p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more abstract variation on the same idea, making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of [[topology]] and [[algebra]], is the following theorem:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |title=Topologie generale |publisher=Springer |year=1981}}, §VIII.2.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a unique ([[up to]] [[automorphism]]) [[continuous function|continuous]] [[isomorphism]] from the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''R'''/'''Z''' of real numbers under addition [[quotient group|modulo]] integers (the [[circle group]]) onto the multiplicative group of [[complex numbers]] of [[absolute value]] one.  The number {{pi}} is then defined as half the magnitude of the derivative of this homomorphism.&lt;ref name="Nicolas Bourbaki"&gt;{{citation |last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |title=Fonctions d'une variable réelle |language=fr |publisher=Springer |year=1979}}, §II.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A circle encloses the largest area that can be attained within a given perimeter.  Thus the number {{pi}} is also characterized as the best constant in the [[isoperimetric inequality]] (times one-fourth).  There are many other, closely related, ways in which {{pi}} appears as an [[eigenvalue]] of some geometrical or physical process; see [[#Eigenvalues|below]].

===Irrationality and normality===
{{pi}} is an [[irrational number]], meaning that it cannot be written as the [[rational number|ratio of two integers]] (fractions such as {{math|{{sfrac|22|7}}}} are commonly used to approximate {{pi}}, but no [[common fraction]] (ratio of whole numbers) can be its exact value).&lt;ref name="Arndt_i"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because {{pi}} is irrational, it has an infinite number of digits in its [[decimal representation]], and it does not settle into an infinitely [[repeating decimal|repeating pattern]] of digits. There are several [[proof that π is irrational|proofs that {{pi}} is irrational]]; they generally require calculus and rely on the ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' technique. The degree to which {{pi}} can be approximated by [[rational number]]s (called the [[irrationality measure]]) is not precisely known; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of {{math|''e''}} or {{math|ln(2)}} but smaller than the measure of [[Liouville number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salikhov|first1=V.|year=2008|title=On the Irrationality Measure of pi|journal=Russian Mathematical Surveys|volume=53|issue=3|pages=570–572|ref=harv|doi=10.1070/RM2008v063n03ABEH004543|bibcode = 2008RuMaS..63..570S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digits of {{pi}} have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for [[statistical randomness]], including tests for [[normal number|normality]]; a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits (of any given length) appear equally often.&lt;ref name="random" /&gt; The conjecture that {{pi}} is [[normal number|normal]] has not been proven or disproven.&lt;ref name="random"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=22–23}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/pi-random.html|title=Are The Digits of Pi Random? Lab Researcher May Hold The Key|first=Paul|last=Preuss|authorlink=Paul Preuss (author)|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|date=23 July 2001|accessdate=10 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020010208/http://lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/pi-random.html|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the advent of computers, a large number of digits of {{pi}} have been available on which to perform statistical analysis. [[Yasumasa Kanada]] has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of {{pi}} and found them consistent with normality; for example, the frequencies of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to [[statistical significance test]]s, and no evidence of a pattern was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=22, 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the [[infinite monkey theorem]].  Thus, because the sequence of {{pi}}'s digits passes statistical tests for randomness, it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non-random, such as a [[Six nines in pi|sequence of six consecutive 9s]] that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also called the "Feynman point" in [[mathematical folklore]], after [[Richard Feynman]], although no connection to Feynman is known.

===Transcendence===
[[File:Squaring the circle.svg|thumb|alt=A diagram of a square and circle, both with identical area; the length of the side of the square is the square root of pi|Because {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]], [[squaring the circle]] is not possible in a finite number of steps using the classical tools of [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]].]]
In addition to being irrational, more strongly {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]], which means that it is not the [[solution (equation)|solution]] of any non-constant [[polynomial equation]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients, such as {{math|{{sfrac|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;|120}} − {{sfrac|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|6}} + ''x'' {{=}} 0}}.&lt;ref name="ttop"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Mayer |url=http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/way/po28/maths/docs/pi.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000929033317/http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/way/po28/maths/docs/pi.html |archive-date=2000-09-29 |title=The Transcendence of {{pi}}|accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The polynomial shown is the first few terms of the [[Taylor series]] expansion of the [[sine]] function.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcendence of {{pi}} has two important consequences: First, {{pi}} cannot be expressed using any finite combination of rational numbers and square roots or [[n-th root|''n''-th roots]] such as {{math|{{radic|31|3}}}} or {{math|{{sqrt|10}}}}. Second, since no transcendental number can be [[Constructible number|constructed]] with [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]], it is not possible to "[[squaring the circle|square the circle]]". In other words, it is impossible to construct, using compass and straightedge alone, a square whose area is exactly equal to the area of a given circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eymard|Lafon|1999|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle and sometimes claim success despite the fact that it is mathematically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|1989|p=37}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlager|first=Neil|last2=Lauer|first2=Josh|title=Science and Its Times: Understanding the Social Significance of Scientific Discovery|publisher=Gale Group|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7876-3933-4|ref=harv}}, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued fractions===
[[File:Matheon2.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the Greek letter pi, created as a large stone mosaic embedded in the ground.|The constant {{pi}} is represented in this [[mosaic]] outside the Mathematics Building at the [[Technical University of Berlin]].]]
Like all irrational numbers, {{pi}} cannot be represented as a [[common fraction]] (also known as a [[Simple fractions|simple]] or [[vulgar fraction]]), by the very definition of "irrational number" (that is, "not a rational number"). But every irrational number, including {{pi}}, can be represented by an infinite series of nested fractions, called a [[continued fraction]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi=3+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{7+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{15+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{1+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{292+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{1+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{1+\textstyle \cfrac{1}{1+\ddots}}}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Truncating the continued fraction at any point yields a rational approximation for {{pi}}; the first four of these are 3, 22/7, 333/106, and 355/113. These numbers are among the most well-known and widely used historical approximations of the constant. Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation; that is, each is closer to {{pi}} than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator.&lt;ref name="Eymard 1999 78"&gt;{{harvnb|Eymard|Lafon|1999|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because {{pi}} is known to be transcendental, it is by definition not [[algebraic number|algebraic]] and so cannot be a [[quadratic irrational]]. Therefore, {{pi}} cannot have a [[periodic continued fraction]]. Although the simple continued fraction for {{pi}} (shown above) also does not exhibit any other obvious pattern,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A001203|name=Continued fraction for Pi}} Retrieved 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; mathematicians have discovered several [[generalized continued fraction]]s that do, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Elegant Continued Fraction for {{pi}}|first=L.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\pi &amp; = \textstyle \cfrac{4}{1+\textstyle \cfrac{1^2}{2+\textstyle \cfrac{3^2}{2+\textstyle \cfrac{5^2}{2+\textstyle \cfrac{7^2}{2+\textstyle \cfrac{9^2}{2+\ddots}}}}}}

In the [[Polar coordinate system#Complex numbers|polar coordinate system]], one number ([[radius]] or ''r'') is used to represent {{math|''z''}}'s distance from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of the [[complex plane]] and the other (angle or {{math|φ}}) to represent a counter-clockwise [[rotation]] from the positive real line as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ayers|1964|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z = r\cdot(\cos\varphi + i\sin\varphi),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]] satisfying {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} = −1. The frequent appearance of {{pi}} in [[complex analysis]] can be related to the behavior of the [[exponential function]] of a complex variable, described by [[Euler's formula]]:&lt;ref name="EF"&gt;{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|p=592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\varphi} = \cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

where [[E (mathematical constant)|the constant {{math|''e''}}]] is the base of the [[natural logarithm]]. This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of {{math|''e''}} and points on the [[unit circle]] centered at the origin of the complex plane. Setting {{math|''φ''}} = {{pi}} in Euler's formula results in [[Euler's identity]], celebrated by mathematicians because it contains the five most important mathematical constants:&lt;ref name="EF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli, ''E: The Story of a Number'', Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 160, {{isbn|978-0-691-14134-3}} ("five most important" constants).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

There are {{math|''n''}} different [[complex number]]s {{math|''z''}} satisfying {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, and these are called the "{{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity|roots of unity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|RootofUnity|Roots of Unity}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are given by this formula:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{2 \pi i k/n} \qquad (k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n - 1).&lt;/math&gt;

===Antiquity===
The best-known approximations to {{pi}} dating [[1st millennium BC|before the Common Era]] were accurate to two decimal places; this was improved upon in [[Chinese mathematics]] in particular by the mid-first millennium, to an accuracy of seven decimal places.
After this, no further progress was made until the late medieval period.

Some Egyptologists&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, W.M.F. ''Wisdom of the Egyptians'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians used an approximation of {{pi}} as {{sfrac|22|7}} from as early as the [[Old Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], supposedly built so that the circle whose radius is equal to the height of the pyramid has a circumference equal to the perimeter of the base (it is 1760 [[cubits]] around and 280 cubits in height).

The earliest written approximations of {{pi}} are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Babylon]], both within one percent of the true value. In Babylon, a [[clay tablet]] dated 1900–1600&amp;nbsp;BC has a geometrical statement that, by implication, treats {{pi}} as {{sfrac|25|8}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.125.&lt;ref name="Arndt_d"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, the [[Rhind Papyrus]], dated around 1650&amp;nbsp;BC but copied from a document dated to 1850&amp;nbsp;BC, has a formula for the area of a circle that treats {{pi}} as ({{sfrac|16|9}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3.1605.&lt;ref name="Arndt_d" /&gt;

Astronomical calculations in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' (ca. 4th century BC) use a fractional approximation of {{sfrac|339|108}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3.139 (an accuracy of 9×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Chaitanya, Krishna.

===Polygon approximation era===
[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|350px|right|thumb|alt=diagram of a hexagon and pentagon circumscribed outside a circle|{{pi}} can be estimated by computing the perimeters of circumscribed and inscribed polygons.]]
The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of {{pi}} was a geometrical approach using polygons, devised around 250&amp;nbsp;BC by the Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1,000 years, and as a result {{pi}} is sometimes referred to as "Archimedes' constant".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=175, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of {{pi}} by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle, and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96-sided regular polygon. By calculating the perimeters of these polygons, he proved that {{math|{{sfrac|223|71}} &lt; {{pi}} &lt; {{sfrac|22|7}}}} (that is {{math|3.1408 &lt; {{pi}} &lt; 3.1429}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29504-the-computation-of-pi-by-archimedes/content/html/ComputationOfPiByArchimedes.html#37|title=The Computation of Pi by Archimedes: The Computation of Pi by Archimedes – File Exchange – MATLAB Central|publisher=Mathworks.com|accessdate=2013-03-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225181030/http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29504-the-computation-of-pi-by-archimedes/content/html/ComputationOfPiByArchimedes.html#37|archivedate=25 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes' upper bound of {{math|{{sfrac|22|7}}}} may have led to a widespread popular belief that {{pi}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|22|7}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 150 AD, Greek-Roman scientist [[Ptolemy]], in his ''[[Almagest]]'', gave a value for {{pi}} of 3.1416, which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from [[Apollonius of Perga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=176}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=168}}&lt;!--may be suspect--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of {{pi}} in 1630, a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits.&lt;ref name="ArPI"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=15–16, 175, 184–186, 205}}. Grienberger achieved 39 digits in 1630; Sharp 71 digits in 1699.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archimedes by Giuseppe Nogari.png|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man studying|[[Archimedes]] developed the polygonal approach to approximating {{pi}}.]]

In [[ancient China]], values for {{pi}} included 3.1547 (around 1 AD), {{math|{{sqrt|10}}}} (100 AD, approximately 3.1623), and {{math|{{sfrac|142|45}}}} (3rd century, approximately 3.1556).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 265 AD, the [[Cao Wei|Wei Kingdom]] mathematician [[Liu Hui]] created a [[Liu Hui's π algorithm|polygon-based iterative algorithm]] and used it with a 3,072-sided polygon to obtain a value of {{pi}} of&amp;nbsp;3.1416.&lt;ref name="autogenerated202"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu later invented a faster method of calculating {{pi}} and obtained a value of 3.14 with a 96-sided polygon, by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor of&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref name="autogenerated202" /&gt; The Chinese mathematician [[Zu Chongzhi]], around 480 AD, calculated that {{math|{{pi}} ≈ {{sfrac|355|113}}}} (a fraction that goes by the name ''[[Milü]]'' in Chinese), using [[Liu Hui's π algorithm|Liu Hui's algorithm]] applied to a 12,288-sided polygon. With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits, this value of 3.141592920 remained the most accurate approximation of {{pi}} available for the next 800 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian astronomer [[Aryabhata]] used a value of 3.1416 in his ''[[Āryabhaṭīya]]'' (499 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fibonacci]] in c.&amp;nbsp;1220 computed 3.1418 using a polygonal method, independent of Archimedes.&lt;ref name="Arndt_e"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian author [[Dante]] apparently employed the value {{math|3+{{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|10}} ≈ 3.14142}}.&lt;ref name="Arndt_e" /&gt;

The Persian astronomer [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] produced 9 sexagesimal digits, roughly the equivalent of 16 decimal digits, in 1424 using a polygon with 3×2&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; sides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Mohammad K.|last1=Azarian|title=al-Risāla al-muhītīyya: A Summary|journal=Missouri Journal of Mathematical Sciences|volume=22|issue=2|year=2010|pages=64–85|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.mjms/1312233136|ref=harv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114232010/http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.mjms/1312233136|archivedate=14 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=John J. |last2=Robertson |first2=Edmund F. |year=1999 |title=Ghiyath al-Din Jamshid Mas'ud al-Kashi |work=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]] |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Al-Kashi.html |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412192025/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Al-Kashi.html |archivedate=12 April 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stood as the world record for about 180 years.&lt;ref name="Arndt_f"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; French mathematician [[François Viète]] in 1579 achieved 9 digits with a polygon of 3×2&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; sides.&lt;ref name="Arndt_f" /&gt; Flemish mathematician [[Adriaan van Roomen]] arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593.&lt;ref name="Arndt_f" /&gt; In 1596, Dutch mathematician [[Ludolph van Ceulen]] reached 20 digits, a record he later increased to 35 digits (as a result, {{pi}} was called the "Ludolphian number" in Germany until the early 20th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch scientist [[Willebrord Snellius]] reached 34 digits in 1621,&lt;ref name="Arndt_g"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austrian astronomer [[Christoph Grienberger]] arrived at 38 digits in 1630 using 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; sides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Christophorus|last=Grienbergerus|authorlink=Christoph Grienberger|language=Latin|year=1630|title=Elementa Trigonometrica|url=http://librarsi.comune.palermo.it/gesuiti2/06.04.01.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234124/http://librarsi.comune.palermo.it/gesuiti2/06.04.01.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-01|format=PDF}} His evaluation was 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 4196 &lt; {{pi}} &lt; 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 4199.&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the most accurate approximation manually achieved using polygonal algorithms.&lt;ref name="Arndt_g" /&gt;

===Infinite series===
{{comparison_pi_infinite_series.svg}}
The calculation of {{pi}} was revolutionized by the development of [[infinite series]] techniques in the 16th and 17th centuries. An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]].&lt;ref name="Ais"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=185–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute {{pi}} with much greater precision than [[Archimedes]] and others who used geometrical techniques.&lt;ref name="Ais" /&gt; Although infinite series were exploited for {{pi}} most notably by European mathematicians such as [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], the approach was first discovered in [[India]] sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roy|1990|pp=101–102}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute {{pi}} was laid out in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] in his ''[[Tantrasamgraha]]'', around 1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Roypp"&gt;{{harvnb|Roy|1990|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series are presented without proof, but proofs are presented in a later Indian work, ''[[Yuktibhāṣā]]'', from around 1530 AD. Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician, [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]], who lived c.&amp;nbsp;1350&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;1425.&lt;ref name="Roypp" /&gt; Several infinite series are described, including series for sine, tangent, and cosine, which are now referred to as the [[Madhava series]] or [[Leibniz formula for π|Gregory–Leibniz series]].&lt;ref name="Roypp" /&gt; Madhava used infinite series to estimate {{pi}} to 11 digits around 1400, but that value was improved on around 1430 by the Persian mathematician [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]], using a polygonal algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joseph|1991|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A formal portrait of a man, with long hair|[[Isaac Newton]]
used [[infinite series]] to compute {{pi}} to 15 digits, later writing "I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations".&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;]]

The [[Viète's formula|first infinite sequence discovered in Europe]] was an [[infinite product]] (rather than an [[infinite sum]], which are more typically used in {{pi}} calculations) found by French mathematician [[François Viète]] in 1593:&lt;ref name="Arndt_h"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEIS2C|id=A060294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7_BCAAAAcAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Variorum de rebus mathematicis responsorum liber VIII].&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac2\pi = \frac{\sqrt2}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}}2 \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Wallis product|second infinite sequence found in Europe]], by [[John Wallis]] in 1655, was also an infinite product:&lt;ref name="Arndt_h" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{9} \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
The discovery of [[calculus]], by English scientist [[Isaac Newton]] and German mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the 1660s, led to the development of many infinite series for approximating {{pi}}. Newton himself used an arcsin series to compute a 15 digit approximation of {{pi}} in 1665 or 1666, later writing "I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations, having no other business at the time."&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=188}}. Newton quoted by Arndt.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Madhava's formula was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] in 1671, and by Leibniz in 1674:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LS" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\arctan z = z - \frac {z^3} {3} +\frac {z^5} {5} -\frac {z^7} {7} +\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula, the Gregory–Leibniz series, equals {{math|π/4}} when evaluated with {{math|''z''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{harvnb|Eymard|Lafon|1999|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1699, English mathematician [[Abraham Sharp]] used the Gregory–Leibniz series for &lt;math&gt;z=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; to compute {{pi}} to 71 digits, breaking the previous record of 39 digits, which was set with a polygonal algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gregory–Leibniz for &lt;math&gt;z=1&lt;/math&gt; series is simple, but [[Convergent series|converges]] very slowly (that is, approaches the answer gradually), so it is not used in modern {{pi}} calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1706 [[John Machin]] used the Gregory–Leibniz series to produce an algorithm that converged much faster:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi}{4} = 4 \, \arctan \frac{1}{5} - \arctan \frac{1}{239}&lt;/math&gt;
Machin reached 100 digits of {{pi}} with this formula.&lt;ref name="A72n4"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mathematicians created variants, now known as [[Machin-like formula]]e, that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of {{pi}}.&lt;ref name="A72n4" /&gt; Machin-like formulae remained the best-known method for calculating {{pi}} well into the age of computers, and were used to set records for 250 years, culminating in a 620-digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson&amp;nbsp;– the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=192–196, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A record was set by the calculating prodigy [[Zacharias Dase]], who in 1844 employed a Machin-like formula to calculate 200 decimals of {{pi}} in his head at the behest of German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].&lt;ref name="A194" /&gt; British mathematician [[William Shanks]] famously took 15 years to calculate {{pi}} to 707 digits, but made a mistake in the 528th digit, rendering all subsequent digits incorrect.&lt;ref name="A194"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=194–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rate of convergence====
Some infinite series for {{pi}} [[convergent series|converge]] faster than others. Given the choice of two infinite series for {{pi}}, mathematicians will generally use the one that converges more rapidly because faster convergence reduces the amount of computation needed to calculate {{pi}} to any given accuracy.&lt;ref name="Aconverge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borwein|first=J.

An infinite series for {{pi}} (published by Nilakantha in the 15th century) that converges more rapidly than the Gregory–Leibniz series is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=223}}, (formula 16.10). Note that (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n''.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=David|page=35|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers|edition=revised|publisher=Penguin|year=1997|isbn=978-0-140-26149-3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = 3 + \frac{4}{2\times3\times4} - \frac{4}{4\times5\times6} + \frac{4}{6\times7\times8} - \frac{4}{8\times9\times10} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
After five terms, the sum of the Gregory–Leibniz series is within 0.2 of the correct value of {{pi}}, whereas the sum of Nilakantha's series is within 0.002 of the correct value of {{pi}}. Nilakantha's series converges faster and is more useful for computing digits of {{pi}}. Series that converge even faster include [[Machin-like formula|Machin's series]] and [[Chudnovsky algorithm|Chudnovsky's series]], the latter producing 14 correct decimal digits per term.&lt;ref name="Aconverge" /&gt;

===Irrationality and transcendence===
{{See also|Proof that π is irrational{{!}}Proof that {{pi}} is irrational|Proof that π is transcendental{{!}}Proof that {{pi}} is transcendental}}
Not all mathematical advances relating to {{pi}} were aimed at increasing the accuracy of approximations. When Euler solved the [[Basel problem]] in 1735, finding the exact value of the sum of the reciprocal squares, he established a connection between {{pi}} and the [[prime number]]s that later contributed to the development and study of the [[Riemann zeta function]]:&lt;ref name="Posamentier"&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|pp=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi^2}{6} = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Swiss scientist [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in 1761 proved that {{pi}} is [[irrational number|irrational]], meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers.&lt;ref name="Arndt_i" /&gt; [[Proof that π is irrational|Lambert's proof]] exploited a continued-fraction representation of the tangent function.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Johann, "Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendantes circulaires et logarithmiques", reprinted in {{harvnb|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|1997|pp=129–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; French mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] proved in 1794 that {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also irrational. In 1882, German mathematician [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] proved that {{pi}} is [[transcendental number|transcendental]], confirming a conjecture made by both [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and Euler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright 1938 and 2000: 177 footnote §11.13–14 references Lindemann's proof as appearing at ''Math. Ann''. 20 (1882), 213–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy and Wright states that "the proofs were afterwards modified and simplified by Hilbert, Hurwitz, and other writers".&lt;ref&gt;cf Hardy and Wright 1938 and 2000:177 footnote §11.13–14. The proofs that e and π are transcendental can be found on pp. 170–176. They cite two sources of the proofs at Landau 1927 or Perron 1910; see the "List of Books" at pp. 417–419 for full citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of the symbol {{pi}}===
[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] popularized the use of the Greek letter {{pi}} in works he published in 1736 and 1748.]]
In the earliest usages, the [[Pi (letter)|Greek letter {{Pi}}]] was an abbreviation of the Greek word for [[Circumference|periphery]] (περιφέρεια),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTgPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP3|title=Theorematum in libris Archimedis de sphaera et cylindro declarario|last=Oughtred|first=William|date=1652|publisher=Excudebat L.

The earliest known use of the Greek letter {{pi}} alone to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]] in his 1706 work ''Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/SynopsisPalmariorumMatheseosOrANewIntroductionToTheMathematics/Synopsis_Palmariorum_Matheseos#page/n261/mode/1up|title=Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos : or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics|last=Jones|first=William|publisher=|year=1706|isbn=|location=|pages=243, 263|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=165}}. A facsimile of Jones' text is in {{harvnb|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|1997|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase "1/2 Periphery ({{pi}})" in the discussion of a circle with radius one.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Schepler|1950|p=220}}: [[William Oughtred]] used the letter {{pi}} to represent the periphery (that is, the circumference) of a circle.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he writes that his equations for {{pi}} are from the "ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. [[John Machin]]", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones.&lt;ref name="Arndt_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late as 1767.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NmYVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA282|title=Cursus Mathematicus|last=Segner|first=Joannes Andreas|date=1756|publisher=Halae Magdeburgicae|isbn=|location=|pages=282|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euler]] started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 ''Essay Explaining The Properties Of Air'', though he used {{pi}}=6.28…, the ratio of radius to periphery, in this and some later writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Euler|first=Leonhard|date=1727|title=Tentamen explicationis phaenomenorum aeris|trans-title=|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E007.pdf#page=5|journal=Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitana|language=la|volume=2|issue=|pages=351|id=[http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E007.html E007]|quote=Sumatur pro ratione radii ad peripheriem, I : π|via=}} [http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/e007tr.pdf#page=3 English translation by Ian Bruce]: "π is taken for the ratio of the radius to the periphery [note that in this work, Euler's π is double our π.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C1iHFBXVEcC&amp;pg=PA139|title=Lettres inédites d'Euler à d'Alembert|last=Euler|first=Leonhard|work=Bullettino di Bibliografia e di Storia delle Scienze Matematiche e Fisiche|publisher=|year=1747|isbn=|editor-last=Henry|editor-first=Charles|volume=19|location=|publication-date=1886|pages=139|language=fr|id=[http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E858.html E858]|quote=Car, soit π la circonference d'un cercle, dout le rayon est = 1|orig-year=}} English translation in {{Cite journal|last=Cajori|first=Florian|date=1913|others=|title=History of the Exponential and Logarithmic Concepts|jstor=2973441|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=20|issue=3|pages=75–84|doi=10.2307/2973441|quote=Letting π be the circumference (!) of a circle of unit radius|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Euler first used {{pi}}=3.14… in his 1736 work ''[[Mechanica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jgdTAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;pg=PA113|title=Mechanica sive motus scientia analytice exposita.

==Modern quest for more digits==

===Computer era and iterative algorithms===
[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|upright|alt=Formal photo of a balding man wearing a suit|[[John von Neumann]] was part of the team that first used a digital computer, [[ENIAC]], to compute {{pi}}.]]

Then an estimate for {{pi}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \pi \approx \frac{(a_n + b_n)^2}{4 t_n}&lt;/math&gt;
|fontsize=90%|qalign=left}}

The development of computers in the mid-20th century again revolutionized the hunt for digits of {{pi}}. American mathematicians [[John Wrench]] and Levi Smith reached 1,120 digits in 1949 using a desk calculator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an [[inverse tangent]] (arctan) infinite series, a team led by George Reitwiesner and [[John von Neumann]] that same year achieved 2,037 digits with a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time on the [[ENIAC]] computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=197}}. See also {{harvnb|Reitwiesner|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The record, always relying on an arctan series, was broken repeatedly (7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits were reached in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute {{pi}}. First, the discovery of new [[iterative algorithm]]s for computing {{pi}}, which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of [[Multiplication algorithm#Fast multiplication algorithms for large inputs|fast multiplication algorithms]] that could multiply large numbers very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such algorithms are particularly important in modern {{pi}} computations because most of the computer's time is devoted to multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include the [[Karatsuba algorithm]], [[Toom–Cook multiplication]], and [[FFT multiplication#Fourier transform methods|Fourier transform-based methods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=132, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by American physicist [[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|Eugene Salamin]] and Australian scientist [[Richard Brent (scientist)|Richard Brent]].&lt;ref name="Arndt_j"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in what is now termed the [[AGM method|arithmetic–geometric mean method]] (AGM method) or [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Arndt_j" /&gt; As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.

The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally ''multiply'' the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, the Canadian brothers [[Jonathan Borwein|John]] and [[Peter Borwein]] produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=111 (5 times); pp. 113–114 (4 times)}}.&lt;br /&gt;See {{harvnb|Borwein|Borwein|1987}} for details of algorithms.&lt;/ref&gt; Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician [[Yasumasa Kanada]] to set several records for computing {{pi}} between 1995 and 2002.&lt;ref name="Background" /&gt; This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.&lt;ref name="Background"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David H.|url=http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|title=Some Background on Kanada's Recent Pi Calculation|date=16 May 2003|accessdate=12 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415102439/http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motives for computing {{pi}}===
[[File:Record pi approximations.svg|thumb|400px|right|As mathematicians discovered new algorithms, and computers became available, the number of known decimal digits of {{pi}} increased dramatically. Note that the vertical scale is [[logarithm]]ic.]]
For most numerical calculations involving {{pi}}, a handful of digits provide sufficient precision. According to Jörg Arndt and Christoph Haenel, thirty-nine digits are sufficient to perform most [[cosmological]] calculations, because that is the accuracy necessary to calculate the circumference of the [[observable universe]] with a precision of one atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Pi and the size of the Universe|author=James Grime|publisher=Numberphile|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpyrF_Ci2TQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting for additional digits needed to compensate for computational [[round-off error]]s, Arndt concludes that a few hundred digits would suffice for any scientific application. Despite this, people have worked strenuously to compute {{pi}} to thousands and millions of digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort may be partly ascribed to the human compulsion to break records, and such achievements with {{pi}} often make headlines around the world.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=John W. Wrench, Jr.: Mathematician Had a Taste for Pi|first=Matt|last=Schudel|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 March 2009|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Big Question: How close have we come to knowing the precise value of pi?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-big-question-how-close-have-we-come-to-knowing-the-precise-value-of-pi-1861197.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=14 April 2012|location=London|first=Steve|last=Connor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402220803/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-big-question-how-close-have-we-come-to-knowing-the-precise-value-of-pi-1861197.html|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have practical benefits, such as testing [[supercomputer]]s, testing numerical analysis algorithms (including [[Multiplication algorithm#Fast multiplication algorithms for large inputs|high-precision multiplication algorithms]]); and within pure mathematics itself, providing data for evaluating the randomness of the digits of {{pi}}.&lt;ref name="Arndt_c"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapidly convergent series===
[[File:Srinivasa Ramanujan - OPC - 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo portrait of a man| [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]], working in isolation in India, produced many innovative series for computing {{pi}}.]]
Modern {{pi}} calculators do not use iterative algorithms exclusively. New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms, yet are simpler and less memory intensive.&lt;ref name="Background" /&gt; The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914, when the Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] published dozens of innovative new formulae for {{pi}}, remarkable for their elegance, mathematical depth, and rapid convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his formulae, based on [[modular equation]]s, is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2 \sqrt 2}{9801} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{k!^4(396^{4k})}.&lt;/math&gt;
This series converges much more rapidly than most arctan series, including Machin's formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Gosper]] was the first to use it for advances in the calculation of {{pi}}, setting a record of 17 million digits in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=104, 206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan's formulae anticipated the modern algorithms developed by the Borwein brothers and the [[Chudnovsky brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chudnovsky algorithm|Chudnovsky formula]] developed in 1987 is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{12}{640320^{3/2}} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(6k)! (13591409 + 545140134k)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 (-640320)^{3k}}.&lt;/math&gt;
It produces about 14 digits of {{pi}} per term,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eymard|Lafon|1999|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used for several record-setting {{pi}} calculations, including the first to surpass 1 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) digits in 1989 by the Chudnovsky brothers, 2.7 trillion (2.7×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) digits by [[Fabrice Bellard]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=110–111, 206}}&lt;br /&gt;Bellard, Fabrice, [http://bellard.org/pi/pi2700e9/pipcrecord.pdf "Computation of 2700 billion decimal digits of Pi using a Desktop Computer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518160217/http://bellard.org/pi/pi2700e9/pipcrecord.pdf |date=18 May 2011 }}, 11 Feb 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 10 trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;) digits in 2011 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo,&lt;ref name="NW"&gt;[http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-12t "Round 2... 10 Trillion Digits of Pi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101121120/http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-12t/ |date=1 January 2014 }}, NumberWorld.org, 17 Oct 2011.

In 2006, Canadian mathematician [[Simon Plouffe]] used the PSLQ [[integer relation algorithm]]&lt;ref&gt;PSLQ means Partial Sum of Least Squares.&lt;/ref&gt; to generate several new formulas for {{pi}}, conforming to the following template:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi^k = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^k} \left(\frac{a}{q^n-1} + \frac{b}{q^{2n}-1} + \frac{c}{q^{4n}-1}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''q''}} is [[Gelfond's constant|{{math|e}}&lt;sup&gt;{{pi}}&lt;/sup&gt;]] (Gelfond's constant), {{math|''k''}} is an [[odd number]], and {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are certain rational numbers that Plouffe computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Plouffe|authorlink=Simon Plouffe|title=Identities inspired by Ramanujan's Notebooks (part 2)|date=April 2006|url=&lt;!-- http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~plouffe/inspired2.pdf --&gt;http://plouffe.fr/simon/inspired2.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114101641/http://www.plouffe.fr/simon/inspired2.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monte Carlo methods]], which evaluate the results of multiple random trials, can be used to create approximations of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buffon's needle]] is one such technique: If a needle of length {{math|''ℓ''}} is dropped {{math|''n''}} times on a surface on which parallel lines are drawn {{math|''t''}} units apart, and if {{math|''x''}} of those times it comes to rest crossing a line ({{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), then one may approximate {{pi}} based on the counts:&lt;ref name="bn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramaley|first=J. F.|title=Buffon's Noodle Problem|jstor=2317945|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=76|issue=8|date=October 1969|pages=916–918|doi=10.2307/2317945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx \frac{2n\ell}{xt}&lt;/math&gt;

Another Monte Carlo method for computing {{pi}} is to draw a circle inscribed in a square, and randomly place dots in the square. The ratio of dots inside the circle to the total number of dots will approximately equal {{math|π/4}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=39–40}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Five random walks.png|thumb|right|Five random walks with 200 steps.  The sample mean of {{math|{{abs|''W''&lt;sub&gt;200&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is {{math|μ {{=}} 56/5}}, and so {{math|2(200)μ&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3.19}} is within {{math|0.05}} of {{pi}}]]
Another way to calculate {{pi}} using probability is to start with a [[random walk]], generated by a sequence of (fair) coin tosses: independent [[random variable]]s {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ {{mset|−1,1}}}} with equal probabilities.  The associated random walk is
:&lt;math&gt;W_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k&lt;/math&gt;
so that, for each {{mvar|n}}, {{math|''W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is drawn from a shifted and scaled [[binomial distribution]].  As {{mvar|n}} varies, {{math|''W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} defines a (discrete) [[stochastic process]].  Then {{pi}} can be calculated by&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Grünbaum |first=B. |authorlink=Branko Grünbaum|title=Projection Constants|journal=Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.|volume=95|issue=3 |pages=451–465|year=1960|doi=10.1090/s0002-9947-1960-0114110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2n}{E[|W_n|]^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This Monte Carlo method is independent of any relation to circles, and is a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]], discussed [[#Gaussian integrals|below]].

These Monte Carlo methods for approximating {{pi}} are very slow compared to other methods, and do not provide any information on the exact number of digits that are obtained. Thus they are never used to approximate {{pi}} when speed or accuracy is desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=43}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spigot algorithms===
Two algorithms were discovered in 1995 that opened up new avenues of research into {{pi}}. They are called [[spigot algorithm]]s because, like water dripping from a [[Tap (valve)|spigot]], they produce single digits of {{pi}} that are not reused after they are calculated.&lt;ref name="Arndtpp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jeremy, [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf "Unbounded Spigot Algorithms for the Digits of Pi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202202928/http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf |date=2 December 2013 }}, 2005. Gibbons produced an improved version of Wagon's algorithm.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms, which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced.&lt;ref name="Arndtpp"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American mathematicians [[Stan Wagon]] and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995.&lt;ref name="Gibbons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arndt_k"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stanley|last1=Rabinowitz|last2=Wagon|first2=Stan|date=March 1995|title=A spigot algorithm for the digits of Pi|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=102|issue=3|pages=195–203|doi=10.2307/2975006|ref=harv|jstor=2975006}} A computer program has been created that implements Wagon's spigot algorithm in only 120 characters of software.&lt;/ref&gt; Its speed is comparable to arctan algorithms, but not as fast as iterative algorithms.&lt;ref name="Arndt_k" /&gt;

Another spigot algorithm, the [[Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula|BBP]] [[digit extraction algorithm]], was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe:&lt;ref name="Arndtpp_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=117, 126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbpf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=David H. |authorlink=David H.

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{16^k} \left( \frac{4}{8k + 1} - \frac{2}{8k + 4} - \frac{1}{8k + 5} - \frac{1}{8k + 6}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
This formula, unlike others before it, can produce any individual [[hexadecimal]] digit of {{pi}} without calculating all the preceding digits.&lt;ref name="Arndtpp_a" /&gt; Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits, and [[octal]] digits can be extracted from one or two hexadecimal digits. Variations of the algorithm have been discovered, but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found that rapidly produces decimal digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=128}}. Plouffe did create a decimal digit extraction algorithm, but it is slower than full, direct computation of all preceding digits.&lt;/ref&gt; An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record {{pi}} computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several random hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.&lt;ref name="NW" /&gt;

Between 1998 and 2000, the [[distributed computing]] project [[PiHex]] used [[Bellard's formula]] (a modification of the BBP algorithm) to compute the quadrillionth (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;th) bit of {{pi}}, which turned out to be 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=20}}&lt;br /&gt;Bellards formula in: {{cite web|url=http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/pi/pi_bin/pi_bin.html|title=A new formula to compute the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; binary digit of pi|first=Fabrice|last=Bellard|authorlink=Fabrice Bellard|accessdate=27 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912084453/http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/pi/pi_bin/pi_bin.html &lt;!-- http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~plouffe/inspired2.pdf --&gt; |archivedate =12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, a [[Yahoo!]] employee used the company's [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] application on one thousand computers over a 23-day period to compute 256 [[bit]]s of {{pi}} at the two-quadrillionth (2×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;th) bit, which also happens to be zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pi record smashed as team finds two-quadrillionth digit |last=Palmer |first=Jason |newspaper=BBC News |date=16 September 2010|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11313194 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317170643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11313194 |archivedate=17 March 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and characterizations in mathematics==
Because {{pi}} is closely related to the circle, it is found in [[List of formulae involving π|many formulae]] from the fields of geometry and trigonometry, particularly those concerning circles, spheres, or ellipses. Other branches of science, such as statistics, physics, [[Fourier analysis]], and number theory, also include {{pi}} in some of their important formulae.

===Geometry and trigonometry===
[[File:Circle Area.svg|thumb|alt=A diagram of a circle with a square coving the circle's upper right quadrant.|right|The area of the circle equals {{pi}} times the shaded area.]]
{{pi}} appears in formulae for areas and volumes of geometrical shapes based on circles, such as [[ellipse]]s, [[sphere]]s, [[cone (geometry)|cones]], and [[torus|tori]]. Below are some of the more common formulae that involve {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|pp=200, 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The circumference of a circle with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|2π''r''}}.
* The [[area of a disk|area of a circle]] with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* The volume of a sphere with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|{{sfrac|4|3}}π''r''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* The surface area of a sphere with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The formulae above are special cases of the volume of the [[N-ball|''n''-dimensional ball]] and the surface area of its boundary, the [[n-sphere|(''n''−1)-dimensional sphere]], given [[#Gamma function and Stirling's approximation|below]].

[[integral|Definite integrals]] that describe circumference, area, or volume of shapes generated by circles typically have values that involve {{pi}}. For example, an integral that specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by:&lt;ref name="udi"&gt;{{MathWorld|Semicircle|Semicircle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In that integral the function {{math|{{sqrt|1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} represents the top half of a circle (the [[square root]] is a consequence of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]), and the integral {{math|{{intmath|int|−1|1}}}} computes the area between that half of a circle and the [[X axis|{{math|''x''}} axis]].
[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|thumb|340px|alt=Diagram showing graphs of functions|[[Sine]] and [[cosine]] functions repeat with period 2{{pi}}.]]
The [[trigonometric function]]s rely on angles, and mathematicians generally use radians as units of measurement. {{pi}} plays an important role in angles measured in [[radian]]s, which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2{{pi}} radians.&lt;ref name="WR"&gt;{{harvnb|Ayers|1964|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle measure of 180° is equal to {{pi}} radians, and 1° = {{pi}}/180 radians.&lt;ref name="WR" /&gt;

Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of {{pi}}; for example, sine and cosine have period 2{{pi}},&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; so for any angle {{math|''θ''}} and any integer {{math|''k''}},

: &lt;math&gt; \sin\theta = \sin\left(\theta + 2\pi k \right) \text{ and } \cos\theta = \cos\left(\theta + 2\pi k \right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="WCS" /&gt;

===Eigenvalues===
[[File:Harmonic_partials_on_strings.svg|thumb|right|The [[overtone]]s of a vibrating string are [[eigenfunction]]s of the second derivative, and form a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic progression]].  The associated eigenvalues form the [[arithmetic progression]] of integer multiples of {{pi}}.]]
Many of the appearances of {{pi}} in the formulas of mathematics and the sciences have to do with its close relationship with geometry.  However, {{pi}} also appears in many natural situations having apparently nothing to do with geometry.

In many applications, it plays a distinguished role as an [[eigenvalue]].  For example, an idealized [[vibrating string]] can be modelled as the graph of a function {{math|''f''}} on the unit interval {{math|[0,1]}}, with [[boundary conditions|fixed ends]] {{math|1=''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = 0}}.  The modes of vibration of the string are solutions of the [[differential equation]] {{math|1=''f'' "(''x'') + λ ''f''(''x'') = 0}}.  Here {{math|λ}} is an associated eigenvalue, which is constrained by [[Sturm–Liouville theory]] to take on only certain specific values.  It must be positive, since the second derivative is [[negative definite]], so it is convenient to write {{math|1=λ = ν&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|ν &gt; 0}} is called the [[wavenumber]].  Then {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = sin(π ''x'')}} satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation with {{math|1=ν = π}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hilbert |first=David |author1link=David Hilbert |last2=Courant |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Courant |title=Methods of mathematical physics, volume 1 |pages=286–290 |year=1966 |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value {{pi}} is, in fact, the ''least'' such value of the wavenumber, and is associated with the [[fundamental mode]] of vibration of the string.  One way to obtain this is by estimating the [[energy]]. The energy satisfies an inequality, [[Wirtinger's inequality for functions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=H. |last1=Dym |first2=H. P. |last2=McKean |title=Fourier series and integrals |publisher=Academic Press |year=1972 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if a function {{math|''f'' : [0, 1] → ℂ}} is given such that {{math|1=''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = 0}} and {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''f'' '}} are both [[square integrable]], then the inequality holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi^2\int_0^1|f(x)|^2\,dx\le \int_0^1|f'(x)|^2\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
and the case of equality holds precisely when {{math|''f''}} is a multiple of {{math|sin(π ''x'')}}. So {{pi}} appears as an optimal constant in Wirtinger's inequality, and from this it follows that it is the smallest such wavenumber, using the [[variational theorem|variational characterization]] of the eigenvalue.  As a consequence, {{pi}} is the smallest [[singular value]] of the derivative on the space of functions on {{math|[0,1]}} vanishing at both endpoints (the [[Sobolev space]] &lt;math&gt;H^1_0[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;).

===Inequalities===
[[File:Sir William Thompson illustration of Carthage.png|thumb|right|The [[ancient Carthage|ancient city of Carthage]] was the solution to an isoperimetric problem, according to a legend recounted by [[Lord Kelvin]] {{harv|Thompson|1894}}: those lands bordering the sea that [[Dido|Queen Dido]] could enclose on all other sides within a single given oxhide, cut into strips.]]
The number {{pi}} serves appears in similar eigenvalue problems in higher-dimensional analysis.  As mentioned [[#Definition|above]], it can be characterized via its role as the best constant in the [[isoperimetric inequality]]: the area {{mvar|A}} enclosed by a plane [[Jordan curve]] of perimeter {{mvar|P}} satisfies the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;4\pi A\le P^2,&lt;/math&gt;
and equality is clearly achieved for the circle, since in that case {{math|1=''A'' = π''r''{{sup|2}}}} and {{math|1=''P'' = 2π''r''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Isaac |last=Chavel |title=Isoperimetric inequalities |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately as a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality, {{pi}} appears in the optimal constant for the critical [[Sobolev inequality]] in ''n'' dimensions, which thus characterizes the role of {{pi}} in many physical phenomena as well, for example those of classical [[potential theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;2\pi\|f\|_2 \le \|\nabla f\|_1&lt;/math&gt;
for ''f'' a smooth function with compact support in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, &lt;math&gt;\nabla f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gradient]] of ''f'', and &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\nabla f\|_1&lt;/math&gt; refer respectively to the [[Lp space|{{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}-norm]].  The Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the isoperimetric inequality (in any dimension), with the same best constants.

Wirtinger's inequality also generalizes to higher-dimensional [[Poincaré inequality|Poincaré inequalities]] that provide best constants for the [[Dirichlet energy]] of an ''n''-dimensional membrane.  Specifically, {{pi}} is the greatest constant such that
:&lt;math&gt;\pi \le \frac{\left (\int_G |\nabla u|^2\right)^{1/2}}{\left (\int_G|u|^2\right)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;
for all [[convex set|convex]] subsets {{math|''G''}} of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of diameter 1, and square-integrable functions ''u'' on {{math|''G''}} of mean zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Payne | first1=L.

F. | title=An optimal Poincaré inequality for convex domains | year=1960 | journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis | issn=0003-9527 | pages=286–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as Wirtinger's inequality is the [[calculus of variations|variational]] form of the [[Dirichlet eigenvalue]] problem in one dimension, the Poincaré inequality is the variational form of the [[Neumann problem|Neumann]] eigenvalue problem, in any dimension.

===Fourier transform and Heisenberg uncertainty principle===
[[File:Animation_of_Heisenberg_geodesic.gif|thumb|right|An animation of a [[Heisenberg group#As a sub-Riemannian manifold|geodesic in the Heisenberg group]], showing the close connection between the Heisenberg group, isoperimetry, and the constant {{pi}}. The cumulative height of the geodesic is equal to the area of the shaded portion of the unit circle, while the arc length (in the [[Carnot–Carathéodory metric]]) is equal to the circumference.]]
The constant {{pi}} also appears as a critical spectral parameter in the [[Fourier transform]].  This is the [[integral transform]], that takes a complex-valued integrable function {{math|''f''}} on the real line to the function defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{-2\pi i x\xi}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
There are several different conventions for the Fourier transform, all of which involve a factor of {{pi}} that is placed ''somewhere''.  The appearance of {{pi}} is essential in these formulas, as there is there is no possibility to remove {{pi}} altogether from the Fourier transform and its inverse transform.  The definition given above is the most canonical, however, because it describes the unique unitary operator on {{math|''L''{{sup|2}}}} that is also an algebra homomorphism of {{math|''L''{{sup|1}}}} to {{math|''L''{{sup|∞}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Harmonic analysis in phase space|author=[[Gerald Folland]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1989|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] also contains the number {{pi}}.  The uncertainty principle gives a sharp lower bound on the extent to which it is possible to localize a function both in space and in frequency: with our conventions for the Fourier transform,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2|f(x)|^2\,dx\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2|\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\ge \left(\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The physical consequence, about the uncertainty in simultaneous position and momentum observations of a [[quantum mechanical]] system, is [[#Describing physical phenomena|discussed below]].  The appearance of {{pi}} in the formulae of Fourier analysis is ultimately a consequence of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]], asserting the uniqueness of the [[Schrödinger representation]] of the [[Heisenberg group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howe|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaussian integrals===
[[File:E^(-x^2).svg|thumb|right|A graph of the [[Gaussian function]] {{math|1=''ƒ''(''x'') = ''e''{{sup|−''x''{{sup|2}}}}}}. The colored region between the function and the ''x''-axis has area {{math|{{sqrt|π}}}}.]]

The fields of [[probability]] and [[statistics]] frequently use the [[normal distribution]] as a simple model for complex phenomena; for example, scientists generally assume that the observational error in most experiments follows a normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Feller, W. ''An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Vol. 1'', Wiley, 1968, pp. 174–190.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gaussian function]], which is the [[probability density function]] of the normal distribution with [[mean]] {{math|μ}} and [[standard deviation]] {{math|σ}}, naturally contains {{pi}}:&lt;ref name="GaussProb"&gt;{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|pp=106–107, 744, 748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = {1 \over \sigma\sqrt{2\pi} }\,e^{-(x-\mu )^2/(2\sigma^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

For this to be a probability density, the area under the graph of {{math|''f''}} needs to be equal to one.  This follows from a [[integration by substitution|change of variables]] in the [[Gaussian integral]]:&lt;ref name="GaussProb" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-u^2} \, du=\sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

which says that the area under the basic [[bell curve]] in the figure is equal to the square root of {{pi}}.

[[File:Random walk simulation.png|thumb|right|{{pi}} [[Arcsine laws (Wiener process)|can be computed]] from the distribution of zeros of a one-dimensional [[Wiener process]]]]
The [[central limit theorem]] explains the central role of normal distributions, and thus of {{pi}}, in probability and statistics.  This theorem is ultimately connected with the [[#Fourier transform and Heisenberg uncertainty principle|spectral characterization]] of {{pi}} as the eigenvalue associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and the fact that equality holds in the uncertainty principle only for the Gaussian function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=H Dym|author2=H P McKean|title=Fourier series and integrals|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972}}; Section 2.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalently, {{pi}} is the unique constant making the Gaussian normal distribution {{math|''e''{{sup|-π''x''{{sup|2}}}}}} equal to its own Fourier transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=[[Elias Stein]]|author2=Guido Weiss|title=Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces|year=1971|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=6}}; Theorem 1.13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed,  according to {{harvtxt|Howe|1980}}, the "whole business" of establishing the fundamental theorems of Fourier analysis reduces to the Gaussian integral.

===Projective geometry===
Let {{math|''V''}} be the set of all twice differentiable real functions &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy the [[ordinary differential equation]] &lt;math&gt;f''(x)+f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then {{math|''V''}} is a two-dimensional real [[vector space]], with two parameters corresponding to a pair of [[initial conditions]] for the differential equation.  For any &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;e_t:V\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; be the evaluation functional, which associates to each &lt;math&gt;f\in V&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;e_t(f)=f(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the function {{math|''f''}} at the real point {{math|''t''}}.  Then, for each ''t'', the [[kernel of a linear transformation|kernel]] of &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt; is a one-dimensional linear subspace of {{math|''V''}}.  Hence &lt;math&gt;t\mapsto\ker e_t&lt;/math&gt; defines a function from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R\to\mathbb P(V)&lt;/math&gt; from the real line to the [[real projective line]].   This function is periodic, and the quantity {{pi}} can be characterized as the period of this map.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Projective Differential Geometry Old and New: From the Schwarzian Derivative to the Cohomology of Diffeomorphism Groups|series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0521831864|author1=V. Ovsienko|author2=S. Tabachnikov}}: Section 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topology===
[[File:Uniform_tiling_73-t2.png|thumb|right|[[Uniformization theorem|Uniformization]] of the [[Klein quartic]], a surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] three and Euler characteristic −4, as a quotient of the [[Poincaré disk model|hyperbolic plane]] by the [[symmetry group]] [[PSL(2,7)]] of the [[Fano plane]].  The hyperbolic area of a fundamental domain is {{math|8π}}, by Gauss–Bonnet.]]
The constant {{pi}} appears in the [[Gauss–Bonnet formula]] which relates the [[differential geometry of surfaces]] to their [[topology]].  Specifically, if a [[compact space|compact]] surface {{math|''Σ''}} has [[Gauss curvature]] ''K'', then
:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Sigma K\,dA = 2\pi \chi(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''χ''(''Σ'')}} is the [[Euler characteristic]], which is an integer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A comprehensive introduction to differential geometry|volume=3|author=[[Michael Spivak]]|year=1999|publisher=Publish or Perish Press}}; Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is the surface area of a sphere ''S'' of curvature 1 (so that its [[radius of curvature]], which coincides with its radius, is also 1.)  The Euler characteristic of a sphere can be computed from its [[homology group]]s and is found to be equal to two.  Thus we have
:&lt;math&gt;A(S) = \int_S 1\,dA = 2\pi\cdot 2 = 4\pi&lt;/math&gt;
reproducing the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius 1.

The constant appears in many other integral formulae in topology, in particular, those involving [[characteristic class]]es via the [[Chern–Weil homomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Kobayashi|first1=Shoshichi|last2=Nomizu|first2=Katsumi | title = Foundations of Differential Geometry|volume=Vol. 2| publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]] | year=1996|edition=New|page=293|title-link=Foundations of Differential Geometry}}; Chapter XII ''Characteristic classes''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vector calculus===
[[File:YL10M5sph.png|thumb|right|The techniques of vector calculus can be understood in terms of decompositions into [[spherical harmonic]]s (shown)]]
[[Vector calculus]] is a branch of calculus that is concerned with the properties of [[vector field]]s, and has many physical applications such as to [[electricity and magnetism]].  The [[Newtonian potential]] for a point source {{mvar|Q}} situated at the origin of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Schey (1996) ''Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus'', {{isbn|0-393-96997-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{k Q}{|\mathbf{x}|}&lt;/math&gt;
which represents the [[potential energy]] of a unit mass (or charge) placed a distance {{math|{{abs|'''x'''}}}} from the source, and {{mvar|k}} is a dimensional constant.  The field, denoted here by {{math|'''E'''}}, which may be the (Newtonian) [[gravitational field]] or the (Coulomb) [[electric field]], is the negative [[gradient]] of the potential:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V.&lt;/math&gt;
Special cases include [[Coulomb's law]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].  [[Gauss' law]] states that the outward [[flux]] of the field through any smooth, simple, closed, orientable surface {{mvar|S}} containing the origin is equal to {{math|4{{pi}}''kQ''}}:
:{{oiint|preintegral=&lt;math&gt;4\pi k Q = &lt;/math&gt;|intsubscpt=&lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt;|integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;}}

It is standard to absorb this factor of {{math|4π}} into the constant {{mvar|k}}, but this argument shows why it must appear ''somewhere''.  Furthermore, {{math|4π}} is the surface area of the unit sphere, but we have not assumed that {{mvar|S}} is the sphere.  However, as a consequence of the [[divergence theorem]], because the region away from the origin is vacuum (source-free) it is only the [[homology class]] of the surface {{mvar|S}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\{0} }} that matters in computing the integral, so it can be replaced by any convenient surface in the same homology class, in particular, a sphere, where spherical coordinates can be used to calculate the integral.

A consequence of the Gauss law is that the negative [[Laplacian]] of the potential {{mvar|V}} is equal to {{math|4π''kQ''}} times the [[Dirac delta function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V(\mathbf x) = -4\pi k Q\delta(\mathbf x).&lt;/math&gt;
More general distributions of matter (or charge) are obtained from this by [[convolution]], giving the [[Poisson equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V(\mathbf x) = -4\pi k \rho(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|ρ}} is the distribution function.

[[File:Spacetime lattice analogy.svg|thumb|right|Einstein's equation states that the curvature of space-time is produced by the matter-energy content.]]
The constant {{pi}} also plays an analogous role in four-dimensional potentials associated with [[Einstein's equations]], a fundamental formula which forms the basis of the [[general theory of relativity]] and describes the [[fundamental interaction]] of [[gravitation]] as a result of [[spacetime]] being [[curvature|curved]] by [[matter]] and [[energy]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, Adrian, ''The pleasures of pi, e and other interesting numbers'', World Scientific Pub., 2006, p. 21, {{isbn|978-981-270-078-0}}.&lt;br /&gt;Ehlers, Jürgen, ''Einstein's Field Equations and Their Physical Implications'', Springer, 2000, p 7, {{isbn|978-3-540-67073-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Ricci curvature tensor]], {{mvar|R}} is the [[scalar curvature]], {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], {{math|Λ}} is the [[cosmological constant]], {{mvar|G}} is [[gravitational constant|Newton's gravitational constant]], {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[stress–energy tensor]].  The left-hand side of Einstein's equation is a non-linear analog of the Laplacian of the metric tensor, and reduces to that in the weak field limit, with the &lt;math&gt;\Lambda g&lt;/math&gt; term playing the role of a [[Lagrange multiplier]], and the right-hand side is the analog of the distribution function, times {{math|8π}}.

===Cauchy's integral formula===
[[File:Factorial05.jpg|thumb|right|Complex analytic functions can be visualized as a collection of streamlines and equipotentials, systems of curves intersecting at right angles.  Here illustrated is the complex logarithm of the Gamma function.]]
One of the key tools in [[complex analysis]] is [[contour integration]] of a function over a positively oriented ([[rectifiable curve|rectifiable]]) [[Jordan curve]] {{math|γ}}.  A form of [[Cauchy's integral formula]] states that if a point {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is interior to {{math|γ}}, then&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Lars Ahlfors]]|title=Complex analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1966|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\gamma \frac{dz}{z-z_0} = 2\pi i.&lt;/math&gt;

Although the curve {{math|γ}} is not a circle, and hence does not have any obvious connection to the constant {{pi}}, a standard proof of this result uses [[Morera's theorem]], which implies that the integral is invariant under [[homotopy]] of the curve, so that it can be deformed to a circle and then integrated explicitly in polar coordinates.  More generally, it is true that if a rectifiable closed curve {{math|γ}} does not contain {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the above integral is {{math|2π''i''}} times the [[winding number]] of the curve.

The general form of Cauchy's integral formula establishes the relationship between the values of a [[complex analytic function]] {{math|''f''(''z'')}} on the Jordan curve {{math|γ}} and the value of {{math|''f''(''z'')}} at any interior point {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|γ}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|CauchyIntegralFormula|Cauchy Integral Formula}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joglekar, S. D., ''Mathematical Physics'', Universities Press, 2005, p. 166, {{isbn|978-81-7371-422-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\gamma { f(z) \over z-z_0 }\,dz = 2\pi i f (z_{0})&lt;/math&gt;
provided {{math|''f''(''z'')}} is analytic in the region enclosed by {{math|γ}} and extends continuously to {{math|γ}}.  Cauchy's integral formula is a special case of the [[residue theorem]], that if {{math|''g''(''z'')}} is a [[meromorphic function]] the region enclosed by {{math|γ}} and is continuous in a neighborhood of {{math|γ}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\gamma g(z)\, dz =2\pi i \sum \operatorname{Res}( g, a_k ) &lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is of the [[residue (mathematics)|residues]] at the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of {{math|''g''(''z'')}}.

===The gamma function and Stirling's approximation===
[[File:Hopf_Fibration.png|thumb|right|The [[Hopf fibration]] of the 3-sphere, by [[Villarceau circles]], over the [[complex projective line]] with its [[Fubini–Study metric]] (three parallels are shown).  The identity {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(1)/''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} π/2}} [[Fubini–Study metric#The n = 1 case|is a consequence]].]]
The factorial function {{math|''n''!}} is the product of all of the positive integers through {{math|''n''}}.  The [[gamma function]] extends the concept of [[factorial]] (normally defined only for non-negative integers) to all complex numbers, except the negative real integers. When the gamma function is evaluated at half-integers, the result contains {{pi}}; for example &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(1/2) = \sqrt{\pi} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(5/2) = \frac {3 \sqrt{\pi}} {4} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|pp=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gamma function is defined by its [[Weierstrass product]] development:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =The gamma function|author= [[Emil Artin]]
|publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston
|year =  1964
|series = Athena series; selected topics in mathematics
|edition = 1st
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) = e^{-\gamma z}\prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{z/n}}{1+z/n}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|γ}} is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].  Evaluated at {{math|''z'' {{=}} 1/2}} and squared, the equation {{math|Γ(1/2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} π}} reduces to the Wallis product formula.  The gamma function is also connected to the [[Riemann zeta function]] and identities for the [[functional determinant]], in which the constant {{pi}} [[#Number theory and Riemann zeta function|plays an important role]].

The gamma function is used to calculate the volume {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')}} of the [[n-ball|''n''-dimensional ball]] of radius ''r'' in Euclidean ''n''-dimensional space, and the surface area {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')}} of its boundary, the [[n-sphere|(''n''−1)-dimensional sphere]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lawrence Evans|title=Partial differential equations|publisher=AMS|year=1997|page=615}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V_n(r) = \frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}r^n&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}(r) = \frac{n\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}r^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Further, it follows from the [[functional equation]] that
:&lt;math&gt;2\pi r = \frac{S_{n+1}(r)}{V_n(r)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The gamma function can be used to create a simple approximation to the factorial function {{math|''n''!}} for large {{math|''n''}}: &lt;math&gt; n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt; which is known as [[Stirling's approximation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{e^{2n}n!^2}{2 n^{2n+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a geometrical application of Stirling's approximation, let {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the [[simplex|standard simplex]] in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space, and {{math|(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)Δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the simplex having all of its sides scaled up by a factor of {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}.  Then

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Vol}((n+1)\Delta_n) = \frac{(n+1)^n}{n!} \sim \frac{e^{n+1}}{\sqrt{2\pi n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Ehrhart's volume conjecture]] is that this is the (optimal) upper bound on the volume of a [[convex body]] containing only one [[lattice point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Benjamin Nill|author2=Andreas Paffenholz|title=On the equality case in Erhart's volume conjecture|year=2014|arxiv=1205.1270|journal=Advances in Geometry|volume=14|issue=4|pages=579–586|issn=1615-7168|doi=10.1515/advgeom-2014-0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number theory and Riemann zeta function===
[[File:Prüfer.png|thumb|right|Each prime has an associated [[Prüfer group]], which are arithmetic localizations of the circle.  The [[L-function]]s of analytic number theory are also localized in each prime ''p''.]]
[[File:ModularGroup-FundamentalDomain.svg|thumb|right|Solution of the Basel problem using the [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers|Weil conjecture]]: the value of &lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Poincaré half-plane model|hyperbolic]] area of a fundamental domain of the [[modular group]], times &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;]]
The [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is used in many areas of mathematics. When evaluated at {{math|1=''s'' = 2}} it can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(2) = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Finding a [[closed-form expression|simple solution]] for this infinite series was a famous problem in mathematics called the [[Basel problem]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] solved it in 1735 when he showed it was equal to {{math|π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6}}.&lt;ref name="Posamentier" /&gt; Euler's result leads to the [[number theory]] result that the probability of two random numbers being [[relatively prime]] (that is, having no shared factors) is equal to {{math|6/π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This theorem was proved by [[Ernesto Cesàro]] in 1881. For a more rigorous proof than the intuitive and informal one given here, see Hardy, G. H., ''An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{isbn|978-0-19-921986-5}}, theorem 332.&lt;/ref&gt; This probability is based on the observation that the probability that any number is [[divisible]] by a prime {{math|''p''}} is {{math|1/''p''}} (for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7.) Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is {{math|1/''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the probability that at least one of them is not is {{math|1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For distinct primes, these divisibility events are mutually independent; so the probability that two numbers are relatively prime is given by a product over all primes:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Stanley Ogilvy|Ogilvy, C. S.]]; Anderson, J. T., ''Excursions in Number Theory'', Dover Publications Inc., 1988, pp. 29–35, {{isbn|0-486-25778-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\prod_p^\infty \left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) &amp;= \left( \prod_p^\infty \frac{1}{1-p^{-2}} \right)^{-1}\\[4pt]
&amp;= \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots }\\[4pt]
&amp;= \frac{1}{\zeta(2)} = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \approx 61\%.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This probability can be used in conjunction with a [[random number generator]] to approximate {{pi}} using a Monte Carlo approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to the Basel problem implies that the geometrically derived quantity {{pi}} is connected in a deep way to the distribution of prime numbers.  This is a special case of [[Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]], which asserts the equality of similar such infinite products of ''arithmetic'' quantities, localized at each prime ''p'', and a ''geometrical'' quantity: the reciprocal of the volume of a certain [[locally symmetric space]].  In the case of the Basel problem, it is the [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]] {{math|[[SL2(R)|SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')]]/[[modular group|SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''')]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic groups and number theory|author1=Vladimir Platonov|author2=Andrei Rapinchuk|publisher=Academic Press|year=1994|pages=262–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zeta function also satisfies Riemann's functional equation, which involves {{pi}} as well as the gamma function:
:&lt;math&gt;
\zeta(s) = 2^s\pi^{s-1}\ \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\ \Gamma(1-s)\ \zeta(1-s)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the derivative of the zeta function satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(-\zeta'(0)) = \sqrt{2\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;
A consequence is that {{pi}} can be obtained from the [[functional determinant]] of the [[harmonic oscillator]].  This functional determinant can be computed via a product expansion, and is equivalent to the Wallis product formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sondow, J.|title=Analytic Continuation of Riemann's Zeta Function and Values at Negative Integers via Euler's Transformation of Series|journal=Proc.

===Fourier series===
[[File:2-adic integers with dual colorings.svg|thumb|right|{{pi}} appears in characters of [[p-adic numbers]] (shown), which are elements of a [[Prüfer group]].  [[Tate's thesis]] makes heavy use of this machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Tate | first1=John T. | title=Algebraic Number Theory (Proc. Instructional Conf., Brighton, 1965) | publisher=Thompson, Washington, D.C. | isbn=978-0-9502734-2-6 | mr=0217026 | year=1950 | chapter=Fourier analysis in number fields, and Hecke's zeta-functions | pages=305–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The constant {{pi}} also appears naturally in [[Fourier series]] of [[periodic function]]s.  Periodic functions are functions on the group {{math|'''T''' {{=}}'''R'''/'''Z'''}} of fractional parts of real numbers.  The Fourier decomposition shows that a complex-valued function {{math|''f''}} on {{math|'''T'''}} can be written as an infinite linear superposition of [[unitary character]]s of {{math|'''T'''}}.   That is, continuous [[group homomorphism]]s from {{math|'''T'''}} to the [[circle group]] {{math|''U''(1)}} of unit modulus complex numbers.  It is a theorem that every character of {{math|'''T'''}} is one of the complex exponentials &lt;math&gt;e_n(x)=  e^{2\pi i n x}&lt;/math&gt;.

There is a unique character on {{math|'''T'''}}, up to complex conjugation, that is a group isomorphism.  Using the [[Haar measure]] on the circle group, the constant {{pi}} is half the magnitude of the [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of this character.  The other characters have derivatives whose magnitudes are positive integral multiples of 2{{pi}}.&lt;ref name="Nicolas Bourbaki"/&gt;  As a result, the constant {{pi}} is the unique number such that the group '''T''', equipped with its Haar measure, is [[Pontrjagin dual]] to the [[lattice (group)|lattice]] of integral multiples of 2{{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=H Dym|author2=H P McKean|title=Fourier series and integrals|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972}}; Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;   This is a version of the one-dimensional [[Poisson summation formula]].

===Modular forms and theta functions===
[[File:Lattice_with_tau.svg|thumb|right|Theta functions transform under the [[lattice (group)|lattice]] of periods of an elliptic curve.]]
The constant {{pi}} is connected in a deep way with the theory of [[modular form]]s and [[theta function]]s.  For example, the [[Chudnovsky algorithm]] involves in an essential way the [[j-invariant]] of an [[elliptic curve]].

[[Modular form]]s are [[holomorphic function]]s in the [[upper half plane]] characterized by their transformation properties under the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)&lt;/math&gt; (or its various subgroups), a lattice in the group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.  An example is the [[Jacobi theta function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(z,\tau) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{2\pi i nz + i\pi n^2\tau}&lt;/math&gt;
which is a kind of modular form called a [[Jacobi form]].&lt;ref name="Mumford 1983 1–117"&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Mumford |authorlink=David Mumford |title=Tata Lectures on Theta I |year=1983 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=978-3-7643-3109-2|pages=1–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is sometimes written in terms of the [[nome (mathematics)|nome]] &lt;math&gt;q=e^{\pi i \tau}&lt;/math&gt;.

The constant {{pi}} is the unique constant making the Jacobi theta function an [[automorphic form]], which means that it transforms in a specific way.  Certain identities hold for all automorphic forms.  An example is
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(z+\tau,\tau) = e^{-\pi i\tau -2\pi i z}\theta(z,\tau),&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that {{math|θ}} transforms as a representation under the discrete [[Heisenberg group]].  General modular forms and other [[theta function]]s also involve {{pi}}, once again because of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]].&lt;ref name="Mumford 1983 1–117"/&gt;

===Cauchy distribution and potential theory===
[[File:Witch of Agnesi, construction.svg|thumb|right|The [[Witch of Agnesi]], named for [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi|Maria Agnesi]] (1718–1799), is a geometrical construction of the graph of the Cauchy distribution.]]
The [[Cauchy distribution]]

:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot\frac{1}{x^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[probability density function]].  The total probability is equal to one, owing to the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } \frac{1}{x^2+1} \, dx = \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Shannon entropy]] of the Cauchy distribution is equal to {{math|log(4π)}}, which also involves {{pi}}.

[[File:Brownianmotion beads in water spim video.gif|thumb|right|The Cauchy distribution governs the passage of [[Brownian motion|Brownian particles]] through a membrane.]]
The Cauchy distribution plays an important role in [[potential theory]] because it is the simplest [[Furstenberg boundary|Furstenberg measure]], the classical [[Poisson kernel]] associated with a [[Brownian motion]] in a half-plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Sidney Port|author2=Charles Stone|title=Brownian motion and classical potential theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1978|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Conjugate harmonic function]]s and so also the [[Hilbert transform]] are associated with the asymptotics of the Poisson kernel.  The Hilbert transform ''H'' is the integral transform given by the [[Cauchy principal value]] of the [[singular integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;Hf(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{f(x)\,dx}{x-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The constant {{pi}} is the unique (positive) normalizing factor such that ''H'' defines a [[linear complex structure]] on the Hilbert space of square-integrable real-valued functions on the real line.&lt;ref&gt;* {{citation|last=Titchmarsh|first=E|authorlink=Edward Charles Titchmarsh|title=Introduction to the theory of Fourier integrals|isbn=978-0-8284-0324-5|year=1948|edition=2nd|publication-date=1986|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford University}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hilbert transform, like the Fourier transform, can be characterized purely in terms of its transformation properties on the Hilbert space {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''')}}: up to a normalization factor, it is the unique bounded linear operator that commutes with positive dilations and anti-commutes with all reflections of the real line.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Elias|last=Stein|authorlink=Elias Stein|title=Singular integrals and differentiability properties of functions|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1970}}; Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt;  The constant {{pi}} is the unique normalizing factor that makes this transformation unitary.

===Complex dynamics===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|alt=An complex black shape on a blue background.|thumb|{{pi}} can be computed from the [[Mandelbrot set]], by counting the number of iterations required before point (−0.75, ε) diverges.]]
An occurrence of {{pi}} in the [[Mandelbrot set]] [[fractal]] was discovered by David Boll in 1991.&lt;ref name="KA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klebanoff |first1=Aaron |year=2001 |title=Pi in the Mandelbrot set |journal=Fractals |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=393–402 |url=http://home.comcast.net/~davejanelle/mandel.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66iUmBi3B?url=https://home.comcast.net/~davejanelle/mandel.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2012 |doi=10.1142/S0218348X01000828 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He examined the behavior of the Mandelbrot set near the "neck" at (−0.75, 0). If points with coordinates (−0.75, ε) are considered, as ε tends to zero, the number of iterations until divergence for the point multiplied by ε converges to {{pi}}. The point (0.25, ε) at the cusp of the large "valley" on the right side of the Mandelbrot set behaves similarly: the number of iterations until divergence multiplied by the square root of ε tends to {{pi}}.&lt;ref name="KA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peitgen, Heinz-Otto, ''Chaos and fractals: new frontiers of science'', Springer, 2004, pp. 801–803, {{isbn|978-0-387-20229-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside mathematics==

===Describing physical phenomena===
Although not a [[physical constant]], {{pi}} appears routinely in equations describing fundamental principles of the universe, often because of {{pi}}'s relationship to the circle and to [[spherical coordinate system]]s. A simple formula from the field of [[classical mechanics]] gives the approximate period {{math|''T''}} of a simple [[pendulum]] of length {{math|''L''}}, swinging with a small amplitude ({{math|''g''}} is the [[Gravity of Earth|earth's gravitational acceleration]]):&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, David; Resnick, Robert; Walker, Jearl, ''Fundamentals of Physics, 5th Ed.'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1997, p. 381, {{isbn|0-471-14854-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T \approx 2\pi \sqrt\frac{L}{g}.&lt;/math&gt;
One of the key formulae of [[quantum mechanics]] is [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]], which shows that the uncertainty in the measurement of a particle's position (Δ{{math|''x''}}) and [[momentum]] (Δ{{math|''p''}}) cannot both be arbitrarily small at the same time (where {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James M|last=Imamura|url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/jan27/hup.html|title=Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle|publisher=[[University of Oregon]]|date=17 August 2005|accessdate=9 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012060715/http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/jan27/hup.html &lt;!-- http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~plouffe/inspired2.pdf --&gt;|archivedate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta x\, \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that {{pi}} is approximately equal to 3 plays a role in the relatively long lifetime of [[orthopositronium]]. The inverse lifetime to lowest order in the [[fine-structure constant]] {{math|''α''}} is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Itzykson|first1=C.|authorlink1=Claude Itzykson|last2=Zuber|first2=J.-B.|authorlink2=Jean-Bernard Zuber|title=Quantum Field Theory|date=1980|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, New York|isbn=978-0486445687|edition=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MwsAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|lccn=2005053026|oclc=61200849}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau} = 2\frac{\pi^2 - 9}{9\pi}m\alpha^{6},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''m''}} is the mass of the electron.

{{pi}} is present in some structural engineering formulae, such as the [[buckling]] formula derived by Euler, which gives the maximum axial load {{math|''F''}} that a long, slender column of length {{math|''L''}}, [[modulus of elasticity]] {{math|''E''}}, and [[area moment of inertia]] {{math|''I''}} can carry without buckling:&lt;ref&gt;Low, Peter, ''Classical Theory of Structures Based on the Differential Equation'', CUP Archive, 1971, pp. 116–118, {{isbn|978-0-521-08089-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F =\frac{\pi^2EI}{L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The field of [[fluid dynamics]] contains {{pi}} in [[Stokes' law]], which approximates the [[drag force|frictional force]] {{math|''F''}} exerted on small, [[sphere|spherical]] objects of radius {{math|''R''}}, moving with velocity {{math|''v''}} in a [[fluid]] with [[dynamic viscosity]] {{math|''η''}}:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, G. K., ''An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, p. 233, {{isbn|0-521-66396-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F =6\pi\eta  Rv.&lt;/math&gt;

In electromagnetics, the [[vacuum permeability]] constant ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; appears in [[Maxwell's equations]], which describe the properties of [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields and [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is defined as exactly
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7}\text{ H/m} \approx 1.2566370614 \ldots \times 10 ^{-6} \text{ N/A}^2 &lt;/math&gt;
A relation for the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{math|''c''}} can be derived from Maxwell's equations in the medium of [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|classical vacuum]] using a relationship between ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric constant (vacuum permittivity)]], {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in SI units:
:&lt;math&gt;c={1\over\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under ideal conditions (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously erodible substrate), the [[sinuosity]] of a [[meander]]ing river approaches {{pi}}. The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, and increasing the overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and "short-circuit", creating an [[ox-bow lake]] in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of {{pi}} between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=271|issue=5256|date=22 March 1996|pages=1710–1713|doi=10.1126/science.271.5256.1710|title=River Meandering as a Self-Organization Process|author=Hans-Henrik Stølum|bibcode=1996Sci...271.1710S|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorizing digits===
{{Main|Piphilology}}
[[Piphilology]] is the practice of memorizing large numbers of digits of {{pi}},&lt;ref name="A445"&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and world-records are kept by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.  The record for memorizing digits of {{pi}}, certified by Guinness World Records, is 70,000 digits, recited in India by Rajveer Meena in 9 hours and 27 minutes on 21 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-pi-places-memorised "Most Pi Places Memorized"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214205333/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-pi-places-memorised |date=14 February 2016 }}, Guinness World Records.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, [[Akira Haraguchi]], a retired Japanese engineer, claimed to have recited 100,000 decimal places, but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records.&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tomoko|last=Otake|url=&lt;!-- http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~plouffe/inspired2.pdf --&gt;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2006/12/17/life/how-can-anyone-remember-100000-numbers/|title=How can anyone remember 100,000 numbers?|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=17 December 2006|accessdate=27 October 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818004142/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2006/12/17/life/how-can-anyone-remember-100000-numbers/|archivedate=18 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common technique is to memorize a story or poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of {{pi}}: The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. An early example of a memorization aid, originally devised by English scientist [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]], is "How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics."&lt;ref name="A445" /&gt; When a poem is used, it is sometimes referred to as a ''piem''. Poems for memorizing {{pi}} have been composed in several languages in addition to English.&lt;ref name="A445" /&gt;  Record-setting {{pi}} memorizers typically do not rely on poems, but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the [[method of loci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raz|first1=A.|last2=Packard|first2=M. G.|year=2009|title=A slice of pi: An exploratory neuroimaging study of digit encoding and retrieval in a superior memorist|journal=Neurocase|volume=15|issue=5|pages=361–372|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13554790902776896|pmid=19585350|pmc=4323087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few authors have used the digits of {{pi}} to establish a new form of [[constrained writing]], where the word lengths are required to represent the digits of {{pi}}. The ''[[Cadaeic Cadenza]]'' contains the first 3835 digits of {{pi}} in this manner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Keith|authorlink=Mike Keith (mathematician)|url=http://www.cadaeic.net/comments.htm|title=Cadaeic Cadenza Notes &amp; Commentary|accessdate=29 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118060210/http://cadaeic.net/comments.htm|archivedate=18 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the full-length book ''Not a Wake'' contains 10,000 words, each representing one digit of {{pi}}.&lt;ref name=KeithNAW&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Michael|title=Not A Wake: A dream embodying (pi)'s digits fully for 10000 decimals|publisher=Vinculum Press|isbn=978-0963009715|author2=Diana Keith|date=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
[[File:Pi pie2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pi Pie at Delft University|A pi pie. The circular shape of [[pie]] makes it a frequent subject of pi [[pun]]s.|bottom]]
Perhaps because of the simplicity of its definition and its ubiquitous presence in formulae, {{pi}} has been represented in popular culture more than other mathematical constructs.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Pickover calls π "the most famous mathematical constant of all time", and Peterson writes, "Of all known mathematical constants, however, pi continues to attract the most attention", citing the [[Parfums Givenchy|Givenchy]] π perfume, [[Pi (film)]], and [[Pi Day]] as examples. See {{citation|title=Keys to Infinity|first=Clifford A.|last=Pickover|authorlink=Clifford A.

In the 2008 [[Open University]] and [[BBC]] documentary co-production, ''[[The Story of Maths]]'', aired in October 2008 on [[BBC Four]], British mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] shows a [[Information graphics|visualization]] of the – historically first exact – [[Madhava of Sangamagrama#The value of π (pi)|formula for calculating {{pi}}]] when visiting India and exploring its contributions to trigonometry.&lt;ref name="BBC_2008"&gt;[http://vimeo.com/74859005 BBC documentary "The Story of Maths", second part] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223134128/http://vimeo.com/74859005 |date=23 December 2014 }}, showing a visualization of the historically first exact formula, starting at 35 min and 20 sec into the second part of the documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Palais de la Découverte]] (a science museum in Paris) there is a circular room known as the ''pi room''. On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of {{pi}}. The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling. The digits were based on an 1853 calculation by English mathematician [[William Shanks]], which included an error beginning at the 528th digit. The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|p=118}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Carl Sagan]]'s novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'' it is suggested that the creator of the universe buried a message deep within the digits of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=14}}. This part of the story was omitted from the [[Contact (1997 American film)|film]] adaptation of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The digits of {{pi}} have also been incorporated into the lyrics of the song "Pi" from the album ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'' by [[Kate Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of Aerial|first=Andy|last=Gill|journal=[[The Independent]]|date=4 November 2005|url=http://gaffa.org/reaching/rev_aer_UK5.html|quote=the almost autistic satisfaction of the obsessive-compulsive mathematician fascinated by 'Pi' (which affords the opportunity to hear Bush slowly sing vast chunks of the number in question, several dozen digits long)|ref=harv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015122229/http://gaffa.org/reaching/rev_aer_UK5.html|archivedate=15 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Pi Day]] falls on 14&amp;nbsp;March (written 3/14 in the US style), and is popular among students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piday.org/2008/2008-pi-day-activities-for-teachers/ Pi Day activities].&lt;/ref&gt; {{pi}} and its digital representation are often used by self-described "math [[geek]]s" for [[inside joke]]s among mathematically and technologically minded groups. Several college [[cheering|cheers]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] include "3.14159".&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/cheer/2004-2005SpecificWebPages/GeneralInformation/cheers.html MIT cheers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119001912/http://web.mit.edu/cheer/2004-2005SpecificWebPages/GeneralInformation/cheers.html |date=19 January 2009 }}.

In 1897, an amateur American mathematician attempted to persuade the [[Indiana General Assembly|Indiana legislature]] to pass the [[Indiana Pi Bill]], which described a method to [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]] and contained text that implied various incorrect values for {{pi}}, including 3.2. The bill is notorious as an attempt to establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat. The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=211–212}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Posamentier|Lehmann|2004|pp=36–37}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hallerberg|first1=Arthur|date=May 1977|title=Indiana's squared circle|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=50|issue=3|pages=136–140|jstor=2689499|doi=10.2307/2689499|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer culture===
In contemporary [[internet culture]], individuals and organizations frequently pay homage to the number {{pi}}. For instance, the [[computer scientist]] [[Donald Knuth]] let the version numbers of his program [[TeX]] approach {{pi}}. The versions are 3, 3.1, 3.14, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ntg.nl/maps/05/34.pdf|title=The Future of TeX and Metafont|first=Donald|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|journal=TeX Mag|volume=5|issue=1|page=145|date=1990-10-03|accessdate=2017-02-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413230304/http://www.ntg.nl/maps/05/34.pdf|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Planet of Giants''''' is the first serial of the [[Doctor Who (season 2)|second season]] in the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which was first broadcast in three weekly parts from 31 October to 14 November 1964.

In the serial, the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]), his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), and teachers [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]) and [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) are shrunk to the size of an inch after the Doctor's time machine the [[TARDIS]] arrives in contemporary England. The Doctor and Susan head inside a laboratory to find Ian and Barbara after the two parties get separated.

==Plot==
Despite indications of a malfunction in the [[TARDIS]], its fault locator shows nothing is wrong and that it is safe to go outside. [[First Doctor|The Doctor]], [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]] and [[Susan Foreman|Susan]] consequently explore the vicinity, finding the remains of giant earthworm and ant, which appear to have died instantaneously. The travellers realise they have returned to Earth but have shrunk to the height of an inch.

Ian is investigating the interior of a discarded matchbox when someone picks it up. That someone is a government scientist called Farrow who is visiting a callous industrialist named Forester to tell him that his application for a new insecticide called DN6 has been rejected as it is far too deadly to all forms of insect life. News of this appraisal prompts Forester to fatally shoot Farrow. The Doctor, Barbara and Susan hear the gunshot and head for the house to find Ian unhurt near Farrow’s corpse.

Forester’s aide, Smithers, arrives but does not report the murder for fear of undermining the DN6 project to which he has dedicated his life. Ian and Barbara hide inside Farrow's briefcase to avoid being stepped on by Forester and Smithers, and get separated from the Doctor and Susan after the briefcase is brought inside the house. The Doctor and Susan climb up a drain pipe to find them. Forester alters Farrow’s report to give support to the DN6 licence application and, disguising his voice as Farrow’s, makes a supportive phonecall to the ministry to the same effect. This is overheard by the local [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]], Hilda Rowse, and her policeman husband, Bert, who suspect something is wrong.

Within the house, Ian and Barbara encounter a giant fly, which is killed instantly when it contacts sample seeds that had been sprayed with DN6. Barbara had foolishly handled one of these seeds and begins to feel unwell. The Doctor, realising the toxic nature of DN6 and the probable contamination of Barbara, proposes they alert someone by hoisting up the giant telephone receiver, but they cannot make themselves heard. At the telephone exchange, the engaged signal makes Hilda and Bert increasingly concerned. Bert heads off to the house to investigate.

The Doctor and his companions decide to attract attention by starting a fire, succeeding in manoeuvring an aerosol can into the flames of the [[Bunsen burner]] gas outlet. This coincides with Smithers discovering the true virulence of DN6 and demanding Forester cease his licence application. In the lab, the makeshift bomb explodes in Forester’s face as PC Rowse arrives.

Back in the TARDIS the Doctor succeeds in returning the craft and crew to normal size, a process which cures Barbara of her infection by DN6.

==Production==
An early version of this concept – by [[C. E. Webber]] and entitled ''The Giants'' – was originally meant to be the first story of the first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J.

Upon viewing Episodes 3 and 4, which focused more heavily on Hilda and Bert, Head of Serials [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] ordered them spliced together in order to form a faster-paced climax (Episode 3) focusing on the core characters of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J.

When Episodes 3 and 4 were edited together to make the new Episode 3, only Camfield was credited.

The decision to splice the last two episodes into one would have ramifications for the second production block of the series, when the producers were left with a one-episode space following ''[[Galaxy 4]]''. Rather than producing a single-episode stand-alone story or extend any of the planned serials, "[[Mission to the Unknown]]" was commissioned to serve as a prelude to ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' without the participation of any of the regular cast. This was produced in the same block as ''Galaxy 4'', and both were held over to form the first five episodes of Season 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Sullivan|first = Shannon|title = Mission to the Unknown (aka.

In 2008, ''[[Radio Times]]'' reviewer Patrick Mulkern wrote that the story had ambition and impressive set design, but felt that "the drama itself is less than enthralling". He pegged the scientists to stereotypes and found it disappointing that they did not directly interact with the miniature TARDIS crew about their plans. Mulkern also noted that Barbara "[came] across as uncharacteristically wet" and Dudley Simpson's score was "annoyingly childish".&lt;ref name="Radio Times"&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Mulkern|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2008-11-14/doctor-who-planet-of-giants|title=Doctor Who: Planet of Giants|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=14 November 2008|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Talk]]'s John Sinnott gave ''Planet of Giants'' three out of five stars, feeling that it was an average "solid installment". Sinnott noted that it was a strange story because the TARDIS crew did not directly interact with the "pretty stupid" criminals and they seemed more concerned about exploring than returning to their normal size.&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Sinnott|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/56812/doctor-who-ep-09-planet-of-giants/|title=Doctor Who: Planet of Giants|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Golder of ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' gave the serial two and a half out of five stars, feeling that it was "undeniably slow, talky and lacking in excitement" and "not quite in synch with the main show" because Barbara and Ian never note that they are in contemporary Britain, to which they are trying to return. Despite praising the TARDIS crew for using "intelligence, ingenuity and simple science to get themselves out of problems", he felt they lacked their usual chemistry and also criticised Barbara's characterisation.&lt;ref name="SFX review"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Golder|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/08/17/doctor-who-planet-of-giants-review/|title=Doctor Who: Planet of Giants Review|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|date=17 August 2012|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Christopher Bahn described the serial as "not lacking in ambitious ideas but never quite [gelling] together, and a last-minute re-edit that condensed the original third and fourth episodes into one hurt the story more than it helped". Bahn felt that the script "is constantly undercutting its own dramatic potential in subtle but pervasive ways", such as when the characters tried calling the police on a telephone, and the "plot-dragger" of Barbara keeping her illness a secret. However, he praised set design and acting of Hill and Tilvern.&lt;ref name="AV Club"&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher|last=Bahn|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/planet-of-the-giants,89561|title=Planet of Giants|work=[[The A.V.

'''Postmodern Vertigo''' is  a description of a panic that occurs when somebody considers the reality of their own existence but no longer accepts truth or structure in their thought.  Suddenly the thinker no longer believes in anything, everything seeming like a fabrication. Thought become meaningless and a feeling akin to [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] is experienced.  Many writers have described this feeling as "the void" or as a "crisis of postmodernism".  Another term which has a similar meaning is anomie.  Whereas a crisis of postmodernism describes the thought or meaning of viewing existence as a false construct and the void creates a metaphoric representation and Anomie refers to the philosophical dead end, Post-modern vertigo more specifically has been used to refer to this feeling when it takes on a physiological manifestation, causing an increase in heart rate and sweating.

Postmodern vertigo might be a form of [[existential crisis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2324">'''Psychorama''', also called '''the precon process''', is the act of communicating [[subliminal messages|subliminal]] information through [[film]] by flashing images on the screen so quickly that they cannot be perceived by the conscious mind.

==History==
In 1958, a film called ''My World Dies Screaming'' (later retitled ''[[Terror in the Haunted House]]'') marked [[Hollywood]]'s first attempt to make use of this technique. At different points in this film, a skull is flashed to inspire terror, a snake to inspire hate, two hearts to inspire love, and large letters spelling out "blood" to create fear. It was produced by William Edwards, written by Robert C. Dennis, and directed by [[Harold Daniels]]. It starred [[Gerald Mohr]] and Cathy O'Donnell. Makeup was handled by [[Harry Thomas (makeup artist)|Harry Thomas]], who worked on a number of [[Ed Wood]] movies in the 50s. The plot concerned a woman who is brought by her husband to live in an old house that she saw many times before in her nightmares, and she desperately tries to get him to leave the house before something terrible happens.

The following year, 1959, saw another film produced using this same format, titled ''[[A Date with Death]]''. This film also starred Gerald Mohr, coincidentally.

The technique of psychorama has also been featured in more recent films, including ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''. In the later film, [[Fight Club (novel)#Tyler Durden|Tyler Durden]] splices images of pornography into family movies that play at the movie theater he works at as a part-time projectionist. 

The band [[Evanescence]] used this technique in their Sweet Sacrifice music video. In it, images of bones, skulls, houses, fires, and videos of the band performing are flashed at various intervals. Evanescence also utilized samples from "My World Dies Screaming" in some versions of their song "Understanding", the demo of "Whisper" and the introduction to the album Origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==
The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/05/19/l-economie-mauve-une-nouvelle-alliance-entre-culture-et-economie_1524674_3232.html Le Monde.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; published on [[Le Monde|Le Monde.fr]].

[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/Asso_diversum_10-05-2010_en.pdf Source]&lt;/ref&gt; which organized the first International Purple Economy Forum under the patronage of [[UNESCO]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purple-economy.org Website of the International Purple Economy Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

The '''Reggio Emilia approach''' is an educational philosophy focused on [[preschool]] and [[primary education]].  It is a [[pedagogy]] described as [[student-centered learning|student-centered]] and [[constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] that utilizes self-directed, [[experiential learning]] in relationship-driven environments.  The program is based on the principles of respect, responsibility, and community through exploration and discovery through a self-guided [[curriculum]].  At its core is an assumption that children form their own personality during early years of development and are endowed with "a hundred languages", through which they can express their ideas. The aim of the Reggio approach is to teach how to use these symbolic languages (e.g., painting, sculpting, drama) in everyday life.  It was developed after [[World War II]] by psychologist Loris Malaguzzi and parents in the villages around [[Reggio Emilia]], Italy, and derives its name from the city.

==History==
During the post-[[World War II]] era in Italy, the “…desire to bring change and create anew"&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt; accompanied great economic and social development, including in education.&lt;ref name=NAREA&gt;{{cite web |title=North American Reggio Emilia Alliance |url=http://www.reggioalliance.org |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s Malaguzzi’s method was known and appreciated by many educators especially thanks to the first exhibit opened at the Modern Museet in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. In Italy, the [[National Group for Work and Study on Infant Toddler Centers]] was formed.

On May 24, 1994, the non-profit organization [[Friends of Reggio Children International Association]] was founded to promote the work of Loris Malaguzzi and organize professional development and cultural events.&lt;ref name="Friends of Reggio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of Reggio Children International Association|url=http://zerosei.comune.re.it/inter/amici.htm|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In November 2002, during the annual conference of the National Association for the Education of Young Children in Chicago, the North American Reggio Emilia Alliance was formally launched as an organization.&lt;ref name=NAREA /&gt;

In 2003 the municipality of Reggio Emilia chose to manage the system and the network of school services and toddler centers by forming the ''Istituzione Scuole e Nidi d'Infanzia''.  This allowed municipal schools and preschools to have independent programs and activities with support from the government.

In February 2006, the [[Reggio Children Foundation|Loris Malaguzzi International Centre]] opened in Reggio Emilia, Italy, as a meeting place for professional development and research of the Reggio philosophy.  On September 29, 2011, the non-profit Reggio Children-Loris Malaguzzi Centre Foundation was officially established at the Loris Malaguzzi International Centre with the aim of fostering “education and research to improve the lives of people and communities, in Reggio Emilia and in the world”.&lt;ref name="Reggio Children Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fondazione Reggio Children Centro Loris Malaguzzi|url=http://reggiochildrenfoundation.org|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Reggio Emilia philosophy is based upon the following set of principles: 
*[[Child]]ren must have some control over the direction of their learning; 
*Children must be able to learn through experiences of touching, moving, listening, and observing; 
*Children have a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with other children and with material items in the world that they must be allowed to explore;
*Children must have endless ways and opportunities to express themselves.

The Reggio Emilia approach to teaching young children puts the natural [[development of children]] as well as the close relationships that they share with their environment at the center of its philosophy. The foundation of the Reggio Emilia approach lies in its unique view of the child: to foster education in the youngest learners to promote the best possible integration among children’s "100 languages".&lt;ref name="A Hundred Languages"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Hundred|url=http://www.childrenfirstschool.org/cf.php?id=childrenC&amp;t=100%20Languages|accessdate=28 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001540/http://www.childrenfirstschool.org/cf.php?id=childrenC&amp;t=100%20Languages|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, there is a belief that children have rights and should be given opportunities to develop their potential. Children are considered to be “knowledge bearers”, so they are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas about everything they could meet or do during the day.
“Influenced by this belief, the child is beheld as beautiful, powerful, competent, creative, curious, and full of potential and ambitious desires."&lt;ref name=Hewitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hewitt|first=Valarie|title=Examining the Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1023/A:1012520828095}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The child is viewed as being an active constructor of knowledge.  Rather than being seen as the target of instruction, children are seen as having the active role of an apprentice.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Lilian|title=The Hundred Languages of Children: The Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education|year=1993|publisher=Ablex Publishing Corporation|location=Norwood, NJ|pages=19–37|authorlink=What can we learn from Reggio Emilia?|editor=Edwards, C. |editor2=Gandini, L. |editor3=Forman, G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This role also extends to that of a researcher.  Much of the instruction at Reggio Emilia schools takes place in the form of projects where they have opportunities to explore, observe, hypothesize, question, and discuss to clarify their understanding.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;{{cite book|last=Forman|first=G.|title=Constructivism: Theory, Perspectives, and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0807734889|pages=172–181|authorlink=The project approach in Reggio Emilia|editor=Fosnot, CT }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Children are also viewed as social beings and a focus is made on the child in relation to other children, the family, the teachers, and the community rather than on each child in isolation.&lt;ref name=Gandini&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gandini|first=L.|title=Fundamentals of the Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education|journal=Young Children|date=1993|volume=49|issue=1|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are taught that respect for everyone else is important because everyone is a “subjective agency ” while existing as part of a group.

Reggio Emilia's approach to early education reflects a theoretical kinship with [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Vygotsky]] and [[Jerome Bruner]], among others. Much of what occurs in the class reflects a [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] approach to early education. Reggio Emilia's approach does challenge some conceptions of teacher competence and developmentally appropriate practice. For example, teachers in Reggio Emilia assert the importance of being confused as a contributor to learning; thus a major teaching strategy is purposely to allow mistakes to happen, or to begin a project with no clear sense of where it might end. Another characteristic that is counter to the beliefs of many Western educators is the importance of the child's ability to negotiate in the peer group.

One of the most challenging aspects of the Reggio Emilia approach is the solicitation of multiple points of view regarding children's needs, interests, and abilities, and the concurrent faith in parents, teachers, and children to contribute in meaningful ways to the determination of school experiences. Teachers trust themselves to respond appropriately to children's ideas and interests, they trust children to be interested in things worth knowing about, and they trust parents to be informed and productive members of a cooperative educational team. The result is an atmosphere of community and collaboration that is developmentally appropriate for adults and children alike. &lt;ref name=New&gt;{{cite journal|last=New|first=Rebecca S.|title=Reggio Emelia: Some Lessons for U.S. Educators” ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education|journal=ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education|date=1993|url=https://www.ericdigests.org/1993/reggio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community support and parental involvement==
Reggio Emilia's tradition of community support for families with young children expands on a view, more strongly held in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, of children as the [[collective responsibility]] of the local community. In Reggio Emilia, the [[infant]]/[[toddler]] and [[pre-primary]] program is a vital part of the community, as reflected in the high level of financial support. Community involvement is also apparent in citizen membership in La Consulta, a school committee that exerts significant influence over [[local government]] policy.

[[Parents]] are a vital component to the Reggio Emilia philosophy; they are viewed as partners, collaborators, and advocates for their children. [[Teachers]] respect parents as each child's first teacher and involve parents in every aspect of the curriculum. It is not uncommon to see parents volunteering within Reggio Emilia classrooms throughout the school. This philosophy does not end when the child leaves the classroom. Some parents who choose to send their children to a Reggio Emilia program incorporate many of the [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] within their parenting and home life. The parents' role mirrors the community's, at both the school-wide and the classroom level. Parents are expected to take part in discussions about school policy, [[child development]] concerns, and [[curriculum]] planning and evaluation.

==The role of teachers==

[[File:Teachers and children in an italian kindergarten.jpg|left|thumb|Teachers and children in an Italian nursery school]]In the Reggio approach, the teacher is considered a co-learner and collaborator with the child and not just an instructor.  Teachers are encouraged to facilitate the child's learning by planning activities and lessons based on the child's interests, asking questions to further understanding, and actively engaging in the activities alongside the child, instead of passively observing the child learning.  "As partner to the child, the teacher is inside the learning situation" (Hewett, 2001).

Some implementations of the Reggio Emilia approach self-consciously juxtapose their conception of the teacher as autonomous co-learner with other approaches. For example:

Teachers' long-term commitment to enhancing their understanding of children is at the crux of the Reggio Emilia approach. They compensate for the meagre pre-service training of Italian early childhood teachers{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} by providing extensive staff development opportunities, with goals determined by the teachers themselves. Teacher autonomy is evident in the absence of teacher manuals, curriculum guides, or achievement tests. The lack of externally imposed mandates is joined by the imperative that teachers become skilled observers of children in order to inform their curriculum planning and implementation.&lt;ref name="reggioemillaapproach.net"&gt;[http://www.reggioemiliaapproach.net/about.php], The Regio Emila Approach - The Pre-school Childs (sic) languages of learning&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on projects with the child, the teacher can also expand the child's learning by collecting data that can be reviewed at a later time. The teacher needs to maintain an active, mutual participation in the activity to help ensure that the child clearly understands what is being "taught". Teachers partner with colleagues, students, and parents in the learning process. They discuss their observations with them, as part of an ongoing dialogue and continuing evolution of their ideas and practices.  This allows them to be flexible in their plans, preparations, and teaching approaches.

Often, teachers listen to and observe children in the classroom and record their observations to help plan the curriculum and prepare the environment and teaching tools to support the student's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, G.S. (2010). "[http://www.education.com/reference/article/reggio-emilia/ Reggio Emilia]". Education.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===
Using a variety of media, teachers give careful attention to the documentation and presentation of the thinking of the students.  Rather than following standardized assessments, the teacher inquires and listens closely to the children.  An example of documentation might be a book or panel with the student’s words, drawings, and photographs.  By making learning visible, the student's thinking and feeling can be studied while the documentation serves to helps with evaluation of the educators' work and refinement of the curriculum.  It provides parents information regarding their child’s learning experience while creating an archive for the class and school.&lt;ref name=Wien&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wien|first=C.A.|author2=Guyevskey, V. |author3=Berdoussis, N. |title=Learning to Document in Reggio-inspired Education|journal=Early Childhood Research and Practice|year=2011|volume=13|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the environment==
[[File:Spazi comuni nella scuola per l'infanzia.jpg|right|thumb|599x599px|The "piazza": common space in a preschool]]Malaguzzi believed the physical environment to be of fundamental importance to the early childhood program; he referred to it as the "third teacher", alongside adults and other students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/yc/node/324 NAEYC, Young Children, VOL. 70 NO. 5, Mary Ann Biermeier, ''Inspired by Reggio Emilia: Emergent Curriculum in Relationship-Driven Learning Environments''].  Retrieved 2017-06-02&lt;/ref&gt; Static  One of the aims in the design of new spaces - and the redesign of existing ones - is integration of the classroom space with the surrounding environment: the rest of the school, and community the school is a part of. The importance of the environment lies in the belief that children can best create meaning and make sense of their world through environments which support "complex, varied, sustained, and changing relationships between people, the world of experience, ideas and the many ways of expressing ideas."&lt;ref name="Cadwell"&gt;{{cite web | author=Cadwell, L.| year=1997| title=Bringing Reggio Emilia home:An innovative approach to early childhood education. | work=Teachers College Press, New York| url=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, the preschools generally incorporate natural light and indoor plants.  Classrooms open to a center [[piazza]], kitchens are open to view, and access to the outside and surrounding community is provided through courtyards, large windows, and exterior doors in each classroom. Entries capture the attention of both children and adults through the use of mirrors (on the walls, floors, and ceilings), photographs, and children's work accompanied by transcriptions of their discussions. These same features characterize classroom interiors, where displays of project work are interspersed with arrays of found objects and classroom materials. In each case, the environment informs and engages the viewer.

Other supportive elements of the environment include ample space for supplies, frequently rearranged to draw attention to their aesthetic features. In each classroom there are studio spaces in the form of a large, centrally located [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] and a smaller mini-atelier, and clearly designated spaces for large- and small-group activities. Throughout the school, there is an effort to create opportunities for children to interact. The single dress-up area is in the center piazza; classrooms are connected with telephones, passageways or windows; and lunchrooms and bathrooms are designed to encourage community.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic Codes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Tarr, Patricia| year=2001| title=
Aesthetic Codes in Early Childhood Classrooms: What Art Educators Can Learn from Reggio Emilia| work=Art Education, Vol. 54, No. 3| url=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohorts or groups of students stay with one teacher for a three-year period, creating consistency in environment and relationships.

==Long-term projects as vehicles for learning==
The curriculum is characterized by many features advocated by contemporary research on young children, including real-life problem-solving among peers, with numerous opportunities for creative thinking and exploration. Teachers often work on projects with small groups of children, while the rest of the class engages in a wide variety of self-selected activities typical of preschool classrooms.

The projects that teachers and children engage in are different in a number of ways from those that characterize American teachers' conceptions of unit or [[thematic learning|thematic studies]]. The topic of investigation may derive directly from teacher observations of children's spontaneous play and exploration. Project topics are also selected on the basis of an academic curiosity or social concern on the part of teachers or parents, or serendipitous events that direct the attention of the children and teachers. Reggio teachers place a high value on their ability to improvise and respond to children's predisposition to enjoy the unexpected. Regardless of their origins, successful projects are those that generate a sufficient amount of interest and uncertainty to provoke children's creative thinking and problem-solving and are open to different avenues of exploration. Because curriculum decisions are based on developmental and sociocultural concerns, small groups of children of varying abilities and interests, including those with special needs, work together on projects.

Projects begin with teachers observing and questioning children about the topic of interest. Based on children's responses, teachers introduce materials, questions, and opportunities that provoke children to further explore the topic. While some of these teacher provocations are anticipated, projects often move in unanticipated directions as a result of problems children identify. Thus, curriculum planning and implementation revolve around open-ended and often long-term projects that are based on the reciprocal nature of teacher-directed and child-initiated activity. All of the topics of interest are given by the children.  Within the project approach, children are given opportunities to make connections between prior and new knowledge while engaging in authentic tasks...

==The hundred languages of children==
The term "hundred languages of children" refers to the many ways that children have of expressing themselves.  Reggio teachers provide children different avenues for thinking, revising, constructing, negotiating, developing and symbolically expressing their thoughts and feelings. The goal is for the adults and children to better understand one another.&lt;ref name=NAREA /&gt;

As children proceed in an investigation, generating and testing their hypotheses, they are encouraged to depict their understanding through one of many symbolic languages, including drawing, sculpture, dramatic play, and writing. They work together toward the resolution of problems that arise. Teachers facilitate and then observe debates regarding the extent to which a child's drawing or other form of representation lives up to the expressed intent. Revision of drawings (and ideas) is encouraged, and teachers allow children to repeat activities and modify each other's work in the collective aim of better understanding the topic. Teachers foster children's involvement in the processes of exploration and evaluation, acknowledging the importance of their evolving products as vehicles for exchange.&lt;ref name="HundredLanguages"&gt;{{cite web | author=Edwards, C.,Gandini L., &amp; Forman, G. (Eds.)| year=1998| title= The Hundred Languages of Children | work=Reggio Emilia, Italy: Reggio Emilia| url=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">For over one thousand years the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] have used [[Sawndip]] to write a wide variety of literature, including folk songs, operas, poems, scriptures, letters, contracts, and court documents.&lt;ref&gt;壮文论集 Anthology of Written Zhuang by 梁庭望 Liang Tingwang 2007 Published by 中央民族大学出版社 Central Minorities University Press pages 153-158 {{ISBN|9787811084368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works include both entirely indigenous works and translations from Chinese, fact and fiction, religious and secular and give us insight in to the life of the Zhuang and the people they have had contact with over a period of two millennia, a writing tradition that is still alive to this day.

==Characteristics==

Sawndip literature is traditionally though not always written in verse. Only a small percentage of Sawndip literature has been published. Folk songs, or stories, are often adapted over time, for example ''Fwen Ciengzyeingz'', meaning "Song to tell others",  gives a philosophy of life, and of which Liáng Tíngwàng observes from the proper pronouns used the song have their origin in Sui-Tang Dynasties and with its final form was set almost a thousand years later in the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;《壮族伦理道德长诗传扬歌译注》 pages 5-81 Liáng Tíngwàng 梁庭望 2005 广西民族出版社&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the rules are flexible the two main types of verse are either 5 characters a line or 7 characters a line, and commonly 4 lines to a stanza. In some texts whilst lines are resung several times in set combinations, the lines are only written once. Waist rhyming is common. Older manuscripts for antiphonal songs only record the male lyrics, whereas modern versions may include both male and female lyrics.

==Notable Works==

===The Orphan Girl and the Rich Girl (Cinderella)===
One fairy tale which has attracted much attention on recent years is "The orphan girl and the rich girl" an early version of the story [[Cinderella]] (Zhuang "Dahgyax Dahbengz" Dah - indicates female, gyax means orphan and bengz means rich) found in Zhuang opera scripts. A 9th century Chinese translation of the Zhuang story entitled [[Ye Xian]] was written in the [[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]&lt;ref&gt;广西民间故事(二) pages 7 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sawndip versions we now have are quite similar and analysis suggests these versions took shape no later than the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;壮族文学发展史 （上册）by 周作秋 page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song about Tang Emperors===
"Song about Tang Emperors" ("𠯘唐皇" Fwen Dangzvuengz), is about 5,000 lines long, and mainly about [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] the fifth and ninth emperor of Tang Dynasty born in 662， the content is similar to sections of the 18th century Chinese [[historical novel]] 《薛刚反唐》 hence some consider it to be an adaptation from the novel, however some manuscript evidence suggests it was already in circulation in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;广西大百科全书 Encyclopedia of Guangxi Vol 5 page 445 {{ISBN|9787500079729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;清代戏曲抄本叙录 A Catalogue of Qing Dynasty Opera Manuscripts by 朱恒夫&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The house-building song"===
"The house-building song" has been sung for over a thousand years&lt;ref&gt;Liao Songs of Pingguo Zhuang Songs of March page 60 {{ISBN|978-7-5495-1097-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; this song has two parts, the first part describes the construction of a traditional [[stilt house]] and the second part the customs to ward off evil from the new home&lt;ref&gt;Liao Songs of Pingguo Zhuang Songs of March pages 56 {{ISBN|978-7-5495-1097-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Origin of the Bronze Drum"===
"The Origin of the [[bronze drum|Bronze Drum]]" tells of the origins of bronze drums that are like "stars" (such drums have a star in the middle of them), that they are as many as the stars of the sky and like stars can ward off evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;广西民间故事(二) pages 129-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shadorma''' is a poetic form consisting of a six-line [[stanza]] (or sestet).  The form is alleged to have originated in [[Spain]].  Each stanza has a [[syllable]] count of three syllables in the first line, five syllables in the second line, three syllables in the third and fourth lines, seven syllables in the fifth line, and five syllables in the sixth line (3/5/3/3/7/5) for a total of 26 syllables.  A poem may consist of one stanza, or an unlimited number of stanzas (a series of shadormas).

The ''shadorma'' has been used by many modern writers{{fact|date=June 2013}} and is a popular writing exercise in creative writing programs and workshops.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, Éamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

[[File:Sheelanagigfethardwall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheela na gig on town wall in [[Fethard, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]]]]

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''Síle'' and ''Síla''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''Síle na gcíoch'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 – The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Seán-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gCíoch'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''Síle ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''Síle,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''Síle na gCíoċ'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Foclóir Gaeḋlge agus Béarla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ɡʲiː|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===
[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|text-top|thumb|right|La Fontaine plate, illustrated by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] (1762)]]
Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar González|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

[[File:IlMazzoVisconteo.jpg|thumb|First edition, part one]]
'''''The Castle of Crossed Destinies''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il castello dei destini incrociati'''}}) is a 1973 novel by the Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]]. Its narrative details a meeting among travelers who are inexplicably unable to speak after traveling through a forest. The characters in the novel recount their tales via [[Tarot cards]], which are reconstructed by the narrator. The novel is in two parts, each using a different style Tarot deck. The first part was published alone in 1969 as ''Tarocchi: Il mazzo visconteo di Bergamo e New York'' (Tarots: The [[Visconti-Sforza tarot cards|Visconti Pack]] in Bergamo and New York). The second part, with the header "The Tavern of Crossed Destinies", features the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].

The novel is an exploration of how meaning is created, whether that be written via words (by the author, via the book, since the characters in the book cannot speak to each other) or by images (the tarot cards – considered prophetic by some, and themselves open to many symbolic interpretations). It is, as often in Calvino's works, multi-layered, and several levels of interpretations and readings are possible, based on the author–narrator–[[fictional character|character]]–[[Reading (process)|reader]] relationship.

==Plot==
The film begins with a man narrating then opens with Bobby Carter and his psychiatrist discussing the events of the first film, which took place eight years ago. Bobby is still traumatized by the events, but he and Rachel, (formerly known as Ruby) who now owns a biker team, have also invented a super fuel that can power bikes. The team is due to race in the same desert where the original massacre took place and Bobby's psychiatrist convinces him to go, but he declines and Rachel takes his place. The team consisting of the blind Cass, her boyfriend Roy, Harry, Hulk, Foster, Jane and Sue meets up at a bus and sets off. Along the way, they pick up Beast from a dog pound. Previously owned by the Carters, he now belongs to Rachel.

While going through the desert, they get lost and Harry suggests a shortcut through the bombing range. As they drive, the bus begins leaking fuel and they stop at an old mining ranch. As they explore the mine, Pluto, who apparently survived the earlier attack from Beast, attacks Rachel. She fights him off and he retreats, but no one believes her at first until Pluto returns and steals one of their bikes. Roy and Harry chase him down, but Harry falls behind, gets caught in a trap and is flattened by a massive rock. Roy catches Pluto, but is ambushed by a 7-foot cannibal called the Reaper, who knocks him unconscious. The Reaper is later revealed to be Papa Jupiter's older brother.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group stays at the mine until nightfall. They begin to worry about Roy and Harry, but Rachel and Hulk depart to look for them while the others stay behind. The Reaper begins to stalk the remaining teens. As Hulk and Rachel try to escape by motorcycle, the Reaper shoots Hulk through the chest with a spear bolt, leaving Rachel to run away in fear. 

The Reaper returns to the mine, where he pulls Foster under the bus and kills him. Jane finds Foster's body just before the Reaper catches her and crushes her in his arms. Sue returns to the camp, only for the Reaper to throw her through a window and slit her throat with a machete. Rachel runs into Pluto, who pins her to the ground, but Beast surprises him and chases him away. Rachel tries to follow Beast, but runs into a trap set by the Reaper, which catapults Hulk's corpse against her. Slammed backwards, she trips and fatally hits the back of her head on a rock.

Meanwhile, Roy wakes up and runs into Pluto at the top of a cliff. Pluto gets ready to attack him, but Beast returns and knocks him off the cliff to his death. Cass runs from the Reaper and ends up in his mineshaft where he dumped the bodies, and comes across the corpses of all her friends. She throws a jar of acid at the Reaper's face and escapes up a rope with help from Roy. The Reaper follows them, but they trap him in a bus full of bike fuel, set it on fire and watch as it explodes. The Reaper escapes from the wreckage covered in flames and attempts to kill them one last time, but he stumbles into an open mineshaft, falling to his death after which Roy and Cass embrace. The film ends with Roy, Cass and Beast walking away from the mine at sunrise, into the vast desert as they follow the road home.{{sfn|Muir|2004|pages=96–100}}

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''The Hills Have Eyes Part II'' received unanimously negative reviews from critics. [[AllMovie]] called it "atrocious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v63256|title=The Hills Have Eyes, Part 2 - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast - AllMovie|last=Firsching|first=Robert|work=[[AllMovie]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|location=United States|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 0% based on reviews from 5 critics and a rating of  2.5 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hills_have_eyes_the_pt_2/ |title=The Hills Have Eyes, Part 2 - Rotten Tomatoes |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|Variety staff]] wrote in their review: "From then on, it’s dull, formula terror pic cliches, with one attractive teenager after another picked off by the surviving cannibals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1984/film/reviews/the-hills-have-eyes-part-ii-1200426426/|title=Review: ‘The Hills Have Eyes Part II’|author=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety staff]]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|date=December 31, 1984|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Official Splatter Movie Guide, Volumes: 1963-1992: Hundreds of the Goriest, Grossest, Most Outrageous Films Ever Made'' by John McCarty, he states "Writer–director [[Wes Craven]] must have thought we all suffer from [[amnesia]], too, because he fills the sequel with clips from the first film to help us remember what happened in it. Either that or, because he really didn't have anything new up his sleeve, he was just trying pad out the running time. The movie is so bad that it was shelved for two years, never released theatrically, then sold to video and [[Pay television|pay TV]] to help recoup some of the costs."&lt;ref name="McCathy"/&gt;{{ref|1|1}}

[[DVD Talk]] writes in its review: "The story goes that [[Wes Craven]] quickly disowned ''The Hills Have Eyes Part 2'', hammering out a quick-and-dirty sequel because he desperately needed the cash. Remember, we're talking about the guy who cowrote the legendary killer-cellphone genre classic ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'' and directed the dreadful inner-city-inspirational-teacher flick ''Music of the Heart'' too; if he disowns a movie, as all over the place as his filmography is, it's gotta be painful. The really bizarre thing is that this was made in the wake of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', a movie that was shot for next-to-nothing but is overflowing with imagination and boasts a dazzlingly inventive visual eye. That well must have been tapped completely dry when cameras started to roll on ''The Hills Have Eyes Part 2'' however many months later. As disturbing as the original ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' remains all these years later, the sequel doesn't deliver anything close to that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/53850/hills-have-eyes-part-2-the/|title=The Hills Have Eyes, Part II|work=[[DVD Talk]]|publisher=[[Internet Brands]]|location=United States|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion''''' ({{lang-ru|Протоколы сионских мудрецов}}) or '''''The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion''''' is an [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic fabricated text]] purporting to describe a [[Jewish]] plan for global domination. The hoax, which was shown to be plagiarized from several earlier sources, some not antisemitic in nature,{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}} was first published in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. According to the claims made by some of its publishers, the ''Protocols'' are the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting where Jewish leaders discussed their goal of global Jewish [[hegemony]] by subverting the morals of [[Gentile]]s, and by controlling the press and the world's economies.

[[Henry Ford]] funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the United States in the 1920s. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] sometimes used the ''Protocols'' as propaganda against Jews; it was assigned by some German teachers, as if factual, to be read by German schoolchildren after the Nazis came to power in 1933,&lt;ref name = "Segel"&gt;Segel, BW and Levy, RS. ''A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion''. University of Nebraska Press (1995), p. 30. {{ISBN|0803242433}},&lt;/ref&gt; despite having been exposed as fraudulent by ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]] in 1921. It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document.

==Creation==
{{Antisemitism}}
The ''Protocols'' is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. Textual evidence shows that it could not have been produced prior to 1901. It is notable that the title of [[Sergei Nilus]]'s widely distributed edition contains the dates "1902–1903", and it is likely that the document was actually written at this time in Russia, despite Nilus' attempt to cover this up by inserting French-sounding words into his edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michelis|first1=Cesare G. De|title=The non-existent manuscript : a study of the Protocols of the sages of Zion|date=2004|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0803217277|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] argues that it was manufactured in the months after a Russian Zionist congress in September 1902, and that it was originally a parody of Jewish idealism meant for internal circulation among antisemites until it was decided to clean it up and publish it as if it were real. Self-contradictions in various testimonies show that the individuals involved—including the text's initial publisher, [[Pavel Krushevan]]—deliberately obscured the origins of the text and lied about it in the decades afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michelis|first1=Cesare G. De|title=The non-existent manuscript : a study of the Protocols of the sages of Zion|date=2004|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0803217277|pages=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the placement of the forgery in 1902–1903 Russia is correct, then it was written at the beginning of the [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]], in which thousands of Jews died or fled the country. Many of the people whom De Michelis suspects of involvement in the forgery were directly responsible for inciting the pogroms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Political conspiracy background===
Towards the end of the 18th century, following the [[Partitions of Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]] inherited the world's largest Jewish population. The Jews lived in ''[[shtetls]]'' in the West of the Empire, in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and until the 1840s, local Jewish affairs were organised through the ''[[qahal]]'', including for purposes of taxation and conscription into the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Following the ascent of [[liberalism]] in Europe, the Russian ruling class became more hardline in its reactionary policies, upholding the banner of ''[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]'', whereby non-Orthodox and non-Russian subjects, including the Jews, were not always embraced. Jews who attempted to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilate]] were regarded with suspicion as potential "infiltrators" supposedly trying to "take over society", while Jews who remained attached to traditional Jewish culture were resented as undesirable aliens.

[[File:Kagal book.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) by Jacob Brafman, in the Russian language original.]]
Resentment towards Jews, for the aforementioned reasons, existed in Russian society, but the idea of a Protocols-esque [[international Jewish conspiracy]] for world domination was minted in the 1860s. [[Jacob Brafman]], a Russian Jew from [[Minsk]], had a falling out with agents of the local kahal &amp;ndash; the semi-autonomous Jewish government &amp;ndash; and consequently turned against [[Judaism]]. He subsequently converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and authored polemics against the [[Talmud]] and the kahal.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} Brafman claimed in his books ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869), published in [[Vilna]], that the kahal continued to exist in secret and that it had as its principal aim undermining Christian entrepreneurs, taking over their property and ultimately seizing power. He also claimed that it was an international conspiratorial network, under the central control of the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'', which was based in Paris and then under the leadership of [[Adolphe Crémieux]], a prominent [[freemason]].{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} The Vilna Talmudist, [[Jacob Barit]], attempted to refute Brafman's claim.

The impact of Brafman's work took on an international aspect, as it was translated into English, French, German and other languages. The image of the "kahal" as a secret international Jewish shadow government working as a [[state within a state]] was picked up by anti-Jewish publications in Russia and was taken seriously by some Russian officials such as P. A. Cherevin and [[Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev]] who in the 1880s urged governor-generals of provinces to seek out the supposed kahal. This was around the time of the ''[[Narodnaya Volya]]''  assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] and the subsequent [[pogrom]]s. In France it was translated by Monsignor [[Ernest Jouin]] in 1925, who supported the Protocols. In 1928, [[Siegfried Passarge]], a geographer active in the [[Third Reich]], translated it into German.

Aside from Brafman, there were other early writings which posited a similar concept to the Protocols. This includes ''The Conquest of the World by the Jews'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forms of Hatred: The Troubled Imagination in Modern Philosophy and Literature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M7Tdl6vgbmUC|publisher = Rodopi|date = 2003-01-01|isbn = 9042010665|first = Leonidas|last = Donskis}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Basel]] and authored by Osman Bey (born Frederick Millingen). Millingen was a British subject of [[Dutch Jews|Dutch-Jewish]] extraction (the grandson of [[James Millingen]]), but served as an officer in the [[Ottoman Army]] where he was born. He converted to [[Islam]], but later became a Russian Orthodox Christian. Bey's work was followed up by [[Hippolytus Lutostansky]]'s ''The Talmud and the Jews'' (1879) which claimed  that Jews wanted to divide Russia among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/new-york/new-york-times/1911/08-27/page-42|title = Ritual murder encouraged...|last = |first = |date = August 27, 1911|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |publication-date = August 27, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, in a 1904 edition of ''The Talmud and the Jews,'' Hippolytus directly quoted verbatim the first, little-known 1903 edition of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Existent Manuscript - University of Nebraska Press|url = http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Non-Existent-Manuscript,671722.aspx|website = www.nebraskapress.unl.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources employed===
Source material for the forgery consisted jointly of ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu|Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue in Hell Between [[Niccolò|Machiavelli]] and [[Montesquieu]]''), an 1864 [[political satire]] by [[Maurice Joly]];{{Sfn | Jacobs | Weitzman | 2003 | p = 15}} and a chapter from ''Biarritz'', an 1868 novel by the antisemitic German novelist [[Hermann Goedsche]], which had been translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1872.&lt;ref name = "translated97"&gt;{{Citation | last = Segel | first = Binjamin W | title = A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor-link = Richard S.

A major source for the ''Protocols'' was ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' by [[Theodor Herzl]], which was referred to as ''Zionist Protocols'' in its initial French and Russian editions. Paradoxically, early Russian editions of the ''Protocols'' assert that they did not come from a Zionist organization.{{Sfn|De Michelis|2004|p=47}} The text, which nowhere advocates for [[Zionism]], resembles a parody of Herzl's ideas.{{Sfn |De Michelis|2004|p=114]}}

===Literary forgery===
''The Protocols'' is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of [[literary forgery]], with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hoax.html | title = A Hoax of Hate | publisher = Jewish Virtual Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forgery is an early example of "[[conspiracy theory]]" literature.&lt;ref name=Boym&gt;{{Citation | first = Svetlana | last = Boym | title = Conspiracy theories and literary ethics: Umberto Eco, Danilo Kis and 'The Protocols of Zion' | journal = Comparative Literature | issue = Spring | year = 1999 | doi = 10.2307/1771244 | volume = 51 | pages = 97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written mainly in the first person plural,{{Efn | The text contains 44 instances of the word "I" (9.6%), and 412 instances of the word "we" (90.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.shoaheducation.com/protocols.html | title = The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | others = Marsden, VE transl | publisher = Shoah education }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the text includes [[generalization]]s, [[truism]]s, and [[platitude]]s on how to take over the world: take control of the media and the financial institutions, change the traditional social order, etc. It does not contain specifics.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}}

===Maurice Joly===
Elements of the ''Protocols'' were plagiarized from Joly's fictional ''Dialogue in Hell'', a thinly veiled attack on the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]], who, represented by the [[Gentile|non-Jewish]] character [[Machiavelli]],&lt;ref name ="Google Books Search"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Ye’r | first1 = Bat | first2 = Miriam | last2 = Kochan | author3-link = David Littman (historian)| first3 = David | last3 = Littman | title = Islam and Dhimmitude | publisher = [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]] | place = US | date = December 1, 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8386-3942-9 | page = 142 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=n4kTdYgwQPkC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=The+Protocols+of+the+Learned+Elders+of+Zion++forgery+%22Maurice+Joly%22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plots to rule the world. Joly, a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and [[Legitimism|legitimist]], was imprisoned in France for 15 months as a direct result of his book's publication. Scholars have noted the irony that ''Dialogue in Hell'' was itself a plagiarism, at least in part, of a novel by [[Eugène Sue]], ''Les Mystères du Peuple'' (1849–56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eco | first = Umberto | title = Six Walks in the Fictional Woods| year = 1994 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-674-81050-3| authorlink = Umberto Eco| page= 135| chapter= Fictional Protocols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifiable phrases from Joly constitute 4% of the first half of the first edition, and 12% of the second half; later editions, including most translations, have longer quotes from Joly.{{Sfn | De Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004 | p = [https://books.google.com/?id=9uG1jsrOenwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=first+zionist+congress+nilus#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20zionist%20congress%20nilus&amp;f=false 8]}}

''The Protocols'' 1–19 closely follow the order of Maurice Joly's ''Dialogues'' 1–17. For example:

|{{Quote|A loan is an issue of Government paper which entails an obligation to pay interest amounting to a percentage of the total sum of the borrowed money.

|{{Quote|Our Government will resemble the Hindu god Vishnu. Each of our hundred hands will hold one spring of the social machinery of State.| ''Protocols'', p.&amp;nbsp;65 }}
|}

[[Philip Graves]] brought this plagiarism to light in a series of articles in ''The Times'' in 1921, the first published evidence that the ''Protocols'' was not an authentic document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Bein | first = Alex|year= 1990| page=339|title=The Jewish question: biography of a world problem|isbn = 978-0-8386-3252-9 |publisher= Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}}

===Hermann Goedsche===
{{main|Hermann Goedsche}}
"Goedsche was a postal clerk and a spy for the [[Prussian Secret Police]]. He had been forced to leave the postal work due to his part in forging evidence in the prosecution against the Democratic leader [[Benedict Waldeck]] in 1849."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = IGC | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf | last = Keren | first = David | title = Commentary on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion | date = February 10, 1993 | page = 4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140729103854/http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf | archivedate = July 29, 2014 | df =  }}. Republished as {{Citation | contribution = Introduction | title = The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | others = Marsden, Victor E transl}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, and wrote literary fiction under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe.&lt;ref name= Cohn1966&gt;{{Citation | first = Norman | last = Cohn | title = Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of the Jewish World-Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elder of Zion | place = New York | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | year = 1966 | pages = 32–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1868 novel ''Biarritz'' (''To Sedan'') contains a chapter called "[[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague|The Jewish Cemetery in Prague]] and the Council of Representatives of the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]]." In it, Goedsche (who was unaware that only two of the original twelve Biblical "tribes" remained) depicts a clandestine nocturnal meeting of members of a mysterious [[rabbi]]nical [[cabal]] that is planning a diabolical "Jewish conspiracy." At midnight, the Devil appears to contribute his opinions and insight. The chapter closely resembles a scene in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''Giuseppe Balsamo'' (1848), in which Joseph Balsamo a.k.a. [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] and company plot the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Serendipities: Language and Lunacy|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11134-7|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCyBIa34aAMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 a Russian translation of "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague" appeared in [[Saint Petersburg]] as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. François Bournand, in his ''Les Juifs et nos Contemporains'' (1896), reproduced the soliloquy at the end of the chapter, in which the character Levit expresses as factual the wish that Jews be "kings of the world in 100 years" —crediting a "Chief Rabbi John Readcliff." Perpetuation of the myth of the authenticity of Goedsche's story, in particular the "Rabbi's speech", facilitated later accounts of the equally mythical authenticity of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Cohn1966 /&gt; Like the ''Protocols'', many asserted that the fictional "rabbi's speech" had a ring of authenticity, regardless of its origin: "This speech was published in our time, eighteen years ago," read an 1898 report in [[La Croix]], "and all the events occurring before our eyes were anticipated in it with truly frightening accuracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Maurice | last = Olender | authorlink = Maurice Olender | title = Race and Erudition | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2009 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional events in Joly's ''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu'', which appeared four years before ''Biarritz'', may well have been the inspiration for Goedsche's fictional midnight meeting, and details of the outcome of the supposed plot. Goedsche's chapter may have been an outright plagiarism of Joly, Dumas père, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History | first1 = Paul R | last1 = Mendes-Flohr | first2 = Jehuda | last2 = Reinharz | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-19-507453-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Bu5GnLZCw0C&amp;pg=PA363 |at=p.363 see footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = lower-alpha name=Graves1921&gt;This complex relationship was originally exposed by {{Harvnb | Graves | 1921}}.

==History==

===Publication history===
{{see also|List of editions of Protocols of the Elders of Zion}}
''The Protocols'' appeared in print in the Russian Empire as early as 1903, published as a series of articles in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'', a [[Black Hundreds]] newspaper owned by [[Pavel Krushevan]]. It appeared again in 1905 as the final chapter (Chapter XII) of the second edition of ''Velikoe v malom i antikhrist'' ("The Great in the Small &amp; [[Antichrist]]"), a book by [[Sergei Nilus]]. In 1906, it appeared in pamphlet form edited by [[Georgy Butmi de Katzman]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}

These first three (and subsequently more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the [[Russian Empire]] during the 1903–6 period as a tool for [[scapegoating]] Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[Revolution of 1905]]. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since ''The Protocols'' are presented as merely a [[document]], the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] and [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as [[Apocrypha]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}}

As fiction in the genre of literature, the tract was further analyzed by [[Umberto Eco]] in his novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' in 1988 (English translation in 1989), in 1994 in chapter 6, "Fictional Protocols", of his ''[[Six Walks in the Fictional Woods]]'' and in his 2010 novel ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''.

As the [[Russian Revolution]] unfolded, causing [[White movement]]-affiliated Russians to flee to the West, this text was carried along and assumed a new purpose. Until then, ''The Protocols'' had remained obscure;{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}} it now became an instrument for blaming Jews for the Russian Revolution. It became a tool, a political weapon, used against the [[Bolsheviks]] who were depicted as overwhelmingly Jewish, allegedly executing the "plan" embodied in ''The Protocols''. The purpose was to discredit the [[October Revolution]], prevent the West from recognizing the [[Soviet Union]], and bring about the downfall of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s regime.{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}}

====Conspiracy references====
According to [[Daniel Pipes]],
{{Quote |The great importance of ''The Protocols'' lies in its permitting antisemites to reach beyond their traditional circles and find a large international audience, a process that continues to this day. The forgery poisoned public life wherever it appeared; it was "self-generating; a blueprint that migrated from one conspiracy to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Umberto | last = Eco | author-link = Umberto Eco | title = [[Foucault's Pendulum]] | place = London | publisher = Picador | year = 1990 | page = 490}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's vagueness—almost no names, dates, or issues are specified—has been one key to this wide-ranging success. The purportedly Jewish authorship also helps to make the book more convincing. Its embrace of contradiction—that to advance, Jews use all tools available, including capitalism and communism, [[philo-Semitism]] and antisemitism, democracy and tyranny—made it possible for ''The Protocols'' to reach out to all: rich and poor, [[right-wing|Right]] and [[left-wing|Left]], Christian and [[Muslim]], American and Japanese.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}}}}

Pipes notes that the ''Protocols'' emphasizes recurring themes of conspiratorial antisemitism: "Jews always scheme", "Jews are everywhere", "Jews are behind every institution", "Jews obey a central authority, the shadowy 'Elders'", and "Jews are close to success."{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | pp = 86–87}}

''The Protocols'' is widely considered influential in the development of other conspiracy theories{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}, and reappears repeatedly in contemporary conspiracy literature, such as [[Jim Marrs]]' ''Rule by Secrecy,'' which identifies the work as a Czarist forgery. Some recent editions proclaim that the "Jews" depicted in the Protocols are a cover identity for other conspirators such as the [[Illuminati]],&lt;ref name="Freund2000" /&gt; [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], the [[Priory of Sion]], or even, in the opinion of [[David Icke]], "[[Reptilian humanoid|extra-dimensional entities]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The chapter "In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague" from Goedsche's ''Biarritz'', with its strong antisemitic theme containing the alleged rabbinical plot against the European civilization, was translated into Russian as a separate pamphlet in 1872.&lt;ref name="translated97"/&gt;  However, in 1921, Princess [[Catherine Radziwill]] gave a private lecture in New York in which she claimed that the Protocols were a forgery compiled in 1904–5 by Russian journalists [[Matvei Golovinski]] and Manasevich-Manuilov at the direction of [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]], Chief of the Russian secret service in Paris.&lt;ref name = NYT_RadziwillQuizzed&gt;{{Cite news |title = Princess Radziwill Quizzed at Lecture; Stranger Questions Her Title After She Had Told of Forgery of "Jewish Protocols."

In 1944, German writer [[Konrad Heiden]] identified Golovinski as an author of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Freund2000&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/27585.html | title = Forging Protocols | first = Charles Paul | last = Freund | newspaper = Reason Magazine |date=February 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Radziwill's account was supported by Russian historian Mikhail Lepekhine, who published his findings in November 1999 in the French newsweekly ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = French | url = http://www.phdn.org/antisem/protocoles/origines.html | first = Éric | last = Conan | title = Les secrets d'une manipulation antisémite |trans-title=The secrets of an antisemite manipulation | newspaper = L’Express | date = November 16, 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lepekhine considers the ''Protocols'' a part of a scheme to persuade Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] that the modernization of Russia was really a Jewish plot to control the world.&lt;ref name=Skuratovsky&gt;{{Citation | first = Vadim | last = Skuratovsky | title = The Question of the Authorship of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" | publisher = Judaica Institute | place = Kiev | year = 2001 | isbn = 966-7273-12-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Bronner|Stephen Eric Bronner]] writes that groups opposed to progress, parliamentarianism, urbanization, and capitalism, and an active Jewish role in these modern institutions, were particularly drawn to the antisemitism of the document.{{Sfn | Bronner | 2003 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkl-ZxE6h0oC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=A+rumor+about+the+Jews+modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bd3tTKjkMcKt8Aa6_u3SDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20rumor%20about%20the%20Jews%20modernity&amp;f=false ix], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkl-ZxE6h0oC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=A+rumor+about+the+Jews+attack+on+liberalism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WtvtTI3MOoK88gauzMGiDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 56]}} [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scholar [[Vadim Skuratovsky]] offers extensive literary, historical and [[linguistics|linguistic]] analysis of the original text of the ''Protocols'' and traces the influences of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s [[prose]] (in particular, ''[[The Grand Inquisitor]]'' and ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'') on Golovinski's writings, including the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Skuratovsky /&gt;

Golovinski's role in the writing of the Protocols is disputed by Michael Hagemeister, Richard Levy and Cesare De Michelis, who each write that the account which involves him is historically unverifiable and to a large extent provably wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = M.

In his book ''The Non-Existent Manuscript'', Italian scholar [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] studies early Russian publications of the ''Protocols''. The ''Protocols'' were first mentioned in the Russian press in April 1902, by the Saint Petersburg newspaper ''Novoye Vremya'' ({{lang|ru|Новое Время}} – ''The New Times''). The article was written by famous conservative publicist [[:ru:Меньшиков, Михаил Осипович|Mikhail Menshikov]] as a part of his regular series "Letters to Neighbors" ("Письма к ближним") and was titled "Plots against Humanity". The author described his meeting with a lady ([[Yuliana Glinka]], as it is known now) who, after telling him about her mystical revelations, implored him to get familiar with the documents later known as the ''Protocols''; but after reading some excerpts, Menshikov became quite skeptical about their origin and did not publish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = Russian | url = http://www.vehi.net/asion/kon/08.html#_ftnref14 | first1 = T | last1 = Karasova | first2 = D | last2 = Chernyakhovsky | title = Afterword}} in {{Citation | language = Russian | edition = translated | first = Norman | last = Cohn | title = Warrant for Genocide}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Krushevan and Nilus editions====
The ''Protocols'' were published at the earliest, in serialized form, from August 28 to September 7 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) 1903, in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'', a Saint Petersburg daily newspaper, under [[Pavel Krushevan]]. Krushevan had initiated the [[Kishinev pogrom]] four months earlier.&lt;ref name = Kadzhaya&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 |title= The Fraud of a Century, or a book born in hell |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051217032523/http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 | archivedate =December 17, 2005 | first = Valery | last = Kadzhaya | accessdate = September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Sergei Nilus published the full text of the ''Protocols'' in ''Chapter XII'', the final chapter (pp&amp;#8239;305–417), of the second edition (or third, according to some sources) of his book, ''[[Velikoe v malom i antikhrist]]'', which translates as "The Great within the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth". He claimed it was the work of the [[First Zionist Congress]], held in 1897 in [[Basel, Switzerland]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}} When it was pointed out that the First Zionist Congress had been open to the public and was attended by many non-Jews, Nilus changed his story, saying the Protocols were the work of the 1902–3 meetings of the Elders, but contradicting his own prior statement that he had received his copy in 1901:
{{quote |In 1901, I succeeded through an acquaintance of mine (the late Court Marshal Alexei Nikolayevich Sukotin of Chernigov) in getting a manuscript that exposed with unusual perfection and clarity the course and development of the secret Jewish Freemasonic conspiracy, which would bring this wicked world to its inevitable end.

====Stolypin's fraud investigation, 1905====
A subsequent secret investigation ordered by [[Pyotr Stolypin]], the newly appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers, came to the conclusion that the ''Protocols'' first appeared in Paris in antisemitic circles around 1897–1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fedorov.ru/stolypin.html | title = P. Stolypin's attempt to resolve the Jewish question | first = Boris | last = Fyodorov | language = Russian | place = [[Russia|RU]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Nicholas II]] learned of the results of this investigation, he requested, "The Protocols should be confiscated, a good cause cannot be defended by dirty means."&lt;ref name=Burtsev1938&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Jewniverse | language = Russian | url = http://www.jewniverse.ru/RED/Burtsev/BPSM-1-4.htm | place = Paris | title = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery | first = Vladimir | last = Burtsev | author-link = Vladimir Burtsev | year = 1938 | page = 106 | chapter = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the order, or because of the "good cause", numerous reprints proliferated.&lt;ref name=Kadzhaya /&gt;

===''The Protocols'' in the West===
[[File:1934 Protocols Patriotic Pub.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|A 1934 edition by the Patriotic Publishing Company of Chicago.]]
In the United States, ''The Protocols'' are to be understood in the context of the [[First Red Scare]] (1917–20). The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by [[Natalie de Bogory]] (personal assistant of [[Harris A. Houghton]], an officer of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]) in June 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, N. ''Henry Ford and the Jews. The mass production of hate''.

But all references to "Jews" were replaced with references to ''[[Bolsheviki]]'' as an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] by the journalist and subsequently highly respected [[Columbia University]] School of Journalism dean [[Carl W. Ackerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p61ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;dq=ackerman.+zion.+bolshevik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQs_6856AM&amp;sig=1A-Ll7ZMvv3419WlV06ZPKKXnVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhuCB_NLXAhWS3KQKHd4jAJcQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Replaced%20every%20reference%20to%20Jews%20with%20Bolshevists&amp;f=false|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|last=Toczek|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=1317525876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

In 1923, there appeared an anonymously edited pamphlet by the [[Britons Publishing Society]], a successor to [[The Britons]], an entity created and headed by [[Henry Hamilton Beamish]]. This imprint was allegedly a translation by [[Victor E. Marsden]], who died in October 1920.{{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

====English language imprints====
On October 27 and 28, 1919, the [[Philadelphia]] ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' published excerpts of an English language translation as the "Red Bible," deleting all references to the purported Jewish authorship and re-casting the document as a [[Bolshevik]] [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{Citation | authorlink= Philip Jenkins|last=Jenkins | first = Philip | title = Hoods and Shirts: The Extreme Right in Pennsylvania, 1925–1950 | publisher = [[UNC Press]] | year = 1997 | page = 114 | isbn = 0-8078-2316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the articles was the paper's [[correspondent]] at the time, [[Carl W.

In the leader (editorial) titled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", [[Wickham Steed]] wrote about ''The Protocols'':
{{Quote | What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery?

In 1934, an anonymous editor expanded the compilation with "Text and Commentary" (pp 136–41). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, an inauthentic expanded edition of the twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 book on the coming of the anti-Christ. It consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from Ford's antisemitic periodical ''The Dearborn Independent''. This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, as well as on the internet. The "Text and Commentary" concludes with [[quote mining|a comment]] on [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s October 6, 1920, remark at a banquet: "A beneficent protection which God has instituted in the life of the Jew is that He has dispersed him all over the world". Marsden, who was dead by then, is credited with the following assertion:
{{Quote | It proves that the Learned Elders exist. It proves that Dr. Weizmann knows all about them. It proves that the desire for a "National Home" in Palestine is only camouflage and an infinitesimal part of the Jew's real object. It proves that the Jews of the world have no intention of settling in Palestine or any separate country, and that their annual prayer that they may all meet "Next Year in Jerusalem" is merely a piece of their characteristic make-believe.

[[File:TheTimes exposes TheProtocols as a forgery.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|''The Times'' exposed the ''Protocols'' as a forgery on August 16–18, 1921]]
In 1920–1921, the history of the concepts found in the ''Protocols'' was traced back to the works of Goedsche and [[Jacques Crétineau-Joly]] by [[Lucien Wolf]] (an English Jewish journalist), and published in London in August 1921. But a dramatic exposé occurred in the series of articles in ''The Times'' by its [[Constantinople]] reporter, [[Philip Graves]], who discovered the plagiarism from the work of [[Maurice Joly]].{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}}

&lt;!-- Note: In 1921, the city of Istanbul was called Constantinople. don't change the city name without discussing. --&gt;
According to writer Peter Grose, [[Allen Dulles]], who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] political structures, discovered "the source" of the documentation and ultimately provided him to ''The Times''. Grose writes that ''The Times'' extended a loan to the source, a Russian émigré who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Grose | title = Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history at [[Sheffield University]], identified the émigré as Michael Raslovleff, a self-identified antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to "give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Leon Poliakov| last = Poliakov | first = Leon | year = 1997 | contribution = Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | title = [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] | edition = CD-ROM 1.0 | editor-first = Cecil | editor-last = Roth | editor-link = Cecil Roth | publisher = Keter | isbn = 965-07-0665-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first article of Graves' series, titled "A Literary Forgery", the editors of ''The Times'' wrote, "our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism. He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made."{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}} In the same year, an entire book{{Sfn | Bernstein | 1921}} documenting the hoax was published in the United States by [[Herman Bernstein]]. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the ''Protocols'' continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites. Dulles, a successful lawyer and career diplomat, attempted to persuade the [[US State Department]] to publicly denounce the forgery, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Breitman et al. (2005).

Working on behalf of the defense was German antisemitic propagandist [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].

Wie ein Berner Gericht 1935 gegen antisemitische Verschwörungsphantasien vorging|last= Hafner|first= Urs|date= December 23, 2005|publisher= [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|language= German|accessdate= 2008-10-11|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201033419/http://www.nzz.ch/2005/12/23/fe/articleDEYRW.html|archivedate= February 1, 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while three other defendants were acquitted. The court declared the ''Protocols'' to be forgeries, plagiarisms, and obscene literature. Judge Walter Meyer, a Christian who had not heard of the ''Protocols'' earlier, said in conclusion,
{{Quote | I hope the time will come when nobody will be able to understand how in 1935 nearly a dozen sane and responsible men were able for two weeks to mock the intellect of the Bern court discussing the authenticity of the so-called Protocols, the very Protocols that, harmful as they have been and will be, are nothing but laughable nonsense.&lt;ref name=Kadzhaya /&gt;}}

[[Vladimir Burtsev]], a Russian émigré, anti-Bolshevik and [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] who exposed numerous [[Okhrana]] [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] in the early 1900s, served as a witness at the Berne Trial. In 1938 in Paris he published a book, ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery'', based on his testimony.

On November 1, 1937, the defendants appealed the verdict to the ''Obergericht'' (Cantonal Supreme Court) of Berne. A panel of three judges acquitted them, holding that the ''Protocols'', while false, did not violate the statute at issue because they were "political publications" and not "immoral (obscene) publications (Schundliteratur)" in the strict sense of the law.&lt;ref name="NZZ"/&gt; The presiding judge's opinion stated, though, that the forgery of the ''Protocols'' was not questionable and expressed regret that the law did not provide adequate protection for Jews from this sort of literature. The court refused to impose the fees of defense of the acquitted defendants to the plaintiffs, and the acquitted Theodor Fischer had to pay 100 Fr. to the total state costs of the trial (Fr. 28'000) that were eventually paid by the Canton of Berne.{{Sfn | Ben-Itto | 2005 | loc = chapter 11}} This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court "confirmed authenticity of the Protocols" which is contrary to the facts. A view favorable to the pro-Nazi defendants is reported in an appendix to [[Leslie Fry]]'s ''Waters Flowing Eastward''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Denis.Fahey/Waters.Flowing.Eastward/Appendix.2_The.Berne.Trials.htm |title= Waters Flowing Eastward | chapter = Appendix II: The Berne Trials|last=Fry|first=Leslie|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly work on the trial is in a 139-page monograph by Urs Lüthi&lt;!--not [[Urs Lüthi]]--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lüthi | first = Urs | language = German | title = Der Mythos von der Weltverschwörung: die Hetze der Schweizer Frontisten gegen Juden und Freimaurer, am Beispiel des Berner Prozesses um die "Protokolle der Weisen von Zion" | place = Basel/Frankfurt am Main | publisher = Helbing &amp; Lichtenhahn | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-3-7190-1197-0 | oclc = 30002662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Basel Trial====
A similar trial in Switzerland took place at [[Basel]]. The Swiss [[National Front (Switzerland)|Frontists]] Alfred Zander and Eduard Rüegsegger distributed the ''Protocols'' (edited by the German Gottfried zur Beek) in Switzerland. Jules Dreyfus-Brodsky and Marcus Cohen sued them for insult to Jewish honor. At the same time, chief rabbi [[Mordecai Ehrenpreis|Marcus Ehrenpreis]] of Stockholm (who also witnessed at the Berne Trial) sued Alfred Zander who contended that Ehrenpreis himself had said that the ''Protocols'' were authentic (referring to the foreword of the edition of the ''Protocols'' by the German antisemite Theodor Fritsch). On June 5, 1936 these proceedings ended with a settlement.{{Efn | Zander had to withdraw his contention and the stock of the incriminated ''Protocols'' were destroyed by order of the court. Zander had to pay the fees of this Basel Trial.{{Sfn | Lüthi | 1992 | p = 45}}}}

===Germany===
According to historian [[Norman Cohn]],{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967 | p = 169}} the assassins of German Jewish politician [[Walter Rathenau]] (1867–1922) were convinced that Rathenau was a literal "Elder of Zion".

It seems likely Hitler first became aware of the ''Protocols'' after hearing about it from ethnic German [[white émigrés]], such as [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gellately, Robert (2012). ''Lenin, Stalin and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', {{ISBN|1448138787}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler refers to the ''Protocols'' in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'':

{{Quote | ... [The Protocols] are based on a forgery, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' moans [ ] every week ... [which is] the best proof that they are authentic ... the important thing is that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims.&lt;ref name = Hitler1924&gt;{{Citation | first = Adolf | last = Hitler | title = [[Mein Kampf]] | chapter = XI: Nation and Race | volume = I | pages = 307–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	
The Protocols also became a part of the Nazi propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews. In ''[[The Holocaust]]: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945'', [[Nora Levin]] states that "Hitler used the Protocols as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews":
{{Quote | Despite conclusive proof that the ''Protocols'' were a gross forgery, they had sensational popularity and large sales in the 1920s and 1930s. They were translated into every language of Europe and sold widely in Arab lands, the US, and England. But it was in Germany after World War I that they had their greatest success. There they were used to explain all of the disasters that had befallen the country: the defeat in the war, the hunger, the destructive inflation.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Nora Levin, ''The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945''. Quoting from [https://web.archive.org/web/20021001121141/http://ddickerson.igc.org/hitler-protokollen.html IGC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitler endorsed the Protocols in his speeches from August 1921 on, and it was studied in German classrooms after the Nazis came to power. "Distillations of the text appeared in German classrooms, indoctrinated the Hitler Youth, and invaded the USSR along with German soldiers."&lt;ref name = "Segel"/&gt; Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels proclaimed: "The Zionist Protocols are as up-to-date today as they were the day they were first published."{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}}

In contrast to Hitler, Nazi leader [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky]] admitted:

{{Quote |I am the only living witness but I must say the truth. Contrary to the opinion of the National Socialists, that the Jews were a highly organized group, the appalling fact was that they had no organization whatsoever. The mass of the Jewish people were taken complete by surprise. They did not know at all what to do; they had no directives or slogans as to how they should act. This is the greatest lie of anti-Semitism because it gives the lie to that old slogan that the Jews are conspiring to dominate the world and that they are so highly organized. In reality, they had no organization of their own at all, not even an information service. If they had had some sort of organization, these people could have been saved by the millions, but instead, they were taken completely by surprise. Never before has a people gone as unsuspectingly to its disaster. Nothing was prepared. Absolutely nothing.&lt;ref name="Levin1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nora Levin|title=The holocaust: the destruction of European Jewry, 1933-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvFmAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=T.

[[Richard S. Levy]] criticizes the claim that the Protocols had a large effect on Hitler's thinking, writing that it is based mostly on suspect testimony and lacks hard evidence.&lt;ref name=Levy-record&gt;{{cite book | author = Richard S.

Publication of the Protocols was stopped in Germany in 1939 for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name=HagemeisterCourt2&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Hagemeister | chapter = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in court: The Bern trials, 1933-1937 | editor = Esther Webman | title = The Global Impact of 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' | place = London, New York | publisher = Routledge | year = 2011| pages = 241–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; An edition that was ready for printing was blocked by censorship laws.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hagemeister, lecture at Cambridge University, 11 November 2014.

====German language publications====
Having fled Ukraine in 1918–19, [[Piotr Shabelsky-Bork]] brought the Protocols to Ludwig Muller Von Hausen who then published them in German.{{Sfn | Kellogg | 2005 | pp = 63–65}} Under the pseudonym Gottfried Zur Beek he produced the first and "by far the most important"{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 94}} German translation. It appeared in January 1920 as a part of a larger antisemitic tract&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Geheimnisse der Weisen von Zion | publisher = Auf Vorposten | year = 1919 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; dated 1919. After ''The Times'' discussed the book respectfully in May 1920 it became a bestseller. "The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern family]] helped defray the publication costs, and Kaiser [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Wilhelm II]] had portions of the book read out aloud to dinner guests".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}} Alfred Rosenberg's 1923 edition&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alfred | last = Rosenberg | author-link = Alfred Rosenberg | title = Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion und die jüdische Weltpolitik | place = Munich | publisher = Deutscher Volksverlag | year = 1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "gave a forgery a huge boost".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}}

===Italy===
Fascist politician [[Giovanni Preziosi]] published the first Italian edition of the ''Protocols'' in 1921.&lt;ref name=Pisanty2006&gt;{{Citation|last=Valentina Pisanty|title=La difesa della razza: Antologia 1938-1943|year=2006|publisher=Bompiani}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}} The book however had little impact until the mid-1930s. A new 1937 edition had a much higher impact, and three further editions in the following months sold 60,000 copies total.&lt;ref name="Pisanty2006"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}} The fifth edition had an introduction by [[Julius Evola]], which argued around the issue of forgery, stating: "The problem of the authenticity of this document is secondary and has to be replaced by the much more serious and essential problem of its truthfulness".&lt;ref name="Pisanty2006"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}}

===Modern era===
{{See also|Contemporary imprints of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|New World Order (conspiracy theory)#The Protocols of the Elders of Zion}}
The ''Protocols'' continue to be widely available around the world, particularly on the Internet, as well as in print in Japan, the Middle East, Asia, and South America.{{Sfn|Jacobs|Weitzmann|2003|pages=xi–xiv, 1–4}}

Governments or political leaders in most parts of the world have not referred to the ''Protocols'' since World War II. The exception to this is the Middle East, where a large number of [[Arab]] and Muslim regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic, including endorsements from Presidents [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] of [[Egypt]], the elder President Arif of [[Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Katz, S. and Gilman, S. ''Anti-Semitism in Times of Crisis''.

The [[Hamas Covenant|1988 charter]] of [[Hamas]], a Palestinian Islamist group, states that ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' embodies the plan of the Zionists.&lt;ref name="yale1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp |title=Hamas Covenant |year=1988 |publisher=Yale |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |quote=Today it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another.

===Television===
====Ash-Shatat====
{{Main|Ash-Shatat}}
''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' (Arabic: الشتات ''The Diaspora'') is a 29-part Syrian television series produced in 2003 by a private Syrian film company and was based in part on the ''Protocols.'' Syrian national television declined to air the program. ''Ash-Shatat'' was shown on Lebanon's Al-Manar, before being dropped.  The series was shown in Iran in 2004, and in Jordan during October 2005 on Al-Mamnou.

==Plot==
Frank Walker addresses an unseen audience about the future. Frank, a young inventor, attended the [[1964 New York World’s Fair]], to sell his prototype [[jetpack]]. It is rejected by judge David Nix on the basis that it doesn’t work. Frank is approached by a young girl, Athena, who hands him a [[lapel pin]] with a “T” embossed on it, telling him to follow her onto “[[It's a Small World]]”. Frank is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world.

Frank passes the narration to the [[optimism|optimistic]] teenager Casey Newton. In the present, Casey repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a [[NASA]] launch site in Florida. Her father, Eddie, is a NASA engineer, but faces redundancy. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a strange pin in her belongings. Upon personal contact, the pin shows her a vision of Tomorrowland, til its battery runs out. 

With help from her younger brother Nate, Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. The owners, Hugo and Ursula, attack her when she is unable to divulge where she got the pin from. Athena, who gave Casey the pin, bursts in and defeats the owners, actually [[Audio-Animatronic]]s, who self-destruct and destroy the shop. Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena revealing she is an animatronic, purposed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. Athena drops Casey outside an adult Frank’s house in [[Pittsfield, New York]].

The reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey’s request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside Frank’s house, Casey finds a probability counter marking the end of the world, Frank warning her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees, lowering the counter’s probability. Animatronic assassins appear to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature. He reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland.

Using a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. Frank explains that [[Gustave Eiffel]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Thomas Edison]] co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction. The trio use an antique rocket, the ''Spectacle'', hidden beneath the tower, to travel to Tomorrowland.

There, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. David Nix, now Tomorrowland’s governor, greets them. They travel to a [[tachyon]] machine, invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the world will end, causing the future to temporarily alter. While Frank attempts to convince Nix to listen, he refuses, arresting the intruders.

Casey realises the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. They confront Nix, who admits he tried to prevent the future by projecting such images to humanity as a warning. Instead, they embraced the [[apocalypse]] in fiction, refusing to act to make a better future for their world. Frank, Casey, and Athena attempt to use a bomb to destroy the machine, leading to a fight with Nix. The bomb is accidentally thrown through a portal to an uninhabited island on Earth, the explosion pinning Nix’s leg. Athena sees a vision of the future where Frank is shot by Nix, and she jumps in the way of his attack, mortally wounding her. Making peace with Frank, Athena activates her self-destruct sequence, destroying the machine, but kills Nix too.

In the present, Frank and Casey lead Tomorrowland, recruit Eddie and Nate, and create a new group of recruitment animatronics like Athena, who they are addressing at the beginning of the film. Given pins, the animatronic children set out to recruit new dreamers and thinkers for Tomorrowland.

==Production==
===Development===
In 2010, [[Damon Lindelof]] began discussions with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] about producing a modern science-fiction Disney film, with [[Tomorrowland]] as a basis.&lt;ref name=DInsiderJune&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomorrowland Writer Jeff Jensen Reveals the Movie's Secret History|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/05/29/tomorrowland-writer-jeff-jensen-reveals-the-movies-secret-history/|access-date=October 14, 2015|work=Disney Insider|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was greenlit by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' president of production, [[Sean Bailey]] in June 2011 with Lindelof signed on to write and produce a film with the working title of ''1952''.&lt;ref name=Deadline1 /&gt; Lindelof asked [[Jeff Jensen]]&amp;nbsp;— who had previously published material on Lindelof's ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' television series&amp;nbsp;— if he was interested in contributing to story elements. Jensen agreed and began to research the history of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]], particularly [[Walt Disney]]'s fascination with [[futurism]], scientific innovation and [[utopia]], as well as his involvement with the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and Disney's unrealized concept for [[EPCOT (concept)|EPCOT]].&lt;ref name=DInsiderJune /&gt; In May 2012, [[Brad Bird]] was hired as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Brad Bird To Helm Damon Lindelof's Secrecy-Shrouded Script '1952′ For Disney|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/brad-bird-to-helm-damon-lindelofs-secret-shrouded-script-1952-for-disney/|access-date=January 29, 2013|newspaper=Deadline|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird's story ideas and themes were influenced by the fading of cultural optimism that once defined society [[Space Age|in the 1950s, '60s, and early '70s]], stating that, "When Damon and I were first talking about the project, we were wondering why people's once-bright notions about the future gradually seemed to disappear".&lt;ref name=LATMay15&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeitchik|first1=Steven|title='Tomorrowland' director Brad Bird keeps looking for the bright side|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-bird-tomorrowland-20150517-story.html|access-date=October 14, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=When [Damon and I] were little, people had a very positive idea about the future, even though there were bad things going on in the world," Bird said. "Even the 1964 World's Fair happened during the [[Cold War]]. But there was a sense we could overcome them. And yet now we act like we're passengers on a bus with no say in where it's going, with no realization that we collectively write the future every day and can make it so much better than it otherwise would be.|source=—&amp;nbsp;Brad Bird on the influence of society's mindset to the film's themes&lt;ref name=LATMay15 /&gt;|width=30%|align=right}}

While keeping information about the plot secret, when asked in November 2012 whether the project would be ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars: Episode VII]]'', Bird denied the rumor, but confirmed that ''Tomorrowland'' would be a science-fiction film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Star Wars Episode 7: Brad Bird rules himself out|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/19/star-wars-episode-7-brad-bird|access-date=January 29, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Lindelof adding that the film would not center on [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=Brad Bird and Damon Lindelof's '1952′ Officially Titled 'Tomorrowland'|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/brad-bird-and-damon-lindelofs-1952-officially-titled-tomorrowland/#disqus_thread|publisher=/Film|access-date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, George Clooney entered negotiations to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|last2=Graser|first2=Marc|title=George Clooney in talks for Disney's alien pic '1952'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118062010/|access-date=January 29, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Hugh Laurie joined the film.&lt;ref name="ew-laurie-confirmed"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/14/casting-hemsworth-lauri/ | title=Casting Net: Chris Hemsworth to team up with Michael Mann; Plus Hugh Laurie confirmed for 'Tomorrowland', Marion Cotillard, and more | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=February 14, 2013 | access-date=February 14, 2013 | author=Bahr, Lindsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://collider.com/hugh-laurie-tomorrowland/|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Hugh Laurie in Talks for Villain Role Opposite George Clooney in Brad Bird's TOMORROWLAND|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|access-date=February 14, 2013|date=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Britt Robertson was cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/britt-robertson-lands-key-role-588569|title=Britt Robertson Lands Key Role in George Clooney's 'Tomorrowland'|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2013, nearly a week before the title change, Bird [[Twitter|tweeted]] a picture related to the project.

The website's critical consensus reads, "Ambitious and visually stunning, ''Tomorrowland'' is unfortunately weighted down by uneven storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tomorrowland_2015/|title=Tomorrowland (2015)|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tomorrowland|title=Tomorrowland Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="THROP" /&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "Brad Bird's ''Tomorrowland'', a noble failure about trying to succeed, is written and directed with such open-hearted optimism that you cheer it on even as it stumbles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travers |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/tomorrowland-20150520 |title='Tomorrowland' Movie Review |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Merry of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, saying "Maybe the ultimate goal of ''Tomorrowland'' remains obscure because once you know where the story is headed, you realize it's a familiar tale. The movie can conjure up futuristic images, but the story is nothing we haven't seen before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merry |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/always-cool-george-clooney-cant-lift-meandering-tomorrowland/2015/05/20/acc4592a-fd9a-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html |title=Always-cool George Clooney can't lift meandering 'Tomorrowland' |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2013-07-16 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira MacDonald of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "Though it's made with great energy and inventiveness, there's something ultimately muddy about ''Tomorrowland''; it's as if director Brad Bird got so caught up in the sets and effects and whooshing editing that the story somehow slipped away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macdonald |first=Moira |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/tomorrowland-exhilarating-for-kids-exhausting-for-adults/ |title='Tomorrowland': Exhilarating for kids, exhausting for adults |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2015-05-23 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Covert of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, saying "A well-oiled machine of visuals, and yet a wobbling rattletrap of storytelling, the sci-fi fantasy ''Tomorrowland'' is an unwieldy clunker driven into the ditch at full speed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/review-tomorrowland-goes-back-to-the-future-badly/304582201/ |title='Tomorrowland' goes back to the future badly |publisher=Star Tribune |date= |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ''ReelViews'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "For a while, it doesn't matter that the plot meanders. The story seems like a jigsaw puzzle inviting us to solve it. That's the fun part. However, when the resolution is presented, it underwhelms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Berardinelli |url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/tomorrowland |title=Tomorrowland &amp;#124; Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "It's important to note that ''Tomorrowland'' is not disappointing in the usual way. It's not another glib, phoned-in piece of franchise mediocrity, but rather a work of evident passion and conviction. What it isn't is in any way convincing or enchanting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.O.

[[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "Rapturous on a scene-by-scene basis and nearly incoherent when taken as a whole, the movie is idealistic and deranged, inspirational and very, very conflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2015/05/21/past-present-and-future-tomorrowland/a5hPKhmQWmntwMcbPIYOtK/story.html |title=It's past, present, and future in 'Tomorrowland' |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2015-05-19 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Whitty of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' (Newark) gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "Strip ''Tomorrowland'' down to its essentials, and you get an ending out of "I'd like to teach the world to sing" and a moral which boils down to: Just be positive, OK? So OK. I'm positive ''Tomorrowland'' was a disappointment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Whitty |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/05/tomorrowland_review_george_clooneys_sci-fi_folly.html |title='Tomorrowland' review: George Clooney's sci-fi folly |publisher=Newark Star-Ledger |date=2015-05-19 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine gave the film a positive review, stating that "''Tomorrowland'' is the most enchanting reactionary cultural diatribe ever made. It's so smart, so winsome, so utterly rejuvenating that you'll have to wait until your eyes have dried and your buzz has worn off before you can begin to argue with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Edelstein |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/movie-review-tomorrowland.html |title=Movie Review: Tomorrowland |publisher=Vulture |date= |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inkoo Kang of ''[[TheWrap]]'' also wrote a positive review, saying "''Tomorrowland'' is a globe-trotting, time-traveling caper whose giddy visual whimsies and exuberant cartoon violence are undermined by a coy mystery that stretches as long as the line for "[[Space Mountain]]" on a hot summer day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Inkoo Kang |url=http://www.thewrap.com/tomorrowland-review-george-clooney-britt-robertson-hugh-laurie/ |title='Tomorrowland' Review: George Clooney's Dystopian Drama, Like Disneyland, Is Exhausting Fun |publisher=Thewrap.com |date=2015-05-17 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "A spectacular ride for most of it, and while you're a little let down at the end, you kind of want to jump back on and do it all over again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/05/21/tomorrowland-movie-review/27578055/ |title='Tomorrowland' isn't short on wonders |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2015-05-19 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Barnard of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "Brad Bird presents a gorgeously wrought, hopeful future vision in ''Tomorrowland'', infusing the family film with enough entertaining action and retro-themed whiz bang to forgive an awkward opening and third-act weakness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2015/05/21/tomorrowlands-bright-future-includes-george-clooney-review.html |title=Tomorrowland's bright future includes George Clooney: review |publisher=Toronto Star |date=2015-03-16 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Neumaier of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "''Tomorrowland'' wears its big movie heart on its sleeve, which is to its advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/tomorrowland-review-future-wait-article-1.2228431 |title='Tomorrowland' Review: The future can wait |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2015-05-19 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a B-, saying "Bird stages the PG mayhem with his usual grasp of dimension and space, his gift for action that's timed like physical comedy. He keeps the whole thing moving, even when it begins to feel bogged down by preachiness and sci-fi exposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.A.

Club |date=2015-05-19 |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Skutle of ''Sonic Cinema'' gave the film a B–, saying "What's so surprising about the film isn't how simple the story is, but how lacking of energy the whole thing is. Gone is the excitement and passion that drove ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', the high-wire suspense of ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol|Ghost Protocol]]'' and the nostalgic feeling of ''[[The Iron Giant]]''. Bird feels less like the author of this film and more like a hired hand to give Disney a big-budget tentpole based on studio notes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Sonic Cinema|author=Skutle, Brian|title=Tomorrowland|date=2015|url=http://www.sonic-cinema.com/film_reviews_individual/1663/tomorrowland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest Wickman, of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'', said the film's "politics might be a little incoherent, or naïve. It is a kids' movie, after all."&lt;ref name="SLT-20150528"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wickman |first=Forrest |title=No, Brad Bird Isn't a Disciple of Ayn Rand - The key philosophical influence on the director of Tomorrowland and The Incredibles isn't the Atlas Shrugged author.

And if his $190 million dream [[Box office bomb|flops]], he'll be asking the same question as his movie: When did it become uncool to care?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson |first=Amy |url=http://www.laweekly.com/film/dont-hate-tomorrowland-for-asking-us-all-to-be-better-5596440 |title=Don't Hate Tomorrowland for Asking Us All to Be Better |work=L.A. Weekly |date= |access-date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Bird commented on some of the film's criticisms:

{{quote|People will argue about whether we told the proper story or not. People ask, 'Why did you spend so much time in a car when you could have been in Tomorrowland?' But the movie was always intended to be a road movie and its title seemed to suggest, to some people, that the whole movie was going to take place in Tomorrowland. We had a lot of ideas for Tomorrowland but just running around Tomorrowland is not a movie. There has to be a conflict. It has to be somewhat interesting. We set out to make a fable or a fairy tale about what happened to the positive view of the future and how can we get it back and pursue that idea. For better or worse, we did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the Future: Brad Bird on Tomorrowland's Deleted Scenes, Incredibles 2's Progress and Animated Prologues|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/10/13/back-to-the-future-brad-bird-on-tomorrowlands-deleted-scenes-incredibles-2s-progress-and-animated-prologues/|publisher=Disney Insider|access-date=October 13, 2015|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Wikispecies|Diabrotica virgifera|Western corn rootworm}}

The '''Western corn rootworm''', ''Diabrotica virgifera virgifera'', is one of the most devastating [[corn rootworm]] species in [[North America]], especially in the midwestern corn-growing areas such as [[Iowa]]. A related species, the Northern corn rootworm, ''D. barberi'' co-inhabits in much of the range, and is fairly similar in biology.

Two other [[subspecies]] of ''D. virgifera'' are described, including the Mexican corn rootworm (''Diabrotica virgifera zeae''), a significant pest in its own right, attacking corn in that country.

Corn rootworm larvae can destroy significant percentages of corn if left untreated. In the United States, current estimates show that {{convert|30000000|acres}} of corn (out of 80 million{{clarify|reason=ambiguous units|date=August 2014}} grown) are infested with corn rootworm. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] estimates that corn rootworms cause $1 billion in lost revenue each year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metcalf|first=R. L.|title=In Methods for the Study of Pest Diabrotica,|year=1986|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=vii – xv|editor=J. L. Krysan|editor2=T. A. Miller|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; including $800 million in yield loss and $200 million in cost of treatment for corn growers.&lt;ref&gt;The Dow Chemical Company&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle ==

There are many similarities in the life cycles of the northern and western corn rootworm. Both overwinter in the egg stage in the soil. Eggs, which are deposited in the soil during the summer, are American football-shaped, white, and less than {{convert|0.004|in|mm}} long. Larvae hatch in late May or early June and begin to feed on corn roots. Newly hatched larvae are small, less than {{convert|.125|in}} long, white worms. Corn rootworms go through three larval instars, pupate in the soil and emerge as adults in July and August. One generation emerges each year. Larvae have brown heads and a brown marking on the top of the last abdominal segment, giving them a double-headed appearance. Larvae have three pairs of legs, but these are not usually visible without magnification. After feeding for several weeks, the larvae dig a cell in the soil and molt into the pupal stage. The pupal stage is white and has the basic shape of the adult. Adult rootworms are about {{convert|.25|in}} long. Western corn rootworms are yellowish with a black stripe on each wing cover. Northern corn rootworm beetles are solid in color and vary from light tan to pale green.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite web |first1=R. |last1=Wright |first2=L. |last2=Meinke |first3=K. |last3=Jarvi |title=Corn Rootworm Management |publisher=[[University of Nebraska]] |date=July 1999 |url=http://ianrpubs.unl.edu/insects/ec1563.htm |accessdate=2007-02-03 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timing of egg hatch varies from year to year due to temperature differences and location. Males begin to emerge before females. Emergence often continues for a month or more. In years with hot, dry summers, numbers of western corn rootworm beetles may decline rapidly after mid-August, although in summers with less extreme conditions they may be found up until the first frost.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

Females mate soon after emergence. Western corn rootworm females need to feed for about two weeks before they can lay eggs. Temperature and food quality influence the pre-oviposition period. Females typically lay eggs in the top {{convert|8|in|mm}} of soil, although they may be laid more than {{convert|12|in|mm}} deep, particularly if the soil surface is dry. Western corn rootworm females are more likely to lay some of their eggs below the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} depth than northern corn rootworm females.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

== Feeding habits ==

Rootworm larvae can complete development only on corn and a few other species of grasses. Rootworm larvae reared on other grasses (specifically, yellow foxtail) emerged as adults later and had smaller head capsule size as adults compared to larvae reared on corn.&lt;ref name="Ellsbury"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1603/0046-225X-34.3.627| title = Interactions Among Western Corn Rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Yellow Foxtail, and Corn| journal = Environmental Entomology| volume = 34| issue = 3| pages = 627–634| year = 2005| last1 = Ellsbury | first1 = M. M.| last2 = Banken | first2 = K. R.| last3 = Clay | first3 = S. A.| last4 = Forcella | first4 = F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults feed primarily on corn silk, pollen and kernels on exposed ear tips, although they will feed on leaves and pollen of other plants. Adults begin emerging before corn reproductive tissues are present, adults may feed on leaf tissue, scraping away the green surface tissue and leaving a window-pane appearance. However, adults quickly shift to preferred green silks and pollen as they become available. Northern corn rootworm adults feed on reproductive tissues of the corn plant, but rarely feed on corn leaves. "Northern" adults are more likely than "western" adults to abandon corn and seek pollen or flowers of other plants as corn matures.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

== Feeding damage ==

Most of the damage to corn is caused by larval feeding. Hatchlings locate roots and begin feeding on the fine root hairs, burrowing into root tips. As larvae grow, they feed on and tunnel into primary roots. When rootworms are abundant, larval feeding and deterioration of injured roots by root rot pathogens can result in roots being pruned to the stalk base. Severe root injury interferes with the roots' ability to transport water and nutrients, reduces growth and results in reduced grain production. Severe root injury may result in lodging of corn plants, making harvest more difficult. Silk feeding by adults can result in pruning at the ear tip, commonly called [[silk clipping]]. In field corn, beetle populations are occasionally high enough to cause severe silk clipping during pollen shed, which may interfere with pollination.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

== History of invasions ==

The Western corn rootworm rapidly expanded its range in North America during the second part of the 20th century. It is now present from the southwestern region of the US [[Corn Belt]] to the east coast. It was introduced at the end of the 20th century into [[Europe]], where it was first observed near [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Gray_miller"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.54.110807.090434| pmid = 19067634| title = Adaptation and Invasiveness of Western Corn Rootworm: Intensifying Research on a Worsening Pest| journal = Annual Review of Entomology| volume = 54| pages = 303–21| year = 2009| last1 = Gray | first1 = M.

The first was discovered near [[Venice]], Italy, in 1998, in northwestern Italy ([[Piedmont]]) and [[Switzerland]] ([[canton Ticino]]) in 2000, northeastern [[Italy]] in 2002 (near [[Pordenone]]) and 2003 (near [[Udine]]), northern [[Italy]] ([[Trentino]]), Eastern France ([[Alsace]]), Switzerland, [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]] in 2003 and the [[Paris]]ian region, [[France]] in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Outbreaks detected in north [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and the Parisian region did not persist.&lt;ref name="Eppo_WCR"/&gt;
The distribution of the European corn rootworm resulted from several introductions from [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1115871| pmid = 16284172| title = Multiple Transatlantic Introductions of the Western Corn Rootworm| journal = Science| url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1255&amp;context=entomologyfacpub| volume = 310| issue = 5750| pages = 992| year = 2005| last1 = Miller | first1 = N.| last2 = Estoup| first2 = A| last3 = Toepfer| first3 = S| last4 = Bourguet| first4 = D| last5 = Lapchin| first5 = L| last6 = Derridj| first6 = S| last7 = Kim| first7 = K.

The European outbreaks observed in [[Alsace]] in 2003 and [[Ile-de-France]] in 2005 came from two additional introductions from [[North America]], bringing to five the number of transatlantic introductions.&lt;ref name="Ciosi_2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03866.x| pmid = 18662220| title = Invasion of Europe by the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera: Multiple transatlantic introductions with various reductions of genetic diversity| journal = Molecular Ecology| volume = 17| issue = 16| pages = 3614–27| year = 2008| last1 = Ciosi | first1 = M.| last2 = Miller | first2 = N.

Small remote outbreaks in southern Germany and north-eastern Italy most likely originated from long-distance dispersal events from Central and southeastern Europe. The large European outbreak is thus likely expanding by stratified dispersal, involving both continuous diffusion and discontinuous long-distance dispersal. This latter mode of dispersal may accelerate expansion in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ciosi_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00133.x| title = Stratified dispersal and increasing genetic variation during the invasion of Central Europe by the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera| journal = Evolutionary Applications| volume = 4| pages = 54–70| year = 2011| last1 = Ciosi | first1 = M.| last2 = Miller | first2 = N. J.| last3 = Toepfer | first3 = S.| last4 = Estoup | first4 = A.| last5 = Guillemaud | first5 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==

Multiple management practices aim to control corn rootworms. These practices include corn variety selection, early planting, [[insecticides]], [[crop rotation]] and [[transgenic]] corn varieties.

=== Variety ===

No commercial, non-transgenic resistant corn varieties are available. Several [[hybrid corn]] traits reduce damage by increasing stalk strength and root mass size. These characteristics allow a plant to better tolerate rootworm feeding, with reduced likelihood of lodging.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

=== Early planting ===

Early planted fields that have completed pollen shed are less attractive and therefore have less egg laying activity. Early fields have relatively larger root systems when rootworm feeding starts. This makes them somewhat more tolerant. Practices that promote strong root systems and a generally vigorous crop make corn more tolerant to rootworm feeding and damage.&lt;ref name=peairs&gt;Peairs, F. B. and S. D. Pilcher. [http://www.ext.colostate.edu/PUBS/insect/05570.html Western Corn Rootworm] Colorado State University. March 24, 2006. Viewed February 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insecticides ===

Soil-applied [[insecticide]]s effectively control corn rootworms. Insecticide may be warranted in areas that have a history of moderate to high damage. The number of adults present during the previous growing season is the best guide for selecting fields to be treated.&lt;ref name=peairs/&gt; However, in some areas of high insecticide use in central [[Nebraska]], populations of corn rootworm beetles have become resistant to certain insecticides. [[Aldrin]] resistance was probably introduced independently, at least twice, from North America into Europe. [[Organophosphate]]s, such as [[methyl-parathion]], may provide effective control of both larval and adult ''populations '' in Central and southeastern Europe and in northwest Italy.&lt;ref name="Ciosi_2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01363.x| title = European populations of ''Diabrotica'' virgifera virgiferaare resistant to aldrin, but not to methyl-parathion| journal = Journal of Applied Entomology| volume = 133| issue = 4| pages = 307–314| year = 2009| last1 = Ciosi| first1 = M.| last2 = Toepfer| first2 = S.| last3 = Li| first3 = H.| last4 = Haye| first4 = T.| last5 = Kuhlmann| first5 = U.| last6 = Wang| first6 = H.| last7 = Siegfried| first7 = B.| last8 = Guillemaud| first8 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crop rotation ===

[[Crop rotation]] is a consistent and economical means of controlling rootworms the season following an outbreak in corn-growing areas where rootworm beetles primarily lay eggs in corn. As a way to reduce rootworm densities, it is more effective than insecticides.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; Corn rootworm larvae must feed on corn roots to develop and mature properly. If they hatch in a field without corn, they starve because they cannot move more than 10 to {{convert|20|in|mm}} in search of food.&lt;ref name=peairs/&gt; However, two rootworm biotypes survive rotation. The "soybean" variant was first discovered in central Illinois in the late 1980s and spread throughout Illinois, Indiana, southern Wisconsin and eastern Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, M. E. and J. J. Tollefson. [http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/icm/2006/3-13/variant.html The variant western corn rootworm in Iowa. Iowa State University]. March 13, 2006. Viewed February 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of laying eggs into a corn field, the females of the soybean variant mate and then fly into a soybean field to lay their eggs, allowing the larvae to hatch in a field likely to rotate back to corn the following year. In the 1980s northern corn rootworm began to be a problem by beating the corn rotation practice with extended [[diapause]] eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Willson H. R. and J. B. Eisley. [http://ohioline.osu.edu/ent-fact/0017.html Monitoring Western Corn Rootworm Activity in Soybeans to Predict Rootworm Injury in First-Year Corn]. August 2001. Viewed February 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs remained in the soil for two years or more before hatching, thereby avoiding the soybean year. This adaptation has been observed in areas of northern Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota.

Companion or second crop planting can dramatically increase rootworm populations. Corn with pumpkins or corn following pumpkins are examples of planting patterns that exacerbate rootworm feeding pressure.

=== Natural enemies ===
Among natural enemies - [[Argiope bruennichi]], Theridion impressum, [[Coccinella]] sp., Pseudophomus rufipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19226790 | volume=73 | title=Natural enemies in control of invasive species Diabrotica virgifera Virgifera from maize crops | year=2008 | journal=Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci | pages=501–8 | last1 = Grozea | first1 = I | last2 = Carabet | first2 = A | last3 = Chirita | first3 = R | last4 = Badea | first4 = AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgenics ===

Planting rootworm-resistant transgenic corn, is another strategy for minimizing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Devos|first=Yann|author2=Lisa N. Meihls |author3=Jószef Kiss |author4=Bruce E. Hibbard |title=Resistance evolution to the first generation of genetically modified Diabrotica-active Bt-maize events by western corn rootworm: management and monitoring considerations|journal=Transgenic research|year=2013|volume=22|issue=2|pages=269–299|pmid=23011587|doi=10.1007/s11248-012-9657-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT corn]] is effective at reducing root damage and is safer and often cheaper than insecticide. The transgenic traits, isolated from the common soil [[bacterium]] ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' strain (often referred to as Bt), produce the insect control protein.

Bt was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese biologist S. Ishiwatari as the source of disease that was killing large populations of [[silkworm]]s. Bt was first used as an insecticide in 1920 and spray formulations containing either Bt bacteria or Bt proteins came into use in the 1970s for [[crop protection]], including [[organic farming]] operations. Bt insecticides saw expanded use and development in the 1980s as an alternative to synthetic insecticides. Beginning in the 1980s, the genes responsible for making ''Bt'' proteins were isolated and transferred into corn plants. Bt was commercially approved in transgenic corn seed in the mid-1990s. Compared to spray formulations, transgenic plants with the Bt protein provide much more effective insect protection throughout the season. Other Bt proteins have been used to genetically modify potatoes, cotton and other types of commercial corn. The two most common brands of transgenic Bt corn are [[Genuity (Monsanto brand)|Genuity]] and [[Herculex]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Genuity Smartstax]] combines [[Monsanto]]'s [[VT Triple Pro]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] Ready 2, and [[Acceleron Seed Treatment System]] technologies, as well as [[Dow Chemical]]'s Herculex Xtra and [[Liberty Link]] technologies. Acceleron, Herculex Xtra, and VT Triple Pro include traits for protection from insect damage.

Bt must be ingested to kill the insect. A susceptible larva eats the protein, which then binds to receptors in the larval gut. Binding initiates a cascade of effects that ultimately leads to death. Bt proteins are highly selective on certain categories and species of insects, eliminating insecticide use and its harmful effects to non-target organisms.&lt;ref&gt;The Dow Chemical Company.

Recently, however, strains of rootworms have been discovered in several Midwest US states that exhibit Bt resistance.&lt;ref name="DOI10.1371/journal.pone.0022629"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022629| pmid = 21829470| title = Field-Evolved Resistance to Bt Maize by Western Corn Rootworm| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 6| issue = 7| pages = e22629| year = 2011| last1 = Gassmann | first1 = A.

In 2009, four strains in Iowa were found to have field-evolved resistance to Bt corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gassman|first=Aaron J|title=Field-evolved resistance to Bt maize by western corn rootworm: Predictions from the laboratory and effects in the field|journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology|date=July 2012|volume=110|issue=3|pages=287–293|pmid=22537837|doi=10.1016/j.jip.2012.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014 [[Syngenta]] Agrisure RW-rootworm strains had been detected in Iowa as well as [[glyphosate]]. Agrisure RW-based products entered the market in 2007. However, government officials, academics and companies lack consensus on how to define the resistance phenomenon. The affected fields constituted 0.2% of transgenic US corn acres. Further the affected areas had not been rotated with other crops.&lt;ref name=wsj1402&gt;{{cite web|last=Bunge |first=Jacob |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304157204579475782097509254?mg=reno64-wsj |title=Farm Belt Pest Gnaws at Syngenta - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 Herculex and Agrisure Duracade had not produced resistant outbreaks.&lt;ref name=wsj1402/&gt;

=== '''Biological solutions''' ===
In Austria, an innovative protection method has been developed, using the "mating disruption" method for the first time ever in fields. The according product is called CornProtect&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lithosnatural.at/en/cornprotect&lt;/ref&gt;. The female bugs distribute pheromones that attract males. With that new method, such pheromones are put on specially treated mineral carriers and are slowly released over the full flying period of the bugs. Mating is significantly reduced, because males become disoriented and less interested in copulating. Reproduction is drastically reduced &lt;ref&gt;https://www.landwirt.com/Maiswurzelbohrer-verwirren,,14319,,Bericht.html&lt;/ref&gt; The application is done with conventional field sprayers which makes it economically very viable. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.topagrar.at/ackerbau/Mit-Pheromonen-gegen-den-Maiswurzelbohrer-1885545.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alt-right===
In the first decade of the 21st century, the conspiracy theory spread beyond its explicit neo-Nazi and white nationalist origins, to be embraced by the newer [[alt-right]] movement.

Anders Behring Breivik's entitled manifesto makes frequent mention of an alleged ongoing genocide against white Europeans.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

Discussion threads on the white nationalist Internet forum [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] often center around the theme of white people being subjected to genocidal policies by their governments.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; The concept has also been popularized by the [[alt-right]] movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy|title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-alt-right-terminology-20161115-story.html|title='Cuck', 'snowflake,' 'masculinist': A guide to the language of the 'alt-right'|last=Roy|first=Jessica|date=2016-11-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] referenced the conspiracy theory as tiki torch-wielding protestors yelled "You will not replace us!" and "Jews will not replace us!"

'''''Wolfchild''''' is a [[platform game]] originally released for the [[Amiga]] and the [[Atari ST]] by [[Core Design]] in 1992. It was later released for the [[SNES]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Sega Master System]], and [[Sega Game Gear]].

The plot revolves around biotechnology researcher Kal Morrow and his son Saul. When the former is kidnapped by the evil Chimera organization, Saul uses one of his father's inventions to turn himself into a wolf-human hybrid (similar to a [[werewolf]]) that may be capable of defeating Chimera.

''Wolfchild'' was designed by Simon Phipps, also responsible for the earlier ''[[Switchblade 2]]'', a rather similar game. The action is viewed from the side and scrolls in eight directions. The player must guide Saul through five levels, negotiating [[platform game|platforms]] and shooting various monsters, the result of Chimera experiments. Initially, the player character is Saul in his normal, human form. Only when enough energy has been collected does he turn into a wolf-human, giving him much better attack techniques.
