'''Alice Thomas Ellis''' (born Ann Margaret Lindholm, 9 September 1932 – 8 March 2005) was a British writer and essayist. She was the author of numerous novels and of some non-fiction, including cookery books. Although her married name was Anna Haycraft, she is best known by her [[nom-de-plume]]. Ellis was born in [[Liverpool]]. Her father was half [[Finnish people|Finnish]], and her mother [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. She spent some of her childhood as an evacuee in [[North Wales]], a period later wrote about in ''A Welsh Childhood''. She later moved to [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] in [[North London]].

==Life==
Ellis' parents belonged to the [[positivism|positivist]] and [[atheism|atheist]] [[Church of Humanity]] founded by [[Auguste Comte]], but she left to become a [[Roman Catholic]] at the age of 19. Shortly afterwards, she entered a [[monastery|convent]] as a [[postulant]], but had to leave due to a health condition.

In 1956, she married Colin Haycraft, owner of the publishing company, [[Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd|Duckworth]]. They were happily married until his death in 1995. The couple had seven children (William being the oldest, and an enthusiastic player of [[Avalon Hill]] war games), raised in Anna's religion, but they were also struck by tragedy: their daughter Mary died in infancy at the age of two days, and their son Joshua spent ten months in a coma after an accident and died at the age of nineteen in 1978. To him is dedicated ''The Birds of the Air'', with the following inscription: 
:All his beauty, wit and grace
:Lie forever in one place.
:He who sang and sprang and moved
:Now, in death, is only loved.

She published her first novel, ''The Sin Eater'', in 1977 under the pen name Alice Thomas Ellis, which she used in all her subsequent writing.

She was well known as a hostess; her skill at cooking and entertaining was a considerable asset to the Duckworth company. Her cookery books include ''All-natural Baby Food'' (published Fontana/Collins, 1977) and ''Darling, you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble'', co-written with [[Caroline Blackwood]]. Caroline Blackwood and her husband, the American poet [[Robert Lowell]], were frequent visitors to the Haycraft home. She was also a close friend of [[Beryl Bainbridge]].

Her best-known novel was probably ''Unexplained Laughter'' (1985), which was adapted for British television, as was her ''Summerhouse Trilogy''. Her novel ''The 27th Kingdom'' (1982) was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]]. Her ''Home Life'' column in ''[[The Spectator]]'' was published in four volumes. All her work was livened by a dry, dark sense of humour. One of her most famous witticisms is: "There is no reciprocity. Men love women. Women love children. Children love hamsters. Hamsters don't love anyone".

As a conservative Roman Catholic who was unhappy with the changes in the Church triggered by the [[Second Vatican Council]], she became a sharp polemicist in the press against what she believed were abuses of liturgy and practice that, she believed, led to a watering-down of the faith. Though her fiction often seems [[feminism|feminist]], with women usually the leads, she opposed radical feminists' activism in the Church, and claimed that since the change from the [[Tridentine Mass]] she could barely bring herself to attend on Sundays. A regular columnist of the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' newspaper, she criticised [[Derek Worlock]], the former [[Archbishop of Liverpool]], shortly after his death in 1996, accusing him of being responsible for a strong fall in [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] attendance in the previous decade. Cardinal Hume demanded and achieved her sacking. Thereafter she was the Catholic Herald's cookery columnist.

Ellis was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows |title=Royal Society of Literature All Fellows |publisher=Royal Society of Literature |accessdate=8 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305070326/http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows |archivedate=5 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She survived a bout of [[lung cancer]] but later developed secondary complications and died a year later, on 8 March 2005, at the age of 72.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Arya Samaj''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|ārya samāja}}'' {{lang|sa|आर्य समाज}} "Noble Society" [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]]: आर्य समाज, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: আর্য সমাজ, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਆਰੀਆ ਸਮਾਜ, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: આર્ય સમાજ) is an [[India]]n [[Hindu reform movement]] that promotes values and practices based on the belief in the infallible authority of the [[Vedas]]. The samaj was founded by the [[sannyasa|sannyasi]] (ascetic) [[Dayanand Saraswati]] on 10 April 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings J. and Selbi J. (Ed.) [https://books.google.com/?id=i53tYSX9SZEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Swami+Dayananda+Saraswati&amp;cd=52#v=onepage&amp;q= ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics''] Kessinger 2003 part 3. p. 57. {{ISBN|0-7661-3671-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one God and reject the worship of idols.

[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first prime minister of India in his book, [[The Discovery of India]] credits Arya Samaj in introducing [[Proselytism|proselytization]] in Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thursby|first1=G. R.|title=Hindu-Muslim relations in British India : a study of controversy, conflict, and communal movements in northern India 1923–1928|date=1975|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004043800|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=abcfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=spencer+lavan+arya+samaj#v=onepage&amp;q=arya%20samaj&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The Arya Samaj was established in [[Bombay]] on 7 April 1875 by [[Dayananda Saraswati]] (born "Mool Shankar" in [[Kathiawar]], [[Gujarat]] 1824 {{ndash}} died [[Ajmer]], 1883)&lt;ref name="aryasamaj"&gt;[http://www.aryasamaj.com/enews/2010/mar/2.htm E News] Aryasamaj website 2 March 2010. Accessed 3 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative date for the foundation of the samaj is 24 June 1877 because it was then, in [[Lahore]] when the samaj became more than just a regional movement based in [[Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter343.pdf Dayanand Saraswati] Himalaya publishing documents.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedic schools===
Between 1869 and 1873, Saraswati began his efforts to reform orthodox [[Hinduism]] in India. He established ''[[Gurukul]]'' ([[Vedas|Vedic]] schools) which emphasised Vedic values, culture, ''[[Satya]]'' (virtue) and ''[[Sanatana Dharma]]'' (the essence of living). The schools gave separate educations to boys and girls based on ancient Vedic principles. The Vedic school system was also to relieve Indians from the pattern of a [[British Raj|British]] education.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma R. N and Sharma R. K. [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=4odAR3HVJNcC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=dayanand+gurukul&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj65saO2qbVAhVMybwKHV9oDFEQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dayanand%20gurukul&amp;f=false ''Problems of Education in India''] Atlantic 2006 p. 356 {{ISBN|817156612X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Vedic school was established at [[Farrukhabad]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Saxena G. S. [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-IbXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=farrukhabad+gurukul&amp;dq=farrukhabad+gurukul&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-n6qu5KbVAhVIi7wKHe9gCiIQ6AEIKTAB ''Arya Samaj movement in India, 1875–1947''] Commonwealth publishers 1990 p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty students were enrolled in its first year. This success led to the founding of schools at [[Mirzapur]] (1870), [[Kasganj]] (1870), [[Chhalesar]] ([[Aligarh]]) (1870) and [[Varanasi]] (1873). 

At the schools, students received all meals, lodging, clothing and books free of charge. Discipline was strict. Students were not allowed to perform ''[[murti]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' (worship of sculpted stone idols). Rather, they performed ''[[Sandhyavandanam]]'' (meditative prayer using Vedic mantras with divine sound) and ''[[agnihotra]]'' (making a heated milk offering twice daily).
 
The study of [[Sanskrit]] scriptural texts which accepted the authority of the Vedas were taught. They included the ''[[Vedas]]'', ''[[Upanishads]]'', ''[[Aranyaka]]'', ''Kashika'', ''[[Nirukta]]'', ''[[Mahabhasya]]'', ''[[Pāṇini|Ashtadhyayi]]'', ''Darshanas''. The teaching was open to girls and to children who were not of the [[Brahmins]] class. 

Dayanand had difficulty finding qualified teachers who agreed with his views on religious reform. There were few textbooks which he considered suitable. Funding was sporadic, attendance fluctuated and students did not achieve desired standards and so some schools closed soon after opening. The last remaining school at Farrukhabad closed in 1876. 
&lt;!--After the spread of Arya Samaj in the twentieth century, more than 200 Vedic schools are currently run by DAV organisation. Now arya samaj is trying to find what is the next step for Vyasan Mukti Abhiyan in the present situation and it is also a part of Swach Bharat Abhiyan--&gt;

===Adi Brahmo Samaj===
{{main|Adi Brahmo Samaj}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
In 1872 and 1873, Dayanand travelled and came to know some pro-Western Indian intellectuals including Navin Chandra Roy, [[Rajnarayan Basu]], [[Debendranath Tagore]] and [[Hemendranath Tagore]] who were actively involved in the [[Brahmo Samaj]]. This reform organization, founded in 1828, held many views similar to those of Dayanand. The organisation promoted [[monotheism]] and the eternality of the soul; and the abolishment of the hereditary [[caste|caste or varna system]] and uplifting people through education. Dayanand disagreed with the Brahmo Samaj about the proper position of the Vedas. Dayanand strongly held the Vedas to be divine revelation.

==="The Light of Truth" lecture series===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
After visiting [[Calcutta]], Dayanand's work changed. He began lecturing in [[Hindi]] rather than in [[Sanskrit]]. Although Sanskrit garnered respect, in Hindi, Dayanand reached a much larger audience. His ideas of reform began to reach the poorest people. 

In [[Varanasi]], after hearing Dayanand speak, a local government official called Jaikishen Das encouraged Dayanand to publish a book about his ideas. From June to September 1874, Dayanand dictated a series of lectures to his scribe, Bhimsen Sharma. The lectures recorded Dayanand's views on a wide range of subjects. They were published in 1875 in Varanasi with the title ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'' ("the light of truth").

===New samaj===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
While his manuscript for ''Satyarth Prakash'' was being edited in Varanasi, Dayanand received an invitation to travel to [[Bombay]]. There, he was to debate representatives of the [[Vallabhacharya]] sect. On 20 October, 1874, Dayanand arrived in Bombay. The debate, though well publicized, never took place. Nonetheless, two members of the [[Prarthana Samaj]] approached Dayanand and invited him to speak at one of their gatherings. He did so and was well received. They recognized Dayanand's desire to uplift the Hindu community and protect Hindus from the pressures to convert to [[Christianity]] or [[Islamism|Islam]]. Dayanand spent over one month in Bombay and attracted sixty people to his cause. They proposed founding a new samaj with Dayanand's ideas as its spiritual and intellectual basis.

===Ahmedabad debates===
On 11 December 1874, Dayanand arrived in [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat on the invitation of [[Gopal Hari Deshmukh]]. There, he debated with interested parties.

===Rajkot Arya Samaj===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
On 31 December, 1874, Dayanand arrived in [[Rajkot]], Gujarat, on the invitation of Hargovind Das Dvarkadas, the secretary of the local Prarthana Samaj. He invited topics of discourse from the audience and spoke on eight. Again, Dayanand was well received and the Rajkot group elected to join his cause. The Samaj was renamed ''Arya Samaj'' (Society of Nobles). Dayanand published a list of twenty-eight rules and regulations for the followers. After leaving Rajkot, Dayanand went to [[Ahmedabad]] but his audience at a meeting on 27 January, 1875, did not elect to form a new Arya Samaj. Meanwhile, the Rajkot group had become in a political row.

===Bombay Arya Samaj===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Arya Samaj R.V. Russell 1916.PNG|thumb|250px|right|A meeting of the Arya Samāj for investing boys with the [[sacred thread]]&lt;ref&gt;[[R. V. Russell|Russell R. V. ]] ''The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India'' 1916 vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On his return to Bombay, Dayanand began a membership drive for a local Arya samaj and received one hundred enrolees. 
On 7 April 1875, the Bombay Arya Samaj was established. Dayanand himself enrolled as a member rather than the leader of the Bombay group. The samaj began to grow.

==After Dayanand==
Dayanand died in 1883. The Arya Samaj continued to grow, especially in Punjab. The early leaders of the samaj were [[Pandit Lekh Ram]] (1858 {{ndash}} 1897) and [[Swami Shraddhanand]] (Mahatma Munshi Ram Vij) (1856 {{ndash}} 1926). In Punjab, the Arya Samaj was opposed by the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] dominated [[Singh Sabha]], the forerunner of the [[Akali Dal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2052684 |jstor=2052684|title=Ham Hindu Nahin: Arya-Sikh Relations, 1877-1905|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=32|issue=3|pages=457|year=1973|last1=Jones|first1=Kenneth W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors claim that the activities of the Samaj led to increased antagonism between Muslims and Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2051414|jstor=2051414|title=The Arya Samaj and Congress Politics in the Punjab, 1894-1908|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=26|issue=3|pages=363|year=1967|last1=Barrier|first1=Norman G.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Shraddhanand led the [[Shuddhi]] movement that aimed to bring Hindus who had converted to other religions back to Hinduism. &lt;ref&gt;Nair N. [https://books.google.com/?id=o-NoCp9Lc24C&amp;pg=PP8 ''Changing Homelands: Hindu Politics and the Partition of India'']. Permanent Black, New Delhi 2011. p. 53 {{ISBN|9780674057791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, the Arya Samaj members of Punjab were divided on the question of [[vegetarianism]]. The group that refrained from eating meat were called the ''"Mahatma"'' group and the other group, the "Cultured Party".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V20_296.gif "Punjab"] Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909. vol. 20 p. 291. Accessed 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, the samaj (or organizations inspired by it such as ''Jat Pat Todak Mandal'') campaigned against caste discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Rajivlochan M. ''Coping with Exclusions the Non-Political Way'' in Judge P. S.

[https://books.google.com/?id=eYpJeVkD_qoC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22arya+samaj%22+diwali+holi#v=onepage&amp;q=arya%20missionaries&amp;f=false ''The Hindu Diaspora: Comparative Patterns''] Routledge, London 2000. pp. 29, 54 and 69. {{ISBN|9780415238939}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent Indian Nationalists such as [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] belonged to Arya Samaj and were active in its campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Rai L. L. ''The Arya Samaj: an Account of its Aims, Doctrine and Activities, with a Biographical Sketch of the Founder'' Longman, London 1915. {{ISBN|978-81-85047-77-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British colonial government in the early part of 20th century viewed the Samaj as a political body.Some samajist in government service were dismissed for belonging to the samaj&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=Raj (editor)|title=Essays on social reform movements|date=2004|publisher=Discovery Pub.

In the 1930s, when the Hindu Nationalist group, the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] grew in prominence in Northern India, they found support in the Arya Samaj of Punjab. &lt;ref&gt;Jaffrelot C.

===Pandit Lekh Ram and Arya Samaj in Punjab===
[[Pandit Lekh Ram]] (1858 {{ndash}} 1897) was an Arya Samaj leader who was a contemporary of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] (1835 {{ndash}} 1908), the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. Ram contested Ahmad's text, ''[[Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya]]'' in a work entitled ''Takzeeb e Barahin Ahmadiyya'' ("A falsification of the Barahin e Ahmadiyya"). Ram was assassinated on 6 March 1897. Members of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] claimed that this was in accordance with the prophecies of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]].&lt;ref name="qern"&gt;[http://wiki.qern.org/mirza-ghulam-ahmad/contemporaries/pandit-lekhram|publisher=wiki.qern.org ''Pandit Lekh Ram (1858–1897)'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Quern organisation website. Accessed 3 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Talbot of the University of Southampton wrote, "Relations grew particularly bad between the Aryas and the Muslims. Serious violence broke out in 1897 when Pandit Lekh Ram was assassinated. Lekh Ram's greatest influence was in the north-west of Punjab. He had in fact joined the Peshawar Arya Samaj in 1880 and rose to prominence first as a missionary and then as editor of the Arya Gazette. At first he had limited his attacks to the Ahmadi movement of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, but he increasingly attacked orthodox Muslims as well. His pamphlet, Risala-i-Jihad ya'ri Din-i-Muhammad ki Bunyad (A treatise on waging holy war, or the foundation of the Muhammadan Religion) caused a considerable outcry, when it was published in 1892. Until his murder by a Muslim{{fact|date=August 2017}} five years later, Lekh Ram continued to stir up animosity by his vituperative writings."&lt;ref&gt;Talbot I.

===Arya Samaj in Gujarat===
The Arya Samaj of Gujarat members were missionaries from Punjab who had been encouraged to move to Gujarat to carry out educational work amongst the [[Untouchability|untouchable castes]] by the [[maharaja]], [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]]. The Gujarat samaj opened orphanages. In 1915, the samaj lost its following to [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardiman D.

===Reconversion in Malabar===
In 1921, during a rebellion by the Muslim [[Moplah]] community of [[Malabar region|
Malabar]] Indian newspapers reported that a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. The Arya Samaj extended its efforts to the region to reconvert these people back to Hinduism through [[Shaucha|Shuddhi]] ceremonies.

===Language issue===
Arya Samaj promoted the use of Hindi in Punjab and discouraged the use of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. This was a serious point of difference between the Sikhs, represented by the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] group and the Arya Samaj. The difference was marked during the period immediately following the [[independence of India]] and the time of the [[Punjabi Suba movement]] (demand for a Punjabi speaking state).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;Lamba K.

===Humanitarian efforts===
Arya Samaj was a charitable organisation. For example, donations were made to victims of the [[1905 Kangra earthquake]]. The samaj campaigned for [[women's right to vote]], and for the protection of widows.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma S. C.

==Contemporary Arya Samaj==

===Arya Samaj in India===
Arya Samaj schools and [[temple]]s are found in almost all major cities and as well as in rural areas (esp in North region) of India. Some are authorised to conduct weddings. The samaj is associated with the [[Dayanand Anglo Vedic]] (DAV) schools which number over two hundred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearyasamaj.org/home Arya Samaj] Arya Samaj website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The former Indian prime minister [[Charan Singh]], as a young man, was a member of Arya Samaj in [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]].

A branch of Arya Samaj was established in 2015 in [[Angul district]] in the state of Odisha&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ordistricts.nic.in/district_home.php?did=an# |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106155800/http://www.ordistricts.nic.in/district_home.php?did=an# |archive-date=6 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core beliefs==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:O3m AryaSamaj.PNG|thumb|upright|{{script|Deva|ओ३म्}} [[pluti|O3]]m ([[Om|Aum]]), considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God.]]
Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one almighty creator known as ''Aum'' who is mentioned in the [[Yajur Veda]] (40:17). They believe the Vedas is an infallible authority. The Arya Samaj members reject other Hindu religious texts because they are not "revealed" works. For instance, they believe books like the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' are legends of historical figures, which secondarily have been used as reference to [[God|supreme beings]] and [[avatars]]. The members of Arya Samaj reject other scriptural works such as the [[Bible]], and the [[Quran]]. They reject the worship of [[cult image|idols]]. The Arya Samaj promotes the equality of all human beings and the empowerment of women.

==Practices==

Members celebrate ''[[Holi]]'' (the start of spring) and ''[[Diwali]]'' (a harvest festival and the victory of good over evil).

Arya Samaj advocates a [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet and in particular, the eating of beef is strictly prohibited.

After a death, Arya samaji will often conduct a havan and collect the ashes on the fourth day.&lt;ref&gt;Firth S.

[[File:Dia two wicks divali 20151111.jpg|thumb|left||upright|Diya with four wicks, pointing in each direction (N, W, S, E).]]
The Arya Samaj celebration of ''Diwali'' is typified by the celebration in [[Suriname]]. The festival celebrates the victory of good over evil. A vegetarian fast is kept. The Gayatri mantra is spoken while oil lamps are lit. One [[Diya (lamp)|Diya]] lamp, which is of a larger size has two wicks crossed to produce four lights, one in each direction and is lit first. The smaller lamp has one wick. The recitation of the Gayatri mantra occurs in front of a fire altar lit with sandalwood. A lamp is kept in every room except the bathroom and restroom. More lamps can be lit, which can be placed arbitrarily in the yard, living room and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Arya Dharm: Hindu Consciousness in 19th-Century Punjab Paperback – January 1, 2006{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Kenneth W.|title=Arya dharm : Hindu consciousness in 19th-century Punjab|date=1976|publisher=Manohar|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8173047091|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RpvXCtNzrz8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=kenneth+w+jones+arya+samaj#v=snippet&amp;q=samaj&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holi===
Holi is celebrated as the conclusion of winter and the start of spring to sow the land and hope for a good harvest. This day is marked by colors and song (''Chautal''). It does not require specific prayer or fasting, however some people keep a vegetarian fast on this day. The Arya Samaj does not associate Holi with a particular deity such as Vishnu or Shiva and in comparison to some interpretations of the festival, the Arya Samaj version in more sober and is as per the 4 Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal R.

'''''Badeken''''', '''''Bedeken''''', '''''Badekenish''''', or '''''Bedekung''''' ({{lang-yi|באַדעקן}}  ''badekn'', lit. covering), is the ceremony where the groom veils the bride in a [[Jewish wedding]].

Just prior to the actual wedding ceremony, which takes place under the ''[[chuppah]]'', the bridegroom, accompanied by his parents, the [[Rabbi]], and other dignitaries, and amidst joyous singing of his friends, covers the bride's face with a veil. At this point, it is traditional for the Rabbi to pronounce a blessing upon the couple. The bride wears this veil until the conclusion of the chuppah ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, 147:3&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Sources==
The custom of a virgin bride wearing a veil is mentioned in the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;Ketubot 17b, Rashi ad loc&lt;/ref&gt; 

The veiling itself is a symbol of modesty, based upon the verse in connection with [[Rebecca]] meeting [[Isaac]], "[T]hen she took her veil and covered herself."&lt;ref&gt;Genesis, 24:65&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of the groom uncovering the veil comes from when [[Jacob]] married [[Leah]] by accident because her face was veiled, when he really wanted to marry [[Rachel]].&lt;ref&gt;Genesis, 29:20-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Some maintain that the Badeken ceremony is the meaning of the term ''chuppah'' (Hebrew for "covering") mentioned in the Talmud and thus has legal ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/477333/jewish/Badeken-Veiling.htm  Badeken -- Veiling] on Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

''[http://bahai-library.com/buck_eschatological_interface_messianism A Unique Eschatological Interface: Baha'u'llah and Cross-Cultural Messianism]'', published in: ''In Iran: Studies in Babi and Baha'i History vol. 3'', ed. [[Peter Smith (historian)|Peter Smith]], pp. 157-179. Kalimat Press, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Krishna]] is included in the succession of [[Manifestations of God]]. The authenticity of the [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]] is seen as uncertain.&lt;ref name="smith-indian-religions"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Indian religions |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural references==
[[Bahá'u'lláh]] was familiar with Hinduism, which is clear from a [[Tablet (religious)|tablet]] to [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]], the English translation of which is included in the volume ''[[Tabernacle of Unity]]''. In this tablet Bahá'u'lláh answered questions about [[Hinduism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] by [[Maneckji Limji Hataria]]. The subjects include [[comparative religion]], and constitute, while much remains implicit, a dialogue of Bahá'u'lláh with Hinduism and the other religions discussed, giving an understanding of what Baha'u'llah meant with the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of the world religions]].&lt;ref name="cole-hindu-zoro"&gt;[[Juan Cole|Cole, Juan R. I.]] ''[http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_cole_questions_manakji Baha'u'llah on Hinduism and Zoroastrianism: The Tablet to Mirza Abu'l-Fadl Concerning the Questions of Manakji Limji Hataria]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another tablet (published in ''[[Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh|Gleanings]]'', section LXXXVII) Bahá'u'lláh discussed the absence of records about history before Adam. Here he refers to the ''Jug-Basisht'' (''Book of Juk''), which is the Persian translation of the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', a [[syncretism|syncretic]] philosophic text.&lt;ref name="cole-hindu-zoro" /&gt; The translation was done during the [[Mughal Dynasty]] in the sixteenth century A.D. and became popular in Persia among intellectuals with [[Indo-Persian culture|Indo-Persian interests]] since then.&lt;ref&gt;[[Juan Cole|Cole, Juan R.I.]] "Iranian Culture and South Asia, 1500-1900". in: [[Nikki R. Keddie|Keddie, Nikki]] (ed.). (2002). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CdzFJIE7f5oC Iran and the Surrounding World: Interactions in Culture and Cultural Politics]''. pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasistha#Section Six: On Liberation|Story of Bhusunda]]'', a chapter of the ''Yoga Vasistha'', a very old sage, Bhusunda, recalls a succession of epochs in the earth's history, as described in [[Hindu cosmology]]. [[Juan Cole]] states that this means that in [[dating Creation]], Bahá'u'lláh promotes the theory of a long chronology over a short one.&lt;ref name="cole-hindu-zoro" /&gt;

==Teachings==

===Brahman (God)===
{{see also|God in the Bahá'í Faith|God in Hinduism}}
In Hinduism [[Brahman]] is believed to be the Absolute Reality. Followers of [[Vedanta]] see Brahman as an impersonal reality, of which each soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]) is a part. The theistic traditions of Hinduism, which include [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]], consider Brahman as a [[personal God]], whom they call [[Bhagwan]] or [[Ishvara]] (Lord).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1990|pp=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bahá'í teachings these differing views are all valid, as they represent different points of view looking at the Absolute Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1990|pp=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avatars (Manifestations of God)===
Both Hinduism and the Bahá'í Faith teach that God manifests himself at different times and places. These messengers are termed [[Avatar]]s in Hinduism and [[Manifestations of God]] in the Bahá'í teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1990|pp=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the difference is that Hinduism teaches that Avatars are God himself in human form and are thus divine while Bahá'í teachings stress that the Manifestations of God are not God but his representatives. 

The Manifestations of God are not seen as [[incarnation]]s of God as God cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures, but they are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of a Manifestation of God emphasizes the simultaneously existing qualities of humanity and divinity. In the station of divinity, they show forth the will, [[knowledge]] and attributes of [[God]]; in the station of humanity, they show the physical qualities of common man.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole |authorlink= Juan Cole| title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common Bahá'í analogy used to explain the relationship between the Manifestation of God and God is that of a perfect [[mirror]]. In the analogy, God is likened to the [[Sun]] – the source of physical life on [[earth]].  The spirit and attributes of God are likened to the rays of the Sun, and the Manifestations of God are likened to perfect mirrors reflecting the rays of the Sun.&lt;ref name="hatcher118"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZmkG1ASirgC |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Manifestations of God act as pure mirrors that reflect the attributes of God onto this material world.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

===Deities and images===
In Hinduism many [[Hindu deities|deities]], depicted in images and [[murti]] (statues), are worshipped. Many Hindus realize that all these deities represent different aspects of the one God, Brahman. The Bahá'í teachings state that in this day, when mankind is reaching the state of maturity, images are not needed anymore to form an idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1990|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical and moral teachings===
There are many similarities in the ethical and moral teachings of Hinduism and the Bahá'í Faith. These include subject as contemplation, detachment, faith, love, non-violence, purity, respect for parents, righteousness, self-control, right speech, not stealing, truth, virtue, work as worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1990|pp=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation of Bahá'í teachings to Hindu context==
[[File:Bahai-house-of-worship-delhi2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Lotus Temple|Bahá'í House of Worship]], [[New Delhi]], [[India]].]]
The speedy growth of the [[Bahá'í Faith in India|Indian Bahá'í community]] since the 1960s was influenced by adapting the [[Bahá'í teachings]] for presentation in a clearly [[Hindu]] context familiar to the people of the countryside - using principles and language familiar to them:&lt;ref name="smith-indian-religions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garlington-india"&gt;Garlington, William. ''[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/india1.htm The Baha'i Faith in India: A Developmental Stage Approach]'', Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, No. 2 (June, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
:*the presentation of Bahá'u'lláh as the [[Kalki Avatar]] who according to the [[Vishnu Purana]] will appear at the end of the [[Kali Yuga]] for the purpose of reestablishing an era of righteousness;
:*emphasizing  the figures of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Krishna]] as past [[Manifestations of God]] or [[Avatar]]s;
:*references to Hindu scriptures such as the [[Bhagavad Gita]];
:*the substitution of [[Sanskrit]]-based terminology for [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] where possible (i.e., Bhagavan Baha for Bahá'u'lláh), and the incorporation in both song (''[[bhajan]]'')&lt;ref name="garlington-bhajans"&gt;Garlington, William. ''[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/vol2/india2.htm The Baha'i Bhajans: An example of the Baha'i Use of Hindu Symbols]'', Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1 (January, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  and literature of Hindu holy places, hero-figures and poetic images;
:*Hindi translations of Baha'i scriptures and prayers that appeared during this period which are so heavily Sanskritized as to make it difficult to recognize their non-Hindu antecedents.

==Gandhi and Tagore==
[[File:Tagore Gandhi.jpg|thumb| [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1940.]]
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] and writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]], both Hindus, had contact with Bahá'ís on several occasions.&lt;ref name = "gandhimoham"&gt;{{cite book |last = Gandhimohan |first = M.V. |year = 2000 |title = Mahatma Gandhi and the Bahá'ís |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = New Delhi, India |isbn = 81-86953-82-5 | pages = 14-15 |url = http://bahai-library.com/gandhimohan_gandhi_bahais_nonviolence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "terry"&gt; Terry, Peter (1992, 2015) ''[https://bahai-library.com/terry_tagore_encounters_bahais Rabindranath Tagore: Some Encounters with Bahá'ís]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Mahatma Gandhi and the Bahá'ís'', M.V. Gandhimohan analyzes similarities and differences between Gandhi's thought and the Bahá'í teachings.&lt;ref name = "gandhimoham"  /&gt; Gandhi called the Bahá'í Faith "a solace to humankind".&lt;ref name = "gandhimoham" /&gt; 

Tagore met [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] in [[Chicago]], [[United States]], in 1912, a few months before his Nobel-prize winning collection of poetry ''[[Gitanjali]]'' was first published in English. 'Abdu'l-Bahá later wrote about Tagore that "he is one of the promoters of peace and reconciliation. He is kind to all people".&lt;ref name = "terry" /&gt; Tagore, who was also the secretary of the [[Hindu reform movement]] [[Adi Dharm|Adi Brahmo Samaj]], stated that "the ideals of my university ([[Visva-Bharati]]) [[Santiniketan]], [[Bengal]], India, are quite akin to the universal ideals of Bahá’u’lláh. Visva-Bharati cherishes the ideal of an active co-operation between the different religions and cultures of the East and the West, and nothing would please me more than to offer a permanent place at my university to the culture and research of the great religion founded by the Prophet Bahá’u’lláh.".&lt;ref name = "terry" /&gt; On another occasion he stated that Bahá’u’lláh "is the latest Prophet to come out of Asia. His life is certainly a glorious record of unflinching human search after truth; and his message is of great importance for the progress of civilization."&lt;ref name = "terry" /&gt;

Throughout the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] writings, future events have been prophesied. The most specific prophecies are related to the rise and fall of leaders and organizations. Most of these prophesies can be found in Bahá'u'lláh's [[Summons of the Lord of Hosts|tablets to the kings and rulers]] of the world and in the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]].&lt;ref name="Smith-prophecy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= prophecy |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-rulers"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= rulers, proclamation to |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly potent to early Bahá'ís was [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s prediction in 1868–69 of the fall of Sultan [[Abdülaziz]], who was deposed in 1876.&lt;ref name="Smith-abdulaziz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Abdulaziz |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=13–14 |url=http://www.oneworld-publications.com/pdfs/Encyclo_Baha.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101163638/http://www.oneworld-publications.com/pdfs/Encyclo_Baha.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prophecies, including statements from [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], are general in nature, relating to the nature of future society, and the rise of the Bahá'í Faith to prominence.&lt;ref name="Smith-prophecy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-world-order"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= World Order |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical events==

===The downfall of various leaders===

====Sultan Abdu'l-Aziz====

Bahá'u'lláh wrote a condemnatory letter to then [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Abdülaziz|`Abdu'l-`Azíz]] (r. 1861-1876), the original of which has been lost. Originals of three other letters addressing two of the Sultan's ministers are recorded in ''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts]]'', which also mention the Sultan. The letters condemn their misrule, abuse of civil power, and character; especially their role in Bahá'u'lláh's banishments and imprisonment.{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|2002|p=Introduction}}

Two of the three letters, the ''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Ra'ís (Tablet to the Chief)|Súriy-i-Ra'ís]]'' and the ''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Lawh-i-Fu'ád (Tablet of Fu'ád Páshá)|Lawh-i-Fu'ád]]'', predict that [[Abdülaziz|`Abdu'l-`Azíz]] will lose control of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Smith-abdulaziz" /&gt; In 1868 Bahá'u'lláh wrote,

{{quote|The day is approaching when the Land of Mystery ([[Adrianople]])  and what is beside it shall be changed, and shall pass out of the hands of the King, and commotions shall appear, and the voice of lamentation shall be raised, and the evidences of mischief shall be revealed on all sides, and confusion shall spread by reason of that which hath befallen these captives at the hands of the hosts of oppression.{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|2002|p=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SLH/slh-10.html#gr5 143]}}}}

Later in 1869, Bahá'u'lláh compares the Sultan and his Prime Minister [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha|`Alí Páshá]] to [[Nimrod]] and [[Ramesses II|Pharaoh]] who rose up against [[Abraham]] and [[Moses]] and writes that they will lose power:
{{quote|Soon will We dismiss the one who was like unto him [`Alí Páshá], and will lay hold on their Chief who ruleth the land [the Sultan]...{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|2002|p=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SLH/slh-12.html#fr7 179]}}}}

Sultan [[Abdülaziz|`Abdu'l-`Azíz]] was deposed on May 30, 1876 and a fortnight later he was found dead in the palace where he had been confined, and trustworthy medical evidence attributed his death to [[suicide]] although many people believed he was murdered by a conspiracy.

The prophecies regarding the downfall of the Sultan played an important role in the conversion of [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]], one of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]'s foremost scholars, after the fulfilment of the prophecies.&lt;ref name="Smith-abul-fadl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Mírzá Abu'l-Faḍl Gulpáygání, Mírzá Muḥammad |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |ISBN=1-85168-184-1 |pages=22–23 |url=http://www.oneworld-publications.com/pdfs/Encyclo_Baha.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101163638/http://www.oneworld-publications.com/pdfs/Encyclo_Baha.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1984|pp=91–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====`Alí Pashá and Fu'ád Páshá====

Bahá'u'lláh addressed two letters to [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha|`Alí Páshá]] (''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Ra'ís (Tablet to the Chief)|Súriy-i-Ra'ís]]'' and ''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Lawh-i-Ra'ís (Tablet of the Chief)|Lawh-i-Ra'ís]]'') and an additional letter written reflecting on the death of [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha|Fu'ád Páshá]] (''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Lawh-i-Fu'ád (Tablet of Fu'ád Páshá)|Lawh-i-Fu'ád]]''), both of whom served at different times as [[Grand Vizier]]s of [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Abdülaziz|`Abdu'l-`Azíz]]. Among the strong condemnations of the ministers, written from 1868-1869, Bahá'u'lláh also predicts the downfall of `Alí Pashá (referred to as the "Chief").&lt;ref name="Smith-ali-pasha"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Âli Paṣa, Mehmet Emin |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=34 |url=http://www.oneworld-publications.com/pdfs/Encyclo_Baha.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101163638/http://www.oneworld-publications.com/pdfs/Encyclo_Baha.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing to him in the Súriy-i-Ra’ís, Bahá'u'lláh says:

{{quote|Soon thou shalt find thyself in manifest loss!{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|2002|p=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SLH/slh-10.html#pg142 142]}}}}

Writing to him in the Lawh-i-Ra'ís, Bahá'u'lláh says:

{{quote|Soon will He seize you in His wrathful anger, sedition will be stirred up in your midst, and your dominions will be disrupted. ... Neither will your glory last, nor will Mine abasement endure.{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|2002|pp=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SLH/slh-11.html#gr7 164-165]}}}}

[[Mehmed Fuad Pasha|Fu'ád Páshá]] died of a heart disorder in February 1869. [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha|`Alí Páshá]] tried to perform the vacant role of foreign minister as well as prime minister, but also began having health problems, later getting tuberculosis and dying in September of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ali Pasha (Mehmet Emin) | url=http://www.biyografya.com/biyografi/16664 | website= Biyografya}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his reforms were changed and his enemies returned from exile. Five years later the government was reformed, and the steady decline of the empire culminated in its dissolution during [[World War I]]. 

[[Juan Cole]] wrote a commentary on the prophecies, suggesting that "predictions of the Sultán's downfall, such as Bahá'u'lláh made in that Tablet, were not unusual but rather were commonplaces..."&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bahai-library.com/resources/tablets-notes/lawh-fuad/notes.html |title= Lawh-i-Fu'ád: notes by Juan Cole |last= Cole |first= Juan| authorlink= Juan Cole |date=  |website= Bahá'í Library Online |publisher= |access-date= December 2, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues, 
{{quote|"Bahá'u'lláh predicts that Alí Páshá, then grand vizier, will be deposed (the verb is 'azala, which is used of deposing kings). He says, too, that God will "lay hold" (the verb is akhadha, to take, seize) of Sultán AbdulAzíz (he is called amiruhum, literally, "their prince" or "their commander"). Although Bahá'u'lláh was correct that neither of these powerful men had long at the top in 1869, his prophecy, if taken literally, actually reverses their true fates... Taken together with Bahá'u'lláh's prediction in the Tablet of the Premier that turmoil would overtake the Ottoman empire and his advocacy from his early Acre years of parliamentary democracy, he does seem to have been prescient about the imminence of the First Constitutional Revolution. Indeed, the matter of Alí Páshá never being deposed seems minor in comparison.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;}}

====Napoleon III====
[[Napoleon III]] was the Emperor of the French from 1852 to 1870.  In 1869 Bahá'u'lláh wrote to him in one of the five chapters that compose the ''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Haykal (Tablet of the Temple)|Súriy-i-Haykal]]''.  In the tablet Bahá'u'lláh writes that if Napoleon III does not follow Bahá'u'lláh he will lose his kingdom and that commotion will occur in France:&lt;ref name="Smith-napoleon"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Napoleon III|year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion, and thine empire shall pass from thine hands, as a punishment for that which thou hast wrought. Then wilt thou know how thou hast plainly erred. Commotions shall seize all the people in that land, unless thou arisest to help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the Spirit of God in this, the Straight Path. Hath thy pomp made thee proud? By My Life! It shall not endure; nay, it shall soon pass away, unless thou holdest fast to this firm Cord. We see abasement hastening after thee, whilst thou art of the heedless. "

Within the year, in battle against [[Prussia]] in July 1870, the Emperor was captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]] (September 2) and was deposed by the forces of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in Paris two days later; he was sent into exile to England where he died.

After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians, General [[Louis Jules Trochu]] and the politician [[Léon Gambetta]] overthrew the Second Empire and established the "Government of National Defence" which later became the conservative Third Republic. Its creation was overshadowed by the subsequent revolution in Paris known as the [[Paris Commune]], which maintained a radical regime for two months until its bloody suppression in May 1871.

====Caliphate====
Bahá'u'lláh prophesied the fall of the [[Caliphate]], the title of the head of state in [[Sunni Islam]].  From 1517 onwards, the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] sultan was also the Caliph of Islam, and the Ottoman Empire was, from 1517 until 1922 (or 1924), synonymous with the Caliphate or the Islamic State.  Addressing the people of [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Bahá'u'lláh, in the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' which was completed in 1873, claims that the leaders of Constantinople, the Caliph, has been a source of tyranny, and that they will lose control:&lt;ref name="Smith-istanbul"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Istanbul |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-caliphate"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= caliphate |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"O people of Constantinople! Lo, from your midst We hear the baleful hooting of the owl. Hath the drunkenness of passion laid hold upon you, or is it that ye are sunk in heedlessness? O Spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas! The throne of tyranny hath, verily, been established upon thee, and the flame of hatred hath been kindled within thy bosom, in such wise that the Concourse on high and they who circle around the Exalted Throne have wailed and lamented. We behold in thee the foolish ruling over the wise, and darkness vaunting itself against the light. Thou art indeed filled with manifest pride. Hath thine outward splendour made thee vainglorious? By Him Who is the Lord of mankind! It shall soon perish, and thy daughters and thy widows and all the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament. Thus informeth thee the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-6.html#pg52 Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'', 1873)

On March 3, 1924, the first [[List of Presidents of Turkey|President of the Turkish Republic]], [[Kemal Atatürk]], constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate. Its powers were transferred to the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] (parliament) of the newly formed Turkish nation-state and the title has since been inactive.

Bahá'u'lláh wrote:

==A ruler who will raise up the Bahá'í Faith==
In 1873 Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'':&lt;ref name="Smith-kings"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= kings, kingship |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"How great the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark--the Ark which God hath prepared for the people of Bahá. All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, O people of Bahá, your substance, nay your very lives, for his assistance."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-6.html#pg50 Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'', 1873)

This is elaborated specifically:
:"In the Lawh-i-Ra'ís He actually and categorically prophesies the rise of such a king: "Erelong will God raise up from among the kings one who will aid His loved ones. He, verily, encompasseth all things. He will instill in the hearts the love of His loved ones. This, indeed, is irrevocably decreed by One Who is the Almighty, the Beneficent." In the Ridvánu'l-`Adl, wherein the virtue of justice is exalted, He makes a parallel prediction: "Erelong will God make manifest on earth kings who will recline on the couches of justice, and will rule amongst men even as they rule their own selves. They, indeed, are among the choicest of My creatures in the entire creation.""
::(Bahá'u'lláh, 1868, quoted by Shoghi Effendi in ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/PDC/pdc-20.html#pg73 Promised Day is Come]'')

:"... It must, however long and tortuous the way, lead, through a series of victories and reverses, to the political unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to the emergence of a world government and the establishment of the Lesser Peace, as foretold by Bahá’u’lláh and foreshadowed by the Prophet Isaiah."

===Signs for the coming of age of the human race===
Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'':&lt;ref name="Smith-human-race"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= human race |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"We have appointed two signs for the coming of age of the human race: the first, which is the most firm foundation, We have set down in other of Our Tablets, while the second hath been revealed in this wondrous Book."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-8.html#pg88 Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'', 1873)
The first sign refers to the selection of a [[Lingua franca|single language]] and the adoption of a common script:
:"O members of parliaments throughout the world! Select ye a single language for the use of all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common script. ... This will be the cause of unity, could ye but comprehend it, and the greatest instrument for promoting harmony and civilization, would that ye might understand!"
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-8.html#pg88 Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'', 1873)
The second sign refers to the emergence of a "divine philosophy" which will include the discovery of a radical approach to the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation of elements]]:
:"Consider the doubts which they who have joined partners with God have instilled into the hearts of the people of this land. “Is it ever possible,” they ask, “for copper to be transmuted into gold?” Say, Yes, by my Lord, it is possible. Its secret, however, lieth hidden in Our Knowledge. We will reveal it unto whom We will. Whoso doubteth Our power, let him ask the Lord his God, that He may disclose unto him the secret, and assure him of its truth. That copper can be turned into gold is in itself sufficient proof that gold can, in like manner, be transmuted into copper, if they be of them that can apprehend this truth. Every mineral can be made to acquire the density, form, and substance of each and every other mineral. The knowledge thereof is with Us in the Hidden Book."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-97.html#pg198 Gleanings from the Writing of Bahá'u'lláh]'', Section XCVII, undated)
In Bahá'u'lláh's tablet addressed to Shaykh Salmán, he mentions a third sign, which is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship:
:"One of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain with none willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon wisdom will be manifested among mankind. Only in order to proclaim the Cause of God and spread abroad His Faith will anyone be willing to bear this grievous weight. Well is it with him who, for love of God and His Cause, and for the sake of God and for the purpose of proclaiming His Faith, will expose himself unto this great danger, and will accept this toil and trouble.”"
::(Bahá'u'lláh, undated, quoted in Shoghi Effendi, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/PDC/pdc-19.html#pg71 The Promised Day is Come]'')

===The establishment of a World Commonwealth===
{{See also|New world order (Bahá'í)}}
Shoghi Effendi wrote:&lt;ref name="Smith-world-order" /&gt;

:"The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded…"

:"A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation—such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving."
::(Shoghi Effendi, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-56.html#pg203 The Unfoldment of World Civilization]'', 1936)

This commonwealth must consist of:
::*a world legislature.
::*a world executive, backed by an international Force.
::*a world tribunal.

Further features:
::*a mechanism of world inter-communication.
::*a world metropolis which will act as the nerve center of a world civilization.
::*a world language, a world script, and a world literature.
::*a uniform and universal system of currency, weights and measures.
::*science and religion will be reconciled and will harmoniously develop.
::*the press will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peoples.
::*the economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, and the distribution of its products will be equitably regulated.
::*national rivalries, hatreds, and intrigues will cease.
::*the causes of religious strife will be permanently removed.
::*economic barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes will be obliterated.
::*destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear.
::*an increase of human inventions, technical development, productivity, and scientific research.
::*the extermination of disease and the raising of the standard of physical health.
::*the sharpening and refinement of the human brain.
::*the prolongation of human life.
::*the furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race.
::*the gradual adoption of a vegetarian diet by the majority of mankind.

==Future Manifestation of God==
On [[Ridván]] 1863, the period in which Bahá'u'lláh made public his claim to have received a revelation from God, he stated that the next [[Manifestation of God]] will not appear before 1000 years have passed:&lt;ref name="Smith-manifestation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Manifestations of God |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"...ere the expiration of one thousand years whosoever advanceth a prophetic claim is false. By “year” a full year is intended, and no exegesis or interpretation is permitted in this matter."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[[Days of Remembrance]]'', section 9.

In the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' Bahá'u'lláh stated:
:"Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor. We pray God that He may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim. Should he repent, God will, no doubt, forgive him... Whosoever, interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and of His mercy..."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-4.html#pg32 Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'', 1873)

In a similar verse he says:
:"Should a man appear, ere the lapse of a full thousand years—each year consisting of twelve months according to the Qur’án, and of nineteen months of nineteen days each, according to the Bayán—and if such a man reveal to your eyes all the signs of God, unhesitatingly reject him!"
::(Bahá'u'lláh, quoted in ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-39.html#gr4 World Order of Bahá’u’lláh]'')

In the ''Ma’idiy-i-Asmani'', Bahá’u’lláh anticipates a different “proof ” for the next Manifestation of God:
:"...we have ordained that a proof other than the revelation of divine verses be produced to vindicate the truth of the next Manifestation."
::(Bahá'u'lláh, ''Ma'idiy-i-Asmani'', Vol. IV, 93.)&lt;ref&gt;Provisional translation quoted in: [[Bahiyyih Nakhjavani|Nakhjavani, Bahiyyih]]. [http://bahai-library.com/nakhjavani_silences_god Silences of God, The: A Meditation]. in Journal of Bahá'í Studies, 24:3-4 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Chaplain of His Holiness''' is a priest to whom the [[Pope]] has granted this title. They are addressed as [[Monsignor]] and have certain privileges with respect to ecclesiastical dress and vestments.&lt;ref name=English&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coat-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates] (31 March 1969), English translation published by the Vatican.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In accordance with the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Pontificalis Domus'' of 28 March 1968, those priests who had been called '''Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains''' continued to be part of the [[Papal Household]], under the new name of Chaplains of His Holiness. Lower ranks of Privy Chamberlains (Honorary Chamberlains of Purple Robes, Chamberlains ''extra Urbem'', Honorary Privy Chaplains, and Honorary Chaplains ''extra Urbem'') were abolished,&lt;ref name="Annuario"&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2012, p. 1853&lt;/ref&gt; making Chaplain of His Holiness the first (lowest) of the three ranks of Monsignor.

The role of Chaplain of His Holiness dates to the time of [[Pope Urban VIII]]. Such Chaplains have provided unpaid service since the pontificate of [[Pope Pius VI]]. The nomination of candidates ''extra urbem'' may be granted at the request of their bishop through the Apostolic Nunciature, subject to the examination of the merits of the person considered for this rank and to the criteria of the [[Holy See]]. Once the candidate has passed all the requirements, a rescript is drawn up by the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] attesting to their promotion to this ecclesiastical rank.&lt;ref name="Annuario"/&gt; The members of the [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] of one church in Rome and the cathedral in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] hold this title ''durante munere'', i.e., while holding that office.&lt;ref name="Annuario"/&gt; The title no longer expires but requires renewal on the death of the Pope who granted it.&lt;ref name="Annuario"/&gt;

'''Christian population growth''' is the [[population growth]] of the global [[Christianity by country|Christian community]]. According to a 2011 [[Pew Research Center]] survey, there were 2.19 billion [[Christians]] around the world in 2010, more than three times as much from the 600 million recorded in 1910, however this rate of growth is slower than the overall population growth over the same time period.&lt;ref name="pewforum1"/&gt; According to a 2015 [[Pew Research Center]] study, by 2050, the Christian population is expected to be 3.0 billion.&lt;ref name=PewProjections&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf  The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian fertility rate is 2.7 children per woman, which is higher than the global average fertility rate of 2.5. Globally, Christians were only slightly older (median age of 30) than the  global average median age of 28 in 2010. According to [[Pew Research]] religious switching is projected to have a modest impact on changes in the Christian population.&lt;ref name=FutureOfWorldReligions&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'', approximately 2.7&amp;nbsp;million converting to Christianity annually from another religion, ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'' also cited that Christianity rank at first place in net gains through religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=15 February 2001 |editor1=David B.

Christian fertility rate is 2.7 children per woman, which is higher than the global average fertility rate of 2.5. Globally, Christians were only slightly older (median age of 30) than the  global average median age of 28 in 2010.

 According to the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'', approximately 2.7&amp;nbsp;million converting to Christianity annually from another religion, ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'' also cited that Christianity rank at first place in net gains through religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=15 February 2001 |editor1=David B.

== Fertility rate ==
The Christian fertility rate has varied throughout history, as with other fertility figures. The Christian fertility rate also varies from country to country. In the 20-year period from 1989–2009, the average world [[fertility rate]] decreased from 3.50 to 2.58, a fall of 0.92 children per women, or 26%. The weighted average fertility rate for Christian nations decreased in the same period from 3.26 to 2.58, a fall of 0.68 children per women, or 21%. The weighted average fertility rate for Muslim nations decreased in the same period from 5.17 to 3.23, a fall of 1.94 children per women, or 38%. While Muslims have an average of 3.1 children per woman—the highest rate of all religious groups—Christians are second, with 2.7 children per woman.&lt;ref name=PewProjections/&gt;

The gap in fertility between the Christian- and Muslim-dominated nations fell from 67% in 1990 to 17% in 2010.  If the trend continues, the Muslim and Christian fertility rates will converge in around 2050.&lt;ref name=PewProjections/&gt;

{{See also|Convert to Christianity|List of people who converted to Christianity}}
*[[Pew Research]] estimates that 40 million people are expected to convert to Christianity between 2010-2050, and 106 million people are expected to leave Christianity during that period (resulting in a net loss of 66 million).&lt;ref name=FutureOfWorldReligions/&gt; This is in contrast to most other religions, including Islam and Hinduism, where the number converting in is roughly similar to the number converting out.&lt;ref name=FutureOfWorldReligions/&gt;
*According to the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'', approximately 2.7 million people convert to Christianity annually from another religion, with Christianity ranking first in net gains through religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=February 15, 2001 |editor1=David B.

* According to 2011 [[Pew Research Center]] survey, there are 2.18 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910.&lt;ref name="pewforum1"/&gt;
*  According to 2015 ''Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census study'' estimates 10,283,700 [[Muslim]] converted to Christianity around the world.&lt;ref name="Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background"/&gt;
*On April 2, 2015, the [[Pew Research Center]] published a Demographic Study about “The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050" with projections regarding Christianity.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/ World Religions Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050 (2015). Retrieved September 18, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; The projection begins with 2010 statistics when "Christianity was by far the world’s largest religion, with an estimated 2.2 billion adherents, nearly a third (31%) of all 6.9 billion people on Earth. Islam was second, with 1.6 billion adherents, or 23% of the global population.”&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt;

:'''Projected growth of Christianity by 2050'''
::Some of the projections are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/ World Religions Population :Growth Projections, 2010-2050 (2015). Retrieved September 18, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:# Over the 2010-2050 period, Christians will remain the [[Major religious groups#Largest religions|largest religious group]] with 34.1% of the world’s population. However, Islam will grow faster and become 29.7% of the world’s population. Therefore, by 2050 there will be 2.8 billion Muslims compared to 2.9 billion Christians.
:# “In the United States, Christians will decline from more than three-quarters of the population in 2010 to two-thirds in 2050.”
:# “Four out of every 10 Christians in the world will live in sub-Saharan Africa.”

:'''Reasons given for the projected growth'''
::Some of the reasons the Study gives are as follows:&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt;
:# The change in the world’s religious is “driven primarily by differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations among the world’s major religions, as well as by people switching faiths.”
:# ''Fertility rates''. “Religions with many adherents in developing countries, where birth rates are high, and infant mortality rates generally have been falling, are likely to grow quickly.” Therefore, much of the growth of Christianity is projected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, Christians have a birth rate of 2.7 children per woman. But Muslims have a higher rate, namely, an average of 3.1 children per woman. This differential is one of the reasons that the Muslim population is growing faster than the Christian.
:# ''Size of youth population''. “In 2010, more than a quarter of the world’s total population (27%) was under the age of 15.” Christian youth under 15 were the same as the 27% global average. But an even higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15. This higher youth population is one of the reasons that from 2010-2050 Muslims are projected to grow faster than Christians.
:# ''Size of old population''. In 2010, “11% of the world’s population was at least 60 years old,”  14% of the Christian population was over 60 years old, but only 7% of Muslims were over 60. This is another reason that Muslims are projected to grow faster than Christians.
:# ''Switching''. A loss of 66 million Christians is projected to come through switching. Most of the loss is projected to come from Christians “joining the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated.”

The United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the [[American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS)]] 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone [[statistical survey|survey]] of 54,461 American residential households in the [[contiguous United States]]. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.

Adult respondents were asked the [[open-ended question]], "What is your religion, if any?" Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was "Protestant" or "Christian" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.

Among the Asian population in the [[United States]], conversion into Christianity is significantly increasing among Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/07/19/asian-americans-a-mosaic-of-faiths-overview/|title=Asian Americans: A Mosaic of Faiths|date=2012-07-19|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the percentage of Christians in these communities was 71%, 31%, and 38% respectively.&lt;ref name="projects.pewforum.org"/&gt;

Data from the [[Pew Research Center]] states that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult [[American Jews]] identify themselves as [[Christians]], most as [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pew: portrait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt; According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as [[Judaism|Jew]] or are Jews by ancestry.&lt;ref name="pew: portrait" /&gt;

According to [[Pew Research]], Christianity loses more people than it gains from religious conversion. It found that 23% of Americans raised as Christians no longer identified with Christianity, whereas 6% of current Christians were converts.&lt;ref name=conversionOffset&gt;{{cite web|title=The share of Americans who leave Islam is offset by those who become Muslim|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/26/the-share-of-americans-who-leave-islam-is-offset-by-those-who-become-muslim/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[Islam in America]], where the number of people who leave the religion is roughly equal to the number who convert to it.&lt;ref name=conversionOffset/&gt; The [[National Catholic Register]] claims that in 2015 there were 450,000 [[Islam in the United States|American Muslim]] [[converts to Christianity]] and that 20,000 Muslims convert to Christianity annually in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/why-are-millions-of-muslims-becoming-christian/ Why Are Millions of Muslims Becoming Christian?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Highlights:'''&lt;ref name=ARIS2008 /&gt;
# The ARIS 2008 survey was carried out during February–November 2008 and collected answers from 54,461 respondents who were questioned in English or Spanish.
# The American population self-identifies as predominantly Christian but Americans are slowly becoming less Christian.
#* 86% of American adults identified as Christians in 1990 and 76% in 2008.
#* The historic Mainline churches and denominations have experienced the steepest declines while the non-denominational Christian identity has been trending upward particularly since 2001.
#* The challenge to Christianity in the United States does not come from other religions but rather from a rejection of all forms of organized religion.
# 34% of American adults considered themselves "Born Again or Evangelical Christians" in 2008.
# The U.S. population continues to show signs of becoming less religious, with one out of every seven Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008.
#* The "Nones" (no stated religious preference, atheist, or agnostic) continue to grow, though at a much slower pace than in the 1990s, from 8.2% in 1990, to 14.1% in 2001, to 15.0% in 2008.
#* Asian Americans are substantially more likely to indicate no religious identity than other racial or ethnic groups.
# One sign of the lack of attachment of Americans to religion is that 27% do not expect a religious funeral at their death.
# Based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious identification in 2008, 70% of Americans believe in a personal God, roughly 12% of Americans are atheist (no God) or agnostic (unknowable or unsure), and another 12% are deistic (a higher power but no personal God).
# America's religious geography has been transformed since 1990. Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has significantly changed the religious profile of some states and regions. Between 1990 and 2008, the Catholic population proportion of the New England states fell from 50% to 36% and in New York it fell from 44% to 37%, while it rose in California from 29% to 37% and in Texas from 23% to 32%.
# Overall the 1990–2008 ARIS time series shows that changes in religious self-identification in the first decade of the 21st century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s, which was a period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the United States.

'''David David-Weill''' (1871-1952) was a French-American banker, chairman of Lazard Frères in Paris, who built an important collection of art.  His collection was plundered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] during the Second World War and over 2000 items seized. He was a major donor to French and American museums and galleries and a benefactor to universities.

==Early life and family==
David-Weill was born in San Francisco on 30 August 1871.&lt;ref name=dumb&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/resources/bliss-tyler-correspondence/annotations/david-david-weill David David-Weill.] Dumbarton Oaks. Retrieved 10 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Julie (née Cahn) and [[:fr:Alexandre Weill (banquier)]] (1834-1906). His father was a cousin to the three French Jewish brothers who founded [[Lazard Frères &amp; Co.]]. His parents had left France in 1870 because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and settled in California, where [[Raphael Weill]], a brother of Alexandre Weill lived. They returned to France about 1883. David-Weill continued his education there at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] and the [[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]. He married Flora Raphael in 1897 and they had seven children, including [[Pierre David-Weill]] and [[Jean David-Weill]].

==Banking career==
Following his education, David-Weill performed his military service and began to work at Lazard Frères, where he rose to become chairman. He became regent of the [[Banque de France]] in 1935.

==Collecting==
David-Weill began to collect from an early age. His acquisitions included paintings, drawings, miniatures, sculpture, furniture, silverware and other items. He became president of the council of French national museums and vice president of the Friends of the Louvre.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt;

His collection was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War and, according to German records, 2687 items seized.&lt;ref name=Harc&gt;Harclerode, Peter, &amp; Brendan Pittaway. (1999) ''The Lost Masters: The Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses''. London: [[Victor Gollancz]], p. 44. {{ISBN|0575052546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life he donated more than 2000 items to museums and galleries, including the [[Guimet Museum]], the [[Louvre]], and universities at New York, Hamburg, Leiden, Honolulu, and Stockholm. He donated to the libraries of the Museum of Man and the National Institute of Art History, to which he gave the manuscript and journal of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. He gave his Chinese bronzes to the [[Musée Guimet]], and his  [[cloisonné]] objects to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt;

==Death==
David-Weill died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on 7 July 1952.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt; Parts of his collection were sold in a series of auctions in 1970.

==Honours==
[[File:P1110765 Paris XIV avenue David-Weill rwk.JPG|thumbnail|Avenue David-Weill, Paris.]]
*David-Weill was elected to the [[Académie des beaux-arts]] in 1934.
*Avenue David-Weill in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]] was named in his honour in 1960 in tribute to his involvement with the [[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris]].

{{Jainism}}
A '''Deshna''' is a type of religious speech in [[Prakrit]]. According to [[Jainism]], after a [[Tirthankara]] gains infinite knowledge, in his honor, the heavenly beings create a place called  [[samavasarana]], where all creatures are welcomed (including non-human creatures, humans, and angels) for Tirthankara's speech. This speech is understood by everyone in their own languages. These types of speeches are known as deshnas.

{{nihongo|'''Gyobutsuji Zen Monastery'''|行仏寺|gyōbutsu-ji}} is a small [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]] near [[Kingston, Madison County, Arkansas|Kingston]] in [[Madison County, Arkansas|Madison County]], [[Arkansas]] in the [[United States]]. It is located in the [[Boston Mountains]] of the [[Ozarks]]. The temple focuses primarily on the practice of [[zazen]] in the tradition of [[Kosho Uchiyama]] and [[Shohaku Okumura]], the latter being the teacher of the founder, [[Shōryū Bradley]]. Study of the writings of [[Eihei Dōgen]] and the teachings of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] are also emphasized. The monastery holds a five-day [[sesshin]] every month except in January and August.&lt;ref name=sotonet&gt;{{Citation| title = Gyobutsuji| publisher = Sotoshu Shumucho| date =| year =| url = http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/temples/outside_jp/America/048.html| accessdate = 2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Gyōbutsu-ji literally means 'Practice Buddha Temple' and is derived from [[Eihei Dōgen]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] the [[Shōbōgenzō]], specifically the chapter titled [[Gyōbutsu igi]] (行仏威儀).&lt;ref name=sotonet/&gt; While the standard [[Classical Chinese]] interpretation of this title is "practice Buddha's dignified actions", Dōgen re-interpreted it as "dignified actions of the Practice Buddha" in line with his assertion that [[Bhavana|practice]] and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] are the same. The chapter explains:

{{quote|text=All buddhas without exception fully practice dignified conduct: this [practice] is Practice Buddha.  ... Sharing one corner of the Buddha's dignified conduct is done together with the entire universe, the great earth, and with the entire coming-and-going of life-and-death. ... This is nothing other than the dignified conduct of the oneness of Practice and Buddha.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7547">[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Nacht 001.jpg|right|thumb|During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]    
(c. 2040–1640 BCE) blind harpists are depicted on tomb walls.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; The ancient Egyptians were not exclusively interested in the causes and cures for blindness but also the social care of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;"''The history of special education''", Margret A. Winzer", p. 463, Gallaudet University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|1-56368-018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Harper's Songs''' are [[ancient Egyptian]] texts that originated in tomb inscriptions of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (but found on papyrus texts until the [[Papyrus Harris 500]] of the [[New Kingdom]]) which in the main praise life after death and were often used in funerary contexts. These songs display varying degrees of hope in an afterlife that range from the skeptical through to the more traditional expressions of confidence.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1976, p. 115"&gt;Lichtheim, 1976, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; These texts are accompanied by drawings of blind harpists and are therefore thought to have been sung.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;''"[[Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs]]"'', [[James P. Allen]], p343, Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-77483-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematically they have been compared with [[The Immortality of Writers]] in their expression of rational skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, 1976, p. 175-178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The distinction between songs, hymns and poetry in Ancient Egyptian texts is not always clear. The convention is to treat as songs those poetic texts which are depicted with musical instruments. If the songs are seen to have a clear connection with temple cults and festivals then they are commonly described as hymns.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193"&gt;Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Poetic texts which are found in some tombs which are shown with scenes of labor are compared with songs sung by Egyptian laborers in the modern era and are also therefore classified as songs. Other songs relate to the cult of the dead and are nearly always depicted with harps from which the title "Harper's Songs" is derived.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193"/&gt; Since the songs are reflections on death, rather than being part of the rituals associated with burial, freer expression of thoughts is encountered in these texts. Songs sought to reassure the owner of the tomb about his fate after death by way of praise.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193"/&gt; The greater freedom, in the case Harper's Song from the Tomb of King Intef, even went so far as to doubt the reality of an afterlife, lamenting death and advising that life should be enjoyed whilst it could.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193"/&gt; [[Miriam Lichtheim]] viewed this as introducing a more skeptical strand of thought which would be reflected in works such as the ''[[Dispute between a man and his Ba|Dispute between a Man and His Ba]]'' and other Harper's Songs.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193"/&gt;

== Middle Kingdom ==
The short song from the funerary stela of Iki is depicted with the deceased sitting at an offering table with his wife and the rotund harpist Neferhotep sitting in front of them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O tomb, you were built for festivity,&lt;br /&gt;
You were founded for happiness!&lt;br /&gt;
The singer Neferhotep, born of Henu.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 194"&gt;Lichtheim, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The stela of [[Nebankh]] from Abydos contains a Harper's Song with the deceased shown seated at the offering table with the harpist squatting in front of him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The singer Tjeniaa says:&lt;br /&gt;
How firm you are in your seat of eternity,&lt;br /&gt;
Your monument of everlastingness!&lt;br /&gt;
It is filled with offerings of food,&lt;br /&gt;
It contains every good thing.&lt;br /&gt;
Your [[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]] is with you,&lt;br /&gt;
It does not leave you,&lt;br /&gt;
O Royal Seal-Bearer, Great Steward, Nebankha!&lt;br /&gt;
Yours is the sweet breath of the northwind!&lt;br /&gt;
So says his singer who keeps his name alive,&lt;br /&gt;
The honorable singer Tjeniaa, whom he loved,&lt;br /&gt;
Who sings to his ka every day.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1975, p. 194"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A song from the tomb of Paatenemheb, which dates from the reign of [[Akhenaten]], is described in its introductory line as having been copied from the tomb of a King Intef, (a name used by several kings from 11th and 17th dynasties) It is also preserved in the Ramesside New Kingdom Harris 500 papyrus. These works are accepted by scholars as being a copy of a genuine Middle Kingdom text.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, 1975, pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt; The song suggests a person should enjoy the good things in life, avoid contemplation of death and expresses doubt about the reality of an afterlife. &lt;blockquote&gt;
Make holiday, don't weary of it!!&lt;br /&gt;
Look, there is no one allowed to take their things with them,&lt;br /&gt; 
and there is no one who goes away comes back again.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Comparison have been made between the sentiments expressed in the above text with a description by Herodotus from a much later period of how a banquet for the rich in Egypt would culminate with a wooden effigy of the deceased being passed around with the saying ''"Look upon this!"'' and ''"drink and rejoice, for thou shalt be as this."''&lt;ref&gt;"Egyptian Literature", Ed. Epiphanius Wilson, Trans. Ludwig Stern, p. 347, Colonial Press, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

Harpers Songs from the New Kingdom period respond to the rational skepticism displayed in this song  by way of outright rejection of impiety or by moderating the skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, 1975, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Kingdom ==
In the case of the priest Neferhotep the three Harper's songs found in his tomb display a full range of viewpoints. In one the sceptical position is blended with the more conventional expressions of hope, the second rejects skepticism, whilst the third is a ritualistic affirmation in life after death.&lt;ref name="Lichtheim, 1976, p. 115"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have heard those songs that are in the ancient tombs,&lt;br /&gt;
And what they tell&lt;br /&gt;
Extolling life on earth and belittling the region of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;
Wherefore do they thus, concerning the land of eternity,&lt;br /&gt;
The just and the fair,&lt;br /&gt;
Which has no terrors?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Wrangling is its abhorrence; no man there girds himself against his fellow.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a land against which none can rebel.&lt;br /&gt;
All our kinsfolk rest within it, since the earliest day of time;&lt;br /&gt;
The offspring of millions are come hither, every one.&lt;br /&gt;
For none may tarry in the land of Egypt,&lt;br /&gt;
None there is who has not passed yonder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The span of earthly things is as a dream;&lt;br /&gt;
But a fair welcome is given him who has reached the West.&lt;ref&gt;"Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs", [[Barbara Mertz]], translation by [[Alan H. Gardiner]],p. 117, BCA edition 1978, org pub 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Integral Yoga''' is a system of Yoga that synthesizes six branches of classical Yoga philosophy and practice: Hatha, Raja, Bhakti, Karma, Jnana, and Japa Yoga. It was brought to the West from India by Sri Swami [[Satchidananda Saraswati]]. Its aim is to integrate body, mind, and spirit by combining physical practices and philosophical approaches to life in order to develop the physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of individuals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Anjali, P. (2005). Boundless Giving: The Life and Service of Sri Swami Satchidananda (A Commemorative) (Vol. 1). Integral Yoga Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The system includes the practices of [[asana]], [[pranayama]], and [[meditation]] as a way to develop physical and mental stillness in order to access inner peace and joy, which Swami Satchidananda believed was a person's true nature. It also encourages practitioners to live service-oriented lives.&lt;ref&gt;Satchidananda, Swami. "What Is Integral Yoga?" Yogaville. Integral Yoga International. Web. &lt;http://www.Yogaville.org/integral-Yoga/about-integral-Yoga/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integral Yoga is also based on interfaith understanding. Swami Satchidananda taught that all religions share essential universal principles and encouraged Integral Yogis to respect and honor the unity in diversity, summarized by his motto, "Truth is one, paths are many." &lt;ref&gt;Satchidananda, S. (n.d.). LOTUS: The Truth is One. Retrieved from http://lotus.org/lotus-truth-is-one/&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a religion, but a combination of teachings that form the foundation of spiritual practice. Its branches are not hierarchical in nature; practitioners can find a combination of practices that suits their individual needs.

Classes in all facets of Integral Yoga are taught at Integral Yoga Institutes, Integral Yoga Teaching Centers around the world, and its headquarters, Satchidananda Ashram–[[Yogaville]], in Buckingham, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;De Sachy, Kumari. "Yogaville.org" About Yogaville. Integral Yoga International. Web. 15 May 2015. &lt;Yogaville.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Teachings of Integral Yoga ==
The main practices of Integral Yoga focus on restoring the ease and peace of the body and mind. Swami Satchidananda said that "dis-ease"—the disturbance of one's natural ease—is the cause of disease, so prevention and restoration are the hallmarks of Integral Yoga practices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Sri Swami Satchidananda's Founding Principles===

{{quotation | The Goal of Integral Yoga, According to Swami Satchidananda: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal of Integral Yoga, and the birthright of every individual, is to realize the spiritual unity behind all the diversities in the entire creation and to live harmoniously as members of one universal family. This goal is achieved by maintaining our natural condition of a body of optimum health and strength, senses under total control, a mind well-disciplined, clear and calm, an intellect as sharp as a razor, a will as strong and pliable as steel, a heart full of unconditional love and compassion, an ego as pure as a crystal, and a life filled with Supreme Peace and Joy.&lt;/blockquote&gt; }}

The teachings of Integral Yoga are rooted in the system of Yoga formalized by the sage [[Patanjali]] in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref&gt;Integral Yoga: About. (n.d.). Retrieved May 6, 2015, from www.integralYoga.org/about&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational teachings include moral and ethical precepts ([[yama]] and [[niyama]]), which include non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, moderation, non-greed, purity, contentment, self-discipline, spiritual study, and leading a dedicated or selfless life.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, Satchidananda. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. 2012. ii-17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Integral Yoga synthesizes the following six branches of classical Yoga.

===The Six Branches of Integral Yoga===

* '''Hatha Yoga''', which combines physical postures (or [[asanas]]) with breath work (pranayama), and deep relaxation. A [[vegetarian]] diet and abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, and/or other stimulants that disrupt the body's natural state are part of this physical component. Swami Satchidananda emphasized that the Yoga asanas should be "steady and comfortable." Therefore, Integral Yoga practitioners are encouraged to avoid over-exertion and to take periods of rest and relaxation during their practice, allowing for a more meditative flow.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, Satchidananda. To Know Your Self. 2008. 65-85. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Integral_Yoga_Hatha.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|alt=An Integral Yoga Hatha course |A swami leads an Integral Yoga hatha course at the Satchidananda Ashram in Yogaville.]]

* '''Raja Yoga''' is the path of meditation and self-discipline, based on ethical principles. Practicing the eight limbs of Yoga described in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali helps to strengthen and harmonize all aspects of the individual, culminating in Self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;Karunananda, S. (n.d.). Raja Yoga: The Nature of the Mind. Retrieved September 14, 2015, from http://www.Yogaville.org/2013/04/raja-Yoga-the-nature-of-the-mind/&lt;/ref&gt;   The Yoga Sutras offer detailed guidance on how to practice. In the Integral Yoga tradition, these teachings are not just for philosophical contemplation, but are seen as tools for transformation. Swami Satchidananda encouraged his students to implement them in daily life, explaining that, "The teachings of Raja Yoga are a golden key to unlock all health, happiness, peace, and joy." &lt;ref&gt;Swami, Satchidananda. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. 2012. 57-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bhakti Yoga,''' the practice that focuses on cultivating love and devotion toward God, is another pillar of Integral Yoga. Swami Satchidananda's teachings draw references for Bhakti Yoga from the Bhagavad Gita&lt;ref&gt;Swami, S. (1988). The Living Gita: The Complete Bhagavad Gita - A Commentary for Modern Readers (8, 9.34 and 18.55).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,&lt;ref&gt;Swami, Satchidananda. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. 2012. 57-69. (9, Sutra I.23; II.45). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which assert that total love and surrender to God would aid the practitioner on the path to enlightenment.  In the Integral Yoga tradition, Bhakti Yoga is practiced in many ways. Common practices include kirtan (a form of call-and-response chanting), prayer, puja (worship), and "constant remembrance of the divine". The Integral Yogi finds these devotional practices to be external expressions of an internal attitude of surrender, or releasing the ego's selfish wanting.&lt;ref&gt;Satchidananda, Swami. "Yogaville.org/2012/02/bhakti-Yoga." Yogaville. Integral Yoga International. Web. 15 May 2015. &lt;Yogaville.org/2012/02/bhakti-Yoga&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Karma Yoga'''  Swami Satchidananda defined Karma Yoga as the act of selfless service. The Integral Yoga tradition views Karma Yoga as a form of meditation in action. It is the Yoga of selfless serving—giving without expecting anything in return; thinking of the actions themselves as an offering to the divine or to all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Maze, K. (2014, May 1). Karma Yoga: At Your Selfless Service. Retrieved July 1, 2015, from http://www.yogaville.org/2014/12/karma-Yoga-at-your-selfless-service/&lt;/ref&gt; In the Integral Yoga tradition, Karma Yoga is a central practice. Swami Satchidananda taught that the key to happiness is being of service to others. His motto was "The dedicated ever enjoy supreme peace and joy. Therefore, live only to serve." &lt;ref&gt;Satchidananda, S. (n.d.). The Greatness of Karma Yoga. Retrieved September 14, 2015, from http://www.Yogaville.org/2012/02/the-greatness-of-karma-Yoga/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jnana Yoga''' is also called the path of wisdom in the Integral Yoga tradition. Through study, analysis, and the cultivation of greater awareness, practitioners strive to cease to identify with their bodies and minds and realize the unchanging "witness" within. Swami Satchidananda stated that this understanding is the essence of Jnana yoga. To attain this awareness, Integral Yogis practice reflection and self-inquiry, (the main practices of Jnana Yoga), both of which can be forms of meditation. Reflection means that a part of the mind stands back and observes; this part of the mind is referred to as the witness. Self-inquiry in Jnana Yoga is a more direct questioning of  "Who am I?"—a practice aimed at aiding a practitioner in experiencing his or her true identity.&lt;ref&gt;Jnana Yoga: Who am I? A Talk by Sri Swami Satchidananda [Motion picture on DVD]. (1994). Integral Yoga Multimedia.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Japa Yoga''' Swami Satchidananda advised his students that Japa Yoga (or [[mantra]] repetition) is one of the easiest and most effective direct approaches to developing a successful meditation practice. When one utilizes a mantra, that mantra represents and invokes in one's system a particular aspect of the "cosmic vibration."&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, S. (n.d.). Japa Yoga. Retrieved September 14, 2015, from http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/japaYoga.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Satchidananda explained that mantras don't have to have personal meaning—anything that calms and uplifts the mind when repeated could be considered mantra. However, he also suggested that selected mantras, given through an initiation, could be beneficial, "like a prescription signed by a doctor."&lt;ref&gt;Swami, Satchidananda. To Know Your Self. 2008. 129-131. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proliferation of Integral Yoga in the West ==

===Integral Yoga in the West===
In 1966, filmmaker [[Conrad Rooks]] invited Swami Satchidananda to visit Europe.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Anjali, P. (n.d.). The Milestones of Sri Swami Satchidananda. Retrieved from http://swamisatchidananda.org/milestones-of-swami-satchidananda/&lt;/ref&gt;  During this visit, he was invited to give talks and classes at Divine Life Societies throughout Europe. He returned to Europe thereafter, having received invitations to speak on Integral Yoga at Yoga conferences, at Yoga centers, and to serve as an advisor to Yoga organizations.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Anjali, P. (Director). (2007). Living Yoga [Motion picture on DVD]. Integral Yoga Multimedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integral Yoga in America, 1960s-2000s===
During the first European visit, Pop artist [[Peter Max]] consulted with Rooks and then suggested that Swami Satchidananda visit America on his return to the East. A two-day visit led to an extended stay in order to teach Integral Yoga to American students.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[File:Swami opening.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Swami Satchidananda opening the Woodstock Music and Art Festival.|Swami Satchidananda opening the Woodstock Music and Art Festival.]]

On October 7, 1966, the first Integral Yoga Institute was founded on the Upper West Side of New York City. There, Swami Satchidananda, and some of his newly trained students began leading classes for the general public in Hatha, meditation, breath work, and stress management.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In August 1968, a group of students took up residence in an apartment in the 500 West End Avenue building to immerse themselves in the yogic lifestyle, forming the first Integral Yoga ashram.

Swami Satchidananda's students in New York City planned and organized a public lecture on Integral Yoga for him to deliver at [[Carnegie Hall]]. There, a sold-out Hatha demonstration and lecture took place in January 1969.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Later that year in August, Swami Satchidananda was invited to give the invocation at the opening of the [[Woodstock Music and Art Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas (21 August 2002). "Swami Satchidananda, Woodstock Guru, Dies at 87". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Swami Satchidananda's weekly lectures on Integral Yoga moved to the Universalist Church on Central Park West, as crowds became larger. Finally, in 1970, a large building in New York's West Village was purchased, which continues to be the site of the Integral Yoga Institute today.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The members of the Institute opened New York's first vegetarian food store, Integral Yoga Natural Foods, in 1972. It remains the only all-vegetarian health food store in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Integral Yoga Natural Foods: A History. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://integralyoganaturalfoods.com/History.html&lt;/ref&gt;

More Integral Yoga Institutes, teaching centers, and ashrams opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s across America. In 1975, Integral Yoga established one of the first Yoga teacher training certification programs and, in 1999, joined with other US-based Yoga lineages to form the [[Yoga Alliance]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Controversies==

Some followers criticised the founder for sexual misconduct and protested against him at [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=WILLIAM J. BROAD |title=Yoga and Sex Scandals: No Surprise Here |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/health/nutrition/yoga-fans-sexual-flames-and-predictably-plenty-of-scandal.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sonia Chopra |title=Satchidananda's Yoga Ashram Caught Up In A New Controversy, Past Sexual Charges Begin Resurfing |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jun/14us.htm |publisher= Rediff |language=EN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integral Yoga Ashrams and Yogaville==

===The First Integral Yoga Ashrams ===
In 1972, many people attending programs at the Integral Yoga centers and institutes in America expressed interest in developing residential Yoga communities, or [[ashrams]]. Yogaville West, the first Satchidananda Ashram was located in [[Seigler Springs]], California. In 1973, a second ashram opened in Pomfret, Connecticut, which became the headquarters for the Integral Yoga organization.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Satchidananda Ashram–Yogaville (VA)===
In 1980, due to severe winters, Swami Satchidananda closed the Connecticut ashram and moved the community to Buckingham, Virginia. Satchidananda Ashram–Yogaville, serves as Integral Yoga's world headquarters and is home to the Light Of Truth Universal Shrine (LOTUS). As of 2015, around 220 people lived permanently in Yogaville, and 2,000 to 3,000 guests were visiting each year. Yogaville operates as a residential spiritual community, Yoga retreat and programs center, and as a Yoga training center, offering teacher trainings, workshops, vegetarian cooking courses, and programs designed around the teachings of Integral Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;"About Yogaville." Yogaville. Integral Yoga International, 2012. Web. &lt;http://www.yogaville.org/about&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integral Yoga Academy ===
Located on the grounds of Satchidananda Ashram—Yogaville, the Integral Yoga Academy is a training center that offers certification courses in Hatha Yoga and therapeutic Yoga, as well as continuing education courses for health care professionals. This academy operates year-round, offering residential programs that encourage students to immerse themselves in a "yogic lifestyle" based on the teachings of Integral Yoga.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;"The Integral Yoga Academy." Yogaville. Integral Yoga International, 2012. Web. &lt;http://www.yogaville.org/Yoga-teacher-training/integral-Yoga-academy/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integral Yoga Applications in Healthcare===
Integral Yoga provides a methodology for the prevention and rehabilitation of a wide range of health concerns. The integrated approach of Integral Yoga can be used to address specific issues such as pain management, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression, arthritis, asthma, heart disease, backache, hypertension, and various types of mobility-related health challenges promoting optimal health and wellness.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Numerous students of Swami Satchidananda have developed successful applications of therapeutic Yoga based on the wellness foundations of Integral Yoga. One of the most well-researched applications is Dr. Dean Ornish's program for preventing and reversing heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ornish, D. (n.d.). Yoga and Healthy Lifestyle: Dr. Dean Ornish's Latest Cancer Study. Integral Yoga Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs such as Sonia Sumar's Yoga for the Special Child, Nischala Devi's Yoga for the Heart, Mala Cunningham's Cardiac Yoga, Jnani Chapman's Yoga Therapy in Cancer and Chronic Illness, and Jivana Heyman's Accessible Yoga are a few further examples of such therapeutic applications.&lt;ref&gt;About Sonia Sumar.

{{Jainism}}
'''Jainism''' and '''Hinduism''' are two ancient Indian religions. There are some similarities and differences between the two religions.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=135-136}} Temples, gods, rituals, fasts and other religious components of Jainism are different from those of Hinduism.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=138}}

"Jain" is derived from the word ''Jina'', referring to a human being who has conquered all inner passions (like anger, attachment, greed and pride) and possesses [[Kevala Jnana]] (pure infinite knowledge). Followers of the path shown by the Jinas are called Jains.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} Followers of Hinduism are called Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism|title=Hinduism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical similarities and differences ==
Jainism and Hinduism have many similar characteristic features, including the concepts of ''[[samsara]]'', ''[[karma]]'' and ''[[moksha]]''. However, they differ over the precise nature and meaning of these concepts. The doctrine of Jainism has minor similarities with the Nyaya-Vaisheshika and samkhya school. The Jain doctrine teaches atomism which is also found in the Vaisheshika system and atheism which is found in Samkhya.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=496}} Within the doctrine of Jainism, there exist many metaphysical concepts which are not known in Hinduism, some of which are ''dharma'' and Adharma tattva (which are seen as substances within the Jain metaphysical system), [[Gunasthana]]s and [[Lesya]]s.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=496}} The epistemological concepts of [[Anekantavada]] and Syadvada are not found in the Hindu system. There were, in the past, attempts made to merge the concepts of Hindu gods and the Tirthankara of Jainism. The cosmography of Hindus resembles that of the Jains and there are similar names of heavenly gods within these systems.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}}

In the [[Upanishads]], there also occur the first statements of the view, dominant in Jainist teachings and elsewhere, that rebirth is undesirable and that it is possible by controlling or stopping one's actions to put an end to it and attain a state of deliverance (moksha) which lies beyond action.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=15}}

===Moksha (liberation) ===
In Hinduism, [[moksha]] means merging of soul with universal soul or eternal being and escaping the cycle of births and deaths; in Jainism, it is action-less and peaceful existence. In Vedic philosophy or Sanatana Dharma, salvation is giving up the sense of being a doer and realizing Self to be the same as Universe and God.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In Jainism, salvation can be achieved only through self-effort and is considered to be the right of human beings.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}

In Jainism, one definite path to attain liberation ([[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]) is prescribed. The prescribed threefold path consists of the [[Ratnatraya|three jewels of Jainism]] (Right belief, Right knowledge, Right conduct). In Hinduism, no one definite path to salvation is prescribed.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p = 137}}

=== Universe ===
{{Further information|Jainism and non-creationism}}
According to [[Jain cosmology]], the universe is eternal, it is neither created nor it can be destroyed. In Hinduism, it is believed to by a creator, and destroyed by God, to be created again. {{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}

=== Karma ===
{{further information|Karma in Jainism|Karma in Hinduism}}
Karma is an invisible force in Hinduism, whereas in Jainism it is a form of matter which can stick to the soul.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}

=== Worship ===
In Hinduism, Gods are worshiped in several ways and for several reasons such as knowledge, peace, wisdom, health, and it also believed to be one's duty to pray god as God is considered as our maker (as we originated from them and we are staying in them and at last will merge with them), for moksham (by attaining moksham we can join him and escape this Maya or dualistic nature which makes us think that we are different from the universal soul) and are also offered food as a respect, etc.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=181}} In Jainism, the [[Tirthankara]]s represent the true goal of all human beings,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}} their qualities are worshiped by the Jains.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Women ==
The religion of Jains included women in their fourfold ''sangha''; the religious order of Jain laymen, laywomen, monks and nuns.{{sfn|Balbir|p=121}} There was a disagreement between early Hinduism, and ascetic movements such as Jainism with the scriptural access to women.{{sfn|Balbir|p=121}} However, the early svetambara scriptures prevented pregnant women, young women or those who have a small child, to enter to the ranks of nun.{{sfn|Balbir|p=122}} Regardless, the number of nuns given in those texts were always double the number of monks. [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]], the two historical teachers of Jainism, had large numbers of female devotees and ascetics.{{sfn|Balbir|p=122}} Tirthankara Mahavira and Jain monks are credited with raising the [[status of women]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=147-148}}

== Religious texts ==
Hindus do not accept any Jain text and Jains do not recognize any Hindu scripture.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=136}}

=== The Vedas ===
The scriptures known as [[Vedas]] are regarded by Hindus as one of the foundations of [[Hinduism]]. Those who rejected the Vedas as the prime source of religious knowledge were labeled "[[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika]]".{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} As a consequence, Jainism and Buddhism were categorized as ''nāstika [[darśana]]''.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

The orthodox schools of Hinduism, such as [[Vedanta]], [[Mimamsa]] and [[Samkhya]], claim the [[Sruti]] do not have any author and hence are supreme to other religious scriptures. This position was countered by Jains who said that saying Vedas are authorless was equivalent to saying that anonymous poems are written by nobody. [[Jain scriptures]], on the contrary, were believed by them to be of human origin, brought through omniscient teachers, and hence claimed greater worth.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}} According to Jains, the origin of Vedas lies with [[Marichi]], the son of [[Bharata Chakravarti]], who was the son of the first Tirthankara Rishabha. Jains maintain that these scriptures were later modified.{{sfn|Feynes|p=xxiv}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|p=497}} Jains pointed that Hindus do not know their own scriptures since they were unaware of the names of tirthankaras present in Vedas.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}}

Jains had a long-standing debate with [[Mimamsa]] school of Hinduism. [[Kumarila Bhatta]], a proponent of Mimamsa school, argued that the Vedas are the source of all knowledge and it is through them that humans can differentiate between right and wrong. Jain monks, such as [[Haribhadra]], held that humans are already in possession of all the knowledge, which only needs to be illuminated or uncovered in order to gain the status of omniscience.{{sfn|Olle|2006|p=91}}

==== Vedic sacrifices ====
The practice of Vedic animal sacrifices was opposed by Jains.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}} [[Hemachandra]], a Jain monk, cites passages from [[Manusmriti]], one of the law book of Hindus, to demonstrate how, in light of false scriptures, Hindus have resorted to violence. [[Akalanka]], another Jain monk, sarcastically said that if killing can result in enlightenment, one should become a hunter or fisherman.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}}

===Hindu epics and Jain counter epics===
The rejection of Hindu epics and scriptures were dominant in Jainism since very early times.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}} The central Hindu scriptures and epics like Vedas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are categorized as false scriptures in Nandi-sutra,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=237}}{{Verify source|date=December 2013}}{{sfn|Iyengar|p=62}} one of the svetambara's canonical literature. Later, Jains adapted various Hindu epics in accordance with their own system.{{sfn|Schubring|p=17}}{{sfn|Jaini|p=305}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|p=497}} There were disputes between Jains and Hindus in form of these epics.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Jains and Hindu Gods ==
{{see also|Rama in Jainism|Rishabha (Hinduism)}}
Within the doctrine of Jainism, the ''tirthankara'' holds the highest status. Hemachandra says that a ''deva'' (roughly god) is the one who has conquered his internal desires and passions. This requirement, according to him, was fulfilled only by the tirthankara. The gods of Hindus are considered worldly having desires for women and weapons. Hence their path for spiritual upliftment and salvation is rejected by the [[Jains]].

Some personage mentioned in the Vedas and Jain scriptures are same. There is mention of the first tirthankara, [[Rishabhanatha]] in [[Rig Veda]] and Vishnu Purana. Rig Veda, X. 12. 166 states{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=74}}- {{cquote|0 Rudra-like Divinity ! do thou produce amongst us, of high descent, a Great God, like Rishabha Deva, by becoming Arhan, which is the epithet of the first World Teacher; let Him become the destroyer of the enemies !}}

Vishnu Purāna mentions:
:ऋषभो मरुदेव्याश्च ऋषभात भरतो भवेत्
:भरताद भारतं वर्षं, भरतात सुमतिस्त्वभूत्
:Rishabha was born to Marudevi, Bharata was born to Rishabh,
:Bharatavarsha (India) arose from Bharata, and Sumati arose from Bharata.
::—Vishnu Purana (2,1,31)

In the [[Skanda Purana]] (chapter 37) it is stated that "Rishabha was the son of [[Nabhiraja]], and Rishabha had a son named Bharata, and after the name of this Bharata, this country is known as Bharata-varsha."{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=106}}

In the "Brahmottara-candam" section of the ''[[Brahma Purana]]'', the narrator Suta describes many matters relating to Shaivism and in the 16th portion, there is a story about Bhadrabahu receiving instructions in a mantra from Rishabha yogi.&lt;ref&gt;P. 88, ''Madras Journal of Literature and Science'', Volume 11 By Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Linga Purana'' mentions that in every kali yuga, Lord Shiva has incarnated, and that in one kali yuga he was a Yogeshwara (one of His 28 incarnations) named Rishabha.&lt;ref&gt;P. 16 ''Linga Purana'' By Vinay. The list is in order is: Shweta, Sutara, Madana, Suhotra, Kanchana, Lokakshee, Jagishavya, Dadhivahana, Rishabha, Muni, Ugra, Atri, Vali, Gautama, Vedashrira, Gokarna, Guhavasi, Shikhandabhriti, Jatamali, Attahasa, Daruka, Langali, Mahakaya, Shuli, Mundishvara, Sahishnu, Somasharma, and Jagadguru.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jainism is considered by some to be distinct from Vedic religion and from a pre-Aryan tradition viz. ''Sramana'' or ''Aarahata'' tradition.{{sfn|George|2008|p=317-318}}

===Ancient===
Jains and Hindus have coexisted in [[Tamilakam|Tamil country]] since at least the second century BCE.{{sfn|John E. Cort|1998|p=187}}

===Medieval===
Competition between Jains and [[Brahman]]s, between Jains and [[Shaiva]]s, is a frequent motif of all medieval western Indian narratives, but the two communities for the most part coexisted and coprospered.{{sfn|John E. Cort|1998|p=87}} Shaiva kings patronised Jain mendicants, and Jain officials patronised Brahmana poets.{{sfn|John E. Cort|1998|p=87}}

===Decline of Jainism===
Around the 8th century CE, Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara|Ādi Śaṅkarācārya]] tried to restore the Vedic religion. Śaṅkarācārya brought forward the doctrine of Advaita. The Vaishnavism and Shaivism also began to rise. This was particularly in the southern Indian states.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=70}}

According to a Saivite legend, the Pandya king [[Koon Pandiyan]] ordered a massacre of 8,000 Jain monks. This event is depicted graphically in walls of Tivatur in [[North Arcot]].{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|pp=70–71}} However, this legend is not found in any Jain text, and is believed to be a fabrication made up by the Saivites to prove their dominance.&lt;ref name="Ashim1984"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ashim Kumar Roy | title=A history of the Jainas | url=http://www.jainworld.com/book/historyofjainism/ch9a.asp | accessdate=22 May 2013 | year=1984 | publisher=Gitanjali | chapter = 9. History of the Digambaras}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nilakantha1976"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[K. A.

==Jains and the Hindu society==
{{POV section|date=September 2015}}

Jain scholars and some monks in general allowed a sort of cautious integration with the Hindu society.{{sfn|Jaini|p=287}} In today's date, there are a lot of common aspects in social and cultural life of Hindus and Jains. It is quite difficult to differentiate a lay Jain from a lay Hindu.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=493}} The Jain code of conduct is quite similar to that which is found in Hindu Dharmasashtra, Manusmriti and other Law books of Brahmans.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} Many Jains now worship Hindu gods and celebrate Hindu festivals.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}}{{sfn|Babb|pp=3-4}} The difference in the rituals of practitioners of the two religions would be that the Jains do not give any importance to bathing in holy water, cremating or burying ascetics.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} According to religious scholar M. Whitney Kelting, some of the "names and narratives" in the Hindu's list of satis are also found in the Jain tradition.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} In the Hindu context, a sati is a virtuous wife who protects her husband and his family and has the "intention to die before, or with," her husband.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} Kelting notes that those satis who die on the funeral pyre of their husband, or who "intended to die" but were prevented from death, may attain a status called satimata.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}}{{sfn|Keilting|2009|p=22}} Kelting says that the Jain tradition, due to principle of non-violence and equanimity, doesn't allow self-immolation.{{sfn|Keilting|2009|p=21}}{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} They, instead, see renunciation rather than self-sacrifice as the highest ideal for a Jain sati.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} Hindus think Jainism is simply another branch of Hinduism.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} Jain apologist like [[Champat Rai Jain]], held that Hindus are Jaina [[allegorists]] who have allegorised the Jain teachings.{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=154}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}} However, such claims are not supported by historical facts.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}}

===Hindu revivalism and Indian identities===
With the onset of British colonialism, select groups of Indians developed responses to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}} In this context, various responses toward Jainism developed.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Dayanand Saraswati and the Arya Samaj====
The Arya Samaj was founded by [[Dayanand Saraswati]] (1824-1883), who "was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility".{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}} Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored Satyarth Prakash,{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=38}} a book containing the basic teachings of Saraswati and the Arya Samaj.{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=38-39}} It contains "Dayananda's bitter criticisms of the major ''non-Vedic'' religions of Indian origins."{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}} In the ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', he writes that he regarded Jainism as "the most dreadful religion",{{sfn|Daniel|2000|p=92}} and that Jains are "possessed of defective and childish understanding."{{sfn|Daniel|2000|p=92}}{{refn|group=note|Daniels cites Dayanand in his investigation of the claim that "Hinduism is the most tolerant of all religions and Hindu tolerance is the best answer in fostering peace and harmony in a multi-religious society",&lt;ref name="EBC"&gt;[http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=3165 Eastern Book Company, ''About the Book: , Hindu Response to Religious Pluralism'' (P.S. Daniels (2000))]&lt;/ref&gt; taking Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayananda and Mahatama Gandhi as cases.&lt;ref name="EBC" /&gt; He asks the question "Why was Dayananda so aggressive and negative in his response to other religions?".&lt;ref name="EBC" /&gt; Panicker also mentions that Dayanand's views are "strongly condemnatory, predominantly negative and positively intolerant and aggressive."{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}}}}

A recent strategy, exemplified by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], is the use of the term ''dharma'' as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Springer|2012}}

==Communal harmony==
{{Main article|Dharmasthala Temple}}
Dharmasthala Temple shows the communal harmony between Jains and Hindus, as the priests of the temple are Shivalli Brahmins, who are Vaishnava, and the administration is run by a [[Jain Bunt]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shridharmasthala.org/subsequent_page.php?id=2|title=Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala|work=shridharmasthala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, JPUSA joined the [[Evangelical Covenant Church]] as a member congregation, and currently has eight pastors credentialed with the ECC. The community organized the annual [[Cornerstone Festival]] from 1984 until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornerstonefestival.com |title=Cornerstone Festival 2012 :: Home |publisher=Cornerstonefestival.com |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Today Jesus People USA is "one of the largest single-site communes in the United States"&lt;ref name="Hippies-and-Beyond"&gt;{{cite news
| title = The Sixties Communes: Hippies and Beyond
| publisher = Syracuse University Press
| year = 1999
| author = Timothy Miller

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is certainly one of the few communes with such an eclectic cultural mix of [[hippie]]s, [[punk subculture|punks]], "[[crusties]]" and other members from various subcultures.

''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]'' magazine and the Christian rock band the [[Resurrection Band]] are part of the JPUSA community. In recent years, Resurrection Band disbanded, but Glenn Kaiser continues touring and playing, both solo and with the blues-based GKB (Glenn Kaiser Band). JPUSA also has its own recording company, Grrr Records. JPUSA was once the home of film producer/art promoter [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]] (who was formerly the husband of [[Yoko Ono]]) and their daughter Kyoko, singer/songwriter [[Daniel Smith (musician)|Daniel Smith]] as well as bass player/vocalist [[Christian Wargo]].

== Controversy ==

=== Enroth controversy ===

In 1993 JPUSA elders learned that [[Ronald Enroth|Dr. Ronald Enroth]] was researching a sequel to his book ''[[Churches That Abuse]]'', which was said to mention issues of abuse within JPUSA. Despite efforts of elders to convince Enroth to edit JPUSA out of the book, it was published in 1994 and included a full chapter of accounts of alleged abuse within the group. The release of the book set off a "firestorm of debate among religious scholars." JPUSA elders referred to the book as "poison in the well." [[Ruth Tucker]], a professor at [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]], defended the movement, saying Enroth was "sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed."  [[Paul R. Martin]], the director of [[Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center]], one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of "abusive groups," supported Enroth's findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA "displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly [[authoritarian]] and [[totalistic]] groups."&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Enroth himself responded to JPUSA in the book, in part, with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who have cooperated with my research efforts.&lt;ref name="Enroth 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Enroth |first=Ronald M. |authorlink=Ronald Enroth |title=Recovering from churches that abuse |publisher=Zondervan Pub.

According to a later newspaper article, as a result of the book's mention of JPUSA, "scores" of members decided to leave the group.&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip2"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicago Tribune criticism ===

In 2001, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published a two-part article primarily critical of the movement, with quotes from several ex-members accusing the group of [[authoritarian]] practices.&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip2"/&gt; One of the JPUSA activities criticized in the article includes "adult spankings," employed after charismatic leader Jack Winters introduced it as a means to heal the "inner child." The practice, which lasted approximately four years in the mid 1970s, was abandoned by the group, with leaders citing it as reflective of how "spiritually immature" the group was at the time.&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip"/&gt;

JPUSA issued a response to the two-part article, found on their website, which accuses the article of "anti-religious bias and cultural intolerance."&lt;ref name="Thor 2007"&gt;{{cite web |author=Thor |title=An Official Response To The Chicago Tribune From Jesus People USA  |website=jpusa.org |date=2007-02-09 |url=http://www.jpusa.org/tribune_response.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209173018/http://www.jpusa.org/tribune_response.html |archive-date=2007-02-09 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of sexual abuse ===

A lawsuit was filed in January 2014 against JPUSA and its parent denomination, the [[Evangelical Covenant Church]] claiming that children were sexually abused by members of JPUSA and its leadership covered it up for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/february/dozens-of-children-abused-at-evangelical-jpusa-jesus-people.html|title=Dozens of Children Abused at Evangelical Commune, Adult Survivors Allege|work=Gleanings - ChristianityToday.com|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Place to Call Home'' is a documentary that shares the stories of former children of JPUSA members who allegedly were sexually abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slowchurch/2014/03/01/jpusa-a-tragic-history-of-sexual-abuse/|title=JPUSA: A Tragic History of Sexual Abuse|work=Slow Church|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 3, 2015, the case was dismissed for want of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courtlink.lexisnexis.com/cookcounty/FindDock.aspx?DocketKey=CABE0L0AADDGE0LD|title=Case Information Summary for Case Number 2014-L-003364|last=|first=|date=March 3, 2015|website=Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court Electronic Docket Search|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy==

JPUSA's social significance stems more from the group's continued presence in Chicago and its historic roots in the 1960s, according to sociologist Shawn Young, one of the most contemporary significant groups from the Jesus movement era:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Founded in 1972, this community is one of the most significant surviving expressions of the original Jesus Movement of the sixties and seventies and represents a radical expression of contemporary countercultural evangelicalism.  JPUSA's blend of Christian Socialism, theological orthodoxy, postmodern theory and ethos of edgy artistic expression (as demonstrated at their annual music festival) prove what some scholars have longed suspected: evangelicalism is a diverse, complex movement, which simply does not yield to any attempt at categorization.

The '''Jivantasvami''' images represent Lord [[Mahavira]] (and in some cases other Tirthankaras) as a prince, with a crown and ornaments. The Jina is represented as standing in the kayotsaga pose. Jivantasvami images have been used only in the Shvetambara Jain tradition, they are unknown in the Digambara tradition.

The earliest reference to the Jivantasvami images is found in the later commentaries on the Shvetambara Jain Agamas (c.mid 6th century AD onwards),  Vasudevahindi of Samghadasagani-(c.mid 6th century AD) the Avashyakachurni (c.AD 625) the Avashyakavritti of Haribhadrasuri-(c.AD 750) and the Trishashtishalakapurushacharita of Hemachandra (c.AD 1169-72). &lt;ref&gt;JIVANTASVAMI IMAGES A STUDY IN CONCEPT AND ICONOGRAPHY, MARUTI NANDAN TIWARI, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 54 (1993), pp. 847-856&lt;/ref&gt;These mention the existence of Jivantasvami images at Ujjain, Dashapura (Mandsor), Vidisha, Vitabhayapattana, Puri and Koshala.

According to [[Hemachandra]], the  original image was made by god Vidyunmali, carved in sandalwood, during the time Lord Mahavira was still a prince.  According to the legend of the queen of Udayana of Vitabhaya worshipped this image.  This image was eventually installed at Vidisha, but was eventually lost.

The best known  images of [[Jivantasvami]] were found in the [[Akota Hoard]], and are widely mentioned examples of the early western Indian school of art. One of them is specifically inscribed as Jivantsvami installed by Nagisvari, which represents early phase of the Gupta style.&lt;ref&gt;Akota Bronzes, Bombay State Board for Historical Records and Ancient Monuments, Archaeological Series. no. 1. Umakant Premanand SHAH, 1959, p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;  The images were dug out sometime before June 1951. A University of Baroda professor brought five of them to archaeologist U.P. Shah for examination. U.P. Shat eventually  purchased most of the images from local individuals and presented them to M.S. University, which are now in the Baroda Museum.

Other tirthankaras including Rishabhanath (1st Jina), Shantinath (16th Jina), Munisuvrata (20th Jina) and Parshvanatha (23rd Jina ), were also sometimes represented in the form of Jivantasvami.&lt;ref&gt;U.P. Shah, Akota Bronze, Bombay, 1959, p 26; Idem 'More Images of Jivantasvami', Jr. Indian Museum xi 1955, &lt;/ref&gt; 


==Museums==

The two famous Jivantasvami images along with the rest of the [[Akota Hoard]] bronzes are in the [[Baroda Museum &amp; Picture Gallery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">'''Kakinomoto Shrine''' (柿本神社 ''Kakinomoto-jinja'') is a [[Shinto Shrine]] in [[Akashi, Hyōgo]]. It is also referred to as '''Hitomaru-san'''.

The shrine's principal deity is [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]], a historical figure who is reputed to have passed through the Akashi area during his life, and who was deified in the centuries following his death, as a god of literature, scholarship, fire safety and childbirth.

According to tradition, the shrine was founded in 887 by the monk [[Kakushō]], in the grounds of the [[Gesshō-ji]] temple. It moved to its current location to accommodate the construction of [[Akashi Castle]].

== Enshrined deities ==
The shrine's principal deity is [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]],{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} a god of ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poetry{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} and, by extension, [[scholarship]] and [[literature]],{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} but also, by way of a pair of puns on his name, [[fire safety]] (火止まる ''hi-tomaru'' = "fire stop"){{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} and [[childbirth]] (人生る ''hito-umaru'' = "person is born"){{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}}

According to tradition, Hitomaro passed through the Akashi area multiple times while travelling between his home in [[Yamato Province]] and his assigned district in [[Iwami Province]],{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}}&lt;!-- Source doesn't explicitly mention "Iwami" but the Hitomaro article's sources do. --&gt; and a poem he wrote on [[Akashi Strait]] survives.{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}}

== History ==
The history of the shrine is said to begin in 887 ([[Ninna|Ninna 3]]),{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} when [[Kakushō]] (覚証), a [[Buddhist monk]] of the temple {{illm|Gesshō-ji|ja|月照寺 (明石市)}},{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} speculated that Hitomaro's spirit had come to rest in Akashi{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} and constructed a small shrine at the back of his temple.{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} Both the temple and the shrine were moved to their current location to accommodate the construction of [[Akashi Castle]].{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} In 1723 ([[Kyōhō|Kyōhō 8]]) the shrine was granted the {{illm|first rank|ja|正一位}} in Japan's {{illm|Shinto Shrine ranking system|ja|神階}}{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} and the shrine's deity was given the [[shingō (Shinto)|title]] (&lt;small&gt;[[:ja:神 (神道)#「ミコト」（神号）|ja]]&lt;/small&gt;) Kakinomoto Dai-myōjin (柿本大明神).{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}}

== Name ==
The shrine is familiarly referred to by local people with the nickname ''Hitomaru-san'' (人丸さん).{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}}

== Monuments and architecture ==
In the shrine grounds is a monument constructed on the order of {{illm|Matsudaira Nobuyuki|ja|松平信之}},{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}} inscribed with a 1,712-character biography of Hitomaro.{{sfn|Akashi Tourism Association|2017}}

[[File:Lavinia.jpg|thumb|Lavinia from [[Guillaume Rouillé|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]]]
[[File:Mirabello Cavalori 001.jpg|thumb|250px|''Lavinia at the Altar'' (''ca.'' 1565) by [[Mirabello Cavalori]], depicting the moment at which Lavinia's hair blazes as an omen of war but ultimate reconciliation]]
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Lavinia''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|v|ɪ|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-la|Lāuīnĭa}} {{IPA-la|laːˈwiːnia|}}) is the daughter of [[Latinus]] and [[Amata]] and the last wife of [[Aeneas]].

Lavinia, the only child of the king and "ripe for marriage", had been courted by many men who hoped to become the king of [[Latium]]. [[Turnus]], ruler of the [[Rutuli]], was the most likely of the suitors, having the favor of Queen Amata. King Latinus is later warned by his father [[Faunus]] in a [[dream oracle]] that his daughter is not to marry a [[Latini|Latin]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Propose no Latin alliance for your daughter,&lt;br /&gt;
Son of mine; distrust the bridal chamber&lt;br /&gt;
Now prepared. Men from abroad will come&lt;br /&gt;
And be your sons by marriage. Blood so mingled&lt;br /&gt;
Lifts our name starward. Children of that stock&lt;br /&gt;
Will see all earth turned Latin at their feet,&lt;br /&gt;
Governed by them, as far as on his rounds&lt;br /&gt;
The Sun looks down on Ocean, East or West."&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 7.96–101, as translated by [[Robert Fitzgerald]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lavinia has what is perhaps her most, or only, memorable moment in Book 7 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', lines 69–83: during sacrifice at the altars of the gods, Lavinia's hair catches fire, an omen promising glorious days to come for Lavinia and war for all Latins.

Aeneas and Lavinia had one son, [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]]. Aeneas named the city [[Lavinium]] for her. According to an account by [[Livy]], [[Ascanius]] was the son of Aeneas and Lavinia; and she ruled the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] as a [[power behind the throne]], for [[Ascanius]] was too young to rule.

== In other works ==
In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'', the character of Lavinia and her relationship with Aeneas is expanded and elaborated, giving insight into the life of a king's daughter in ancient Italy. Le Guin employs a self-conscious narrative device in having Lavinia as the first-person narrator know that she would not have a life without [[Virgil]], who, being the writer of the ''Aeneid'' several centuries after her time, is thus her creator.

Lavinia also appears with her father Latinus in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', ''Inferno'', Canto IV, lines 125–126.

'''Lyon Cohen''' (1868–1937) was a Polish-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer/poet [[Leonard Cohen]].

==Biography==
Cohen was born in Budwitcher, [[Poland]], to a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family on May 11, 1868.&lt;ref name="faculty.marianopolis.edu"&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/LyonCohen.htm The Quebec History Encyclopedia: Lyon Cohen] retrieved April 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1871.&lt;ref name="faculty.marianopolis.edu" /&gt; He was educated at the McGill Model School and the Catholic Commercial Academy in Montreal.&lt;ref name="faculty.marianopolis.edu" /&gt; In 1888, he entered the firm of Lee &amp; Cohen in Montreal; later became partner with his father in the firm of L. Cohen &amp; Son; in 1895, he established W. R. Cuthbert &amp; Co; in 1900, he organized the Canadian Improvement Co., a dredging contractor; in 1906, he founded The Freedman Co. in Montreal; and in May 1919, he organized and became President of Canadian Export Clothiers, Ltd.&lt;ref name="faculty.marianopolis.edu" /&gt;  The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal’s largest clothing companies.&lt;ref name=MJM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imjm.ca/location/1080|website=[[Museum of Jewish Montreal]]|title=Lyon Cohen - Freedman Company|first=Richard|last=Kreitner|access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Cohen co-founded with [[Samuel William Jacobs]], the ''Canadian Jewish Times'', the first English language Jewish newspaper in Canada.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.cjhn.ca/permalink/145 Cohen, Lyon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323075541/http://www.cjhn.ca/permalink/145 |date=2012-03-23 }} Canadian Jewish Congress Charities Committee National Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper promoted the [[Canadianization]] of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs&lt;ref name=MJM /&gt; as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name=MJM /&gt; In 1914, the paper was purchased by [[Hirsch Wolofsky]], owner of the [[Yiddish]] language [[Keneder Adler]], who transformed it into the [[Canadian Jewish Chronicle]].&lt;ref name=MJM /&gt;

He was elected the first president of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] in 1919 and organized the [[Jewish Immigrant Aid Services]] of Canada.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Cohen was also a leader of the Young Men’s Hebrew Benevolent Society (later the Baron de Hirsch Institute) and the [[United Talmud Torahs]], a Jewish day school in Montreal.&lt;ref name=mont&gt;[http://www.jewishpubliclibrary.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Newspapers-of-Jewish-Montreal.pdf Newspapers of Jewish Montreal"] (page 3), Jewish Public Library Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as president of [[Congregation Shaar Hashomayim]]&lt;ref name=MJM /&gt; and president of the [[Jewish Colonization Association]] in Canada.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Personal life==

There is little information concerning the Mazatec people generally before the arrival of the Spanish and less concerning their spiritual practices.  

Several researchers{{who?|date=July 2014}} have commented on the difficulty in obtaining information, as the Mazatec shamans tend to be secretive and protective of their practices.

[[File:Metabus.jpg|thumb| ''Metabus and Camilla'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Peytavin]] (1808)]]

In [[Roman mythology]], King '''Metabus''' of the [[Volsci]] was the father of [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]].

Driven from his throne, Metabus and his infant daughter Camilla were chased into the wilderness by armed Volsci.  When the river Amasenus blocked his path, he bound her to a spear and promised [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] that Camilla would be her servant if she would safely transport her to the opposite bank. He then safely threw her to the other side, and swam across to retrieve her. The story is told by [[Virgil]] in Book XI of the ''[[Aeneid]]''.

'''''Mohammedan''''' (also spelled ''Muhammadan'', ''Mahommedan'', ''Mahomedan'' or ''Mahometan'') is a term for a follower of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker. "Muhammadans". ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''. 1997. p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as both a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]], meaning belonging or relating to, either Muhammad or the religion, doctrines, institutions and practices that he established.&lt;ref&gt;-Ologies &amp; -Isms. Copyright 2008 The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, edited by Noah Porter, published by G &amp; C. Merriam Co., 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The word was formerly common in usage, but the terms [[Muslim]] and [[Islamic]] are more common today. Though sometimes used stylistically by some Muslims, a vast majority consider the term a misnomer.

==Etymology==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites 1663 as the first recorded usage of the English term; the older spelling ''Mahometan'' dates back to at least 1529. The English word is derived from [[New Latin]] ''Mahometanus'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Mahometus'', Muhammad. It meant simply a follower of Mohammad.&lt;ref&gt;A concise etymological dictionary of the English language,  By Walter William Skeat&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, down to the 13th century or so, [[Medieval Christian view of Muhammad|some Christians had a mistaken belief]] that Muhammad had either been a [[Heresy|heretical]] Christian or that he was a god worshipped by Muslims.&lt;ref name="meyer2"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (1 July 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". DIANE Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 4–15 – "Some Europeans believed that Moslems worshipped Mohammed as a god,[...]" (4)&lt;/ref&gt; Some works of [[Medieval literature|Medieval European literature]] referred to Muslims as "[[paganism|pagans]]" or by [[sobriquet]]s such as the "paynim foe" (enemy). Depictions, such as those in the ''[[Song of Roland]]'', show Muslims praying to a variety of "[[cult image|idols]]", including [[Apollo]], [[Lucifer]], [[Termagant]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', "[http://www.bartleby.com/81/16352.html Termagant]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mahound]]. When the [[Knights Templar]] were being tried for heresy, reference was often made to their worship of a demon [[Baphomet]]; this is similar to "Mahomet", the [[Romanization|Latin transliteration]] of Muhammad's name, and Latin was, for another 500 years, the [[lingua franca|language of scholarship and erudition]] for most of Europe.&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt;

These and other variations on the theme were all set in the "temper of the times" of the Muslim–Christian conflict, as Medieval Europe was becoming aware of its great enemy in the wake of the quickfire success of the Muslims through [[Muslim conquests|a series of conquests]] shortly after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery,''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman.'' Oxford University Press, 1961. from pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obsolescence==
The term has been largely superseded by "[[Muslim]]" (formerly [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Moslem") or "Islamic". "Mohammedan" was commonly used in European literature until at least the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the second edition of ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage|A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' by [[Henry Watson Fowler|HW Fowler]], revised by [[Ernest Gowers]] (Oxford, 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim is more commonly used today, and the term Mohammedan is widely considered archaic or in some cases even offensive.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2000) annotates the term as ''offensive''. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' has "its use is now widely seen as depreciatory or offensive", referring to ''English Today'' no. 39 (1992): "The term Mohammedan [...] is considered offensive or pejorative to most Muslims since it makes human beings central in their religion, a position which only Allah may occupy". Other dictionaries, such as [[Merriam-Webster]], do not label the term as offensive.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term remains in limited use. The [[Govt. M.A.O College Lahore|Government Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College]] in [[Lahore]], Pakistan retains its original name, while the similarly named "Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College" in [[Aligarh]], India was renamed [[Aligarh Muslim University]] in 1920. There are also a number of [[sporting club]]s in Bangladesh and India which include the word, such as [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Dhaka)]], [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Chittagong)]], [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Jhenaidah)]] and [[Mohammedan S.C. (Kolkata)]].

==Muslim objections to the term==
Some modern Muslims have objected to the term,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fUw7Eks1UooC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Mohammedanism+misnomer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C7QVuTLE00&amp;sig=7YNCgxBkZ3eWj7KYsJZ7WwhVIYI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AAIlSqXHFYq7mQeg4-H6CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Mohammedanism a Misnomer]{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, by R.

Thus modern Muslims believe "Mohammedan" is a misnomer, "which seem[s] to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Gibb| first = Sir Hamilton| title = Mohammedanism: an historical survey| year = 1969| page=1 | quote=Modern Muslims dislike the terms Mohammedan and Mohammedanism, which seem to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term ''al-Muḥammadīya'' has been used in Islam to denote several sects considered heretical.&lt;ref name="bowker"&gt;JOHN BOWKER. "Muhammadans." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. 1997. Retrieved 8 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, R.. " al-Muḥammadīya."

==Other similar uses==
Islam has, and has had, [[Islamic schools and branches|many schools and branches]]. ''Tariqa Muhammadiyya'' (the Way of Mohammad) is a school of reform [[Sufism]] that arose in the 18th century and seeks to redirect and harmonize Sufi philosophy and practices with the authority and example of the prophet and hadith.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Nile, Sufism: A Global History, Jon Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012 pg 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, [[Muhammadiyah]] (followers of Muhammad) is the name of a [[Sunni]] socioreligious reform movement that shuns syncretistic and Sufi practices and advocates a return to a purer form of Islam based on the hadith and examples from the life of the prophet. It has adapted institutions such as the Boy Scouts to Islamic ends as the [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="bowker"/&gt;

{{Korean shamanism}}
'''''Mu''''' 무 is an ancient [[Korean language|Korean]] word defining a [[shaman]], that is to say intermediary between [[Haneullim|the first god]], [[deity|gods of nature]], and men, in the [[Korean shamanism|Korean traditional religion]]. Korean shamans hold rituals called ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'' (literally "good") for the welfare of the individuals and the society. In modern [[Korea]] different terms are used to define shamans, including '''mudang''' (mostly for females), '''baksu''' (only for males), '''tangol''' (for hereditary shamans) and '''musogin''' ("people who do shamanism", used in the context of organised shamanism).

==Etymology==
The Korean word 무 ''mu'' is related to the Chinese 巫 ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'',{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=3–5}} which defines shamans of either sex. Korean shamanic terminology has, however, at least a partial origin in [[Mongolic languages|Siberian languages]]. Already in records from the [[Yi dynasty]], ''mudang'' has a prevalent usage.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=3}} ''Mudang'' itself is explained in relation to Chinese characters, as originally referring to the "hall", 堂 ''tang'', of a shaman.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=3}} A different [[etymology]], however, explains ''mudang'' as stemming directly from the Siberian term for female shamans, ''utagan'' or ''utakan''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=3}}

''Mudang'' is used mostly, but not exclusively, for female shamans.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=3}} Male shamans are called by a variety of names, including ''sana mudang'' (literally "male ''mudang''") in the [[Seoul]] area, or ''baksu mudang'', also shortened ''baksu'' ("doctor", "healer"), in the [[Pyongyang]] area.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=3}} According to some scholars, ''baksu'' is an ancient authentic designation of male shamans, and locutions like ''sana mudang'' or ''baksu mudang'' are recent coinages due to the prevalence of female shamans in recent centuries.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=3–4}} ''Baksu'' may be a Korean adaptation of terms loaned from Siberian languages, such as ''baksi'', ''balsi'' or ''bahsih''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=4}}

The theory of a Siberian origin of Korean shamanic terminology is more reasonable than theories which explain such terminology as originating in Chinese,{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=4}} given that Chinese culture influenced [[Korea]] only at a relatively recent stage of Korean history.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=4}} Likely, when Koreans adopted [[Chinese characters]] they filtered their previously oral religious culture through the sieve of Chinese culture.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=4}} Another term, mostly used in contemporary South Korea in the context of shamanic associations, is ''musogin'', which means "people who do shamanism".{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=x}}

==Role of the ''mu''==
The work of the ''mu'' is based on the [[holism|holistic model]], which takes into consideration, not only the whole person, but the individual's interaction with his environment, thus both the inner and outer world. The soul is considered the source of life breath, and any physical illness is considered to be inextricably linked with sickness of the soul. Illness of the mind has its cause in soul loss, intrusion or [[demonic possession|possession]] by malevolent spirits.

The ''gut'', [[rite]]s practised by Korean shamans, have gone through a number of changes since the [[Silla]] and [[Goryeo]] periods. Even during the [[Joseon dynasty]], which established [[Korean Confucianism]] as the state religion, shamanic rites persisted. In the past, such rites included [[agriculture|agricultural]] rites, such as [[prayer]]s for abundant harvest. With a shift away from agriculture in modern Korea, agricultural rites have largely been lost and modern-day shamans are more focused on the spiritual issues of urban life.

==Myths about the origin of Korean shamans==
[[File:Dangun Wanggeom.jpg|thumb|Image of Dangun.]]
In all the [[myth]]s which figuratively explain the role of the shamans, it is implied that they are media, intermediaries, of higher forms of being.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=10}} They are not ordained institutionally, but receive ordination from Heaven itself.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=10}} The supreme God, "King of Heaven"—''[[Haneullim]]'' or ''Hwanin''—has a key role in all the myths regarding the shamans.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=10}}

Generally, these myths explain that shamans, whom in the most recent history of Korea are regarded as belonging to the lowest class of society (''[[cheonmin]]'' 천민), have a forgotten divine or princely nature,{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=11}} often coming from a blood lineage that may be traced back to the early founders of civilisation.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=11}} Further features of these myths are symbols of [[divine presence]], such as the [[axis mundi|holy mountain]] and the [[tree of life|holy tree]],{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=19}} and [[tragedy|tragic]] or painful experiences.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=11–12}}

The [[bear]] is an animal often present in such myths, with parallels in the mythologies of [[Siberia]].{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=20}} In such Siberian traditions, in the Chinese tradition of the [[Yellow Emperor]] and other divine progenitors, and in Korean shamanism as well, the bear is a symbol of the [[Big Dipper]] (i.e. [[Ursa Major]]), itself a symbol of the supreme God.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' but especially Vol. I, pp. 143, 154}} In Korean shamanism the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and the associated divine influence, are considered fundamental for childbearing.{{sfnb|Korean Cultural Service|1998|p=34}}

===''Sungmo''—the Holy Mother===
{{Further|Sungmo}}
In a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to a [[mother goddess]] associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the "Heavenly King". She has different names according to different regions and associated mountains: ''Sungmo'' ("Holy Mother"), ''Daemo'' ("Great Mother"), ''Jamo'' ("Benevolent Mother"), ''Sinmo'' ("Divine Mother"), ''Nogo'' ("Olden Maiden"), and others.{{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=6–7}} In other myths she is a mortal princess who is later [[apotheosis|turned into a goddess]].

These myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the "Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]" on the top of a mountain.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–6}} The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first ''mudang''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–6}} According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the [[Silla]] period, when [[Buddhism]] and influences from [[China]] had already penetrated the Korean peninsula.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–6, 13}}

The myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=6}} In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=6}} The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=6}} Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The first ''mudang'' were established as her successors.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in [[Chungcheong]].{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The yellow and red clothes worn by the ''mudang'' are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}}

In the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as ''Chil Kongju'' (the "Seventh Princess"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and casted it in a pond, but she was rescued by a [[Dragon King]] sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} Names of the goddess in other local traditions ''Pali Kongju'' and ''Kongsim''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} In the tradition of [[Jeju Island]], where there are more male ''baksu'' than female ''mudang'', the myth tells of a prince as the ancestor of all shamans.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=12}}

===''Dangun''—the Sandalwood King===
{{Further|Dangun}}
Dangun is traditionally considered to be the son of ''Hwanin'', the "Heavenly King", and founder of the Korean nation.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=13}} This myth is reputed to be older than that of the mother goddess.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=13}} Myths similar to that of Dangun are found in [[Ainu people|Ainu]]{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=20}} and Siberian cultures.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=21}}

The myth starts with prince ''[[Hwanung]]'' ("Heavenly Prince"), son of ''Hwanin''. The prince asked his father to grant him governance over Korea.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} Hwanin accepted, and Hwanung was sent to Earth bearing three Heavenly Seals and accompanied by three thousand followers.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} The prince arrived under the [[tree of life|holy tree]] of [[sandalwood]] (''Sintansu'' 신단수, 神檀樹){{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=10–13}} on the holy mountain, where he founded his holy city.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}}

At the time of his reign, ''[[Ungnyeo]]'' or ''Ungnye'' (웅녀, 熊女){{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=10–13}}—who was a she-[[bear]]—and a [[tiger]] were living in a cave near the holy city, praying earnestly that their wish to become part of mankind might be fulfilled.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} ''Ungnyeo'' patiently endured weariness and hunger, and after twenty-one days she was transformed into a beautiful woman, while the tiger ran away for it could not tolerate the effort.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} The woman ''Ungnyeo'' was overjoyed, and visiting the sandalwood city she prayed that she might become the mother of a child.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}}

Ungnye's wish was fulfilled, so that she became the queen and gave birth to a prince who was given the royal name of ''Dangun'', the "Sandalwood King".{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} Dangun reigned as the first human king of Korea, giving to his kingdom the name of [[Joseon]], "Land of the Morning Calm".{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}}

Dangun was the first shaman, intermediary between mankind and ''Haneullim'', to whom he worshipped and prayed on the behalf of his people.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=17}} The importance of the worship of ancestors and gods reside in their being the mean of communion with the supreme God, ''Haneullim''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=17}} According to some scholars, the name ''Dangun'' is related to the Siberian ''[[Tengri]]'' ("Heaven"),{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=17–18}} while the bear is a symbol of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major).{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' but especially Vol. I, pp. 143, 154}} Later in the myth, Dangun becomes the ''[[Sansin]]'', the "Mountain God" (metaphorically of civilising growth, prosperity).{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=16–18}}

==Types of Korean shamans==
Korean shamans may be classified into two categories:{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=32–33}} ❶ ''sessǔmu'' or ''tangol'' (당골),{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=ix}} people who are shamans and have the right to perform rites by family lineage; and ❷ ''kangshinmu'', people who become shamans through an initiation ceremony. Hereditary shamans were historically concentrated in the southern part of the [[Korean peninsula]], while initiated shamans were found throughout the entire peninsula but were peculiar to the northern half, the contiguous areas of [[China]] inhabited by [[Koreans]], and the central regions along the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=32–33}}

===''Kangshinmu''—initiated shamans===
[[File:Hyewon-Munyeo.sinmu.jpg|thumb|''Munyeo sinmu'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|무녀신무}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|巫女神舞}}), painted by [[Hyewon|Shin Yunbok]] in the late [[Joseon]] (1805).]]
''Kangshinmu'' (강신무; 降神巫) are historically found throughout [[Korea]], but they are peculiar to the central and northern regions of the peninsula and the lands of modern-day China contiguous to the northern part of the peninsula. The essential characteristic of the ''kangshinmu'' is that they acquire their status by being "chosen" and possessed by a god. There are two subtypes of ''kangshinmu'': ① General ''mudang'' and ② ''myǒngdu''.{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=32–33}}

A person becomes a ''kangshinmu'' undergoing a period of ''[[shinbyeong]]'' (神病), "divine illness". The possession by the god is said to be accompanied by physical pain and [[psychosis]]. Believers assert that the "divine illness" may not be healed through medical treatments, but only through the full communion with the spirit.{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=41–42}}

''Mudang'' are shamans who are possessed by a god, called a ''momju''. They perform fortune telling using spiritual powers derived from their possession, and lead ''gut'' rituals involving song and dance. A sub-type of ''mudang'' is the ''sǒnmudang''  or ''posal'', who are thought to have acquired power through spiritual experience, but are still not worthy of holding an orthodox ''gut''. Many male shamans, ''baksu'', belong to this category.{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=28–29}}

''Myǒngdu'' differ from the general ''mudang'' in that they channel the spirit of a dead person, usually a young child related to the ''myǒngdu'' himself, rather than a god, and invite such spirits to take residence into shrines set up in their homes. ''Myǒngdu'' are found primarily in the [[Honam]] region of Korea.{{sfnb|Kim|1998|p=32}}

===''Seseummu''—hereditary shamans===
''Seseummu'' (세습무; 世襲巫), found in the area south of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], receive their status as shamans by family bloodline. There are two subtypes of ''seseummu'': ① ''Shimbang'' and ② ''tangol''.

''Shimbang'' are similar to initiated shamans, because the relationship with a god and spiritual experience are important elements in their tradition, though the right to conduct ceremonies is hereditary. Furthermore, ''shimbang'' differ from ''kangshimu'' because their bodies are not actually possessed by the god and led to celebrate the ''gut'' rite. Rather, ''shimbang'' contact the god through a medium (''mujǒmgu'') and do not enter in full identification with the god. Endly, ''Shimbang'' do not set up and keep shrines.{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=31–32}}

''Tangol'' are a type of shaman found predominantly in the southernmost regions of the Korean peninsula, especially in [[Yeongnam]] ([[Gyeongsang Province|Gyeongsang]]) and [[Honam]] area ([[Jeolla Province|Jeolla]]). Each one of the ''tangol'' families of Honam had districts of influence (''tangolpan'') in which they had the exclusive right to perform ''gut'' rites. Rituals performed by ''tangol'' involve song and dance to entertain a god or goddess. Both the rights of succession and the ceremonies have been systematised, so that they now bear the characteristics of a religious institution. Unlike other types of Korean shamans, ''tangol'' do not receive a particular god as part of an initiation ceremony and may therefore work with a variety of gods. They do not keep shrines in their homes.{{sfnb|Kim|1998|pp=29–30}}

[[File:Pietro Perugino cat50.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna della Consolazione (Perugino)|Madonna della Consolazione]]'', Perugino c.1497]]
Starting in the 2nd century, [[Roman Catholics|Catholics]] venerated [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as '''Our Lady of Consolation''', one of her earliest titles of honor. The title of "Our Lady of Consolation", or "Mary, Consoler of the Afflicted", comes from the Latin ''Consolatrix Afflictorum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://franciscansusa.org/our-lady-of-consolation|title=Our Lady of Consolation – Conventual Franciscan Friars|website=franciscansusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in the [[Litany of Loreto]].

==Augustinians==
The origin of this invocation is derived from the [[Augustinian]] monks who propagated this particular devotion. In 1436 the Confraternity of the Holy Cincture of Our Lady of Consolation was founded in [[Bologna]], Italy. It was based on an Augustinian tradition which holds that [[Saint Monica]] in the fourth century, was distraught with anxiety for her wayward son, [[Augustine]], and that Mary gave her a sash which the Virgin wore, with the assurance that whoever wore this belt would receive her special consolation and protection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-consolation.php Roten S.M., Johann. "Our Lady of Consolation", International Marian Research Institute Home : University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Augustine, and [[Saint Monica|Monica]], Our Lady of Consolation is one of the three patrons of the Augustinians. The "Augustinian Rosary" is sometimes called the "Corona (or Crown) of Our Mother of Consolation".

In the 1700s members of the Augustinian Order introduced devotion to Our Lady of Consolation to the island of [[Malta]]. On December 1, 1722 the Prior General of the Augustinian Order Fr Thomas Cervioni issued the Decree for the erection of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Consolation in the church of St Mark, run by the Augustinians at [[Rabat]], although the devotion had been practiced for some time before. By this time the custom of asking for the final blessing before death in the name of Our Lady of Consolation was very popular, and the monks were given a dispensation to leave the monastery at any time to confer it. Processions in Our Lady's honor were suspended during the French occupation of 1798 to discourage the gathering of crowds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhs.eu.pn/md/MD26.html Schembri, Henry. ''The Augustinian Friars and Devotion to Our Lady in the Maltese Islands'', p. 313, Malta Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The feast day is celebrated on the last Sunday of October with pyrotechnic displays by Our Lady of Consolation Fireworks Factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmalta.com/en/event-details/2016-09/feast-of-our-lady-of-consolation-6348|title=FEAST OF OUR LADY OF CONSOLATION - Visitmalta - The official tourism website for Malta, Gozo and Comino.|website=www.visitmalta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turin==

[[File:Icona della Consolata, Torino.jpg|thumb|left|Icon of della Consolata, Turin]]
An ancient story relates St [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] brought back an icon of Our Lady of Consolation when he was returning from exile in Egypt in 363. This icon was presented to the city of [[Turin]]. Later [[Maximus of Turin|St Maximus]], Bishop of Turin, established a small shrine to house the icon in a church dedicated to [[St Andrew]]. The icon became the object of great veneration, and the church became the [[Santuario della Consolata]]. [[Giuseppe Allamano]], rector of the Santuario della Consolata founded the [[Consolata Missionaries]] in 1902; they brought the devotion to Africa. At the age of nineteen [[Joseph Marello]] of Turin contracted [[typhus]]. He attributed his recovery to Our Lady of Consolation and went on to found the [[Oblates of St. Joseph]].&lt;ref name=lic&gt;[http://www.newspaper.licatholic.org/saints/saint-joseph-marello "Saint Joseph Marello" ''Long Island Catholic'', May 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of the image of Our Lady of Consolation. The original one is in Turin at the [[Santuario della Consolata]]. A star on her shoulder is characteristic of almost all the images. The traditional depiction of Our Mother of Consolation in Augustinian houses shows Mary holding the child [[Jesus]] on her lap. Jesus and Mary both hold the Augustinian [[cincture]] in their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midwestaugustinians.org/our-mother-of-consolation|title=Our Mother of Consolation|website=Midwest Augustinians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Vannes]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Valence|Valence]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier|Montpelier]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Laval|Laval]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nantes|Nantes]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Périgueux|Périgueux]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tours|Tours]] and many others, possessed churches or chapels dedicated to Mary under this title.&lt;ref name=grinstead/&gt; In 1652, [[Pope Innocent X]] encouraged devotion to Our Lady of Consolation by establishing a [[confraternity]].

[[File:Consolatrix afflictorum Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|Consolatrix afflictorum Luxembourg]]

==Luxembourg==

The devotion to Our Lady of [[Luxembourg]], Comforter of the Afflicted, was initiated by the [[Jesuits]] in 1624 and led to the election of Our Lady as the protectress of the City in 1666 and of the Duchy in 1678. After the destruction of the old pilgrimage chapel at the time of the [[French Revolution]], the statue of Our Lady of Luxembourg was moved to St. Peter church, today's [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in [[Luxembourg City]].&lt;ref name=weyrich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutgrandducal.lu/Joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=91|title=INSTITUT GRAND-DUCAL DE LUXEMBOURG|website=www.institutgrandducal.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statues depicting her can be found in niches in buildings throughout the city of Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/susanna/our_lady_of_consolation.htm|title=Our Lady of Consolation|website=mavweb.mnsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there the devotion was adopted by the English [[Order of St Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns of [[Cambrai]].

===United States===

Immigrants from Luxembourg transposed the devotion to Our Lady of Consolation to the United States.
 
* In 1848, Luxembourg immigrants began to settle in the area around [[Dacada, Wisconsin]]. The oldest statue of Our Lady of Luxembourg found in the United States, was brought to Dacada by a Luxembourg immigrant, Anna Margaret Deppiesse, in 1849. Mrs. Deppiesse donated it to St. Nicholas Church, where it can be found in an alcove shrine below the choir loft. When the church was remodeled in 1941, a mural depicting Our Lady of Luxembourg (Mary, Consoler of the Afflicted) was added to the apse in the sanctuary. The mural, which honors the parish’s Luxembourgian roots, was painted by liturgical artist, Bernard Grenkhe, using the “al secho” method (i.e., painting on wet plaster so as to make the image permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galenfrysinger.com/wisconsin_port_washington_st_nicholas.htm|title=St. Nicholas Church, Dacada, Wisconsin | website=Travel Photos by Galen R Frysinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], three parishioners of St. Augustine's Parish in [[Leopold, Indiana]] fought for the North and were imprisoned at the notorious [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville Prison]]. Henry Devillez, Isidore Naviaux and Lambert Rogier, formerly of Belgium, vowed that if they survived, one of them would make a pilgrimage to Luxembourg and obtain a copy of the statue of Our Lady of Consolation that stood in their ancestral church. Rogier went to Luxembourg in 1867 and upon his return enshrined it in St. Augustine's, where it now stands to the left of the main altar. In September 2013, Archbishop [[Joseph William Tobin|Joseph W. Tobin]] of [[Indianapolis]] dedicated a larger outdoor garden shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archindy.org/criterion/local/2013/09-20/leopold.html Cornwell, Patricia Happel. "Archbishop rededicates Marian shrine at St. Augustine Parish in Leopold", ''The Criterion'', September 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the two main celebrations held each year in the [[Tacony, Philadelphia|Tacony section of Philadelphia]] were Our Lady of Consolation’s Feast Day Parade. (The other was Memorial Day.) Each July statues of the saints were paraded through the streets of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nephillyhistory.com/1cnephtest/tacony/tachist.htm|title=c|website=www.nephillyhistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Another center of veneration and pilgrimage, which also adopted Our Lady, Comforter of the Afflicted is [[Kevelaer]] in [[Germany]], not far from the Dutch border. In 1642 a copperplate engraving, representing Our Lady of Luxembourg, was installed in a sanctuary erected the same year. It is one of the best visited Catholic pilgrimage locations in north-western Europe. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevelaer.de/en/content/wallfahrt/&amp;nid1=15854|title=City of Kevelaer - Wallfahrt|website=www.kevelaer.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
[[File:Our Lady of Consolation Grinstead Great Britain.jpg|thumb|left|Our Lady of Consolation Grinstead, Great Britain]]
There is a shrine of Our Lady of Consolation in [[West Grinstead]], in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton|Diocese of Arundel and Brighton]] in England. The [[Shrine Church of Our Lady of Consolation and St Francis]] dates from 1876 and is the first Shrine in honour of Mary to be established in England since before the Reformation. There was in the Church of St. John the Baptist at [[Perth]], an altar inscribed to "St. Mary of Consolation".&lt;ref name=grinstead/&gt;

With the approval of the Archbishop of Turin in northern Italy, the new church was affiliated to the original sanctuary of Our Lady of Consolation, and a painting, closely resembling the miraculous Shrine Painting in the [[Santuario della Consolata]] of Turin, enriched with similar indulgences and privileges, was brought to West Grinstead. The Shrine Statue was [[Canonical coronation|canonically crowned]] by the Papal Delegate, Bishop Butt, on behalf of [[Pope Leo XIII]], in July 1893.&lt;ref name=grinstead&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consolation.org.uk/n_welcome.php|title=Our Lady of Consolation of West Grinstead - Introduction|website=www.consolation.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación is located in [[Táriba]], [[Venezuela]]. The Augustinian church of Our Mother of Consolation in the Shiroyama district of [[Nagasaki]] is also named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pauline.or.jp/church/shiroyama.php|title=Daughters of St. Paul --Catholic Churches in Japan|website=english.pauline.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feast day===
The feast of Our Lady of Consolation is one of the solemnities not inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, but which are observed in particular places, regions, churches or religious institutes. Augustinians observe September 4;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osa.org.au/en/ministries/additional-information/mary-mother-of-consolation/|title=OSA : Mary - Mother of Consolation|website=www.osa.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Benedictines July 5.

The popular girls name "Consuela" is derived from this title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JtrPtUUqXK8C&amp;dq=our+lady+of+consolation+feast+day&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Nevins, Albert J., and Ball, Ann.

'''Margin''' incurved when young, often irregular, and non-translucent. Flesh greyish white.
*'''Gills:''' Attachment adnate to adnexed, sometimes sinuate, rarely subdecurrent, widely spaced, irregular, greyish a first, soon grayish black, blackish with age, and mottled as spores mature.
*'''Stem:''' 30-50mm by 4-6mm thick, equal, firm, pruinose towards the apex. Whitish to white with pinkish tones, generally ligher than the cap, and lacking any veil remnants.
*'''Microscopic Features:'''Spores nearly black in deposit, 11.5-14.5 by 7.9-10 micrometers, lemon shaped, and often variable. Basidia 2- and 4-spored.Cheilocystidia clavate 17-24 by 7.4-12 micrometers. Pleurocystidia present, with extended sharp apices, 25-60 (60) by 10-17 (20) micrometers.&lt;ref name="Stamets" /&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
Reported from [[central Africa]] to the southern regions of the [[Sudan]]. Probably more widely distributed. Found on hippopotamus and elephant dung in the spring or during the rainy seasons.&lt;ref name="Stamets" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">The '''Podruchnik''' (Russian: "Подручник", literally "Something under an arm") is a small [[cushion]], once used in prayer by all [[Russian Orthodox]] Christians in the [[Tsardom of Russia]] before [[Raskol|the schism of 1653]] but currently in use only by the [[Old Believers]].

Measuring roughly 40cm by 40 cm, the Podruchnik takes the form of a small cushion, often with patchwork decoration which varies from region to region. Its sole function is to keep the worshipper's hands and face clean during the frequent [[Zemnoy poklon|prostrations]] that occur in church services, as it is felt that the fingers used to make the [[Sign of the Cross]] must remain clean during the prayers.

During Church services, when prostrations are made, as the worshipper lowers his torso, he flips the Podruchnik onto the ground in such a way that when he is kneeling and prostrate on the ground, the Podruchnik protects his hands and forehead from the dirt and grime of the floor. 

When not in use, they are stored at the side of the church, stacked up in such a manner that the dirty sides touch each other and the clean sides only touch other clean sides.

'''''The Pranava-Vada of Gargyayana''''' (''pranava-vāda'' is the Sanskrit for "uttering of [[Om|Pranava (AUM)]]") is a book by [[Bhagavan Das (theosophy)|Bhagavan Das]], published in three volumes in years 1910-1913 by the [[Theosophical Society, Adyar]] with notes by [[Annie Besant]]. Das alleges that the work is a "summarised translation" of an otherwise unknown "ancient text" by a sage called [[Gargya (disambiguation)|Gargyayana]]. Das states that the text was dictated to him from memory by ''Pandit Dhanaraja Mishra'', a theosophist friend of his who was blind in both eyes and had died before the book's publication.

The "'''Red Basilica'''" ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Kızıl Avlu''), also called variously the '''Red Hall''' and '''Red Courtyard''', is a monumental ruined temple in the ancient city of [[Pergamon]], now [[Bergama]], in western [[Turkey]]. The temple was built by the [[Roman Empire]], probably in the time of [[Hadrian]] and possibly on his orders. It is one of the largest Roman structures still surviving in the [[Hellenistic civilization|ancient Greek world]]. The temple is thought to have been used for the worship of the [[Egyptian gods]] – specifically [[Isis]] and/or [[Serapis]], and possibly also [[Osiris]], [[Harpocrates]] and other lesser gods, who may have been worshipped in a pair of drum-shaped rotundas, both of which are virtually intact, alongside the main temple.

Although the building itself is of an immense size, it was only one part of a much larger sacred complex, surrounded by high walls, that dwarfed even the colossal Temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in [[Baalbek]]. The entire complex was built directly over the River Selinus in a remarkable feat of engineering that involved the construction of an immense bridge {{convert|196|m|ft}} wide to channel the river through two channels under the temple. The [[Pergamon Bridge]] still stands today, supporting modern buildings and even vehicle traffic. A series of tunnels and chambers lies under the main temple, connecting it with the side rotundas and giving private access to different areas of the complex. Various drains, water channels and basins are located in, around and under the main temple and may have been used for symbolic reenactments of the [[flooding of the Nile]].

The temple was converted by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] into a [[Christianity|Christian]] church dedicated to [[John the Evangelist|St John]] but was subsequently destroyed. Today the ruins of the main temple and one of the side rotundas can be visited, while the other side rotunda is still in use as a small mosque.

== History ==
The temple's date of construction is not recorded, but from the style of the sculptures and the building techniques a date in the first half of the second century AD has been proposed. Its use of [[Roman brick|red brick]] on a massive scale, unique in Asia Minor but relatively common in Italy at the time, indicates that the architect was not local. The immense size and lavish construction of the complex points to an extremely wealthy patron who sent a Roman architect and brick masons to Pergamon to build the temple. The most likely candidate is the emperor Hadrian himself. He is known to have been an enthusiastic sponsor of the Egyptian gods; he built temples of Isis and Serapis at various places in the Roman world, including at [[Hadrian's Villa|his own villa]] in [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]].{{sfn|Witt|1997|p=235}}

At some point during the Christian era the temple was gutted by fire. It was not restored, but was redeveloped in the 5th century AD as a Christian basilica, built inside the shell of the destroyed temple. Arcades were built dividing the interior into a central [[nave]] and two side aisles. The eastern wall was demolished and replaced with an [[apse]]. The floor level was raised by about {{convert|2|m|ft}}, obscuring the original Roman floor, though the former floor level has since been restored by archaeologists.{{sfn|Pergamon, the Red Hall}} The church was probably destroyed by the forces of the Arab general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik]], who besieged and looted the city in 716–717 during his [[Second Arab Siege of Constantinople|unsuccessful bid]] to conquer [[Constantinople]]. Pergamon fell into Turkish hands in 1336 and the building was converted into a mosque.{{sfn|Jonsson|2007|p=274-275}}

The complex has been investigated and excavated in a series of campaigns by the [[German Archaeological Institute]]. In 1906–1909 P. Schazmann prepared detailed drawings of the ruins during a German excavation of the Hellenistic city. The temple and ''temenos'' were excavated by [[Theodor Wiegand]] from 1927. New archaeological studies were carried out from 2002 to 2005 under A. Hoffmann.{{sfn|Pergamon: The city and its landscape}} Restoration efforts have also been pursued, first in the 1930s under O. Bayatlı, the Director of the Bergama Museum, and later in the 1950s and 1960s. Further restoration work was conducted on the main temple in 2006 and the south rotunda was restored between 2006 and 2009.{{sfn|Pergamon, the Red Hall}}

==Description==
[[File:Red Basilica plan.svg|left|thumb|350px|Plan of the "Red Basilica" and the surrounding complex]]
The temple was built in the lower city of Pergamon at the foot of the hill on which the ancient city's [[acropolis]] stood. It was located at the eastern end of what was originally an immense sacred precinct or ''[[temenos]]'', 270&amp;nbsp;m long by 100&amp;nbsp;m wide (890&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;× 330&amp;nbsp;ft), which was surrounded by stone walls standing at least {{convert|13|m|ft}} high. Most of the ''temenos'' was destroyed and built over long ago, but substantial fragments of the walls remain standing to a height of 13&amp;nbsp;m today. The main entrance lay on the western side of the ''temenos'' through a colossal marble gateway; smaller gateways were located on the same side, north and south of the main gate. From there, visitors walked some {{convert|200|m|ft}} to an immense ''[[propylon]]'' (or monumental gateway) in front of the temple, supported by a row of columns standing {{convert|14|m|ft}} high.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=170}}

The ''temenos'' was built on top of the River Selinus, presumably because the person who commissioned the complex wished it to be located in the city centre rather than in an outlying district. As the city was already substantially built up, the river bed offered an otherwise unused location for the temple complex and reduced the number of properties that would have to be demolished to make way for it. The river was channelled into two tunnels passing diagonally for a distance of about {{convert|150|m|ft}}, northwest to southeast, under the ''temenos'' and temple. This structure, the [[Pergamon Bridge]], still stands today and continues to drain the river underneath the complex.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=170}}

===The temple===
[[File:Red basilica north view.jpg|right|thumb|The temple viewed from the north, also showing the north rotunda. The roof of the south rotunda can just be seen on the other side.]]
[[File:Red basilica interior.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of the temple, showing the podium and ''(left)'' the base of the cult statue. Smaller statues of the gods would have stood in the side alcoves.]]
The temple measures {{convert|60|m|ft}} from east to west and {{convert|26|m|ft}} from north to south.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=170}} Its walls still survive up to a height of {{convert|19|m|ft}}, though its roof and eastern wall no longer exist and much of the original interior was destroyed when it was converted into a Christian basilica. The building was originally a vast hall, rather than a basilica, covered by a wooden roof that had no interior support or colonnade. Its walls were built entirely of red bricks that gave the building its modern Turkish name (which means literally "Red Courtyard"). They were covered in marble in various colours, though this has entirely disappeared; some important structural parts were also constructed from marble.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=171}}

There appear to have been windows only in the western half of the main temple, meaning that the eastern half did not receive any natural light (unless there were windows in the eastern wall, which no longer stands).{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=171}} The building was entered from the west through an immense door measuring more than {{convert|7|m|ft}} wide by at least {{convert|14|m|ft}} high. Its door-sill is still in place and was made from a single piece of marble weighing over 30 tons. It seems, however, that the door was kept open continuously as there are no traces of the rollers that would have been necessary to open and close it. In front of the door stood an iron grating, which presumably had an opening in it to permit access to the interior of the temple.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=172}}

A total of twelve arched niches are embedded in the walls of the western end of the temple, five each lining the north and south walls and another two flanking the door on the west wall. They stand {{convert|2.55|m}} wide by {{convert|6|m}} high and presumably held statues of deities – perhaps the twelve gods of the [[zodiac]]. In his novel ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'', the Roman writer [[Apuleius]] described a visit to the temple in which his protagonist "saw the gods infernal and the gods celestial, before whom I presented myself and worshipped." {{sfn|Koester|2007|p=175 fn. 17}}  Near the centre of the hall is a shallow basin, {{convert|22|cm}} deep by {{convert|5.2|m}} long, in which three rectangular tubs stood, placed parallel to each other. It had no inflow pipe or drain. The eastern and western halves of the hall are divided by an alabaster-lined water channel, {{convert|1.4|m}} wide and {{convert|1.37|m|ft}} deep, extending the full width of the temple. This did have a substantial inflow or outlet point, {{convert|1|m}} high by {{convert|0.45|m}} wide, which exited somewhere to the west in the direction of the river. The floor of the temple was constructed from plates of marble and granite imported from as far away as [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=172}}{{sfn|Wild|1981|p=57}}

The eastern end of the hall would have been closed to the public and could only be accessed by the temple priests and their attendants. It housed the cult statue, which stood on a base that stood in turn on a podium raised by {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} above the temple floor. The statue was at least {{convert|10|m}} high, approaching the size of the great [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. An entry-hole in the base indicates that priests could climb inside the body of the statue, perhaps to make it "speak" during ceremonies.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=172}}{{sfn|Gates|2003|p=386}}

At the far end of the temple were two massive towers, projecting some distance out from the eastern wall of the ''temenos''. The original wall no longer exists but from the foundations it can be seen that it would have been in the shape of an inverted semicircle. During the Christian era it was demolished and replaced with an apsidal wall.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=173}}

===Side courts and rotundas===
[[File:Red basilica south rotunda.jpg|right|thumb|South rotunda and a surviving section of the south wall of the ''temenos''. Holes for the beams of the stoa roof can still be seen in the ''temenos'' wall.]]
Two [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]s topped by domes stand on either side of the main temple. Although they have been stripped of their original marble cladding, they are still substantially intact. Each stands {{convert|18|m}} high, with a diameter of {{convert|12|m}}, and had doors standing {{convert|11.5|m}} high. They were lit by an opening (an ''opaion'' or ''[[oculus]]'') that was originally {{convert|3.7|m}} wide. The two rotundas had different fates in the modern era. The one on the south side, which is part of the Red Basilica archaeological site and is open to visitors, was re-used and modified in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]], and in the 19th century became the machinery room for an [[olive oil]] factory. Its inside walls are still covered with black soot from the smoke produced by the machinery. The north rotunda is currently used as a mosque.{{sfn|The Southern Rotunda}}

The two rotundas stood within courtyards to the north and south of the main temple. They were surrounded on all sides by [[stoa]]s measuring some {{convert|5|m}} deep, supported on the eastern side by [[Atlas (architecture)|atlantes]] and [[caryatid]]s that each consisted of two figures standing back-to-back supporting the stoa roof. The figures were clearly intended to represent Egyptians, as they are depicted wearing Egyptian headgear.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=174}}

A pair of water basins was located in front of each rotunda, measuring {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} long by {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|85|cm|in}} deep. These basins each had a smaller round basin of {{convert|1.75|m|ft}} diameter at each end.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=174}}

===Underground===
An underground complex lies below the temple and rotundas. Spiral ramps lead down from the rotundas to connect with a north-south passageway that links all three buildings. Branching passageways lead to secondary entrances in the ''temenos'' and to several pillared underground chambers – two on the south side have been excavated and it is presumed that a corresponding pair of chambers exist under the mosque/rotunda on the north side. The passageways gave access to the hidden entrance to the cult statue and also to the side walls of the temple, linking to shafts that connected with the temple roof.{{sfn|Wild|1981|p=199-200}}

The tunnels are all about {{convert|2|m}} high by between {{convert|0.45|m}} to {{convert|1.4|m}} wide. They appear to have been generally unadorned, but some pieces of coloured [[stucco]] are reported to be visible in one area – perhaps the remainder of some kind of decoration. The chambers to which they link are substantial structures. Two are rectangular rooms on either side of the main temple, measuring {{convert|9|m|ft}} by {{convert|15|m|ft}}, {{convert|4|m}} high, supported by pillars arranged in a 3 x 3 pattern. The other two, situated on the far side of each rotunda, are significantly larger; they measure {{convert|13|m}} by {{convert|15|m}} with a 4 x 4 pattern of columns.{{sfn|Wild|1981|p=199-200}} The two excavated chambers beside the south rotunda are today used as storage space for the archaeological site.{{sfn|The Southern Rotunda}}

==Use and purpose==
[[File:Red basilica atlantid.jpg|right|thumb|Atlantid wearing an Egyptian headdress – an indication of the nature of the gods worshipped in the temple]]
The temple was certainly used to worship Egyptian gods, as the presence of Egyptianised atlantids indicates. Which specific gods were worshipped there is, however, unclear. An inscription referring to the temple mentions "[[Serapis]], [[Isis]], [[Harpocrates]], [[Osiris]], [[Apis (god)|Apis]], [[Helios]] on a horse ... [[Ares]] and the [[Dioskouroi]]". Another inscription mentions Serapis, and a small [[terracotta]] head of Isis was discovered in the area of the ''temenos''. One of the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] from Egypt refers to Isis as ''ὲν Περγάμῳ δεσπότις'' ("she who rules in Pergamon"). The temple may well have been dedicated to Isis, though some historians have interpreted it as a [[Serapeum]] (temple of Serapis) instead. The two rotundas may have been used for the worship of [[Horus]] and [[Anubis]].{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=174-175}}

The layout of the temple provides more clues about how it was used. Unlike Greek temples, where the entire building was considered to be the house of the divinity, the god worshipped in the "Red Basilica" was confined to the eastern half of the temple. Similar layouts are found in other Isis and Serapis temples elsewhere in Asia Minor and Greece. The ''temenos'' is a vastly enlarged equivalent of enclosures found elsewhere in Greek mystery sanctuaries, such as the one as [[Eleusis]] in Greece where the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] were performed annually. The purpose of its high walls was to prevent outsiders from witnessing ceremonies held within the ''temenos'' and temple precinct, thus preserving the mystery of the rituals.{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=175}}

Water appears to have been a central theme of the ceremonies held at the temple, judging from the number of water features (basins, troughs and so on) in the complex. The basins outside the temple may have been purely decorative but those inside seem to have been intended for use in ceremonies. These may have included purification rituals – sprinkling the faithful with water – and possibly also a ritual re-enactment of the flooding of the Nile. Robert A. Wild suggests that the deep basin dividing the temple into its eastern and western halves may have been designed to convey flood- or rainwater into the temple during peak rainfall periods in the winter.{{sfn|Wild|1981|p=58}} The basin also served to separate the public western half of the temple from the sacred eastern half. Initiates may have been taken through the underground passages to the cultic area, where they would be presented to the worshippers filling the western end of the temple. Something of this nature is hinted at by Apuleius in ''Metamorphoses'': "There in the middle of this sacred temple before the image of the goddess I was made to stand on a wooden pulpit."{{sfn|Koester|2007|p=175}}

[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Michel de Belgrade.jpg|thumb|200px|[[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)|Saborna Crkva]], the Eastern Orthodox cathedral.]]

'''[[Belgrade]]''', [[Serbia]] has an abundance of '''religious architecture'''. The city has numerous [[Serbian Orthodox]] churches and temples and it is also the seat of the [[Serbian Patriarch|Patriarch]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Its two most prominent [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] places of worship are the [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)|Saborna Crkva]] (the Cathedral Church) and the [[Temple of St. Sava]], the largest [[Orthodox church (building)|Eastern Orthodox church]] in the world.

Other notable Belgrade churches include [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade|St. Mark's Church]], in which rests the body of the first [[Serbian Empire|Serbian Emperor]], [[Stefan Dušan]]. The architecture of this church was greatly inspired by the [[Gračanica monastery]] in the province of [[Kosovo]]. The church of [[Ružica Church|Sveta Ružica]] in the [[Kalemegdan Fortress]] is one of the holiest places in Belgrade for Serbian Orthodox Christians since this was the site where the body of [[Parascheva of the Balkans|St. Paraskeva]] was preserved for several years after the Ottoman conquest, before being taken to [[Romania]] where it still rests today. St. Paraskeva (Sv. Petka) is one of the most important saints to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]].

Belgrade is the seat of a [[Catholic]] archdiocese, with a small Catholic community and several Catholic churches. One of these, St Anthony's, was designed by the noted [[Slovenia]]n architect [[Jože Plečnik]].

There is also a [[Muslim]] community in Belgrade and only one [[mosque]], the [[Bajrakli Mosque, Belgrade|Bajrakli Mosque]] built in 1526 by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]], [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].  It is one of the oldest surviving structures in contemporary Belgrade.

The [[Jew]]ish community is served by the [[Belgrade Synagogue]], which is the only currently active Jewish place of worship in the entire country, although not the only such structure within the city limits.

Belgrade also had an active [[Buddhist]] temple in the first half of the 20th century.  It was built by East [[Russia]]n expatriates fleeing the outcome of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917.

'''The 1904 St. Louis Jain temple''' is a historic structure that was constructed for the 1904 St. Louis World’s fairs, termed "[[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]". It was the first building in the [[United States]] designated as a [[Jain temple]], since it was a temple in [[India]], although there were no [[Jainism|Jains]] in the United States at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Tim J. "Religion, Indian American".  In {{cite book|author1=Huping Ling|author2=Allan W. Austin|title=Asian American History and Culture: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PFnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA353|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47645-0|pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later stood in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] where some members of the Los Angeles Jain community discovered it in 1980. It now stands within the [[Jain Center of Southern California]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Jains Want Their Shrine Miami News, May 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana Purchase Exposition==
At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition it stood within the India pavilion. It was described thus:&lt;ref&gt;The universal exposition of 1904, Volume 1 By David Rowland Francis, Louisiana Purchase Exposition Co. (Saint Louis, Mo.), 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The pavilion, a reproduction of the famous mosque of Itmad-ul-Dowlah at Agra, India, was much admired, as were the interior decorations and exhibits. Rising from the center of the court was a Jain temple of teakwood .., being a copy of a white marble temple eight times as large at Palitana, Central India. The reproduction represented two years' work of sixty-five artists and was made expressly for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.”

After the exposition, the temple was dismantled, but was not shipped back to India as originally planned.

==Las Vegas==
In 1957, San Souci Hotel was built in Las Vegas. It was bought and refurbished in 1963 and given the name [[Castaways (casino)|Castaways]] which used Polynesian Islands in the Pacific Ocean as a theme. Instead of constructing a Polynesian temple, the St. Louis Jain temple structure was acquired, and reconstructed beside the pool. It was given the name '''Gateway to Luck'''. It is unclear when the temple arrived there. It could be seen from across the blue waters of the pool.  Then image of the temple was widely used in the hotels postcards.&lt;ref&gt;Y.K. Malaiya, ‘‘The incredible journey of the 1904 St.Louis Jain temple”, Jain Center of Central Ohio Pratishtha Sovenier,  July 2012,  pp. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt;
The site is now occupied by [[The Mirage]].

==In Los Angeles==
The Jain Center of Southern California was established in 1979, with Mahendra Khandar as the President. In 1980, Lalit Shah and Shirish Seth visited Las Vegas and discovered the temple. In 1981, some of the Jains accompanied by [[Acharya Sushil Kumar]] and [[Chitrabhanu]] saw the temple, and agreed that the temple should belong to a Jain organization. Lalit Shah, then vice-president of the Jain Center of Southern California  approached the Castaways manager Bill Friedman. He offered to have the value of the Temple appraised and sell it to them. The Jains instead requested the estate of  Howard Hughes to donate it to them. In 1987, Castaways was bought by Steve Wynn. Castaways was demolished to make place for the new 3,044-room megaresort Mirage.  The Temple was boxed up again and  was acquired  by the  [[Jain Center of Southern California]] through the efforts of Dr. Manibhai Mehta, a former president. In 1995, the 1600 parts were transported to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;The Palitana Temple of Southern California, Chandrakant Parekh, Jan 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Southern California Jain Center initiated reconstruction of the 42,000 square feet center.&lt;ref&gt;Prominence of Jains in U.S. rises with temple, Ann Pepper, The Orange County Register, October 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The wood temple has been carefully restored with the assistance of Manubhai Shah and MS International who carefully studied who the temple would be put together again. The coating put on it at Las Vegas was removed to restore the original teak look. The structure is 15&amp;nbsp;ft x 20&amp;nbsp;ft x 35&amp;nbsp;ft high and weighs nearly 10,000&amp;nbsp;lbs. It now forms the centerpiece of the Center.  In 2008 the new building was inaugurated.

==Artistic significance==
The 1904 St. Louis temple is not only one of a kind in USA, but is a rare surviving example of Indian tradition of wooden architecture. It has been suggested that it was originally carved at the Ahmadabad Woodcarving Company jointly run by  Muggenbhai [[Hutheesing]] of Ahmedabad and [[Lockwood de Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;An Eastern Fantasia, Asleep for a Century, Mitchell Owens, New York Times, August 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; a painter, orientalist and interior architect of New York City.

==Location==
The temple is located within the Jain Center at Buena Park, California.

[[Image:Miecz001 szymonp.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The copy of Saint Peter's Sword displayed in [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Poznań|Poznań Archcathedral]].]]
{{Peter}}

The '''Sword of Saint Peter''' ({{lang-pl|Miecz świętego Piotra}}) is allegedly the [[sword]] with which the [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]] cut off the right ear of [[Malchus|the high priest's servant]] at the time of [[Arrest of Jesus|Jesus' arrest]] in [[Gethsemane]].

The sword is wide-tipped, similar in shape to a [[dussack]] or [[machete]]. It is in the [[Poznań]] Archdiocesan Museum.

An exact copy of the sword, made by Bogdan Puchalski, is displayed on the wall of the [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Poznań|Poznań Archcathedral Basilica]].

== History ==
The sword is mentioned for the first time in the published in 1609 ''Vitae Episcoporum Posnaniensium'' of [[Jan Długosz]] as being the original Roman sword ([[Gladius]]) used by [[Saint Peter]] in the Gospels, or a direct copy made for [[Pope Stephen VII]]. However, at that time Stephen was already dead, and the current pope was [[Pope John XIII|John XIII]].

The sword arrived in [[Poznań]] in 968 as a gift from John XIII for either [[Jordan, Bishop of Poland|Bishop Jordan]] or [[Mieszko I|Duke Mieszko I]]. The [[Archdeacon]] of Poznań Cathedral in 1699 wrote about the sword, describing it as a part of St. Peter's sword brought to Poznań by Bishop Jordan, where it was usually kept in the [[cathedral treasury]], except for the few times a year when it was shown to the people. The 1721 [[Decree]] of Poznań Cathedral [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] refers to having the sword moved to the [[chapter house]] as a more proper placement for the artifact.

==Folklore==
According to [[English folklore|British folklore]], St. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] brought the sword to [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and it was kept at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] for many years until the abbot gave it to [[Saint George]].&lt;ref name=LBFF&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legends of Berkshire: Folklore or Fact? |last=Ford |first=David Nash |year=1991 |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |location=Wokingham |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/legends/george02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authenticity ==
{{cleanup rewrite|section|date=January 2017}}
{{tone|section|date=January 2017}}
For many years, historians treated the sword as a copy, probably made in the 10th century. However, research by scientists from the [[Polish Army Museum]] in [[Warsaw]] suggests that the weapon could have been made in the 1st century in the eastern borderlands of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poznan.naszemiasto.pl/wydarzenia/540640.html |title=Piotrowy miecz w folii |date=2005-11-25 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=Poznań, Poland |language=pl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225073308/http://poznan.naszemiasto.pl:80/wydarzenia/540640.html |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scientists from the Greater Poland Army Museum in Poznań consider it to be a medieval copy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Other experts, such as Marian Głosek and Leszek Kajzer, suggest that the sword was made in the first quarter of the 14th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Regardless of when the sword was made, it has the longest documented history in [[Poland]], along with the ''[[Szczerbiec]]''.

== Description ==
* The blade was made from a single piece of [[iron]] with an added small [[cross-guard]]
* Total length: {{convert|70.2|cm|in|1}}, it was probably 1 or 2 cm longer, but the tip of the sword was destroyed by [[corrosion]]
* Maximal width, at the tip: {{cvt|9.4|cm|in|1}}
* There is a hole {{cvt|10.3|cm|in|1}} from the end of the hilt, which is {{cvt|0.4|cm|in|1}} in diameter

'''Taxila''' (from [[Pāli]]: Takkasilā, [[Sanskrit]]: तक्षशिला, {{IAST3|Takṣaśilā}}, meaning "City of Cut Stone" or "{{IAST|Takṣa}} Rock") is an important archaeological site of [[ancient India]], located in [[Taxila city]], [[Rawalpindi District]] of the [[Punjab, Pakistan]], situated about {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Islamabad Capital Territory|Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]], just off the famous [[Grand Trunk Road]]. 

Ancient Taxila was situated at the pivotal junction of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Central Asia]]. The origin of Taxila as a city goes back to c. 1000 BCE.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Raymond Allchin, Bridget Allchin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC&amp;pg=PA314 ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan''.] [[Cambridge University Press]], 1982 p.314 {{ISBN|052128550X}} ("The first city of Taxila at Hathial goes back at least to c. 1000 B.C.")&lt;/ref&gt; Some ruins at Taxila date to the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BCE, followed successively by [[Mauryan Empire]], [[Indo-Greek]], [[Indo-Scythian]], and [[Kushan Empire]] periods.

Owing to its strategic location, Taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control. When the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important, the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed by the nomadic [[Huna people|Hunas]] in the 5th century. The renowned archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham|Sir Alexander Cunningham]] rediscovered the ruins of Taxila in the mid-19th century. In 1980, Taxila was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site, 1980.  [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/139/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=153 Taxila: Multiple Locations].  Retrieved 13 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 it was ranked as the top tourist destination in Pakistan by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/oct/17/pakistan?page=all | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Out of the rubble | first=Antonia | last=Windsor | date=17 October 2006 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By some accounts, the [[University of Taxila]] was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) [[university|universities]] in the world.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham |year=2004 |title=Within the Four Seas: The Dialogue of East and West |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-36166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulke 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulke |first=Hermann |authorlink=Hermann Kulke |last2=Rothermund |first2=Dietmar |year=2004 |edition=4th |title=A History of India |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-32919-4|quote=In the early centuries the centre of Buddhist scholarship was the University of Taxila.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="entrepreneurship2007"&gt;[[Balakrishnan Muniapan]], [[Junaid M.

In a 2010 report, [[Global Heritage Fund]] identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most "On the Verge" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/ Global Heritage Fund | GHF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, significant preservation efforts have been carried out since then by the government which have resulted in the site being declared as "well-preserved" by different international publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1101899.shtml|title=Pakistan in efforts to rejuvenate Taxila, one of most important archaeological sites in Asia - Global Times|last=Times|first=Global|website=www.globaltimes.cn|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/12/c_137172822.htm|title=Feature: Pakistan in efforts to rejuvenate Taxila, one of most important archaeological sites in Asia - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the extensive preservation efforts and upkeep, the site is a popular tourist spot, attracting up to one million tourists every year. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/239407/taxila-an-illustration-of-fascinating-influences-of-multiple-civilisations/|title=Taxila: an illustration of fascinating influences of multiple civilisations - Daily Times|date=2018-05-13|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Taxila was known in [[Pali]] as ''Takkasilā'',{{sfn|Scharfe|2002|pp=140,141}} and in [[Sanskrit]] as तक्षशिला (''Takshashila'', {{IAST3|Takṣaśilā}}; "City of Cut Stone"). The Greeks pared the city's name down to Taxila&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|loc=Chapter 3}} which became the name that the Europeans were familiar with ever since the time of Alexander the Great.{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=1}}

Takshashila can also alternately be translated to "Rock of ''Taksha''" in reference to the [[Ramayana]] which states that the city was named in honour of [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]'s son and first ruler, Taksha.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxila, ancient city, Pakistan|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Taxila|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another derivation, Takshashila is related to [[Takshaka]] (Sanskrit for "carpenter") and is an alternate name for the Nāga, a non-Indo-Iranian people of ancient India.{{sfn|Kosambi|1975|p=129}}

[[Faxian]] who had visited the city had given its name's meaning as "Cut off Head". With the help of a [[Jataka]], he had interperted it to be the place where Buddha in his previous birth as Pusa or Chandaprabha cut off his head to feed a hungry lion. This tradition still persists with the area in front of [[Sirkap]] (also meaning "cut off head") was known in the 19th century as ''Babur Khana'' ("House of Tiger"), which alludes to the place where Buddha offered his head. In addition, a hill range to south of Taxila valley is called ''Margala'' ("cut off throat").&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;{{cite journal|journal= The Panjab Past and Present|title=Antiquity, Meaning and Origin of the Name Takshashila or Taxila|volume= 11|issue=2|author=Saifur Rahman Dar|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In traditional sources==
In Vedic texts such as the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], it is mentioned that the Vedic philosopher [[Uddalaka Aruni]] (c. 8th century BCE) had travelled to the region of [[Gandhara]]. In later Buddhist texts, the [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]], it is specified that Taxila was the city where Aruni and his son [[Shvetaketu|Setaketu]] each had received their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalhistory00raycuoft|last=Raychaudhuri|first=Hem Chandra|title=Political history of ancient India, from the accession of Parikshit to the extinction of the Gupta dynasty|year=1923|pages=17–18, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest mentions of Taxila is in [[Pāṇini]]'s ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'',{{sfn|Scharfe|2002|pp=140,141}} a Sanskrit grammar treatise dated to the 5th century BCE.

Much of the [[Hindu]] epic, the [[Mahabharata]], is a conversation between [[Vaishampayana]] (a pupil of the sage, [[Vyasa]]) and King [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]]. It is traditionally believed that the story was first recited by Vaishampayana at the behest of Vyasa during the snake sacrifice performed by Janamejaya at Takshashila.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; The audience also included [[Ugrashravas]], an itinerant bard, who would later recite the story to a group of priests at an [[ashram]] in the [[Naimisha Forest]] from where the story was further disseminated.{{sfn|Davis|2014|p=38}} The [[Kuru Kingdom]]'s heir, [[Parikshit]] (grandson of Arjuna) is said to have been enthroned at Takshashila.{{sfn|Kosambi|1975|p=126}}

The Ramayana describes Takshashila as a magnificent city famed for its wealth which was founded by Bharata, the younger brother of [[Rama]]. Bharata, who also founded nearby [[Pushkalavati]], installed his two sons, Taksha and Pushkala, as the rulers of the two cities.{{sfn|Marshall|1960|p=10}}

In the Buddhist [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]], Taxila is described as the capital of the kingdom of [[Gandhara]] and a great centre of learning with world-famous teachers.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; The Takkasila Jataka, more commonly known as the Telapatta Jataka, tells the tale of a prince of [[Benares]] who is told that he would become the king of Takkasila if he could reach the city within seven days without falling prey to the [[yakkhini]]s who waylaid travellers in the forest.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1937|loc=Telapatta Jātaka (No.96)|ps=: "The Bodhisatta was once the youngest of one hundred sons of the king of Benares. He heard from the Pacceka Buddhas, who took their meals in the palace, that he would become king of Takkasilā if he could reach it without falling a prey to the ogresses who waylaid travellers in the forest. Thereupon, he set out with five of his brothers who wished to accompany him. On the way through the forest the five in succession succumbed to the charms of the ogresses, and were devoured. One ogress followed the Bodhisatta right up to the gates of Takkasilā, where the king took her into the palace, paying no heed to the Bodhisatta's warning. The king succumbed to her wiles, and, during the night, the king and all the inhabitants of the palace were eaten by the ogress and her companions. The people, realising the sagacity and strength of will of the Bodhisatta, made him their king."}}{{sfn|Appleton|2016|pp=23,82}} According to the [[Dipavamsa]], one of Taxila's early kings was a [[Kshatriya]] named Dipankara who was succeeded by twelve sons and grandsons. {{IAST|Kuñjakarṇa}}, mentioned in the [[Avadanakalpalata]], is another king associated with the city.{{sfn|Marshall|1960|p=10}}

In the [[Jain]] tradition, it is said that [[Rishabha]], the first of the [[Tirthankaras]], visited Taxila millions of years ago. His footprints were subsequently consecrated by Bahubali who erected a throne and a [[dharmachakra]] ("wheel of the law") over them several miles in height and circumference.{{sfn|Marshall|1960|p=10}}

==History==
===Early settlement===
The region around Taxila was settled by the [[neolithic]] era, with some ruins at Taxila dating to 3360 BCE.{{sfn|Allchin|Allchin|1988|p=127}} Ruins dating from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Early Harappan]] period around 2900 BCE have also been discovered in the Taxila area,{{sfn|Allchin|Allchin|1988|p=127}} though the area was eventually abandoned after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation.

The first major settlement at Taxila was established around 1000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allchin|Allchin|1988|p=314}}: "The first city of Taxila at Hathial goes back at least to c. 1000 B.C."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/139|title=Taxila|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scharfe|2002|p=141}} By 900 BCE, the city was already involved in regional commerce, as discovered pottery shards reveal trading ties between the city and [[Puṣkalāvatī]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Pant, Shūji Funo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-K5_Z8qsJEC&amp;pg=PA222 ''Stupa and Swastika: Historical Urban Planning Principles in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley.''] NUS Press, 2007 {{ISBN|9971693720}}, citing Allchin: 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Taxila was sometimes ruled as part of the [[Gandhara]] kingdom (whose capital was Pushkalavati), particularly after the Achaemenid period, but Taxila sometimes formed its own independent district or city-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNUwBYGYgxsC&amp;pg=PA36 | title=The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys| isbn=9780875868592| last1=Samad| first1=Rafi U| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=16-17,30,71}}

Taxila was founded in a strategic location along the ancient [[Grand Trunk Road|"Royal Highway"]] that connected the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] capital at [[Pataliputra]] in [[Bihar]], with ancient [[Peshawar]], [[Puṣkalāvatī]], and onwards towards [[Central Asia]] via [[Kashmir]], [[Bactria]], and [[Kapisa (city)|Kāpiśa]].{{sfn|Thapar|1997|p=237}} Taxila thus changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control.

[[File:Eastern border of the Achaemenid Empire.jpg|thumb|Eastern border of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]]]

===Achaemenid===
{{see also|Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley}}
Archaeological excavations show that the city may have grown significantly during the rule of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BCE. In 516 BCE, [[Darius I]] embarked on a campaign to conquer [[Central Asia]], ''[[Ariana]]'' and ''[[Bactria]]'', before marching onto what is now [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]]. Emperor Darius spent the winter of 516-515 BCE in the ''[[Gandhara]]'' region surrounding Taxila, and prepared to conquer the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]], which he did in 515 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/da-dd/darius/darius_i_8.html|title=Darius the Great - 8. Travels - Livius|website=www.livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he appointed [[Scylax of Caryanda]] to explore the [[Indian Ocean]] from the mouth of the Indus to the [[Suez]]. Darius then returned to [[Persia]] via the [[Bolan Pass]]. The region continued under Achaemenid suzerainty under the reign of Xerxes I, and continued under Achaemenid rule for over a century.{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=83}}

===Hellenistic===
{{see also|Indian campaign of Alexander the Great}}
[[Image:AlexanderIndiaMap.jpg|thumb|A map of Alexander's campaign in [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|ancient India]].]]
During his invasion of the [[Indus Valley]], [[Alexander the Great]] was able to gain control of Taxila in 326 BCE without a battle, as the city was surrendered by its ruler, king [[Āmbhi|Omphis]] (Āmbhi).{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=83}} Greek historians accompanying Alexander described Taxila as “wealthy, prosperous, and well governed.”{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=83}}

===Mauryan===

By 317 BCE, the Greek [[satrap]]s left by Alexander were driven out,{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=31}} and Taxila came under the control of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], who turned Taxila into a regional capital. His advisor, [[Chanakya|Kautilya/Chanakya]], was said to have taught at Taxila's university.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=22,54}} Under the reign of [[Ashoka]], Chandragupta's grandson, the city was made a great seat of Buddhist learning, though the city was home to a minor rebellion during this time.{{sfn|Thapar|1997|p=52}}

===Indo-Greek===
In the 2nd century BCE, Taxila was annexed by the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] of [[Bactrian Greek|Bactria]]. Indo-Greeks built a new capital, [[Sirkap]], on the opposite bank of the river from Taxila.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=75}} During this new period of Bactrian Greek rule, several dynasties (like [[Antialcidas]]) likely ruled from the city as their capital. During lulls in Greek rule, the city managed profitably on its own, to independently control several local trade guilds, who also minted most of the city's autonomous coinage. In about the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE, an [[Indo-Scythian]] king named [[Azilises]] had three mints, one of which was at Taxila, and struck coins with obverse legends in Greek and [[Kharoṣṭhī]].

The last Greek king of Taxila was overthrown by the [[Indo-Scythian]] chief [[Maues]] around 90 BCE.{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=84}} [[Gondophares]], founder of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]], conquered Taxila around 20 BCE, and made Taxila his capital.{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=85}} According to early Christian legend, [[Thomas the Apostle]] visited Gondophares IV around 46 CE,{{sfn|Medlycott|1905|loc=Chapter: The Apostle Thomas and Gondophares the Indian King}} possibly at Taxila given that that city was Gondophares' capital city.

===Kushan===
In the first century CE, the Greek [[Neopythagorean]] philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] visited Taxila, which his team described as a fortified city laid out on a symmetrical plan, similar in size to ''[[Nineveh]].'' Inscriptions dating to 76 CE demonstrate that the city had come under [[Kushan]] rule by this time, after the city was captured from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] by [[Kujula Kadphises]], founder of the [[Kushan Empire]].{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=80}} The great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] later founded ''[[Sirsukh]]'', the most recent of the ancient settlements at Taxila.

===Gupta===

In the mid fourth century CE, the Gupta Empire occupied the territories in Eastern [[Gandhara]], establishing a Kumaratya's post at Taxila. The City became well known for its Trade links- including Silk, Sandalwood, Horses, Cotton, Silverware, Pearls, and Spices. It is during this time that the City heavily features in Classical Indian Literature- both as a centre of Culture as well as a militarised border City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/30145861|title=Treasures of the Gupta Empire - A Catalogue of Coins of the Gupta Dynasty|last=Kumar |first=Sanjeev |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient India by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxila's university remained in existence during the travels of Chinese pilgrim [[Faxian]], who visited Taxila around 400 CE.{{sfn|Needham|2005|p=135}} He wrote that Taxila's name translated as "the Severed Head", and was the site of a story in the life of [[Buddha]] "where he gave his head to a man".&lt;ref&gt;''A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms, Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fa-Hsien of his Travels in India and Ceylon in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
The [[Kidarites]], vassals of the [[Hephthalite Empire]] are known to have invaded Taxila in c. 450 CE. Though repelled by the Gupta Emperor [[Skandagupta]], the city would not recover- probably on account of the strong Hunnic presence in the area, breakdown of trade as well as the [[Kidarites#Conflicts with the Gupta Empire|three-way war between Persia, the Kidarite State, and the Huns in Western Gandhara]].

The [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] swept over ''Gandhāra'' and [[Punjab]] around 470 CE, causing widespread devastation and destruction of Taxila's famous Buddhist monasteries and [[stupa]]s, a blow from which the city would never recover. From 500 CE to 540 CE, the city fell under the control of the Hunnic Empire in South Asia and languished.{{sfn|Marshall|1951|p=86}}

[[Xuanzang]] visited India between 629 to 645 CE. Taxila which was desolate and half-ruined was visited by him in 630 CE, and found most of its [[sangharama]]s still ruined and desolate. Only a few monks remained there. He adds that the kingdom had become a dependency of [[Kashmir]] with the local leaders fighting amongst themselves for power. He noted that it had some time previously been a subject of [[Ancient Kapisa|Kapisa]]. By the ninth century, it became a dependency of the [[Kabul Shahis]]. The Turki Shahi dynasty of Kabul was replaced by the Hindu Shahi dynasty which was overthrown by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] with the defeat of [[Trilochanpala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEMbH2aDO0UC&amp;pg=PA39|title=A Guide to Taxila|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=39, 46|isbn=9781107615441|date=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Persepolis to the Punjab: Exploring Ancient Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan|authors=Elizabeth Errington, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis|publisher=British Museum Press|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre of learning==
[[File:SirkapCity.JPG|thumb|A view over the ruins of Sirkap.]]
{{main|Ancient higher-learning institutions}}
By some accounts, Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) [[university|universities]] in the world.{{sfn|Needham|2005|p=135}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=157}}{{sfn|Mookerji|1989|pp=478,479}} Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Altekar|1965|p=109}}: "It may be observed at the outset that Taxila did not possess any colleges or university in the modern sense of the term."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall|1951|p=81}}: "We come across several [[Jātaka]] stories about the students and teachers of Takshaśilā, but not a single episode even remotely suggests that the different 'world renowned' teachers living in that city belonged to a particular college or university of the modern type."|author=F. W. Thomas (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the later [[Nalanda]] university in eastern India.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Taxila became a noted centre of learning (including the religious teachings of [[Buddhism]]) at least several centuries BCE, and continued to attract students from around the old world until the destruction of the city in the 5th century. It has been suggested that at its height, Taxila exerted a sort of "intellectual suzerainty" over other centres of learning in India and its primary concern was not with elementary, but higher education.{{sfn|Mookerji|1989|pp=478,479}} Generally, a student entered Taxila at the age of sixteen. The ancient and the most revered scriptures, and the Eighteen ''Silpas'' or Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of [[military science]].{{sfn|Mookerji|1989|pp=478–489}} Students came to Taxila from far-off places such as [[Varanasi|Kashi]], [[Kosala]] and Magadha, in spite of the long and arduous journey they had to undergo, on account of the excellence of the learned teachers there, all recognised as authorities on their respective subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prakash|1964}}: "Students from Magadha traversed the vast distances of northern India in order to join the schools and colleges of Taxila. We learn from Pali texts that Brahmana youths, Khattiya princes and sons of setthis from Rajagriha, Kashi, Kosala and other places went to Taxila for learning the Vedas and eighteen sciences and arts."&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}{{sfn|Apte|p=9}}

===Notable students and teachers===
Taxila had great influence on Hindu culture and the [[Sanskrit]] language. It is perhaps best known for its association with [[Chanakya]], also known as [[Kautilya]], the strategist who guided [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and assisted in the founding of the [[Mauryan]] empire. Chanakya's [[Arthashastra]] (''The knowledge of Economics'') is said to have been composed in Taxila.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120535/http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 Kautilya].  Encyclopædia Britannica. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120535/http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 |date=10 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=17}} The [[Ayurvedic]] healer [[Charaka]] also studied at Taxila.{{sfn|Mookerji|1989|pp=478–489}} He also started teaching at Taxila in the later period.&lt;ref name=Takshila&gt;{{cite web|title=Takshila university|url=http://www.taksha.org/about/history|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2017}} [[Pāṇini]], the grammarian who codified the rules that would define [[Classical Sanskrit]], has also been part of the community at Taxila.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prakash|1964}}: "Pāṇini and Kautilya, two masterminds of ancient times, were also brought up in the academic traditions of Taxila"&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

The institution is significant in Buddhist tradition since it is believed that the [[Mahāyāna]] branch of [[Buddhism]] took shape there.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Jīvaka]], the court physician of the Magadha emperor [[Bimbisara]] who once cured the Buddha, and the Buddhism-supporting ruler of Kosala, Prasenajit, are some important personalities mentioned in Pali texts who studied at Taxila.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prakash|1964}}: "Likewise, Jivaka, the famous physician of Bimbisara who cured the Buddha, learnt the science of medicine under a far-famed teacher at Taxila and on his return was appointed court-physician at Magadha. Another illustrious product of Taxila was the enlightened ruler of Kosala, Prasenajit, who is intimately associated with the events of the time of the Buddha."&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

No external authorities like kings or local leaders subjected the scholastic activities at Taxila to their control. Each teacher formed his own institution, enjoying complete autonomy in work, teaching as many students as he liked and teaching subjects he liked without conforming to any centralised syllabus. Study terminated when the teacher was satisfied with the student's level of achievement. In general, specialisation in a subject took around eight years, though this could be lengthened or shortened in accordance with the intellectual abilities and dedication of the student in question. In most cases the "schools" were located within the teachers' private houses, and at times students were advised to quit their studies if they were unable to fit into the social, intellectual and moral atmosphere there.{{sfn|Apte|pp=9,10}}

Knowledge was considered too sacred to be bartered for money, and hence any stipulation that fees ought to be paid was vigorously condemned{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Financial support came from the society at large, as well as from rich merchants and wealthy parents{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Though the number of students studying under a single Guru sometimes numbered in the hundreds, teachers did not deny education even if the student was poor; free boarding and lodging was provided, and students had to do manual work in the household{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Paying students, such as princes, were taught during the day, while non-paying ones were taught at night.{{sfn|Apte|pp=16,17}} [[Dakshina#Gurudakshina|Gurudakshina]] was usually expected at the completion of a student's studies, but it was essentially a mere token of respect and gratitude - many times being nothing more than a turban, a pair of sandals, or an umbrella. In cases of poor students being unable to afford even that, they could approach the king, who would then step in and provide something. Not providing a poor student a means to supply his Guru's Dakshina was considered the greatest slur on a King's reputation.{{sfn|Apte|pp=18,19}}

Examinations were treated as superfluous, and not considered part of the requirements to complete one's studies{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. The process of teaching was critical and thorough- unless one unit was mastered completely, the student was not allowed to proceed to the next{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. No convocations were held upon completion, and no written "degrees" were awarded, since it was believed that knowledge was its own reward. Using knowledge for earning a living or for any selfish end was considered sacrilegious.{{sfn|Apte|pp=9,10}}

Students arriving at Taxila usually had completed their primary education at home (until the age of eight), and their secondary education in the Ashrams (between the ages of eight and twelve), and therefore came to Taxila chiefly to reach the ends of knowledge in specific disciplines.{{sfn|Apte|p=11}}

==Ruins==
[[File:Dharmarajika stupa,Taxila.jpg|thumb|The Dharmarajika Stupa]]
The sites of a number of important cities noted in ancient Indian texts were identified by scholars early in the 19th century. The lost city of Taxila, however, was not identified until later, in 1863-64. Its identification was made difficult partly due to errors in the distances recorded by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]] which pointed to a location somewhere on the [[Haro River|Haro river]], two days march from the [[Indus River|Indus]]. [[Alexander Cunningham]], the founder and the first director-general of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], noticed that this position did not agree with the descriptions provided in the itineraries of Chinese pilgrims and in particular, that of [[Xuanzang]], the 7th-century Buddhist monk. Unlike Pliny, these sources noted that the journey to Taxila from the Indus took three days and not two. Cunningham's subsequent explorations in 1863–64 of a site at Shah-dheri convinced him that his hypothesis was correct.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=265}}
{{quote|Now as Hwen Thsang, on his return to China, was accompanied by laden elephants, his three days' journey from {{sic|''Takhshasila''}} to the Indus at ''Utakhanda'', or Ohind, must necessarily have been of the same length as those of modern days, and, consequently, the site of the city must be looked for somewhere in the neighbourhood of ''Kâla-ka-sarâi''. This site is found near ''Shah-dheri'', just one mile to the north-east of ''Kâla-ka-sarâi'', in the extensive ruins of a fortified city, around which I was able to trace no less than 55 stupas, of which two are as large as the great [[Manikyala]] tope, twenty eight monasteries, and nine temples.|author=Alexander Cunningham|source={{sfn|Cunningham|1871|p=105}}}}

Taxila's archaeological sites lie near [[Taxila (modern)|modern Taxila]] about {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the city of [[Rawalpindi]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; The sites were first excavated by [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], who worked at Taxila over a period of twenty years from 1913.{{sfn|Wheeler|2008}}

[[File:Jaulian_Buddhist_Monastery_in_Taxila.jpg|thumb|Panorama of the [[Jaulian]] monastery]]
The vast archaeological site includes [[neolithic]] remains dating to 3360 BCE, and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Early Harappan]] remains dating to 2900–2600 BCE at ''Sarai Kala''.{{sfn|Allchin|Allchin|1988|p=127}} Taxila, however, is most famous for ruins of several settlements, the earliest dating from around 1000 BCE. It is also known for its collection of Buddhist religious monuments, including the [[Dharmarajika|Dharmarajika stupa]], the [[Jaulian]] monastery, and the [[Mohra Muradu]] monastery.

The main ruins of Taxila include four major cities, each belonging to a distinct time period, at three different sites. The earliest settlement at Taxila is found in the [[Hathial]] section, which yielded pottery shards that date from as early as the late 2nd millennium BCE to the 6th century BCE. The [[Bhir Mound]] ruins at the site date from the 6th century BCE, and are adjacent to ''Hathial''. The ruins of [[Sirkap]] date to the 2nd century BCE, and were built by the region's [[Greco-Bactrian]] kings who ruled in the region following [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of the region in 326 BCE. The third and most recent settlement is that of [[Sirsukh]], which was built by rulers of the [[Kushan]] empire, who ruled from nearby ''Purushapura'' (modern [[Peshawar]]).

=== World Heritage Site ===
Taxila was designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1980 in particular for the ruins of the four settlement sites which "reveal the pattern of urban evolution on the Indian subcontinent through more than five centuries". The serial site includes a number of monuments and other historical places of note in the area besides the four settlements at Bhir, Saraikala, Sirkap, and Sirsukh.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxila|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/139|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They number 18 in all:&lt;ref name="unescomap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxila Map|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/139/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=153|website=whc.unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=29 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 report, [[Global Heritage Fund]] identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most "on the Verge" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/|title=Global Heritage Fund - GHF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820022935/http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/|archivedate=20 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was announced that [[Thailand]] would assist in conservation efforts at Taxila, as well as at Buddhist sites in the [[Swat Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand to provide assistance for restoration of Ghandhara Archelogical [sic] sites|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/16-Jan-2017/thailand-to-provide-assistance-for-restoration-of-ghandhara-archelogical-sites|accessdate=1 June 2017|agency=The Nation|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Satanic Verses'' controversy''', also known as the '''Rushdie Affair''', was the heated and frequently violent reaction of [[Muslims]] to the publication of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', which was first published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1988 and inspired in part by the life of [[Muhammad]]. Many Muslims accused Rushdie of [[blasphemy]] or unbelief and in 1989 the Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] of Iran issued a [[fatwa]] ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie. Numerous killings, attempted killings, and bombings resulted from violent Muslims over the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Jacobson. ''Islam in transition: religion and identity among British Pakistani youth''. 1998, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iranian government]] backed the fatwa against Rushdie until 1998, when the succeeding government of Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] said it no longer supported the killing of Rushdie.&lt;ref name="HttpquerynytimescomgstfullpagehtmlresFEDFFAACAE"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DF1439F936A1575AC0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Barbara | last=Crossette | title=Iran Drops Rushdie Death Threat, And Britain Renews Teheran Ties | date=25 September 1998 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224152053/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DF1439F936A1575AC0A96E958260 | archivedate=24 February 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fatwa remains in place.&lt;ref name=fatwacont/&gt;

==Background==
Even before the publication of ''The Satanic Verses'', the books of Salman Rushdie had stoked controversy. Rushdie saw his role as a writer "as including the function of antagonist to the state".&lt;ref&gt;Rushdie, Salman, ''Jaguar Smile''; New York: Viking, 1987, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; His second book ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' angered [[Indira Gandhi]] because it seemed to suggest "that Mrs. Gandhi was responsible for the death of [[Feroze Gandhi|her husband]] through neglect".&lt;ref name="Netton"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text and Trauma: An East-West Primer |author=Ian Richard Netton|year=1996|publisher=Routledge Curzon|location=Richmond, UK|isbn=0-7007-0325-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1983 ''[[roman à clef]]'' ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]'' "took an aim on Pakistan, its political characters, its culture and its religion... [It covered] a central episode in Pakistan's internal life, which portrays as a family squabble between Iskander Harappa ([[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]) and his successor and executioner Raza Hyder ([[Zia ul-Haq]])... 'The Virgin Ironpants'... has been identified as [[Benazir Bhutto]], a Prime Minister of Pakistan".&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt;

Positions Rushdie took as a committed leftist prior to the publication of his book were the source of some controversy. He defended many of those who would later attack him during the controversy. Rushdie forcefully denounced the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s government and supported the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of Iran]], at least in its early stages. He condemned the [[1986 Bombing of Libya|US bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986]] but found himself threatened by [[Libya]]'s leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] three years later.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a book bitterly critical of [[US foreign policy]] in general and its [[Sandinista#Sandinistas vs. Contras|war in Nicaragua]] in particular, for example calling the [[United States government]], "the bandit posing as sheriff".&lt;ref&gt;Rushdie, ''Jaguar Smile'', Viking, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; After the Ayatollah's fatwa however, he was accused by Iranian government of being "an inferior [[CIA]] agent".&lt;ref&gt;"The book's author is in England but the real supporter is the United States"&amp;nbsp;– Interior Minister Mohtashemi (IRNA 17 February 1989) "An Iranian government statement called Rushdie "an inferior CIA agent" and referred to the book as a "provocative American deed"". (IRNA 14 February 1989) (Pipes, 1990, p.129)&lt;/ref&gt; A few years earlier, an official jury appointed by a ministry of the Iranian Islamic government had bestowed an award on the [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of Rushdie's book ''Shame'', which up until then was the only time a government had awarded Rushdie's work a prize.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}

==Controversial elements of ''The Satanic Verses''==
{{Further|Satanic Verses}}
"[V]ehement protest against Rushdie's book" began with the title itself. The title refers to a legend of the Islamic Prophet [[Mohammad]], when a few verses were supposedly spoken by him as part of the [[Qur'an]], and then withdrawn on the grounds that [[the devil]] had sent them to deceive Mohammad into thinking they came from [[Allah|God]]. These "[[Satanic Verses]]" are found in verses eighteen to twenty-two in surah An-Najim of the Qur'an,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quran.com/53/18-22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306203937/http://quran.com/53/18-22 |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by accounts from Tabari, but is seldom mentioned in the first biography of Mohammad by [[Ibn Ishaq]]. The verses also appear in other accounts of the prophet's life. They permitted prayer to three pre-Islamic [[Quraysh (tribe)|Meccan]] goddesses: [[Al-lāt]], [[Uzza]], and [[Manāt]]—a violation of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt; The utterance and withdrawal of the so-called Satanic Verses forms an important sub-plot in the novel, which recounts several episodes in the life of Muhammad. The phrase Arab historians and later Muslims used to describe the incident of the withdrawn verses was not "Satanic verses", but the ''gharaniq'' verses; the phrase 'Satanic verses' was unknown to Muslims, and was coined by Western academics specialising in the [[Orientalism|study of Middle Eastern culture]]. The story itself is not found in the six Sahih of the sunni or the shiite sources, so much so that Muraghi, in his commentary, says: "These traditions are undoubtedly a fabrication of the heretics and foreign hands, and have not been found in any of the authentic books" ...&lt;ref name="Muraghi"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tafsir Muraghi, vol. 17, pg. 130, under the abovementioned verse.|author=Al Muraghi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qharanic"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Myth of Gharaniq or 'The Satanic Verses'?|author=Ayatullah al-'Uzma al-Hajj ash-Shaykh Nasir Makarim Shirazi|url=http://www.al-islam.org/180-questions-about-islam-vol-2-various-issues-makarim-shirazi/43-what-myth-gharaniq-or-'-satanic|publisher=The Islamic Education Board of the World Federation of Khoja Shia Ithna-Asheri Muslim Communities|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701110337/http://www.al-islam.org/180-questions-about-islam-vol-2-various-issues-makarim-shirazi/43-what-myth-gharaniq-or-%E2%80%98-satanic|archivedate=1 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Pipes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Pipes]]&lt;/ref&gt; when attention was drawn to a book with this title, "Muslims found [it] incredibly sacrilegious", and took it to imply that the book's author claimed that verses of the Qur'an were "the work of the Devil".&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam and Postcolonial Narrative|author=John D. Erickson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=1998|isbn=0-511-00769-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McRoy (2007), other controversial elements included the use of the name [[Mahound]], said to be a derogatory term for Muhammad used by the English during the [[Crusades]]; the use of the term Jahilia, denoting the 'time of ignorance' before Islam, for the holy city of [[Mecca]]; the use of the name of the [[Angels in Islam|Angel]] [[Jibril|Gibreel]] (Gabriel) for a film star, of the name of [[Saladin]], the great Muslim hero of the Crusades, for a devil, and the name of [[Aisha|Ayesha]] the wife of Muhammad for a fanatical Indian girl who leads her village on a fatal pilgrimage. Moreover, the brothel of the city of [[Jahilia]] was staffed by prostitutes with the same names as [[Muhammad's marriages|Muhammad's wives]],&lt;ref name="Pipes65"&gt;Pipes, 1990, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; who are viewed by Muslims as '[[Mother of the Believers|the Mothers of all Believers]]'.&lt;ref name="McRoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Muslims feel angry about the Rushdie knighthood|date=1 July 2007|author=Anthony McRoy|url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=875 |publisher=Religious Intelligence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215055220/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=875 |archivedate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other issues many Muslims have found offensive include [[Islamic views on Abraham|Abraham]] being called a "bastard" for casting [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] and [[Ishmael]] in the desert;&lt;ref name = Bombay&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Michael M. J.

[[Daniel Pipes]] identified other more general issues in the book likely to have angered pious Muslims: A complaint in the book by one of Mahound's companions: "rules about every damn thing, if a man farts let him turn his face to the wind, a rule about which hand to use for the purpose of cleaning one's behind ...", which was said to mix up "Islamic law with its opposite and with the author's whimsy";&lt;ref name="Pipes65"/&gt; the prophet of Rushdie's novel, as he lies dying, being visited in a dream by the Goddess [[Al-lāt]], on the grounds that this suggested either that she exists or that the prophet thought she did; the angel Gibreel's vision of the Supreme Being in another dream as "not abstract in the least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of about the same age as himself", balding, wearing glasses and "seeming to suffer from dandruff".&lt;ref name="Pipes67"&gt;Pipes, 1990, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; A complaint by one of the characters about communal violence in India: "Fact is, religious faith, which encodes the highest aspirations of human race, is now, in our country, the servant of lowest instincts, and God is the creature of evil".&lt;ref name="Pipes67"/&gt;

''[[Guardian newspaper|The Guardian]]'' newspaper published on 14 September 2012 a series of recollections of various British people involved in the controversy. [[Lisa Appignanesi]], ex-president of English [[English PEN|PEN]], observed "Intransigence is never so great as when it feels it has a god on its side." One of the lawyers involved, [[Geoffrey Robertson]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], rehearsed the arguments and replies made when 13 Muslim [[barristers]] had lodged a formal indictment against Rushdie for the crime of [[blasphemous libel]]: it was said that God was described in the book as "the Destroyer of Man", yet he is described as such in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Book of Revelation]], especially of men who are unbelievers or enemies of the Jews; that the book contained criticisms of the prophet Abraham, yet the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions themselves see Abraham as not without fault and deserving of criticism; that Rushdie referred to Mohammed as "Mahound", a conjurer, a magician and a false prophet, yet these remarks are made by a drunken apostate, a character with whom neither reader nor author has any sympathy; that the book insults the wives of the Prophet by having whores use their names, yet the wives are explicitly said to be chaste and the adoption of their names by whores is to symbolise the corruption of the city then being described (perhaps symbolising Mecca in its pre-Islamic state); that the book vilified the companions of the Prophet, calling them "bums from Persia" and "clowns", yet the character saying this is a hack poet hired to write propaganda against the Prophet and does not reflect the author's beliefs; that the book criticised Islam for having too many rules and seeking to control every aspect of life, yet while characters in the book do make such remarks these cannot constitute blasphemy since they do not vilify God or the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/looking-at-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Salman Rushdie (Author),Fiction (Books genre),Publishing (Books),Books,Culture,Blake Morrison,Hari Kunzru (author),Ian McEwan (Author),Peter Carey (Author),Hanif Kureishi (Author),Fay Weldon (Author),Religion (Books genre),Religion (News),Michael Holroyd | date=14 September 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121121224/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/looking-at-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses | archivedate=21 January 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reaction==
Before the publication of ''The Satanic Verses'', the publisher received "warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant" that the book might be controversial.&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt; Later, Rushdie would reflect upon the time that the book was about to be published. Speaking to an interviewer, he said, "I expected a few [[mullah]]s would be offended, call me names, and then I could defend myself in public... I honestly never expected anything like this".&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt;

''The Satanic Verses'' was published by [[Viking Penguin]] on 26 September 1988 in the UK, and on 22 February 1989 in the US.&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt; Upon its publication the book garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United Kingdom. On 8 November 1988, the work received the [[1988 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Award]] for novel of the year,&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt; worth £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; According to one observer, "almost all the British book reviewers" were unaware of the book's connection to Islam because Rushdie has used the name Mahound instead of Muhammad for his chapter on Islam.&lt;ref name="Pipes65"/&gt;

===Muslim response and book bannings===

In Islamic communities, the novel became instantly controversial, because of what some Muslims considered [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] references. Rushdie was accused of misusing [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdolkarim Soroush]]'s speech in the US, November 2002, Farsi Text, it has been published in [http://www.drsoroush.com/PDF/F-CMB-13820100-Freedom_of_Speech.pdf Aftab monthly magazine in April 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613060231/http://www.drsoroush.com/PDF/F-CMB-13820100-Freedom_of_Speech.pdf |date=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 1988, letters and phone calls arrived at Viking Penguin from Muslims, angry with the book and demanding that it be withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt; Before the end of the month, the import of the book was [[Banned books|banned]] in India, although possession of the book is not a criminal offence.&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-25/india/30662344_1_import-ban-book-satanic-verses | work=The Times of India | title=Reading 'Satanic Verses' legal | date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1988, it was also banned in [[Bangladesh]], [[Sudan]], and South Africa. By December 1988, it was also banned in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt;

In Britain on 2 December 1988, 7,000 Muslims in the town of [[Bolton]] staged the first ever demonstration against ''The Satanic Verses''. After the Friday prayers, a certain section of the congregation marched from the Zakariyya Jame Masjid to the town centre and then burned the book. The organisers claimed "It was a peaceful protest, and we burned the book to try and attract public attention".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lustig, Martin Bailey, Simon de Bruxelles and Ian Mather The Guardian newspapers story of events around the Book {{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1989/feb/19/race.world |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008235518/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1989/feb/19/race.world |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of Bradford]] gained international attention in January 1989 when some of its members organised a public book-burning of ''The Satanic Verses'', evoking as the journalist [[Robert Winder]] recalled "images of medieval (not to mention Nazi) intolerance".&lt;ref name=winder&gt;Winder, Robert. ''Bloody Foreigners: The Story of Immigration to Britain''. Abacus, London: 2013: p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, when the US edition was published, a new round of reviews and criticism began. 
March 1989 saw it banned in Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Singapore.&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt;  The last nation to ban the book was Venezuela, in June 1989.&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt;

====Attacks====

In the United States, the [[FBI]] was notified of 78 threats to bookstores in early March 1989, thought to be a small proportion of the total number of threats. [[B. Dalton]] bookstore chain received 30 threats in less than three hours. Bombings of book stores included two in [[Berkeley, California]]. In New York, the office of a community newspaper, ''[[The Riverdale Press]]'', was all but destroyed by firebombs following the publication of an editorial defending the right to read the novel and criticising the bookstores that pulled it from their shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitt|first1=David E.|title=Office of Weekly Paper in Riverdale Is Firebombed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/01/nyregion/office-of-weekly-paper-in-riverdale-is-firebombed.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|work=The New York Times|date=1 March 1989|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525103953/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/01/nyregion/office-of-weekly-paper-in-riverdale-is-firebombed.html|archivedate=25 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the United Kingdom was the country where violence against bookstores occurred most often and persisted the longest. Two large bookstores in [[Charing Cross]] Road, London, ([[Collets Bookshop|Collets]] and [[Dillons Booksellers|Dillons]]) were bombed on 9 April. In May, explosions went off in the town of [[High Wycombe]] and again in London, on [[Kings Road]]. Other bombings included one at a large London department store ([[Liberty &amp; Co.|Liberty's]]), in connection with the Penguin Bookshop inside the store, and at the Penguin store in [[York]]. Unexploded devices were found at Penguin stores in [[Guildford]], [[Nottingham]], and [[Peterborough]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the United States, it was unavailable in about one-third of bookstores. In many others that carried the book, it was kept under the counter.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.169-171&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Fatwa}}Fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini==
After the book was first published in the United Kingdom, in September 1988, there were protests by Muslims mainly in India and the UK. 
When it was published in the United States, six months later (in February 1989), it received renewed attention, and the protests took a more deadly form.  
 
On 12 February 1989, a  10,000-strong protest against Rushdie and the book took place in Islamabad, Pakistan.  Six protesters were killed in an attack on the American Cultural Center, and an [[American Express]] office was ransacked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jK9LnwmaAgC&amp;dq=Iran+Rushdie+%22diplomatic+relations%22+%227+March%22&amp;q=Islamabad#v=snippet&amp;q=Islamabad&amp;f=false ''The Rushdie File'', p. 67] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120231224/https://books.google.com/books?id=9jK9LnwmaAgC&amp;dq=Iran+Rushdie+%22diplomatic+relations%22+%227+March%22&amp;q=Islamabad |date=20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and one of the most prominent [[Shi'a]] Muslim leaders, issued a [[fatwa]] calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers. This created a major international incident that persisted for decades.

Broadcast on Iranian radio, the judgement read:

{{quote|[[Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un|We are from Allah and to Allah we shall return]]. I am informing all brave Muslims of the world that the author of The Satanic Verses, a text written, edited, and published against Islam, the Prophet of Islam, and the Qur'an, along with all the editors and publishers aware of its contents, are condemned to death. I call on all valiant Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay, so that no one will dare insult the sacred beliefs of Muslims henceforth. And whoever is killed in this cause will be a martyr, Allah Willing.

Khomeini did not give a legal reasoning for his judgement.  It is thought to be based on the ninth chapter of the Qur'an, called [[At-Tawba]], verse 61: "Some of them hurt the prophet by saying, 'He is all ears!' Say, 'It is better for you that he listens to you. He believes in God, and trusts the believers. He is a mercy for those among you who believe.' Those who hurt God's messenger have incurred a painful retribution".&lt;ref name="rel"&gt;{{Cite book|title=''The Resilience of Conservative Religion: The Case of Popular, Conservative Protestant Congregations''|author=Joseph Bernard Tamney|publisher=The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge| location=Cambridge, UK|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However [[#On Islamic grounds|it was not explained]] how that chapter could support such a judgement.

Over the next few days, Iranian officials offered a bounty of $6 million for killing Rushdie, who was thus forced to live under police protection for the next nine years. On 7 March 1989, the [[United Kingdom-Iran relations|United Kingdom and Iran broke diplomatic relations]] over the Rushdie controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jK9LnwmaAgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Iran+Rushdie+%22diplomatic+relations%22+%227+March%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2UfqvkDitf&amp;sig=bHgzrtp4oYQNNGMbq4q6tfON8Es&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r5DgU8P8JMyw7Ab7oIGwBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Iran%20Rushdie%20%22diplomatic%20relations%22%20%227%20March%22&amp;f=false Letter from the Private Secretary, 16 March 1989: quoted in ''The Rushdie File, p. 120] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120231224/https://books.google.com/books?id=9jK9LnwmaAgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Iran+Rushdie+%22diplomatic+relations%22+%227+March%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2UfqvkDitf&amp;sig=bHgzrtp4oYQNNGMbq4q6tfON8Es&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r5DgU8P8JMyw7Ab7oIGwBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA |date=20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="month-rushdies"&gt;[http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR14.4/rushdie.html The Month of Rushdies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820235838/http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR14.4/rushdie.html |date=20 August 2016 }}, Eliot Weinberger.

===Rushdie's apology and reaction===

====Rushdie's apology====
On 18 February, Iran's President [[Ali Khamenei]] (who would later that year succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader) suggested that if Rushdie "apologises and disowns the book, people may forgive him".&lt;ref name="Moin, 2001 p.284"&gt;from Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2001), p.284, (Issued 18 February, Obtained by Baqer Moin from the Archbishop of Canterbury's aides.)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following this, Rushdie issued "a carefully worded statement",&lt;ref name="Moin, 2001 p.284"/&gt; saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I recognize that Muslims in many parts of the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly regret the distress the publication has occasioned to the sincere followers of Islam. Living as we do in a world of many faiths, this experience has served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the sensibilities of others.&lt;ref name="Moin, 2001 p.284"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran "via official channels" before being released to the press.&lt;ref name="Moin, 2001 p.284"/&gt;

====Rejection of Rushdie's apology====
On 19 February 1990, Ayatollah Khomeini's office replied:

{{quote|The imperialist foreign media falsely alleged that the officials of the Islamic Republic have said the sentence of death on the author of ''The Satanic Verses'' will be retracted if he repents. Imam Khomeini has said:

This is denied 100%. Even if Salman Rushdie repents and become the most pious man of all time, it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and wealth, to send him to Hell.}}

The Imam added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a non-Muslim becomes aware of Rushdie's whereabouts and has the ability to execute him quicker than Muslims, it is incumbent on Muslims to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2001), p.284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McRoy (2007) stated that Khomeini's interpretation of the Islamic law that led him to refuse the apology follows the same line of reasoning as  [[Al-Shafi'i]] (9th century jurist), who in his ''Risala'' (Maliki Manual 37.19 ''Crimes Against Islam'') ruled that an "apostate is also killed unless he repents... Whoever abuses the Messenger of God ... is to be executed, and his repentance is not accepted".&lt;ref name="McRoy"/&gt;

===Support for Khomeini's fatwa===
In Britain, the [[Union of Islamic Students' Associations in Europe]] issued a statement offering its services to Khomeini. Despite incitement to murder being illegal in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.182-3&lt;/ref&gt; one London property developer told reporters, "If I see him, I will kill him straight away. Take my name and address. One day I will kill him".&lt;ref name="Newsweek, 27 February 1989"&gt;''Newsweek'', 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leaders, while supporting the fatwa, claimed that British Muslims were not allowed to carry out the fatwa themselves.{{Why?|date=January 2012}} Prominent amongst these were the [[Muslim Parliament]] and its leader [[Kalim Siddiqui]], and after his death in 1996, his successor, [[Ghayasuddin Siddiqui]]. His support for the fatwa continued, even after the Iranian leadership said it would not pursue the fatwa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/177987.stm |title=BBC, 23 September 1998 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 1998 |accessdate=27 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926002414/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/177987.stm |archivedate=26 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-iterated his support in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/rushdie-death-warrant-intact-726733.html The Independent, 13 February 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in America, the director of the [[Near East Studies Center]] at [[UCLA]], [[George Sabbagh]], told an interviewer that Khomeini was "completely within his rights" to call for Rushdie's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601890227,00.html ''TIME'', 27 February 1989, p.159] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115104320/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601890227,00.html |date=15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Lebanon Hostage Crisis}}

In May 1989 in [[Beirut, Lebanon]], British citizen [[Jackie Mann]] was abducted "in response to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for the publication of book the Satanic Verses and more specifically, for his refuge and protection in the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p.103&lt;/ref&gt; He joined several Westerners [[Lebanon Hostage Crisis|held hostage]] there. Two months earlier a photograph of three teachers held hostage was released by [[Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine]] with the message that it "would take revenge against" all institutions and organisations that insulted in one way or another "members of the Prophet Mohammed's family".&lt;ref&gt;"Iran: West to Blame Islam for Forthcoming Terrorism", ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 24 February 1989, p.5A&lt;/ref&gt;

McRoy (2007) claimed that "In Islamic society a blasphemer is held in the same hostile contempt as a pedophile in the West. Just as few if any people in the West mourn the murder of a child molester, few Muslims mourn the killing of a blasphemer".&lt;ref name="McRoy"/&gt;

===Criticism of Khomeini's fatwa===
Khomeini's fatwa was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of [[free speech]], [[freedom of religion]], and that Khomeini had no right to condemn to death a citizen of another country living in that country.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  The 12 members of the [[European Economic Community]] removed their ambassadors from Tehran for three weeks.&lt;ref name="month-rushdies"/&gt;

====On Islamic grounds====
In addition to criticism of the death sentence on the basis of humans rights, the sentence was also criticised on Islamic grounds. According to [[Bernard Lewis]], a death warrant without trial, [[defence (law)|defence]] and other legal aspects of [[sharia]] violates Islamic jurisprudence. In Islamic [[fiqh]], [[apostasy]] by a mentally sound adult male is indeed a [[capital crime]]. However, fiqh also:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... lays down procedures according to which a person accused of an offense is to be brought to trial, [[right to confront accusers|confronted with his accuser]], and given the opportunity to defend himself. A judge will then give a verdict and if he finds the accused guilty, pronounce sentence... Even the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence. They say nothing about a hired killing for a reported insult in a distant country.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis commenting on Rushdie fatwa in ''The Crisis of Islam : Holy War and Unholy Terror'', 2003 by Bernard Lewis, p.141-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other Islamic scholars outside Iran took issue with the fact that the sentence was not passed by an Islamic court,&lt;ref name="Newsweek, 27 February 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Majalla1989"/&gt; or that it did not limit its "jurisdiction only [to] countries under Islamic law".&lt;ref name="rel"/&gt; Muhammad Hussan ad-Din, a theologian at [[Al-Azhar University]], argued "Blood must not be shed except after a trial [when the accused has been] given a chance to defend himself and repent".&lt;ref name="Newsweek, 27 February 1989"/&gt; Abdallah al-Mushidd, head of Azhar's Fatwā Council stated "We must try the author in a legal fashion as Islam does not accept killing as a legal instrument".&lt;ref name="Majalla1989"&gt;"Ab'ad Harb al-Kitab" ''[[The Majalla|Al Majalla]]'', 1 March 1989, quoted in Pipes, 1990, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Jurisprudence Academy in Mecca urged that Rushdie be tried and, if found guilty, be given a chance to repent, (p.&amp;nbsp;93) and Ayatollah [[Mehdi Rohani]], head of the Shi'i community in Europe and a cousin of Khomeini, criticised Khomeini for 'respect[ing] neither international law nor that of Islam.'&lt;ref&gt;''Le Nouvel Observateur'' 23 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also criticism of the fatwa issued against Rushdie's publishers. According to Daniel Pipes: "The [[Sharia]] clearly establishes that disseminating false information is not the same as expressing it. "Transmitting blasphemy is not blasphemy" (''naql al-kufr laysa kufr''). In addition, the publishers were not Muslim and so could not be "sentenced under the Islamic laws of apostasy". If there was another legal justification for sentencing them to death, "Khomeini failed to provide" it.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's response to calls for a trial was to denounce its Islamic proponents as "deceitful". President Khomeini accused them of attempting to use religious law as "a flag under which they can crush revolutionary Islam".&lt;ref&gt;Radio Tehran, 16 March 1989, quoted in Pipes, 1990, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questions of political motivation====
Some speculate that the fatwa (or at least the reaffirmation of the death threat four days later) was issued with motives other than a sense of duty to protect Islam by punishing blasphemy/apostasy. Namely:

*To divide Muslims from the West by "starkly highlight[ing] the conflicting political and intellectual traditions" of the two civilisations.&lt;ref name="Pipes, 1990, p.133" /&gt; Khomeini had often warned Muslims of the dangers of the West&amp;nbsp;– "the agents of imperialism [who] are busy in every corner of the Islamic world drawing our youth away from us with their evil propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution'' (1980), p.127&lt;/ref&gt; He knew from news reports the book was already rousing the anger of Muslims.
*To distract the attention of his Iranian countrymen from his capitulation seven months earlier to a truce with [[Iraq]] (20 July 1988) ending the long and bloody [[Iran–Iraq War]] (a truce Iraq would have eagerly given him six years and hundreds of thousands of lives earlier),&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', (2001), p.267,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gulf War : Its Origins, History and Consequences'' by John Bulloch and Harvey Morris, 1989, (p.xvi)]&lt;/ref&gt; and strengthen the revolutionary ardour and morale&lt;ref&gt;''People of the Century'', by CBS News, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; of Iranians worn down by the bloodshed and privation of that war. According to journalist Robin Wright, "as the international furore grew, Khomeini declared that the book had been a 'godsend' that had helped Iran out of a 'naïve foreign policy'".&lt;ref name="rel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin ''In the Name of God'', (c1989), p.201&lt;/ref&gt;
*To win back the interest in and support for the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] among the 90% of the population of the Muslim world that was [[Sunni]], rather than [[Shia]] like Khomeini. The Iran–Iraq War had also alienated Sunni, who not only were offended by its bloodshed, but tended to favour Iran's Sunni-led opponent, Iraq. At least one observer speculated that Khomeini's choice of the issue of disrespect for the Prophet [[Muhammad]] was a particularly shrewd tactic, as Sunni were inclined to suspect Shia of being more interested in the Imams [[Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] than in the Prophet.&lt;ref name="Pipes133-4"&gt;Pipes, 1990, 133–4&lt;/ref&gt;
*To [[Stealing thunder|steal the thunder]] of Khomeini's two least favourite enemy states, [[Saudi Arabia]] and the United States, who were basking in the glory of the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan]]. This withdrawal, seen by many as a great victory of Islamic faith over an atheist superpower, was made possible by billions of dollars in aid to the Afghan mujahideen by those two countries. Khomeini issued the fatwa on 14 February 1989. The next day came the official announcement of the completion of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, lost in the news cycle of the fatwa.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2001), p.135)&lt;/ref&gt;
*To gain the upper hand from Saudi Arabia in the struggle for international leadership of the Muslim world. Each led rival blocs of international institutions and media networks, and "the Saudi government, it should be remembered, had led the anti-Rushdie campaign for months".&lt;ref name="Pipes133-4"/&gt; Unlike the more conservative Saudi Arabia, however, Iran was ideologically and militantly anti-western and could take a more militant stand outside international law.

====Questions of personal motivation====
Despite claims by Iranian officials that "Rushdie's book did not insult Iran or Iranian leaders" and so they had no selfish personal motivation to attack the book, the book does include an eleven-page sketch of Khomeini's stay in Paris that could well be considered an insult to him. It describes him as having "grown monstrous, lying in the palace forecourt with his mouth yawning open at the gates; as the people march through the gates he swallows them whole". In the words of one observer, "If this is not an insult, Khomeini was far more tolerant than one might suppose",&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Crowley]] has noted that the section of the book depicting the Khomeini-like character was selected to be read publicly by Rushdie in the promotional events leading up to and following the book's release.&lt;ref name="Crowley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley |first=John |title=Rushdie and Me |url=http://crowleycrow.livejournal.com/213161.html |publisher=Livejournal |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120231224/http://crowleycrow.livejournal.com/213161.html |archivedate=20 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Crowley's opinion, the fatwa was most likely declared because of this section of the novel and its public exposure, rather than the overall parodic treatment of Islam.&lt;ref name="Crowley"/&gt;

===Attempts to revoke the fatwa===
On 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of [[diplomatic relations]] with Britain, the Iranian government, then headed by moderate [[Muhammad Khatami]], gave a public commitment that it would "neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie".&lt;ref name="Tomb"&gt;{{Cite news|date=8 June 2005|title=Tomb of the unknown assassin reveals mission to kill Rushdie|author=Anthony Loyd|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531110.ece|work=The Times|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171205/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531110.ece|archivedate=1 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/26/newsid_2542000/2542873.stm |publisher=BBC News: On This Day |title=26 December 1990: Iranian leader upholds Rushdie fatwa |accessdate=10 October 2006 |date=26 December 1990 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408091112/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/26/newsid_2542000/2542873.stm |archivedate=8 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some in Iran have continued to reaffirm the death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/article/1002 |publisher=The Middle East Forum: Promoting American Interests |title=Can Iran Be Trusted? |author=Rubin, Michael |date=1 September 2006 |accessdate=10 October 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026203104/http://www.meforum.org/article/1002 |archivedate=26 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2005, Khomeini's fatwa was reaffirmed by Iran's Supreme Leader, [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]], in a message to Muslim pilgrims making the [[Hajj|annual pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="webster-bbc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-2-1448279-2,00.html |work=The Times |title=Ayatollah revives the death fatwa on Salman Rushdie |author=Webster, Philip, Ben Hoyle and Ramita Navai |date=20 January 2005 |accessdate=10 October 2006 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016192342/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-2-1448279-2,00.html |archivedate=16 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] have declared that the death sentence on him is still valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4260599.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iran adamant over Rushdie fatwa |date=12 February 2005 |accessdate=10 October 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206020617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4260599.stm |archivedate=6 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has rejected requests to withdraw the fatwa on the basis that only the person who issued it may withdraw it,&lt;ref name="webster-bbc"/&gt; with Ruhollah Khomeini having died in 1989.

On 14 February 2006, the [[Islamic Republic News Agency|Iranian state news agency]] reported that the fatwa will remain in place permanently.&lt;ref name=fatwacont&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran says Rushdie fatwa still stands|publisher=Iran Focus|date=14 February 2006|url=http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5768|accessdate=22 January 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090417232632/http%3A//www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D5768|archivedate=17 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Salman Rushdie reported that he still receives a "sort of [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]]'s card" from Iran each year on 14 February letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him. He was also quoted saying, "It's reached the point where it's a piece of rhetoric rather than a real threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007021501382200.htm&amp;date=2007/02/15/&amp;prd=th&amp; |title=Rushdie's term |accessdate=15 February 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012000434/http://hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007021501382200.htm&amp;date=2007%2F02%2F15%2F&amp;prd=th&amp; |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political fallout==
One of the immediate consequences of the fatwa was a worsening of Islamic-Western relations.

===Heightened tension===
Rushdie lamented that the controversy fed the Western stereotype of "the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer",&lt;ref&gt;Marzorati, Gerald, "Salman Rushdie: Fiction's Embattled Infidel", ''The New York Times Magazine'', 29 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
while another British writer compared the Ayatollah Khomeini "with a familiar ghost from the past&amp;nbsp;– one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a [[Faqir of Ipi]] or a [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|mad Mullah]], who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Harly, "Saving Mr. Rushdie?" ''Encounter'', June 1989, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Media expressions of this included a banner headline in the popular British newspaper the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' referring to Khomeini as "that Mad Mullah".&lt;ref&gt;15 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Independent'' newspaper worried that Muslim book burning demonstrations were "following the example of the [[Inquisition]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazism|National Socialists]]",&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', 16 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and that if Rushdie was killed, "it would be the first burning of a [[Heresy|heretic]] in Europe in two centuries".&lt;ref&gt;League for the Spread of Unpopular Views. West German organization, ''Bund zur Verbreitung unerwunschter Einsichten'' [Hamburg], ''"Der Fall Rushdie und die Feigheit des Westerns,"'' pamphlet, p. 3. quoted in Pipes 1990, p.250&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peregrine Worsthorne]] of the ''Sunday Telegraph'' feared that with [[Muslims in Western Europe|Europe's growing Muslim population]], "[[Islamic fundamentalism]] is rapidly growing into a much bigger threat of violence and intolerance than anything emanating from, say, the fascist [[British National Front|National Front]]; and a threat, moreover, infinitely more difficult to contain since it is virtually impossible to monitor, let alone stamp out ...".&lt;ref&gt;Peregrine Worsthorne, "The Blooding of the Literati", ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 19 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Muslim side, the Iranian government saw the book as part of a British [[wiktionary:Conspiracy|conspiracy]] against Islam. It broke diplomatic relations with UK on 7 March 1989 giving the explanation that "in the past two centuries Britain has been in the frontline of plots and treachery against Islam and Muslims", It accused the British of sponsoring Rushdie's book to use it as a political and cultural tact on earlier military plots that no longer worked.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Revolution News Agency, 7 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It also saw itself as the victor of the controversy, with the European Community countries capitulating under Iranian pressure. "When Europeans saw that their economic interests in Muslim countries could be damaged, they began to correct their position on the issue of the insulting book. Every official started to condemn the book in one way or another. When they realised that Iran's reaction, its breaking of diplomatic relations with London, could also include them, they quickly sent back their ambassadors to Tehran to prevent further Iranian reaction".&lt;ref&gt;''Kayhan Havai'', 18 April 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book sales===

Although British bookseller [[W.H. Smith]] sold "a mere hundred copies a week of the book in mid-January 1989", it "flew off the shelves" following the fatwa. In America it sold an "unprecedented" five times more copies than the number two book, ''Star'' by [[Danielle Steel]], selling more than 750,000 copies of the book by May 1989. B. Dalton, a bookstore chain that decided not to stock the book for security reasons, changed its mind when it found the book "was selling so fast that even as we tried to stop it, it was flying off the shelves".&lt;ref&gt;Len Riggioi quoted in ''Publishers Weekly'', 10 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.200-1&lt;/ref&gt; Rushdie earned about $2&amp;nbsp;million within the first year of the book's publication,&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; and the book is Viking's all-time best seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/rushdie/RUSHDIE_Haunted_by_his_unholy_ghosts.pdf |title=RUSHDIE: Haunted by his unholy ghosts |format=PDF |accessdate=27 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204055505/http://www.alislam.org/books/rushdie/RUSHDIE_Haunted_by_his_unholy_ghosts.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rushdie===
The author of the book himself was not killed or injured as many militants wished, but visibly frustrated by a life locked in 24-hour armed guard&amp;nbsp;– alternately defiant against his would-be killers and attempting overtures of reconciliation against the death threat. A week after the death threat, and after his unsuccessful apology to the Iranian government, Rushdie described succumbing to "a curious lethargy, the soporific torpor that overcomes ... while under attack";&lt;ref&gt;Salman Rushdie, "Beginning of a Novelist's Thralldom" ''The Observer'', 26 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; then, a couple of weeks after that, wrote a poem vowing "not to shut up" but "to sing on, in spite of attacks".&lt;ref&gt;6 March 1989 published in ''Granta'', Autumn 1989&lt;/ref&gt; But in June, following the death of Khomeini, he asked his supporters "to tone down their criticism of Iran".

His wife, [[Marianne Wiggins]], reported that in the first few months following the fatwa the couple moved 56 times, once every three days. In late July Rushdie separated from Wiggins, "the tension of being at the centre of an international controversy, and the irritations of spending all hours of the day together in seclusion", being too much for their "shaky" relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

Late the next year Rushdie declared, "I want to reclaim my life", and in December signed a declaration "affirming his Islamic faith and calling for Viking-Penguin, the publisher of ''The Satanic Verses'', neither to issue the book in paperback nor to allow it to be translated".&lt;ref name=pipes201&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/201 |title=Rushdie Fails to Move the Zealots |author=Daniel Pipes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=28 December 1990 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408075454/http://www.danielpipes.org/article/201 |archivedate=8 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also failed to move supporters of the fatwa and by mid-2005 Rushdie was condemning [[Islamic fundamentalism]] as a

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... project of [[tyranny]] and unreason which wishes to freeze a certain view of Islamic culture in time and silence the progressive voices in the Muslim world calling for a free and prosperous future. ... along comes [[9/11]], and now many people say that, in hindsight, the fatwa was the prologue and this is the main event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Shikha Dalmia from the August/September 2005 issue |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/33120.html |title=The Iconoclast |work=Reason |accessdate=27 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903081731/http://reason.com/news/show/33120.html |archivedate=3 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Explanation of different reactions===

====Muslim====
The passionate international rage of Muslims towards the book surprised many Western readers because the book was written in English, not [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or other languages for which the majority of mother tongue speakers are Muslims; it was never published or even sold in the countries where most Muslims lived; and was a work of fiction—a demanding, densely written novel unlikely to appeal to the average reader.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the explanations for the unprecedented rage unleashed against the book were that:
*''The Satanic Verses'' was seen as a continuation of the long tradition of anti-Islamic sentiment in Western literature, portraying the core subject matter of the Prophet Muhammad and Islam in a derogatory manner&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/107049639/Mis-Representations-of-Islam-Reading-Salman-Rushdie-s-The-Satanic-Verses-By-Ismail-Isa-Patel-London-1998 Mis/Representations of Islam: Reading Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, By Ismail Isa Patel London 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306152056/https://www.scribd.com/doc/107049639/Mis-Representations-of-Islam-Reading-Salman-Rushdie-s-The-Satanic-Verses-By-Ismail-Isa-Patel-London-1998 |date=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rushdie was living in the West and ought to be setting a good example for Islam and not siding "with the Orientalists".&lt;ref&gt;Syed Ali Ashraf, writing in ''Impact International'', 28 October 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
*The view of many Muslims was that "Rushdie has portrayed the prophet of Islam as a brothel keeper".&lt;ref&gt;ad by the [[Birmingham Central Mosque]] in British newspapers&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2012}} "Rushdie accuses the prophet, particularly Muhammad of being like prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;Dawud Assad, president of the [[U.S. Council of Masajid]] quoted in ''[[Trenton Times]]'', 21 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; "all who pray are sons of whores"&lt;ref&gt;a young French Muslim quoted in ''Le Nouvel Observateur, 23 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; "The Prophet's wives are portrayed as women of the street, his homes as a public brothel and his companions as bandits".&lt;ref&gt;M. Rafiqul Islam, ''The Rushdie Affair: A Conflict of Rights'' unpublished manuscript, April 1989, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The book, in fact, portrays prostitutes who "had each assumed the identity of one of Mahound's wives".&lt;ref&gt;Salman Rushdie, "The Satanic Verses", Random House, 1988, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;
*Belief that fictional elements of the novel were not flights of imagination but lies. Complaints included that it was "neither a critical appraisal nor a piece of historical research",&lt;ref&gt;Mir Husayn Musavi, prime minister of Iran, quoted on Radio Tehran 21 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; that the novel failed to rely on "scientific and logical arguments",&lt;ref&gt;(Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, Agence France Press, 27 February 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; its "lack of scientific, accurate or objective methods of research",&lt;ref&gt;(Shaykh Ahmad Kaftaru, mufti of the Syrian Arab Republic, source: Syrian Arab News Agency, 1 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; "unfounded lies", not being "serious or scientific",&lt;ref&gt;Religious affairs director of Turkish government, Mustafa Sait Yazicioglu, Radio Ankara 14 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; "a total distortion of historical facts",&lt;ref&gt;Sayed M. Syeed, secretary general of the Association of Muslim Social Scientists in the United States, Philadelphia Inquirer, 14 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; being "not at all an objective or scientific opinion".&lt;ref&gt;Libyan ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unfamiliarity with the concept of free speech. The belief among many Muslims in or from the Middle East is that every country "has ... laws that prohibits any publications or utterances that tend to ridicule or defame Islam".&lt;ref&gt;editorial in ''The Jordan Times'', 5 March 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; It followed that permission to publish a book that ridiculed or defamed Islam showed an anti-Islamic bias in those countries that permit publication. Although not enforced, and abolished completely in 2008, the United Kingdom had [[blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|laws prohibiting blasphemy against the Christian religion.]]
*The view of many Muslims that Britain, America and other Western countries are engaged in a [[war on Islam|war against Islam]] and what might on the surface appear to be the product of the imagination of an individual iconoclast author was actually a conspiracy on a national or transnational scale. Then Iranian president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], for example, explained the alleged historical roots of the Rushdie book in a broadcast on Radio Tehran:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever is familiar with the history of colonialism and the Islamic world knows that whenever they wanted to get a foothold in a place, the first thing they did in order to clear their paths&amp;nbsp;– whether overtly or covertly&amp;nbsp;– was to undermine the people's genuine Islamic morals.&lt;ref name="Radio Tehran 1990 p.124-5"&gt;broadcast Radio Tehran, 7 March 1989 quoted in Pipes, 1990, p.124-5&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

and claimed an unnamed British foreign secretary once told the British parliament, "So long as the Qur'an is revered by Muslims, we will not be able to consolidate a foothold among the Muslims".&lt;ref name="Radio Tehran 1990 p.124-5"/&gt;

*A campaign by the international Islamist group [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] in retaliation for Rushdie's satire of them in the earlier book ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]''. In Britain the group was represented by the UK Action Committee on Islamic Affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wYkQXO4sEoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+fatwa+to+jihad+:&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yHXdTaG4OKTf0QHB7qTqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath By Kenan Malik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509201749/https://books.google.com/books?id=wYkQXO4sEoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+fatwa+to+jihad+%3A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yHXdTaG4OKTf0QHB7qTqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA |date=9 May 2016 }}, chapter one, (no page numbers)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Among second generation Muslim immigrants in UK and elsewhere, a decline in interest in universalist "white Left" anti-racist/anti-imperialist politics, and rise in [[identity politics]] with its focus on the "defence of values and beliefs" of Muslim identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wYkQXO4sEoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+fatwa+to+jihad+:&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yHXdTaG4OKTf0QHB7qTqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath By Kenan Malik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509201749/https://books.google.com/books?id=wYkQXO4sEoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+fatwa+to+jihad+%3A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yHXdTaG4OKTf0QHB7qTqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA |date=9 May 2016 }}, introduction, part 5, no page numbers&lt;/ref&gt;
*Based on the book's title, and out of a general ignorance about what it references, a misunderstanding in the part of people in Muslim majority countries, where the book was not available, that led to the belief that the book was a "Satanist" critique of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.

====Western mainstream====
Despite the passionate intensity of Muslim feeling on the issue no Western government banned ''The Satanic Verses.'' This is primarily because most Western governments explicitly or implicitly allow for freedom of expression, which includes forbidding censorship in the vast majority of cases. Western attitudes regarding freedom of expression differ from those in the Arab world because:

*Westerners are less likely to be shocked by ridicule of religious figures. "Taboo and sacrilege are virtually dead in the West. Blasphemy is an old story and can no longer shock".&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990 p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of movies and books that aroused little or no protest in the west despite their blasphemy: [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[God Knows (novel)|God Knows]]'', which turned "Biblical stories into pornographic fare";&lt;ref name="Pipes108-118-9"&gt;Pipes, 1990 p.108, 118–9&lt;/ref&gt; Even ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', a book that was not only offensive and untrue but arguably very dangerous, having inspired the killing of Jews in Russia and contributed to Nazi ideology, was "freely available in the west".&lt;ref name="Pipes108-118-9"/&gt;
*The idea widely accepted among writers that provocation in literature is not a right but is a duty, an important calling: "it is perhaps in the nature of modern art to be offensive ... in this century if we are not willing to risk giving offence, we have no claim to the title of artists".&lt;ref&gt;John Updike, ''The Wall Street Journal'', 10 August 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Rushdie himself said: "I had spent my entire life as a writer in opposition, and indeed conceived the writer's role as including the function of antagonist to the state".&lt;ref&gt;Rushdie, Salman, ''Jaguar Smile'', p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

The last point also explains why one of the few groups to speak out in Muslim countries against Khomeini and for Rushdie's right to publish his book were other writers.&lt;ref&gt;"The Importance of Being Earnest About Salman Rushdie" by Sadeq al-'Azm, in M.D. Fletcher, ''Reading Rushdie: Perspectives on the Fiction of Salman Rushdie'', Amsterdam, Rodopi B.V., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel prize winners [[Wole Soyinka]] of Nigeria and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] of Egypt, both attacked Khomeini, and both received death threats as a result, with Mahfouz later getting stabbed in the neck by a Muslim fundamentalist.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, 1990, p.148, 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2009"/&gt;

Some Western politicians and writers did criticise Rushdie.  Former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]], while condemning the threats and [[fatwa]] against Rushdie, stated, "we have tended to promote him and his book with little acknowledgment that it is a direct insult to those millions of Moslems whose sacred beliefs have been violated and are suffering in restrained silence the added embarrassment of the Ayatollah's irresponsibility". He also held that Rushdie must have been aware of the response his book would evoke: "The author, a well-versed analyst of Moslem beliefs, must have anticipated a horrified reaction throughout the Islamic world".&lt;ref&gt;"[[International Herald Tribune]]", 4 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He saw a need to be "sensitive to the concern and anger" of Muslims and thought severing diplomatic relations with Iran would be an "overreaction".&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Carter, "Rushdie's Book Is an Insult", ''The New York Times'', 5 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Among authors, [[Roald Dahl]] was scathing and called Rushdie's book sensationalist and Rushdie "a dangerous opportunist".&lt;ref name="nyt2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/arts/04iht-15donadio.6482640.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Salman Rushdie: Fighting words on a knighthood |author=Rachel Donadio |date=4 July 2007 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200426/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/arts/04iht-15donadio.6482640.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=21 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John le Carré]] thought the death sentence to be outrageous, but he also criticised Rushdie's action: "I don't think  it is given to any of us to be impertinent to great religions with impunity",&lt;ref name="nyt2007"/&gt; although he later expressed regret over his dispute with Rushdie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9671959/Le-Carre-regrets-Rushdie-fatwa-feud.html |title=Le Carré regrets Rushdie fatwa feud |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007224222/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9671959/Le-Carre-regrets-Rushdie-fatwa-feud.html |archivedate=7 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rushdie, however, was supported by major bodies in the literary world such as [[PEN International|PEN]] and [[Association of American Publishers]], and prominent figures such as [[Günter Grass]], [[Martin Amis]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Nadine Gordimer]] and [[Derek Walcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/13/books/3d-anniversary-of-edict-against-rushdie.html |title=3d Anniversary of Edict Against Rushdie |date=13 February 1992 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145821/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/13/books/3d-anniversary-of-edict-against-rushdie.html |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major supporter of Rushdie, [[Christopher Hitchens]], said that the fatwa persuaded him that Islamic fundamentalism was an urgent menace, and later wrote ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', a polemic against religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/16/143830372/for-hitchens-in-life-and-death-an-unaware-cosmos |title=For Hitchens, In Life And Death, An Unaware Cosmos |author=Barbara Bradley Hagerty |date=16 December 2011 |publisher=NPR |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093757/http://www.npr.org/2011/12/16/143830372/for-hitchens-in-life-and-death-an-unaware-cosmos |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair however led to greater caution and some degree of self-censorship when dealing with Islamic issues in the literary and other creative arts.&lt;ref name="guardian2009"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/11/salman-rushdie-satanic-verses |title=How one book ignited a culture war |author=Andrew Anthony |work=The Observer |date=11 January 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106013924/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/11/salman-rushdie-satanic-verses |archivedate=6 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western religious figures====
Many religious figures in the United States and United Kingdom shared the aversion to blasphemy of pious Muslims (if not as intensely) and did not defend Rushdie like their secular compatriots. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Robert Runcie]], demanded that the government expand the [[blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|Blasphemy Act]] to cover other religions, including Islam.&lt;ref name="Longworth"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Britain's blasphemy laws getting renewed attention |first=R.C. |last=Longworth |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8eUPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NowDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6740,4165272 |newspaper=[[The Free Lance–Star]] |location=Fredericksburg, Virginia |date=11 March 1989 |page=5 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Walzer wrote that the response revealed an evolution of the meaning of blasphemy; it moved away from a crime against God and toward something more temporal.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today we are concerned for our pain and sometimes, for other people's. Blasphemy has become an offence against the faithful&amp;nbsp;– in much the same way as pornography is an offence against the innocent and the virtuous. Given this meaning, blasphemy is an ecumenical crime and so it is not surprising ... that Christians and Jews should join Muslims in calling Salman Rushdie's [book] a blasphemous book.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, "The Sins of Salman", ''The New Republic'', 10 April 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[rabbis]], such as [[Immanuel Jakobovits]], [[chief rabbi]] of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, opposed the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 4 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Three of Wands''' or '''Three of Batons''' is a [[playing card]] of the [[suit of wands]]. In tarot, it is a [[Minor Arcana]] card.

[[Image:Wands03.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Three of Wands from the [[Rider-Waite|Rider-Waite Tarot deck]]]]

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==

A calm onlooker facing towards the sea. There's a possibility that he is a merchant or looking forward to a journey. The three represents creation - looking forward to something with optimism - a mission. This card symbolizes enterprise, trade, or commerce. 

Keynotes: ''Achievement - venture - traveling - pursuing a journey''

If the card is in reversed, it means the end of a task, toil, a cessation, and disappointment.

The '''Triratna Buddhist Community''' (formerly the '''Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO)''') is an international fellowship&lt;ref name="Irons 2008 206"&gt;{{citation | first=Edward A | last=Irons | year=2008 | title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism | publisher=Checkmark Books | isbn=978-0-8160-5459-6 | page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Buddhists, and others&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The Friends of the Western Buddhist Order – structure | work=official site | url = http://www.fwbo.org/fwbo/fwbo_structure.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who aspire to its path of mindfulness, under the leadership of the Triratna Buddhist Order (formerly the Western Buddhist Order). It was founded by [[Sangharakshita]] in the [[UK]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="Irons 2008 206"/&gt; and describes itself as "an international network dedicated to communicating Buddhist truths in ways appropriate to the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Friends of the Western Buddhist Order | work = official site | url = http://www.fwbo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with Buddhist traditions, it also pays attention to contemporary ideas, particularly drawn from Western philosophy, psychotherapy, and art.&lt;ref name="Queen 2005 377"&gt;{{citation | first=Christopher S | last=Queen | year=2005 | title=Engaged Buddhism in the West | publisher=Wisdom Publications | isbn=978-0-86171-159-8| page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, more than 100 groups are affiliated with the community, including in North America, Australasia and Europe. In the UK, it is one of the largest Buddhist movements,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=David N. | last=Kay | year=2004 | title=Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-29765-3 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some 30 urban centres and retreat centres.&lt;ref name="Queen 2005 378"&gt;{{citation | first=Christopher S | last=Queen | year=2005 | title=Engaged Buddhism in the West | publisher=Wisdom Publications | isbn=978-0-86171-159-8| page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its centre there is at [[Coddington, Herefordshire]]. Its largest following, however, is in India, where it is known as Triratna Bauddha Mahāsaṅgha (TBM) (formerly the Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana (TBMSG)).&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 193"&gt;{{citation | first=Christopher | last=Partridge | year=2004 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religions | publisher=Lion | isbn=978-0-7459-5073-0 | page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community has been described as "perhaps the most successful attempt to create an ecumenical international Buddhist organization,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Harry L. | last=Oldmeadow | year=2004 | title=Journeys East: 20th century Western encounters with Eastern religious traditions | publisher=World Wisdom, Inc | isbn=978-0-941532-57-0 | page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an important contributor to Buddhism on the world stage."&lt;ref name="Crook"&gt;{{Citation | last =Crook | first = John | title =Dangers in Devotion: Buddhist Cults and the Tasks of a Guru – '...It is this that leads many of us to see the FWBO more as a cult than as a Buddhist institution or school in accordance with tradition.' | journal=Western Chan Fellowship, Paper Presented at the Conference 'The Psychology of Awakening' at Dartington Hall, UK, October 1998 | url =http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/dangers-in-devotion.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been criticised, most notably for lacking "spiritual lineage"&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 81"/&gt; and over claims of sexual exploitation and misogyny during the 1970s and 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Madeleine | last=Bunting | title=The Dark Side of Enlightenment | newspaper=Guardian | date=27 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices and activities==
[[Meditation]] is the common thread through activities. Order members teach two practices: (a) "The mindfulness of breathing" ([[anapanasati]]), in which practitioners focus on the rise and fall of the breath; and (b) "The [[metta]] bhavana", which approximately translates from the original [[Pali]] as "the cultivation of lovingkindness". These practices are felt to be complementary in promoting equanimity and friendliness towards others. Some friends of the Order may have little, if any, other involvement in its activities; but friendship, Sangha, and community are encouraged at all levels as essential contexts for meditation.

The founder, Sangharakshita, described meditation as having four phases. The first two according to his system ('integration' and 'positive emotion', can be correlated to the traditional category of "calming" "[[samatha]]" practices, and the last two (spiritual death and spiritual rebirth) can be correlated to "insight" or "[[vipassana]]" practices. For those not ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order, the practices associated with the first two are emphasised, though the spirit of the last two is also taught.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 194"&gt;{{citation | first=Christopher | last=Partridge | year=2004 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religions | publisher=Lion | isbn=978-0-7459-5073-0 | page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These phases are:

# '''Integration.''' The main practice at this stage is the mindfulness of breathing, which is intended to have the effect of "integrating the psyche" – improving mindfulness and concentration, and reducing psychological conflict.
# '''Positive emotion.''' The second aspect of samatha is developing positivity – an other-regarding, life-affirming attitude. The [[Brahmavihara]] meditations, especially the 'metta bhavana' or cultivation of loving kindness meditations, are the key practices intended to foster the development of positive emotion.
# '''Spiritual death.''' The next stage is to develop insight into what is seen to be the emptiness of the self and reality. Meditations at this stage include considering the elements of which self and world are thought to be composed; contemplating impermance (particularly of the body); contemplating suffering; and contemplating [[sunyata]].
# '''Spiritual rebirth.''' The WBO teaches that, with the development of insight and the death of the limited ego-self, a person is spiritually reborn. Practices which involve the visualization of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are among the main practices in this phase. At ordination, each dharmachari(ni) is given an advanced visualisation meditation on a particular figure.

Centres also teach scripture, [[yoga]] and other methods of self-improvement, some of which are felt by some commentators to come from outside the Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, community activities have begun to include outdoor festivals, online meditation courses, arts festivals, poetry and writing workshops, tai chi, karate, and pilgrimages to Buddhist holy sites in India. For many years, the community charity [[Karuna Trust (UK)]] has raised money for aid projects in India.&lt;ref name="Baumann 1998"&gt;{{citation | first=Martin | last=Baumann | year=1998 | journal=Journal of Buddhist Ethics | title=Working in the Right Spirit: The Application of Buddhist Right Livelihood in the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order | issn=1076-9005 | volume=5| url=http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/124/1/Working_in_the_right_spirit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As among Buddhists generally, [[Puja (Buddhism)|Puja]] is a [[ritual]] practice at some events, intended to awaken the desire to liberate all beings from suffering. The most common ritual consists of a puja, derived and adapted from the ''[[Bodhicaryavatara]]'' of [[Shantideva]].

[[Retreats]] provide a chance to focus on meditational practice more intensely, in a residential context outside of a retreatant's everyday life.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2001 308"&gt;{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; community retreats can be broadly categorised into meditation retreats, study retreats, and solitary retreats. Retreat lengths vary from short weekends to one or two weeks.

Businesses, said to operate to the principle of "right livelihood", generate funds for the movement, as well seeking to provide environments for spiritual growth through employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Christopher S | last=Queen | year=2005 | title=Engaged Buddhism in the West | publisher=Wisdom Publications | isbn=978-0-86171-159-8| page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis is placed on teamwork, and on contributing to the welfare of others: for example by funding social projects and by considering ethical matters such as fair trade. The largest community business was Windhorse:Evolution, a gift wholesaling business and a chain of gift shops.&lt;ref name="Baumann 1998"/&gt; Windhorse:Evolution closed down in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Final Goodbye|url=https://thebuddhistcentre.com/windhorse-evolution/final-goodbye|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities with a Triratna centre also have a residential community. The first of these was formed after a retreat where some participants wanted to continue retreat-style living. Since it was felt that the most stable communities tended to be single sex, this has become the paradigm for communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=A | last=Rawlinson | year=1997 | title=The Book of Enlightened Masters | publisher=Open Court | place=Chicago | isbn=978-0-8126-9310-2 | page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support from fellow practitioners in a community is seen to be effective in helping members make spiritual progress.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 117"&gt;{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Triratna centre in the [[UK]] is the [[London Buddhist Centre]] in [[Bethnal Green]], [[East (London sub region)|East London]], which offers drop-in lunchtime meditation sessions each weekday, open to beginners, as well as courses and classes through the week. The centre's courses for depression, based on the mindfulness-based [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] methodology of [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], featured in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Meditation or medication? | author = Emma Jacobs | date = 6 April 2008 | work = [[Financial Times]] | url = http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto040720080048417482 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110901005540/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto040720080048417482 | archivedate = 1 September 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative is supported by the local authority, the London borough of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. ''[[The Times]]'' has also reported on the centre's work with those affected by alcohol dependency &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Buddha and the bottle | url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2234628.ece | publisher=The Times | date=11 August 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the movement==
According to the community, six characteristics define it:
# '''An ecumenical movement.''' It is not identified with any particular strand or school of Buddhism, but draws inspiration from many. It calls itself "ecumenical" rather than "eclectic" because it is founded on the premise that there is an underlying unity to all schools.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2001 308"/&gt;
# '''"Going for [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]]" is central.''' "Going for Refuge to the [[Three Jewels]]" – meaning the [[Buddha]], the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] – is considered to be what makes someone a Buddhist.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 194"/&gt;
# '''A unified Order.''' Unlike some sangha, the community does not propagate a monastic lineage. Sangharakshita devised a non-monastic ordination system, whilst also allowing the undertaking of the "anagarika" precept which enjoins celibacy. Identical ordination is open to both sexes. While the movement regards single-sex activities as important to spiritual growth, men and women are recognised as being equally able to practice and develop spiritually.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2001 309"&gt;{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''An emphasis on spiritual friendship.''' There is a strong emphasis on the sangha, and spiritual friendship based on shared values. The community teaches that spending time with friends who share ideals, and engaging in ritual practice with them, supports ethical living and the arising of the [[bodhicitta]].&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 117"/&gt;
# '''Teamwork.''' Working together in teams, in the spirit of generosity and with a focus on ethics, is considered a transformative spiritual practice.&lt;ref name="Baumann 1998"/&gt;
# '''Importance of art.''' Engagement in, and an appreciation of, the arts are considered to be a valuable aspect of spiritual practice. The community teaches that a refinement of one's artistic tastes can help refine emotional sensitivity and provide a channel for the expression of right living, and spiritual growth. More broadly, the movement seeks ways to re-express Buddhism by making connections with sympathetic elements in the surrounding culture, regarding the arts as such an aspect of western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge| place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The FWBO's attitude to spreading the Dharma is one of heartfelt urgency," wrote [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], a prominent British Buddhist author, in a book published in 1994.&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1994 339"&gt;{{citation | first=Stephen | last=Batchelor | year=1994 | title=The Awakening of the West | publisher=Aquarian | isbn=978-0-938077-69-5 | page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For the FWBO, Western Society as such needs to be subject to the unflinching scrutiny of Buddhist values."

==The Triratna Buddhist Order==
The Triratna Buddhist Order is the focal-point of the community,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Peter| last=Clarke| year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a network of friendships between individuals who have made personal commitments to the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha, in communion with others.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 194"/&gt;
Members are known as dharmacharis (masculine) or dharmacharinis (feminine), and are ordained in accord with a ceremony formulated by the founder. At ordination they are given a religious name in Pali or Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Clarke 2005 198"&gt;{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is an informal hierarchy within the order, there are no higher ordinations. A small number of members, however, take vows of celibacy and adopt a simpler lifestyle. Contrary to the traditional Buddhist structure of separating lay and monastic members, the order combines monastic and lay lifestyles under one ordination,&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 194"/&gt; a practice not dissimilar to that which evolved in some Japanese schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Neither Monk nor Layman: Clerical Marriage in Modern Japanese Buddhism Richard Jaffe. Published by Princeton University Press and copyrighted, © 2002, by Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-07495-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with followers of the [[Shingon]] school of Buddhism, order members observe ten precepts (ethical training rules).&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 117"/&gt; These precepts are different from monastic vows and do not appear in the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], but were formulated on the basis of the so-called "dasa-kusala-dhammas" (ten wholesome actions). These are found in several places in the [[Pāli Canon]], as well as in some Sanskrit sources. The [[karma]] sections of the fundamental meditation texts of all four schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] also list these acts as basic guidelines for lay or ordained practitioners intent on observing the law of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Pali sources: the Majjhima Nikāya, (MN 41:8–14). (See also: DN 114, MN.114, AN vol. V inter alia).Sanskrit sources:the Mahāvastu, the [[Vimalakīrti Nideśa]], and the [[Suvarnaprabhāṣa Sūtra]]Tibetan sources (for example): Tzong Kha Pa's 'Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path; Gampopa's 'Jewel Ornament of Liberation; Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub's 'The Beautiful Ornament of the Triple Vision'; Paltrul Rinpoche's 'The Words of my Perfect Teacher'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this, a commitment to personal [[dharma]] practice and to remain in communication with other members are the only expectations.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 117"/&gt; Ordination confers no special status, nor any specific responsibilities, although many order members choose to take on responsibilities for such things as teaching meditation and dharma. In mid-2008, there were around 1,500 members of the order, in more than 20 countries.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 193"/&gt;

==The wider community==
In the Triratna community, as in the [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] traditions, ''sangha'' is interpreted as the Buddhist community as a whole. Someone who regularly attends community activities is considered to be a "friend". Friends do not have to regard themselves as Buddhists, and can be of any faith, or none. Some choose, after some time, to participate in a formal ceremony of affiliation, and thus become a "mitra." "Mitra" is [[Sanskrit]] for "friend", which in this case denotes a person who considers themselves Buddhist, who makes an effort to live in accordance with the five ethical precepts, and who feels that this spiritual community is the appropriate one for them.

Those who wish to join the Order must request this in writing. It will then take several years to prepare for ordination. This is an informal process, the focus of which is to deepen one's commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Friends, Mitras and Order members decide, at least for a while, to study teachings from outside the community, including non-Buddhist traditions such as [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 81"&gt;{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, the community was founded in London in April 1967 by [[Sangharakshita]]. He had then recently returned to England after spending two decades as a Buddhist and monk in India, following demobilisation from the British army.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Subhuti | origyear=1994| year=2009 | title=Sangharakshita: A New Voice in the Buddhist Tradition | publisher=Windhorse | isbn=978-0-904766-68-4 | pages=16–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been born in south London as Dennis Lingwood, in August 1925. He would lead the organisation until his formal retirement in 1995, and would continue to exert a decisive influence on its thinking and practices thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the order grew in India, and, according to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Edward A | last=Irons | year=2008 | title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism | publisher=Checkmark Books | isbn=978-0-8160-5459-6 | page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian members now make up about half the movement's formal membership. In a book published in 2005, the FWBO's members and supporters were estimated to number 100,000, the majority of whom were in India.&lt;ref name="Queen 2005 378"/&gt;

In 1997, the responsibility for ordination and spiritual leadership passed to a "preceptor's college", based in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="Clarke 2005 198"/&gt; In 2000, the first chair of a preceptor's council was chosen by Sangharakshita. In future, this position will be elected by the WBO to five-year terms.&lt;ref name="Clarke 2005 198"/&gt;

In 2003, the public preceptors, responding to feedback, decided to move away from a formal relationship to the order and movement, and to concentrate on the ordination of new order members, teaching and dharma practice. At the same time, to increase flexibility, the number of preceptors was expanded.

==Name change==
In the spring of 2010, the Western Buddhist Order and Friends of the Western Buddhist Order changed their names to the Triratna Buddhist Order (which approximates in English to the name used in India - Triratna Bauddha Mahasangha) and the Triratna Buddhist Community. Since its western foundation the movement had spread to other parts of the world, including India where it was known by a different, non-western, name, and Indian members had long wished for one single worldwide name. An official history acknowledges this to have been controversial among some Order members.&lt;ref name="Vajragupta 2010"&gt;{{citation | last=Vajragupta | year=2010 | title=The Triratna Story: Behind the Scenes of a New Buddhist Movement | publisher= Windhorse | isbn=978-1-899579-92-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Triratna", Sanskrit term meaning [[Three Jewels]])

==Controversies and criticism==

===Spiritual lineage===
Although Sangharakshita studied under, and in some cases received initiations from, eminent Buddhist teachers during his two decades in [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Stephen | last=Batchelor | year=1994 | title=The Awakening of the West | publisher=Aquarian | isbn=978-0-938077-69-5 | pages=323–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Jagdish Kashyap]], [[Dhardo Rinpoche]], HH [[Dudjom Rinpoche]], HH [[Dilgo Khyentse]], and [[Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö|Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche]], author James William Coleman has noted that "he never worked closely enough with any teacher to be recognized as a dharma-heir".&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 81"/&gt;

Rather than leadership by a guru, the community instead operates through what has been called a "friendly hierarchy,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=A | last=Rawlinson | year=1997 | title=The Book of Enlightened Masters | publisher=Open Court | place=Chicago | isbn=978-0-8126-9310-2 | page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some critics have said can cause problems.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2001 309"/&gt; In 1997, [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], a prominent Buddhist commentator, was quoted as saying that the FWBO operated as "a self-enclosed system" and that their writings "have the predictability of those who believe they have all the answers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dark side of enlightenment|url=http://www.ex-cult.org/fwbo/Guardian.htm|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 27, 1997|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 Sangharakshita wrote of his "conviction that the less the FWBO is involved with 'Buddhist groups' and with individuals affiliated to existing Buddhist traditions, the better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Travel Letters |last=Sangharakshita |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Windhorse Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-904766-17-2 |page= 173|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, however, the community is a member of the [[European Buddhist Union]] and the [[Network of Buddhist Organisations]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbo.org.uk/get-involved/buddhist-links/old-nbo-members-page Network of Buddhist Organisations] Accessed 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; individual members of the order serve on the board of the [[International Network of Engaged Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inebnetwork.org/ineb/committee International Network of Engaged Buddhists &gt; Committee] Accessed 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the FWBO's former magazine, ''Dharma Life'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dharmalife.com/ Dharma Life]'' Accessed 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; frequently carried articles by Buddhists from other organisations.

===The Guardian report===
In October 1997, the FWBO and Western Buddhist Order were rocked&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first= Dharmachari | last= Vishvapani | title=Perceptions of the FWBO in British Buddhism | publisher= Western Buddhist Review | volume= 13 | url= http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol3/Perceptions.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a report by the religious affairs correspondent of the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', which made wide-ranging allegations of sexual misconduct, dogmatism and misogyny within the movement during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2001 309"/&gt;

The most detailed complaints reported were claims by Mark Dunlop, who had lived with the movement's founder for a number of years in the early 1970s, and left the order in 1985. The report described intimate details of what Dunlop characterised as their relationship, and claimed that Sangharakshita, who declined to comment, had told him “that to develop spiritually he had to get over his anti-homosexual conditioning.”

The report contained further allegations from an anonymous source, who said that he had been persuaded into a sexual relationship with the leader of FWBO's centre in [[Croydon]], south of London. “The head of the community was a very powerful, intrusive personality and incredibly manipulative. He would intuitively become aware of people's vulnerabilities,” the source was reported to have said.

A third concern drew on complaints by the mother of a former FWBO member who had committed suicide in 1990, following a history of depression. A report by a clinical psychologist said, among other things: “He feels the community attempted to alienate him from his family and from women, and that direct attempts were made to encourage him to practise homosexuality. He stated that he did not indulge in homosexual practices, although attempts were made for him to do so both by using inducements and by using threats.”

===Sexuality, women and the family===
Following ''The Guardian'' report, a widespread debate ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first= John | last= Crook | title=Dangers in Devotion: Buddhist Cults and the Task of a Guru | url= http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/dangers-in-devotion.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first= Dharmachari | last= Vishvapani | title=Testing Articles of Faith | publisher= DharmaLife | issue= 17 | url= http://www.dharmalife.com/issue17/testingfaith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed to writings by Sangharakshita, and his senior advisor [[Dharmachari Subhuti]], which placed such emphasis on single-sex activities, and what the Triratna Buddhist Community calls “spiritual friendship”,&lt;ref name="Queen 2005 377"/&gt; that the potential for misunderstandings or inappropriate behaviour appeared to some to be inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Stuart | last=McLeod | year=2001 | title=The Benefits and Pitfalls of the Teacher-Meditator Relationship | publisher=thezensite.com | url= http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Miscellaneous/Benefits_and_Pitfalls-McLeod.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FWBO had long been known for questioning assumptions about family life,&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1994 339"/&gt; and, according to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism:&lt;ref name="Irons 2008 206"/&gt;

:"Among the unique characteristics of the FWBO has been the open acceptance of homosexuality among the members. Order members have concluded that precept rules against abusing sexuality do not relate to the formal structure of sexual relations so much as to the nature of the relationship itself."

In an official biography of Sangharakshita, published in 1994, and reissued in 2009, Subhuti says: “Sangharakshita believes that men must break down their fear of homosexuality by facing the fact that there may be some element of sexual attraction towards their friends.”&lt;ref name="Subhuti 1994, 2009 166"&gt;{{citation | last=Subhuti | origyear=1994| year=2009 | title=Sangharakshita: A New Voice in the Buddhist Tradition | publisher=Windhorse | isbn=978-0-904766-68-4 | page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' report also raised controversy over statements by Sangharakshita which it interpreted as adverse to women and the family. Expressing views found in Buddhist texts from their earliest times,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Tamura Yoshiro | last=Kato (ed) | year=1971 | title=The Threefold Lotus Sutra| publisher=Kosei Publishing | isbn=978-4-333-00208-5 | page=207 (notes)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Jan | last=Natier | year=2003 | title=A Few Good Men: the Boddhisattva Path According to the Inquiry of Ugra (Ugrapariprccha) | publisher=University of Hawaii | pages=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Nagapriya | last=Wright | year=2009 | title=Visions of Mahayana Buddhism | publisher=Windhorse Publications | isbn=978-1-899579-97-6 | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has argued, for example, that, at least in the early stages of their spiritual careers, men are more apt to commit themselves to the spiritual life than women.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 144"&gt;{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he wrote that the couple and nuclear family can be sources of neurosis.
:"A couple consists, in fact, of two half-people, each of whom unconsciously invests part of his or her total being in the other: each is dependent on the other for the kind of psychological security that can be found, ultimately, only within oneself."(Sangharakshita, 1986, Alternative Traditions).

Although scriptures and historians recognize that the Buddha himself had concerns over such issues, particularly after the birth of his son [[Rahula]], when he left home convinced that "family life was incompatible with the highest forms of spirituality",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Karen | last=Armstrong | year=2000 | title=Buddha | publisher= (UK) Orion | isbn=978-0-7538-1340-9  | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics cite Sangharakshita's conservative views as evidence that misogynystic attitudes persisted in the FWBO during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2001 309"/&gt;
Evidence that those ideas may have been more widely held is also found in the writings of Subhuti, who echoes the [[Sūtra|sutras]] when he says in his book, 'Women, men and angels,' that to be reborn as a woman is to be less spiritually able than to be reborn as a man.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2001 144"/&gt;

As a movement, what was then the FWBO gave detailed responses and staunchly supported its founder,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Sangharakshita's Teachings in Theory and Practice | publisher= fwbo | url= http://response.fwbo.org/guardian-article/guardian2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2010 the renamed movement published an official history which acknowledged widespread concern among order members that, at least in the 1980s and before, the founder had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to sexually exploit young men.&lt;ref name="Vajragupta 2010"/&gt;

The controversies have attracted little public interest, and in recent years both ''The Guardian'', and its sister Sunday newspaper, ''[[The Observer]]'', have run many supportive items, recommending community activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Sandra Deeble | title = Mind Over Other Matters |work=[[The Guardian]] | date= 8 May 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/money/2004/may/08/workandcareers.jobsandmoney |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Right Frame of Mind on Run In |author=Karen Hainsworth |work=[[The Guardian]] | date= 22 January 2005 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/jan/22/careers.studentwork | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Meditation directory |work=[[The Observer]] | date= 6 July 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/06/healthandwellbeing.relaxation10 | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''Guardian'' Web directory listed the FWBO website as "a good starting point for children."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Buddhism | work= [[The Guardian]] | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/netclass/schools/religion/links/0,,81145,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4035">'''Wassim Doureihi''' ({{lang-ar|وسيم دوريهي}}; born in Sydney, Australia) is a prominent member of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia)]] (The Party of Liberation), a global [[Islamic]] political party that advocates the re-establishment of the [[Caliphate]] in the Muslim world.  He is a spokesman for the organisation.&lt;ref name="Wassim1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sheikh-ismail-alwahwah-a-sinister-player-in-a-world-of-radicals/story-fni0cx12-1227085769758  |title=Sheikh Ismail al-Wahwah: A sinister player in a world of radicals|author=Chambers, Geoff|date=10 October 2014|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At a July 2014 demonstration in Sydney, Doureihi described the conflict against Israel as, "a civilizational struggle between Islam and between [[Kafir|kufir]]," further saying that, "this is an Islamic struggle to liberate Islamic lands, to re-institute Islamic rule over what is, and will always be, Islamic land." Regarding Jews who currently live in Israel, Doureihi said, "our advice, very clearly, is to return to the lands from which you immigrated, to do so peacefully before you will do so forcefully."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4403.htm Australian Islamist Leaders Incite to Jihad to Expel Jews from Palestine], [[MEMRI]], Clip.

In September 2014, in a speech to supporters at Lakemba, he said, "Let me say clearly, even if a single bomb went off, even if a thousand bombs went off in this country, all it will prove is that Muslims are angry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/firebrand-spokesman-for-hizb-uttahrir-wassim-doureihi-refuses-to-denounce-is-in-two-interviews/story-fni0cx12-1227084815114 |title=Firebrand spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir Wassim Doureihi refuses to denounce IS in two interviews |author=Chambers, Geoff|date=9 October 2014|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2014 interview with ABC's [[Emma Alberici]], Doureihi was asked his opinion on tactics employed by [[ISIS]] but instead he repeatedly diverted the topic in question&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/lateline-host-emma-albericis-only-regret-over-hizb-uttahrir-interview-20141009-113sgr.html  |title=Lateline host Emma Alberici's only regret over Hizb ut-Tahrir interview|author=Cormack, Lucy|date=9 October 2014|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss Hizb ut-Tahrir's view about the origins of the crisis in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] and to express his condemnation of the role of Western nations in the Muslim world.&lt;ref name = "Wassim1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2014/s4103227.htm |title=IS a reaction to unjust occupation |author=Alberici, Emma|date=8 October 2014|work=ABC|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interview, Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] said, "Hizb ut-Tahrir is an organisation with an ideology which justifies terrorism, and that's why I say it's un-Australian, it's also un-Islamic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-backs-lateline-host-emma-alberici-over-fiery-hizb-uttahrir-interview-20141008-113fxd.html|title=Tony Abbott backs Lateline host Emma Alberici over fiery Hizb ut-Tahrir interview |author=Burke, Latika|date=9 October 2014|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yated Ne'eman''''' ({{lang-he|יָתֵד נֶאֱמָן}}) is an [[Israel]]i daily [[Hebrew language]] newspaper based in [[Bnei Brak]]. The Hebrew edition is published daily except on the Jewish [[Sabbath]]. A weekly English language edition was published in [[Israel]] and distributed in Israel, South Africa and Britain until December 2006.

An English language newspaper by the same name is published in New York. It was formerly  affiliated with the Israeli newspaper, but is currently independent. This article concentrates on the Israeli Yated Ne'eman.

==History==
The paper was founded in 1985 by Rabbis [[Elazar Shach]] (1898–2001) and [[Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky]] (1899–1985). In 1988 Rabbi Shach went on to found the [[Degel HaTorah]] political party that later joined forces with [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudath Israel]] and is called [[United Torah Judaism]]. The paper was founded as part of a broad initiative to have a full range of social and communal organizations that specifically serve the [[Misnagdim|Lithuanian Torah]] community, after it was felt that [[Agudat Israel]], its institutions, and their paper [[Hamodia]] no longer represented their point of view.

''Yated Ne'eman'' is controlled by its rabbinic board which defers to Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]] and Rabbi [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]] on all matters pertaining to the content of the newspaper.

In the spirit of Rabbi Shach, its ideology is [[anti-Zionist]], with strong opposition to both [[religious Zionism]] as well as secular [[Zionism]]. In practice, these particular views are reflected in only a handful of articles each year. Most of the content reports news related to the religious community and articles supporting their ideology which is based on Torah study and mitzvah observance and does not define its basic identity in political terms.

Since December 2006, the [http://www.chareidi.org Dei'ah Vedibur] website has continued offering only limited news coverage and occasional religious content in English. The website is edited by Mordecai Plaut.

The [[Yated Ne'eman (United States)|Yated Neeman]] newspaper published in New York was originally affiliated with the [[Jerusalem]] paper of the same name, but is no longer affiliated due to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].

==The name==
The Hebrew phrase "''yated ne'eman''" literally refers to a peg strongly anchored in the ground, and is used figuratively to describe a secure connection or something which can be relied upon. The name was supposedly given by Rabbi Kanievsky and comes from [[Isaiah]] 22 verse 23, "ותקעתיו '''יתד''', במקום '''נאמן'''", translated as "And I will fasten him as '''a nail''' in a '''sure''' place", or as "I will drive him like '''a peg''' in a '''firm''' place".

==Censorship==
On April 3, 2009, the paper published a manipulated picture of Israeli cabinet ministers. Female cabinet ministers [[Limor Livnat]] and [[Sofa Landver]] were digitally removed from the published picture and replaced with male ministers [[Ariel Atias]] and [[Moshe Kahlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008983329_isphoto04.html |title=Women in Israeli govt?

In 2015, the newspaper refused to print advertisements for the political campaign of [[U'Bizchutan]], a newly formed political party dedicated to the needs of Haredi women and including female candidates on its slate. Ruth Kolian, head of the party, then petitioned the court to stop the discriminatory practice. The party prevailed and the court ordered the  newspaper to accept the advertisements. The court rejected the claims made by the news organizations that they might offend customers by publishing ads for the Haredi women's party. The head of [[the Rackman Center]] for the Advancement of the Status of Women at Bar-Ilan University's Law Faculty, Professor [[Ruth Halperin-Kaddari]], called the court decision "a historic legal precedent which determines that in certain circumstances, considerations of equality for women and election equality, as well as preventing discrimination against women and their preventing their exclusion, surpass property rights of commercial bodies like newspapers. This is the height of women's exclusion. Haredi women are not only prevented in practice from realizing the basic human right of running and being elected for Knesset, they are also denied the equal opportunity to inform their potential voters that they are running independently."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4636935,00.html Court orders Haredi papers to run campaign ads for women's party] YNET, 14 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the paper still refused to publish the advertisement and it never ran.
