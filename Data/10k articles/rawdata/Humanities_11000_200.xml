In the 20th century such studies were deepened by [[Norbert Jokl]], [[Milan Šufflay]], and [[Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás]], as well as [[Karl Reinhold]], and [[Eqrem Çabej]].

The studies of Albanology were more institutionally supported in Albania starting in 1940 with the opening of the [[Royal Institute of the Albanian Studies]], which had preceded the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]], opened in 1972. Meanwhile, during the 1960s, the [[Albanology Institute of Pristina]] was also reconstructed in [[Kosovo]], then part of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Shetuni2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spiro J.

The '''baseball cheering culture in South Korea''' started in the 1990s and continues to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/iw99106/220776033445|title=한국 야구 응원 문화|last=|first=|date=2016-07-31|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[KBO League#Teams|10 professional clubs]] and each club has its own way of cheering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201503291857115&amp;code=960801|title=한국 야구 팬들의 열정 넘치는 응원 현장|last=허|first=남설|date=2015-03-29|work=The Kyunghyang Shinmun|access-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean cheering culture generally shares similar characteristics: collective, enthusiastic and empathetic. Baseball cheering is popular among women because of the easy-to-learn melodies of fight songs, break-time events and a variety of foods. Baseball cheering is performed in most parts of a [[Baseball park|ballpark]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_2014-11-03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/openlabseoul/220029353959|title=즐거운 소란, 프로야구 응원 재개 - 한국의 스포츠 응원문화|last=|first=|date=2014-06-16|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt;

== Cheering methods ==

=== Fight songs ===
Korean baseball [[Fight song|fight songs]] consist of the song for each club and songs for individual players.&lt;ref name="nytimes_2014-11-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt; The fight song is a key element of Korea's baseball cheering culture. Cheering is done for the offence. Each batter has a personal fight song, sung when the batter enters the [[Baseball field#Batter's box and catcher's box|batter's box]]. The melodies of fight songs are taken from famous pop songs or K-pop songs, with lyrics rewritten to make it easy for the crowd to sing along. There are cell phone mobile applications that allow baseball fans to listen to the fight songs of clubs and players in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2016/07/11/0200000000AKR20160711156500007.HTML|title=보크는 몰라도, 응원가는 술술 나와요|last=이|first=대호|date=2016-07-16|work=Yonhap News|access-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cheering tools ===
In the early days of [[KBO League|Korea's professional baseball league]], which was started in 1982, the most commonly used cheering tools were Korean traditional musical instruments, such as [[Buk (drum)|Buk]], [[Jing (instrument)|Jing]], and [[Kkwaenggwari]]. But nowadays, a typical example of a cheering tool is cylindrical, inflatable balloon sticks, now commonly known in the English-speaking world as [[thundersticks]]. They are used for cheering by beating a pair of balloon sticks together to make a loud sound.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/BestClick/3/all/20081027/8649242/1#csidx9dee7f5be08905c901a0829c675f7ff|title=전태수 사장이 밝히는 막대풍선의 역사|last=이|first=길상|date=2009-09-23|work=dongA.com,|access-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_2014-11-03"/&gt; The first club in the world to introduce balloon sticks was the [[LG Twins]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/magazine/who-made-that-inflatable-noisemaker.html|title=Who Made That Inflatable Noisemaker?|first=Daniel|last=Engber|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s they made balloon sticks out of [[polyethylene]]. It has been evolving and now it is recyclable, as the sticks can be inflated for use then deflated for storage until the next game.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt;

Each club has its own color for the balloon sticks: [[SK Wyverns]] is red, [[Samsung Lions]] is blue, [[Doosan Bears]] is white, [[Kia Tigers]] is yellow, [[LG Twins]] is red, [[Nexen Heroes]] is pink and [[Hanwha Eagles]] is orange. &lt;ref name="Korean Culture and Information Service"&gt;Pg 71 - {{cite book |ref=harv|last2=Won Hee-bok|last=Korean Culture and Information Service|first=| authorlink = Korean Culture and Information Service| title = K-SPORTS A New Breed of Rising Champions|year=2012| publisher = [[Korea.net]]| isbn= 9788973755653|language=ENGLISH }} &lt;small&gt;- Total pages: 108 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting characteristic of Korean baseball cheering is fans wearing team uniform shirts with players' names.&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt; They wear this to feel a sense of belonging, solidarity and pride. Symbolic accessories and cheering tools play a similar role. There are stores in each stadium, so it is easy for supporters to buy cheer-related items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyesports.com/view.php?ud=2017081721533583157|title=MD 상품과 e스포츠 응원 문화|last=|first=|date=2017-08-18|work=Daily e-sports|access-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cheer leaders ===
The [[Korea Baseball Organization]] did not have standardized cheering methods until the 1990s. It was the audiences who became the initiators of cheering. The initial ways of cheering were clapping and spontaneous singing. But in time, official cheer leaders appeared.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://star.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/OhmyStar/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002307409|title=막대풍선 들고 "와와"... 프로야구 응원, 좀 바꿉시다|date=2017-03-16|website=오마이스타|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheer leaders and cheer leading captain are the ones who take the lead. Each club has one captain and four or five cheer leaders. Cheer leaders dance to the chant the captain is making. Basically, they start cheering with the club's fight songs, but sometimes they lead the cheering using the latest [[K-pop]] songs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt;

== Cheering features of each stadium ==

=== Foods ===
Each stadium has specialty food associated with cheering. A typical example of baseball stadium food is "[[Chimaek]]," which is fried chicken and beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/v/dd2123d4ed992ad5710750cfbae4414b|title=야구장서 치맥파티... 하루 1000마리 날개 돋친 듯|work=한국일보|access-date=2017-11-20|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various kinds of cheering foods featured at each [[Baseball park|ballpark]]. These are often the representative foods of the region where the ballpark is located. In [[Daegu]] [[Samsung Lions Ballpark|Samsung Lions Park]], there are Napjak Mandu (flat grilled [[dumpling]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jmagazine.joins.com/forbes/view/318614|title=야구장 엔터테인먼트는 ‘춘추전국시대’|date=2017-10-23|work=중앙시사매거진|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samgyeopsal]] (Korean-style bacon) and [[kebab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fnnews.com/news/201104092323329794?t=y|title=[이슈가 Money?] 치어리더 쟁탈전..지정석 1만원|date=2011-04-10|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Busan]] [[Busan Sajik Baseball Stadium|Sajik Stadium]], Buljokbal (spicy [[Jokbal]]), Bulgopchang (spicy [[Gopchang]])&lt;ref name="hankookilbo_96bb20ad4eb4b04880cf4e4b76d10d9"/&gt; and [[fast food]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as [[hamburger]]s and [[fried chicken]]. In [[Seoul]] [[Jamsil Baseball Stadium|Jamsil Stadium]], [[Jokbal]] ([[pig's trotters]]), in [[Gwangju]] [[Gwangju-Kia Champions Field|Kia Champions Field]], [[Garak-guksu|Garak Guksu]] (boiled thin noodles in dried [[anchovy]] broth),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lady.khan.co.kr/khlady.html?mode=view&amp;code=11&amp;artid=201205101808581&amp;pt=nv|title=‘야구 초보’ 당신을 위한 2012 프로야구 친절 설명서|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Daejeon Hanbat Baseball Stadium|Hanwha Life Insurance Eagles Park]], in Jinmi [[Tongdak]] and in [[Suwon]] [[Suwon Baseball Stadium|KT Wiz Park]], chicken.&lt;ref name="hankookilbo_96bb20ad4eb4b04880cf4e4b76d10d9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt;

=== Cheering zones ===
Each baseball stadium has its sections of unique themed seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/view.php?key=20150330010018236|title=“이왕이면 명당자리”…프로야구 구장별 베스트 명당|work=종합일간지 : 신문/웹/모바일 등 멀티 채널로 국내외 실시간 뉴스와 수준 높은 정보를 제공|access-date=2017-11-20|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/no1wooriauction/221050360440|title=(주)신한우리경매 맙소사같은 인생 : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_2014-11-03"/&gt; [[Incheon]] [[Munhak Baseball Stadium]] has a "T Green Zone", "Happiness Zone", "Skybox Zone", and “[[Barbecue]] Zone.” "T Green Zone" is located on the grassy hillside which is available to set up a tent or lay a mat. This zone is recommended to family audiences because it is not too crowded and there is a kid's park near by. "Happiness Zone" is located at the [[Backstop (baseball)|backstop]] and the seats are equipped with tables. "Barbecue Zone" can accommodate up to 200 people at once. It is Korea’s first stadium to provide fans a way to cook meat while watching baseball. At the store inside the stadium they sell meat and lend grills. "Skybox Zone" is located indoors, so watching baseball game isn't restricted by bad weather. Lastly, there is a “[[Home run|Homerun]] Couple Zone” in the outfield [[bleacher]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Many couples enjoy dating there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbcsportsplus.com/news/?mode=view&amp;cate=1&amp;b_idx=99939385.000#07D0|title=&lt;이동섭의 하드아웃&gt; 야구장 사용 설명서: SK행복드림구장 편|last=엠스플뉴스|website=엠스플뉴스|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jamsil Baseball Stadium|Jamsil stadium]]'s "Exciting Zone" allows fans to see players close up, but as this zone is close to the playing field, audiences have to be cautious about safety and borrow a [[helmet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0008155702|title=잠실야구장 어떻게 달라졌나… 선수 숨소리까지 들려요 ‘익사이팅존’ 생겨|website=news.kmib.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Suwon]] [[Suwon Baseball Stadium|KT Wiz park]] has a "[[HiteJinro|Hite]] Pub" and "[[PlayStation|Playstation]] Lounge." "Hite Pub" is Korea's first sports pub and the cost of one glass of beer and food is included in the ticket price. In the "[[PlayStation|Playstation]] Lounge" audiences can enjoy the match in the assigned room in which a [[PlayStation|Playstation]] is equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbcsportsplus.com/news/?mode=view&amp;cate=1&amp;b_idx=99935889.000#07D0|title=&lt;이동섭의 하드아웃&gt; 야구장 사용 설명서: kt위즈파크 편|last=엠스플뉴스|website=엠스플뉴스|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Daejeon]] [[Daejeon Hanbat Baseball Stadium|Hanwha Life Insurance Eagles Park]] has an "Outfield Lawn Seat" and "Outfield Fieldbox." At the "Outfield Lawn Seat", audiences can enjoy the game with the feeling of a picnic. The "Outfield Fieldbox" is where audiences can watch the game from seats inside the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.donga.com/3/all/20170426/84084679/2|title=한화이글스, ‘스포츠 마케팅 어워드 코리아 2017’프로스포츠구단 부문 대상 : 스포츠동아|website=sports.donga.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Busan]] [[Busan Sajik Baseball Stadium|Sajik Stadium]] has a "Rocket Battery Zone." There, people can enjoy the baseball game and camping at the same time, so it is recommended to family fans. These two stadiums both have an "Exciting Zone." This zone is close to the ground so audiences can enjoy the players’ dynamic game. It can be interesting to watch the game at ground eye level, but as many [[foul ball]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fly toward the seats, children are not allowed to enter as it could be somewhat dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.segye.com/newsView/20170416001394|title=입장권·용품 할인 듬뿍… “알뜰하게 스포츠 즐기세요”|last=세계일보|date=2017-04-17|work=입장권·용품 할인 듬뿍… “알뜰하게 스포츠 즐기세요” - 세상을 보는 눈, 글로벌 미디어 - 세계닷컴 -|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Tigers Family Seat" is most famous at [[Gwangju]] [[Gwangju-Kia Champions Field|Kia Champions Field]]. There are seats and tables for four to six people, so audiences can watch the game comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=144&amp;oid=117&amp;aid=0002030506|title=KIA타이거즈, 특석 및 가족석 신설|access-date=2017-11-20|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masan]] [[Masan Baseball Stadium|Sports Complex Baseball Stadium]] has the "Dinos Mattress Seat." Audiences can watch the game lying on comfortable mattresses. They can borrow a [[Umbrella|parasol]] and beach towel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/4443055|title=NC다이노스 매트리스석 '비치타올' 등 무료 제공|access-date=2017-11-20|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a unique stand made up of wooden decks. It is for family audiences and can accommodate six people. Audiences can party there, and no one complains about making noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.mk.co.kr/view.php?no=106471&amp;year=2015|title=NC, 마산구장 좌석…팬 친화적으로 바꾼다|work=mk.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cheering cultures of each club ==
The clubs of the Korean professional baseball league each have a unique cheering culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/junhoo10288/80132349077|title=감염된 테란의 둥지 : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans of the Lotte Giants use [[newspaper]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and orange [[plastic bag]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as cheering tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsq.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=156084|title=롯데자이언츠 '신문지 응원' 전격 부활, 옛 분위기 살린다 - 스포츠Q(큐)|date=2016-04-18|access-date=2017-12-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers are rolled up and swayed in the air. People wear plastic bags on their heads, some knotted to look like [[Mickey Mouse]] ears. The plastic bags were initially intended to handle garbage, but the supporters started to use them as a cheering tool. The Lotte Giants also have unique [[chant]]s, such as 'Azura' and 'Ma'. 'Azura' is a [[dialect]] word, implying 'yield a foul ball/home run ball to children', and 'Ma' is a dialect for calling children, implying 'throw the ball forward' (used when the pitcher throws to first base to check a runner). In response to 'Ma', supporters of other clubs make a counter-chant such as 'Wa' (a dialect of 'why').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.sports.naver.com/kbaseball/news/read.nhn?oid=003&amp;aid=0008139712|title=비닐봉지 머리에 쓰고 롯데 자이언츠 응원하는 바른정당|website=m.sports.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_2014-11-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews_50817262"/&gt;

[[Hanwha Eagles]] went through a decline of organized cheering starting in 2009. This led many baseball fans to start cheering for visiting teams. The Hanwha Eagles are trying to figure out how to keep track of the new trends and revitalize their fan base. They started to use Fanbots, a cheering [[robot]] made as part of the social cheering campaign for fans who want to support the team but cannot attend the games in person. Anytime, anywhere, if people upload a cheering message via web or mobile, the message is sent to a Fanbot in real time and to be displayed on the board Fanbot is holding. The Hanwha Eagles are the first club to use Fanbots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=464&amp;aid=0000000055|title=&lt;정우영의 히든클립&gt; 응원 로봇 '팬봇'을 아시나요?|access-date=2017-12-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_2014-11-03"/&gt;

The biggest feature of the [[Doosan Bears]] is that there are many fans who go cheering at [[away game]]s. In addition, the percentage of female audience members is high. In the 2015 season, the percentage of female audiences was 43 percent for all teams, while for the Doosan Bears, it was 53 percent. For this reason, Doosan Bears is the only team in the league to have separate parts for the male and female in cheering songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/junhoo10288/80132349077|title=감염된 테란의 둥지 : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kia Tigers|KIA Tigers]] have their base in [[Gwangju]], so they have many fans in [[Jeolla Province|Jeolla-do]]. They support the team regardless of their performance. The [[LG Twins|LG]] fans are similar in this regard. The official Kia Tigers team color is red but they use yellow balloon sticks for cheering.

Korea’s baseball cheering culture has been observed to be spreading to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/korean-baseball-team-fans-phone-cheer_us_5638d1fce4b00a4d2e0bdbcc|title=Korean Baseball Fans’ Coordinated Cheer Puts America To Shame|last=Spies-Gans|first=Juliet|date=2015-11-03|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight song for [[Eric Thames]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsq.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=235805|title=테임즈 응원가 밀워키 상륙, 한국야구 문화 'MLB 진출' - 스포츠Q(큐)|date=2017-05-03|access-date=2017-11-20|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thames, who had been a member of Korea's [[Changwon]] [[NC Dinos]] (2014–2016), returned to U.S. [[Major League Baseball]] with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 2017. His Korean theme song was played when he came to bat for Milwaukee. The song resounded through the Milwaukee stadium. His teammates, who did not know about the idea of personal fight songs, showed interest and hummed its melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsis.com/view/?id=NISX20170430_0014865133&amp;cID=10522&amp;pID=10500|title=[MLB]테임즈 맹활약에 NC 시절 응원가도 수출 조짐|last=NEWSIS|website=newsis|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kukinews.com/news/article.html?no=492602|title=밀워키 브루어스 “KBO팬, 테임즈 잊지 않았다”|website=www.kukinews.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

=== Crisis ===
Recently the issue of [[copyright]] for [[Fight song|club]] chants or fight songs has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawtimes.co.kr/Legal-News/Legal-News-View?serial=120079|title=프로야구 응원가 ‘저작권 침해’… 법정으로 가나|date=2017-08-10|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs want to make their song legitimate and are negotiating with the original copyright holders to use the fight songs familiar to the fans, but as the legal wrangling is ongoing, the clubs have either made some changes to the songs or used the songs without license to do so. The copyright owners for the original songs have prepared [[class action]] lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.tvchosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/27/2017072790021.html|title=[이슈 진단] 야구 응원가 저작권 침해 '심각'…이젠 짚고 넘어갈 때|access-date=2017-12-04|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Traditionally, the fight songs of each club were created without thought to the original copyright holder. The song would be [[Arrangement|altered]] by changing the lyrics, but this violates the author's [[intellectual property]]. South Korean copyright law largely protects both the author's [[property rights]] and [[moral rights]]. Property rights refer to the rights to the media that is owned by the creators. Usually, content producers are paid for allowing others to use their creation. Moral rights in South Korea are related to the issue of the creator's psychological profit. This includes the right to maintain the identity of the content. This means that anyone using the author's creation must not change its original form. However, the clubs usually modify the original lyrics or tune. Therefore, even though the clubs often pay a large sum for the author's property rights, the fight songs violate the author's moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lec.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=44062|title=신종범 변호사의 법정이야기(76) - 응원가와 저작인격권 - 법률저널|date=2017-04-14|access-date=2017-12-04|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Korea's baseball cheering culture is largely considered to be positive, but some issues have arisen over the course of its development. First is the "Azura Culture", the cheering culture of the [[Lotte Giants]]. This culture is semi-coercive rather than voluntary. Initially, this culture began with the expectation that if adult spectators pass a foul or home run ball to a child, the conflicts between the adults to get the ball might decrease. This culture also has the purpose of presenting a child with a good memory of watching a baseball game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1004189808&amp;plink=ORI&amp;cooper=NAVER|title=프로야구 롯데의 응원 문화 '아주라'…훈훈 VS 민폐|date=2017-05-11|work=SBS NEWS|access-date=2017-12-04|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the coercive atmosphere, there are a few audiences with bad manners who take the ball away from the teenagers. As a result, there is a growing criticism about whether "Azura Culture" is truly a good one. There is an ongoing debate online. Some even refer to "Azura Culture" as "robbery in the baseball stadium". As people give the ball to the child before shouting "Azura", the excitement of shouting it is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0010472408&amp;code=61161111&amp;cp=nv|title='어우, 진짜 극혐!' 아주라 논쟁 촉발한 외국녀 영상|website=news.kmib.co.kr|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Recently, other criticisms have been raised. Boisterous cheering culture makes watching the baseball game more joyful, but for some people who want to watch the game quietly, it is annoying. Residents neighboring the ballpark also suffer from the noise. Residents living in the apartment near [[Gwangju-Kia Champions Field|Kia Champions Field Ball Park]] sued [[Gwangju]] city and the [[Kia Tigers|Kia Tigers club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news1.kr/articles/?3084354|title=국내 첫 야구장 소음·빛 피해소송 내달 7일 변론 재개|date=2017-08-27|work=뉴스1|access-date=2017-12-04|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Korea's [[Baseball park|ballparks]] are located near very populated regions, it seems to be necessary to resolve the conflict between local residents and the baseball field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2016/05/04/0200000000AKR20160504092300054.HTML|title=야구장 야간조명에 "눈부셔 못살겠다" 고통 호소|last=박철홍|date=2016-05-08|work=연합뉴스|access-date=2017-12-04|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12493">The '''Brittle Books Program''' is an initiative carried out by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] at the request of the United States Congress. The initiative began officially between 1988 and 1989 with the intention to involve the eventual [[microform|microfilming]] of over 3 million endangered volumes.

== Purpose ==
In the beginning half of the 20th century it became apparent that the use of acidic [[wood-pulp paper]], common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the [[slow fire]]. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As [[mass deacidification]] efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material. Microfilm, one of the most stable and durable mediums around at the time, was decided to be the most reasonable alternative.

== Timeline ==
*1987 - A subcommittee of the House of Representatives during the 100th Congress (1st session) addressed the problem of "brittle books in our nation's libraries."
*March 17, 1988 - [[Patricia Battin]], president of the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA), testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies (Committee on Appropriations).  She proposed a collaborative approach to the preservation of the nation's brittle books and asked the House to increase federal funding for preservation microfilming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhalliance.org/testimony/1988/88testimony-pbattin.html# |title=NHA Testimony: Patricia M.

*October, 1988 - An appropriations bill for fiscal year 1989 gave the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] $12.5 million. Eight million dollars of that sum went to instituting a twenty-year program for the microfilming of endangered volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/timeline.html Timeline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1995 - The program was assessed to be on schedule and 25% complete.{{Citation needed|reason=who assessed the program?|date=August 2009}}
*Roughly 50,000 brittle and endangered volumes are microfilmed each year.

==Important figures==
[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] was a pioneer conservator in the [[library science]] field. He connected the paper strength or lack thereof (brittle paper)to the acidity of the groundwood used to make [[wood pulp]] after the 1850s.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;.{{cite web |author1=Timoth Barrett |author2=Cynthia Mosier |year=1994 |url=http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v13/bp13-02.html|title=The Role of Gelatin in Paper Permanency II|publisher=American Institute for Conservation.}}The Book and Paper Annual vol.13&lt;/ref&gt; 
With his own observations of his collection and tests conducted, he announced to the library community that acid deterioration begins to show signs after 20,40 and 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrow|first1=William J.|title=Permanence/Durability of the book-VI: Spot testing for unstable modern book and record papers.|date=1969|publisher=W.

== Structure ==
As with other [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] programs, the Brittle Books Program is a partnership program, meaning that qualifying institutions must apply for grants in order to participate. Should the institution be accepted, they are required to share at least 33% of the program's costs. Unlike other [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] preservation funding initiatives, the Brittle Books program does require that an institution in each state must be awarded a grant. The projects are largely run at the state level with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] providing methodologies, assuring a standard level of quality, and connecting the efforts of the various institutions. To be awarded a grant as part of the Brittle Books Program, institutions were required to abide by five basic conditions:
*1. That they abide by the national standard
*2. That they create three copies of all material: a master negative, a print negative, and a service copy
*3. That a record adhering to national standards be entered into a national bibliographic database
*4. That interlibrary loan copies be readily available
*5. That storage conditions meet that of the national standard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhalliance.org/testimony/1995/95testimony-pbattin.html# |title=NHA Testimony: Patricia M.

== Preservation issues ==

===Deacidification===
While there is a deacidification&lt;ref&gt;[[Mass deacidification]]&lt;/ref&gt; method that can successfully lower the acidity in brittle books, many public libraries do not have the funding to implement standard programs to halt the deterioration taking place in these institutions.  Some repositories have the resources to send books for a deacidification wash in stages.

Deacidification washes are usually a viable option for most repositories as books can be sent in bulk; however, only books of excellent physical quality may be sent.  The wash process is rather aggressive and any deformities in a book may cause damage to already brittle specimens.  Therefore, libraries would have to first repair those books in less than desirable condition - specifically elements of the binding, leaf attachments, and text attachments - before deacidification.  These extra conservation efforts would increase the costs of deacidification.

===Paper splitting===
Another option to preserve brittle books is to perform [[paper splitting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/papertreng.html MDEP Paper Strengthening Pilot Program 2003-2005 (Preservation, Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526155014/http://www.loc.gov/preserv/papertreng.html |date=May 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process dissects a book by its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually.  Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - and a piece of alkaline paper is placed in between.  The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process.  However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zfb.com/en_version.php Mass Deacidification and Conservation for Libraries, Archives and Museums from one source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting).  They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes de-acidification washes.&lt;ref&gt;Brückle, I. and Dambrogio, J.[http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic39-03-001_indx.html "Paper splitting: History and modern technology"] "[[Journal of the American Institute for Conservation]]", 2000.  Retrieved on 2008-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bansa, H. and Ishii, R. [https://www.uni-muenster.de/Forum-Bestandserhaltung/downloads/pfest-bansa.pdf "The Effect of Different Strengthening Methods on Different Kinds of Paper"]. "[[Restaurator]]", 1997. Retrieved on 2008-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liers, L., Wächter, W., and Müller, G. "Results of the paper splitting process." "[[Restaurator]]",1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microform===
Microform is a reasonable option for Brittle Book preservation mainly because microfilm can be usable for 500 years, so long as it is stored in proper conditions and a microfilm reader is accessible.  Even [[microform|microfiche]] is easier to store than microfilm, provided organizational practices prevent the divestment of sheets from their filing system. Despite its proven record of durability, microform is no longer a preferred method of digitization because it lacks the accessibility that modern electronic digitization provides.

===Digitization===
Digital conversion of physical items is the preferred method, despite an estimated five-year longevity for most computer files.  As proper archival-quality digitization requires use of large, uncompressed [[TIFF]] files, storage can be a significant cost, especially for public libraries. Moreover, copyright law restrains the ability to digitize all brittle books. While the library is authorized to make a copy of a book it cannot obtain through reasonable means, having a digital copy offers the possibility of unauthorized distribution if circulated in this format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byauth/oakley/brittle.html Copyright and Preservation-Brittle Books Preservation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photocopies===
Many repositories, such as the University of Kansas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/BrittleBooks.shtml KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190614/http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/BrittleBooks.shtml |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opt for preservation-quality photocopies.  A list-serv&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/Brittle.shtml KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903072543/http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/Brittle.shtml |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is utilized for the posting of titles so a consortium of libraries can benefit from a reduced cost in replication so they may maintain their circulating collections.  Maintained by OCLC, the submissions are processed at the OCLC Preservation Service Center and OCLC retains the digital copies produced as to defer any copyright issues away from the repositories subscribing to the service.

== Future ==
As libraries move into the digital era, preservation practices attempt to move with them. Current and future projects in preserving brittle volumes are more likely to involve scanning and digitization than microfilming. A recent example of such a program is the ''Digitizing America's Imprints'' project at the [[Library of Congress]] which received a $2 million grant in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-02-01-digitizing-brittle-books_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=A $2M grant will digitize brittle books | date=2007-02-01 | accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7123">'''Caleb Jefferson McNulty''' (December, 1816 – July 12, 1846) was an American lawyer, newspaper editor and politician.  Active in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he became [[Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives]]; while serving in this post he was alleged to have embezzled congressional funds; some charges were subsequently dismissed, and he was acquitted of the others. [[John Quincy Adams]], then serving as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] member of the House, referred to the charges as a "memorable development of Democratic [[defalcation]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, his diary from 1795 to 1848'', Charles Francis Adams, ed., Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co., © 1877, Vol. 12, p. 148 (entry for January 17, 1845)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[West Middletown, Pennsylvania|West Middletown]], [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], McNulty graduated from [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College|Jefferson College]], and moved to [[Zanesville, Ohio]], and then to  [[Mount Vernon, Ohio|Mount Vernon]].  He practiced law, worked as editor of the ''Democratic Banner'' newspaper, and became active in politics as a Democrat.  McNulty served as Clerk of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]], and was subsequently elected to the House himself.

On December 6, 1843, McNulty was elected by the members of the U.S. House to serve as their Clerk, defeating incumbent [[Matthew St. Clair Clarke]] of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Washington County, Pennsylvania with biographical sketches of many of its pioneers and prominent men'', Boyd Crumrine, ed.,  Philadelphia H.L. Everts &amp; Co., 1882, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress 1774-2005'', Washington, D.C., U.S. Government Printing Office, © 2005, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, he ran for [[U.S. Congress]], and lost to [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Columbus Delano]] by only 12 votes.

==Embezzlement charge==
On January 17, 1845, a shortage of $45,000 was reported from a U.S. House contingency fund.&lt;ref&gt;Again, ''Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, his diary from 1795 to 1848'', Charles Francis Adams, ed., Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co., © 1877, Vol. 12, p. 148 (entry for January 17, 1845)&lt;/ref&gt; McNulty was dismissed as Clerk, and the House recommended that the [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] institute the necessary legal proceedings to recover the money from McNulty.

During the House investigation, Rep. [[John B. Weller]] produced a document ostensibly showing that McNulty had simply deposited $30,000 of House funds with a New York commercial house.  McNulty’s accounting clerk produced documents, including a certificate ostensibly showing that the House had a credit for $29,000 dollars at the bank.&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, his diary from 1795 to 1848'', Charles Francis Adams, ed., Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co., © 1877, Vol. 12, p. 148–150 (entries for January 17 and 18, 1845)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edwin Stanton]] defended McNulty, and succeeded at obtaining dismissal of some charges, and acquittal on the others.&lt;ref&gt;“went to Washington and succeeded in having an indictment against Caleb McNulty, a defaulting clerk of the House of Representatives dismissed, thus saving”, p.27, Joseph Beatty Doyle, ''In memoriam, Edwin McMasters Stanton, his life and work, with an account of dedication of a bronze statue in his native city'', E Book [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/joseph-beatty-doyle/in-memoriam-edwin-mcmasters-stanton-his-life-and-work-with-an-account-of-dedi-goo/page-3-in-memoriam-edwin-mcmasters-stanton-his-life-and-work-with-an-account-of-dedi-goo.shtm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ohjeffer/1890bioindex/emstanton.htm]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
McNulty's reputation in Ohio was largely undamaged. Though he had previously served in the militia and attained the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], at the start of the [[Mexican–American War]] he joined the 1st Ohio Volunteer Infantry as a private.  He died on a steamship (some sources indicate the ''Alhambra'', others the ''Jamestown'') near [[Helena, Arkansas]] while the regiment was en route to [[New Orleans]] for transport to Mexico.

==Family==
McNulty was survived by his wife, Caroline Abbott Converse McNulty, and a one-year-old son named Rob Roy MacGregor McNulty (later, also, Converse), who had been born in Cincinnati in 1844. Caroline McNulty died before Rob Roy McNulty's tenth birthday, leaving him an orphan.

Rob Roy MacGregor McNulty Converse become a nationally prominent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest and U.S. scholar, and a chaplain with the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He was wounded at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and nursed back to health at the [[Mower U.S.A. General Hospital]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia]]. Returned to the field for the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], McNulty's brigade was captured by [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], and he was held as a prisoner of war at [[Andersonville prison|Andersonville]] from May to December, 1864.

After the war Rob Roy McNulty was successively rector of St. John's Church in Waterbury, Connecticut, Christ Church in Corning, New York, and St. Luke’s Church in Rochester, New York. A [[Phi Beta Kappa]] graduate of [[Iowa]]'s [[Griswold College]], he was also a professor of mathematics and science and chaplain at [[Washington and Jefferson College]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]]. He was also president of the [[Archeological Institute of America]] and a fellow of the [[American Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''Some of the Ancestors and Descendants of Samuel Converse, Jr.'' (Vol. II) (Ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2667">[[File:Даниил.jpg|thumb|The prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].]]

According to the theory of the art historian [[Marcia B. Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Marcia B.|title=Color and Meaning: Practice and Theory in Renaissance Painting|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-521-45733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained considerable acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Canonical Painting Modes by APA|url=http://artpaintingartist.org/the-four-canonical-painting-modes-of-the-renaissance/}}. Retrieved June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; '''''cangiante''''' is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian [[High Renaissance]] painters, along with [[sfumato]], [[chiaroscuro]] and ''[[unione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Marcia B., ''Rome'' (series "Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521624452}}, 9780521624459, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gt5gtrqoKOIC&amp;pg=PA148 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;   The word itself derives from the Italian ''cangiare'' ("to change").

''Cangiante'' is characterized by a change in color necessitated by an original color's darkness or lightness limitation. For example,  when painting shadows on a yellow object, the artist may use a red color simply because the yellow paint cannot be made dark enough. There are other methods of rendering shadows or highlights (for example, mixing the original hue with black or brown), but these can render the shadow color dull and impure. During the Renaissance, the variety and availability of paint colors were severely limited.
[[File:Giotto ArenaChapel Lamentation.jpg|thumb|An early example of cangiante by [[Giotto]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel|Arena Chapel]]. Note the shift in color on the robes.]]
The greatest practitioner of the ''cangiante'' technique was [[Michelangelo]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Marcia B., ''Rome'' (series "Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521624452}}, 9780521624459, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gt5gtrqoKOIC&amp;pg=PA148 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in many parts of the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. For example, in the image of the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], a transition from green to yellow is evident in the subject's robes. After Michelangelo's time, the technique found widespread acceptance and is now a standard painting technique.

[[Image:China Tibetology Research Center.JPG|thumb|right|China Tibetology Research Center]]
The '''China Tibetology Research Center''' ({{zh|c=中国藏学研究中心}}; [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ཀྲུང་གོའི་བོད་རིག་པ་ཞིབ་འཇུག་ལྟེ་གནས།; [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie:]] Krung go'i bod rig pa zhib 'jug ste gnas&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) is an [[academic research]] organization in [[Beijing]], [[People’s Republic of China|China]] devoted to the study of [[Tibet]] ([[Tibetology]]). It studies all aspects of [[Tibet]] including subjects related to everyday life in Tibetan areas (economy, ecology etc.).

==Founding==

The ''China Tibetology Research Center'' was founded in Beijing on May 20, 1986.

==Subdivisions==

Five research institutes comprise the scholarly core of the Chinese Tibetology Research Center. They are:

* Institute for Social and Economic Studies
* Institute for History Studies
* Institute for Religious Studies
* Institute for Contemporary Tibetan Studies
* Institute for Tibetan Medicine Studies.

Additionally, the Center also manages the China Tibetology Publishing House, the Kanjur and Tanjur Collation Bureau, the Beijing Tibetan Medical Center, the China Tibetology press and the Center’s Library.

==Activities==

International collaboration and academic exchange are key activities of the Chinese Tibetology Research Center. The Center has successfully held three international [[seminar]]s for Tibetan studies. In 2001, about 220 scholars from 14 countries attended the Beijing International Seminar for Tibetan Studies. Since the year 2000, the Center has hosted about 230 scholars, diplomats and journalists from 40 countries.

==Position on 2008 Tibetan unrest==
{{neutrality|reason=Undue emphasis on opinions opposed to the Dalai Lama|date=October 2017}}
The regional government of Tibet is quoted: "There has been enough evidence to prove that the recent sabotage in Lhasa was 'organised, premeditated and masterminded' by the Dalai clique," as published by the [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua news agency]], citing the Tibet government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Maureen Fan of the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] on March 27, 2008 wrote, 
::"Experts from the government-established China Tibetology Research Center echoed leaders in blaming the Dalai Lama for deliberately sparking the protests to separate Tibet from China and sabotage the Aug. 8-24 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:She further wrote of Lhagpa Phuntshogs, General Director of the China Tibetology Research Center that, 
:::"... even though the [[Lhasa]] riots were 'carefully premeditated and organized' by the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], he said, 'so long as the Dalai Lama abandons his separatist position, stops all separatist activities and recognizes Tibet and [[Taiwan]] as part of [[China]], the door for consultation and dialogue between him and the central government is always open.' Professor Lian Xiangmin, director of the center's Research Projects Office, responded to a question on whether China is afraid of the Dalai Lama by saying, 'I do not think I said the Dalai is highly violent, and I also believe that so long as 1.3 billion Chinese people are united as one, they will fear no one.' "&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160307045037/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nearly-1-000-give-selves-up-after-riots-China-3222441.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 John Powers wrote about 2008's "[[2008 Tibetan unrest|unprecedented levels of protest]]"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Buddha Party: How the People's Republic of China Works to Define and Control Tibetan Buddhism|last=Powers|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199358151|location=New York|pages=Appendix B, page 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "On March 7, 2009, Wang Xiaobin, a scholar at the China Tibetology Research Centre, told foreign reporters: 'We think the Dalai Lama is the reason for the riots in Tibet... and the Dalai Lama is a card, a chip in a wider diplomatic struggle.... If there was no intervention by the West, there would be no Tibet issue at all. The Tibet issue is a creation of the USA.' "&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Codefellas''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[political satire]] [[web series]] starring Emily Heller and [[John Hodgman]] distributed by Wired magazine. It was created by [[David Rees (cartoonist)|David Rees]] &lt;ref name="www.mnftiu.cc"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[David Rees (cartoonist)|David Rees]]|url=http://www.mnftiu.cc/2013/06/21/codefellas/|title=www.mnftiu.cc  » Blog Archive   » CODEFELLAS|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Spinks]] from an idea by Robert Green.

== Story ==
In the first episode "When Topple Met Winters", protégé hacker Nicole Winters (Emily Heller) who works for "Special Projects", an electronic surveillance governmental agency, receives a call from elderly Special Agent Henry Topple ([[John Hodgman]]) informing her that she has just been assigned to him to spy on the general public.

In the second episode "Meet Big Data", Agent Topple checks up on how Winters is settling into her new job at "Special Projects". Topple asks Winters about her surveillance of e-mails and in turn reveals his lack of understanding with modern computing. The conversation then trails off into the secret history of how fake mustaches were involved with the United States' national security.

In the third episode "How to Hack a Website", Agent Topple instructs Winters to hack a website. It is revealed that Topple merely used Winters's hacking expertise to remember the password to his old [[GeoCities]] e-mail. After Topple asks what e-mails are in his inbox, Winters finds an urgent message from 1998 on a secret project involving Topple's past partner Logan and a "test subject".

In the fourth episode "The AntiSocial Network", Agent Topple calls Winters about a supposed alert from [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] on a [[Cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] group called "[[Evite]]" infiltrating their networks and a subsequent attack. In the course of conversation, it is revealed that it is only an invitation from Topple's co-worker Doug for his retirement party described as a "big blow-out." Blaming the terror alert from PRISM on boredom, Winters brings up [[Facebook]], a social network. Topple then calls Facebook "the smartest way to keep people dumb since we started [[Water fluoridation controversy|fluoridating the water]]." Winters then admonishes Topple for having her to have to fill out a "88-J" incident form because of revealing classified information so candidly. Since "88-J" incident forms are only filled out by supervisors, Topple realizes Winters was promoted to become Topple's superior.

In the fifth episode "Spy vs. Spy", Winters calls Topple back since she was busy with a briefing. As Topple was not invited to the meeting, he passed the time watching [[telenovela]]s. Winters complains about his unprofessionalism and reveals that she had not slept well because of a list of troubles the night before. It turns out that the troubles were all perpetrated by Topple's ability to use national security at his disposal as he is still upset over Winters's recent promotion.

In the sixth episode "Blackmail at 4:20", Topple finds his personal accounts with [[Walgreens]], [[Amtrak]], [[MCI Communications|MCI]], and so forth have been hacked because of Winters. In retaliation, Topple orders a "toilet water sample" and finds that Winters is a drug user, which is grounds for termination. Coming to a compromise, Winters discloses to Topple her secret project: stopping a North Korean computer virus. Per their agreement, Topple gets to collaborate with Winters on the secret project as well as getting full credit for it.

In the seventh episode "25 Reasons the NSA Should Hire Buzzfeed Staffers", Topple sends Winters a fax of his analysis of the North Korean computer virus called "[[Stuxnet|Staxnut]]". As the two converse on the computer virus, it is revealed that the computer virus could replace all American digital content with North Korean [[flagging dance|flag dancing]]. Given that North Korea is busy producing flags, there is still time to stop the virus. However, Topple realizes it would wipe out electronic dance music (and other media) he loathes and thus realizes his dilemma.

In the eighth episode "How to Kill Your Boss", Winters informs Topple that she called Chief Deputy Rollins and that Rollins does not want Topple on the Staxnut project. Annoyed that he is not involved with the project, Topple lists off the people he has killed. In the course of the conversation, Winters receives an alert that the Chief Deputy was murdered.

'''Communicative rationality''', or '''communicative reason''' ({{lang-de|kommunikative Rationalität}}), is a theory or set of theories which describes human [[rationality]] as a necessary outcome of successful communication. In particular, it is tied to the philosophy of [[Karl-Otto Apel]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], and their program of [[universal pragmatics]], along with its related theories such as those on [[discourse ethics]] and [[rational reconstruction]]. This view of reason is concerned with clarifying the [[norm (social)|norm]]s and [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] by which agreement can be reached, and is therefore a view of reason as a form of public justification.

According to the theory of communicative rationality, the potential for certain kinds of reason is inherent in [[communication]] itself. Building from this, Habermas has tried to formalize that potential in explicit terms. According to Habermas, the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that need to be accounted for by the theory are the "intuitively mastered rules for reaching an understanding and conducting argumentation", possessed by subjects who are capable of speech and action. The goal is to transform this implicit "[[know-how]]" into explicit "know-that", i.e. knowledge, about how we conduct ourselves in the realm of "moral-practical" reasoning.

The result of the theory is a conception of reason that Habermas sees as doing justice to the most important trends in twentieth century philosophy, while escaping the [[relativism]] which characterizes [[postmodernism]], and also providing necessary standards for critical evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three kinds of (formal) reason ==

According to Habermas, the "substantive" (i.e. formally and semantically integrated) rationality that characterized pre-modern [[worldview]]s has, since modern times, been emptied of its content and divided into three purely "formal" realms: (1) [[Instrumental rationality|cognitive-instrumental reason]]; (2) moral-practical reason; and (3) aesthetic-expressive reason. The first type applies to the sciences, where experimentation and theorizing are geared towards a need to predict and control outcomes. The second type is at play in our moral and political deliberations (very broadly, answers to the question "how should I live?"), and the third type is typically found in the practices of art and literature. It is the second type which concerns Habermas.

Because of the de-centering of religion and other traditions that once played this role, according to Habermas we can no longer give substantive answers to the question "How should I live?" Additionally, there are strict limits which a "post-metaphysical" theory (see below) must respect – namely the clarification of procedures and norms upon which our public deliberation depends. The modes of justification we use in our moral and political deliberations, and the ''ways'' we determine which claims of others are valid, are what matter most, and what determine whether we are being "rational". Hence the role that Habermas sees for communicative reason in formulating appropriate methods by which to conduct our moral and political discourse.

This purely formal "division of labour" has been criticized by [[Nikolas Kompridis]], who sees in it too strong a division between practical and aesthetic reasoning, an unjustifiably hard distinction between the "right" and the "good", and an unsupportable priority of validity to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolas Kompridis]], ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' (Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-metaphysical philosophy ==&lt;!-- 'Post-metaphysical philosophy' redirects here --&gt;
There are a number of specific trends that Habermas identifies as important to twentieth century philosophy, and to which he thinks his conception of communicative rationality contributes. To look at these trends is to give a clear outline of Habermas's understanding of communicative rationality. He labels all these trends as being ''post-metaphysical''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; These post-metaphysical philosophical movements have, among other things:
# called into question the substantive conceptions of rationality (e.g. "a rational person thinks this") and put forward procedural or formal conceptions instead (e.g. "a rational person thinks like this");
# replaced [[foundationalism]] with [[fallibilism]] with regard to valid knowledge and how it may be achieved;
# cast doubt on the idea that reason should be conceived abstractly beyond history and the complexities of social life, and have contextualized or situated reason in actual historical practices;
# replaced a focus on individual structures of consciousness with a concern for pragmatic structures of language and action as part of the contextualization of reason; and
# given up philosophy's traditional fixation on theoretical truth and the [[Meaning (linguistics)|representational functions of language]], to the extent that they also recognize the [[moral]] and expressive functions of language as part of the contextualization of reason.

== Explanation ==
Habermas' conception of communicative rationality moves along with these contemporary currents of philosophy. Concerning (1) it can be said that:
:''[Communicative] rationality refers primarily to the use of knowledge in ''language and action'', rather than to a property of knowledge. One might say that it refers primarily to a mode of dealing with validity claims, and that it is in general not a property of these claims themselves. Furthermore...this perspective suggests no more than formal specifications of possible forms of life... it does not extend to the concrete form of life...&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning (2), Habermas clearly and explicitly understands communicative rationality according to the terms of a ''reconstructive science''. This means that the conception of communicative rationality is not a definitive rendering of what reason is, but rather a fallible claim. It can prescribe only formal specifications concerning what qualifies as reasonable, being open to revision in cause of experience and learning.

On (3) and (4), Habermas's entire conceptual framework is based on his understanding of social interaction and communicative practices, and he ties rationality to the validity basis of everyday speech. This framework locates reason in the everyday practices of modern individuals. This is in contradistinction to theories of rationality (e.g. Plato, Kant, etc.) that seek to ground reason in an intelligible and non-temporal realm, or [[objectivity (science)|objective]] "view from nowhere", which supposes that reason is able adequately to judge reality from a detached and disinterested perspective.

While Habermas's notion of communicative rationality is [[contextualism|contextualized]] and historicized, it is not relativistic. Many philosophical contextualists take reason to be entirely context-dependent and relative. Habermas holds reason to be relatively context specific and sensitive. The difference is that Habermas explicates the deep structures of reason by examining the presuppositions and validity dimensions of everyday communication, while the relativists focus only on the content displayed in various concrete standards of rationality. Thus, Habermas can compare and contrast the rationality of various forms of society with an eye to the deeper and more universal processes at work, which enables him to justify the critique of certain forms (i.e., that [[Nazism]] is irrational and bad) and lend support to the championing of others (i.e., democracy is rational and good). The relativists on the other hand can compare and contrast the rationality of various forms of society but are unable to take up a critical stance, because they can posit no standard of rationality outside the relative and variable content of the societies in question, which leads to absurd conclusions (i.e., that Nazism is morally equivalent to democracy because the standards for both are relative).

=== Validity dimensions ===

Concerning (5), Habermas's communicative rationality emphasizes the equal importance of the three '''validity dimensions''', which means it sees the potential for rationality in ''normative rightness'' (WE), ''theoretical truth'' (IT) and ''expressive or subjective truthfulness'' (I). The differentiation of these three “worlds” is understood as a valuable heuristic. This leaves each to its specific forms of argumentation and justification. However, these validity dimensions should be related to one another and understood as complementary pieces in a broader conception of rationality. This points towards a productive interpenetration of the validity dimensions, for example the use of moral insights by the sciences without their having to sacrifice theoretical rigor, or the inclusion of psychological data into resources of moral philosophy.

These last points concerning the breadth of communicative rationality have by far the most important implications. By differentiating the three validity dimensions and holding them as equally valuable and rational, a broader and multifaceted conception of rationality is opened. What this means is that Habermas has, through the formal pragmatic analysis of communication, revealed that rationality should not be limited to the consideration and resolution of objective concerns. He claims that the structure of communication itself demonstrates that [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and evaluative concerns can (and ought to) be resolved through rational procedures.

The clearest way to see this is to recognize that the validity dimensions implicit in communication signify that a speaker is open to the charge of being irrational if they place normative validity claims outside of rational discourse. Following Habermas, the argument relies on the following assumptions:

::(a) that communication can proceed between two individuals only on the basis of a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] (usually implicit{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}) regarding the validity claims raised by the [[speech acts]] they exchange;

::(b) that these validity claims concern at least three dimensions of validity:
:::: I, truthfulness
:::: WE, rightness
:::: IT, truth

::(c) that a mutual understanding is maintained on the basis of the shared presupposition that any validity claim agreed upon could be justified, if necessary, by making recourse to good reasons.

From these premises it is concluded that any individual engaging in communication is accountable for the normative validity of the claims they raise. By earnestly offering a speech act to another in communication, a speaker claims not only that what they say is true (IT) but also that it is normatively right (WE) and honest (I). Moreover, the speaker implicitly offers to justify these claims if challenged and justify them with reasons. Thus, if a speaker, when challenged, can offer no acceptable reasons for the normative framework they implied through the offering of a given speech act, that [[speech act]] would be unacceptable because it is irrational.

In its essence the idea of communicative rationality draws upon the implicit validity claims that are inescapably bound to the everyday practices of individuals capable of speech and action. A mutual understanding can be achieved through communication only by fusing the perspectives of individuals, which requires they reach an agreement (even if it is only assumed) on the validity of the speech acts being shared. Moreover, the speech acts shared between individuals in communication are laden with three different types of validity claims, all of which quietly but insistently demand to be justified with good reasons. Communicative rationality appears in the intuitive competencies of communicative actors who would not feel that a mutual understanding had been achieved if the validity claims raised were unjustifiable. Thus, the simple process of reaching an understanding with others impels individuals to be accountable for what they say and to be able to justify the validity claims they raise concerning normative (WE), evaluative (I) and objective matters (IT).

=== Standards of justification ===
Of course a very important issue arises from this, which is that what constitutes a good or acceptable justification varies from context to context. Even if it is accepted that rationality must be expanded to include normative and evaluative dimensions, it is not clear what it is that makes a speech act justified, because it is unclear what constitutes a good reason.

It must be understood that there are different kinds of reasons in relation to the different validity dimensions. This is apparent, because what defines a validity dimension are the procedures of [[Theory of justification|justification]] that are unique to it. For example, if one claims or implies with their speech act that it is raining outside, a good reason for claiming this is that one saw it out the window. If this were called into question, the claim would be vindicated by looking out the window. This is a very simple way of describing the procedures of justification unique to objective validity claims. However, if one claims or implies with their speech acts that 'abortion is acceptable in certain cases', one's reasons for claiming this must be of a different nature. The speaker would have to direct the attention of the listener to certain features of the social world that are infused with meaning and significance. The speaker would have to draw on insights into, for instance, the vulnerability of individuals under the weight of life's circumstances, the kinds of rights that humans deserve, etc. These types of considerations make up the resources available for the justification of normative validity claims.

What constitutes a good reason is a more complex problem. Accepting the distinction between the different kinds of reasons that accompany the differentiation of the validity dimensions does not give any insight into what a good reason in a particular validity dimension would be. In fact, it complicates the issue because it makes it clear that there are different procedures unique to each validity dimension and that these dimensions cannot be reduced to one another. Habermas does suggest some general guidelines concerning the rationality of communicative processes that lead to conclusions (see [[Universal pragmatics]]). But his explanations regarding the specific procedures that are unique to each validity dimension are much more elaborate.

== Critique ==
The theory of communicative rationality has been criticized for being utopian and idealistic,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1988, Calhoun 1992&lt;/ref&gt; for being blind to issues of gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 1995, Fraser 1987, Ryan 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and for ignoring the role of conflict, contest, and exclusion in the historical constitution of the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Nikolas Kompridis]] has taken issue with Habermas' conception of rationality as incoherent and insufficiently complex, proposing a "[[reflective disclosure|possibility-disclosing]]" role for reason that goes beyond the narrow proceduralism of Habermas' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cursive script''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:草書|草書]]|s=草书|p=cǎoshū}}), often mistranslated as '''grass script''', is a [[Chinese script styles|script style]] used in [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] and [[East Asian calligraphy]]. Cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. It functions primarily as a kind of [[shorthand]] script or calligraphic style. People who can read [[Regular script|standard]] or printed forms of Chinese may not be able to comprehend this script.
[[Image:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|left|Cursive script in [[Sun Guoting]]'s ''Treatise on Calligraphy''.]]

==Names==
The character 書 (shū) means script in this context, and the character 草 (cǎo) means quick, rough or sloppy. Thus, the name of this script is literally "rough script" or "sloppy script". The same character 草 (cǎo) appears in this sense in the noun "rough draft" (草稿, cǎogǎo), and the verb "to draft [a document or plan]" (草擬, cǎonǐ). The other indirectly related meaning of the character 草 (cǎo) is [[grass]], which has led to the mistranslation{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} "grass script".

==History==
Cursive script originated in China during the [[Han dynasty]] through the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] period, in two phases. First, an early form of cursive developed as a cursory way to write the popular and not yet mature [[clerical script]]. Faster ways to write characters developed through four mechanisms: omitting part of a graph, merging strokes together, replacing portions with abbreviated forms (such as one stroke to replace four dots), or modifying stroke styles. This evolution can best be seen on extant [[bamboo]] and wooden slats from the period, on which the use of early cursive and immature clerical forms is intermingled. This early form of cursive script, based on clerical script, is now called zhāngcǎo (章草), and variously also termed ancient cursive, draft cursive or clerical cursive in English, to differentiate it from modern cursive (今草 jīncǎo). Modern cursive evolved from this older cursive in the [[Cao Wei|Wei Kingdom]] to Jin dynasty with influence from the semi-cursive and standard styles.
[[Image:Cur eg.svg|200px|thumb|left|Chinese characters of "Cursive Script" in [[regular script]] (left) and cursive script (right). Notice that for the cursive form, there is only a total of 3 [[Stroke (CJK character)|stroke]]s which is 17 strokes less than its regular counterpart.]]
[[Image:Cursive characters dragon.jpg|thumb|250px|8 different cursive representations of the character 龍 (dragon), from ''Compilation of Cursive Characters'' (《草字彙》), authored by Shi Liang (石梁) of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The artists are: 1 Sun Guoting; 2, 3 [[Huaisu]]; 4 [[Yan Zhenqing]]; 5 [[Zhao Mengfu]]; 6, 7 [[Zhu Zhishan]]; 8 anonymous.]]

==Styles==
Beside zhāngcǎo and the "modern cursive", there is the "wild cursive" ({{zh|c=[[wikt:狂草|狂草]]| p=kuángcǎo}}, Japanese ''kyōsō'') which is even more cursive and difficult to read. When it was developed by [[Zhang Xu]] and [[Huaisu]] in the [[Tang dynasty]], they were called ''Dian Zhang Zui Su'' (crazy Zhang and drunk Su, 顛張醉素). Cursive, in this style, is no longer significant in legibility but rather in artistry.

Cursive scripts can be divided into the unconnected style (Chinese (S) and Japanese 独草, Chinese (T) 獨草, pinyin ''dúcǎo'', romaji ''dokusō'') where each character is separate, and the connected style (Chinese (S) 连绵, Chinese (T) 連綿, Japanese 連綿体, pinyin ''liánmián'', romaji ''renmentai'') where each character is connected to the succeeding one.

==Derived characters==
Many of the [[simplified Chinese characters]] are modeled on the printed forms of the cursive forms of the corresponding characters ({{zh|t=[[wikt:草書楷化|草書楷化]]|s=[[wikt:草书楷化|草书楷化]]|p=cǎoshūkǎihuà}}).

Cursive script forms of Chinese characters are also the origin of the Japanese [[hiragana]] script. Specifically, the hiragana characters developed from cursive forms of the [[man'yōgana]] script, called ''sōgana'' (草仮名). In Japan, the ''sōgana'' cursive script was considered to be suitable for women's writing, and thus came to be referred to as {{Nihongo|women’s script|女手|onnade}}. This term was later applied to hiragana, as well. In contrast, kanji themselves were referred to as {{Nihongo|men’s script|男手|otokode}}.

[[Andrea del Verrocchio]]'s [[bronze]] statue of '''''David''''' was most likely made between 1473 and 1475. It was commissioned by the Medici family. It is sometimes claimed that Verrocchio modeled the statue after a handsome pupil in his workshop, the young [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

The statue represents the youthful [[King David|David]], future king of the [[Israelites]], triumphantly posed over the head of the slain [[Goliath]].

The bronze was initially installed in [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in 1476.&lt;ref name="Verrocchio's David"&gt;[http://www.high.org/david/understanding.html Verrocchio's David&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525085051/http://www.high.org/david/understanding.html |date=25 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placement of Goliath's head has been a source of some debate for art historians. When exhibited at the National Gallery of Art, the head was placed between David's feet,&lt;ref name="Verrocchio's David"/&gt; as is the case in the statue's permanent home, the [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello|National Museum of the Bargello]], in [[Florence]], Italy. Another school of art historians have suggested that Verrocchio intended for Goliath's head to be placed to David's right, pointing to the diagonals of the ensemble. This placement was temporarily arranged at the National Gallery of Art, as well as Atlanta's [[High Museum]], among others.

David was intended as a representation of Florence, as both were more powerful than they appeared, and both the shepherd boy and Florence could be viewed as rising powers.&lt;ref name="Verrocchio's David"/&gt;

The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London also owns a plaster cast of Verrocchio's David.

'''Denying the antecedent''', sometimes also called '''inverse error''' or '''fallacy of the inverse''', is a [[formal fallacy]] of inferring the [[inverse (logic)|inverse]] from the original statement. It is committed by reasoning in the [[argument form|form]]:&lt;ref name=KA&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/wi-phi/wiphi-critical-thinking/wiphi-fallacies/v/denying-the-antecedent |author=Matthew C. Harris |title=Denying the antecedent |publisher=[[Khan academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If ''P'', then ''Q''.
:Therefore, if not ''P'', then not ''Q''.

which may also be phrased as

:&lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;    (P implies Q)
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore \neg P \rightarrow \neg Q&lt;/math&gt;    (therefore, not-P implies not-Q)&lt;ref name= KA/&gt;

[[Argument]]s of this form are [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]. Informally, this means that arguments of this form do not give good reason to establish their conclusions, even if their premises are true.

The name ''denying the antecedent'' derives from the premise "not ''P''", which denies [[Antecedent (logic)|the "if" clause]] of the [[indicative conditional|conditional]] premise.

One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample that has true premises but an obviously false conclusion. For example:

:If you are a ski instructor, then you have a job.
:You are not a ski instructor
:Therefore, you have no job&lt;ref name=KA/&gt;

That argument is intentionally bad, but arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example offered by [[Alan Turing]] in the article "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]":

{{quote|If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, men could still be machines that do not follow a definite set of rules. Thus, this argument (as Turing intends) is invalid.

It is possible that an argument that denies the antecedent could be valid, if the argument instantiates some other valid form. For example, if the claims ''P'' and ''Q'' express the same proposition, then the argument would be trivially valid, as it would [[begging the question|beg the question]]. In everyday discourse, however, such cases are rare, typically only occurring when the "if-then" premise is actually an "[[if and only if]]" claim (i.e., a [[logical biconditional|biconditional]]/[[logical equality|equality]]). For example:

:If I am [[President of the United States]], then I can veto Congress.
:I am not President.
:Therefore, I cannot veto Congress.

The above argument is not valid, but would be if the first premise ended thus: "...and if I can veto Congress, then I am the U.S. President" (as is in fact true). More to the point, the validity of the new argument stems not from denying the antecedent, but ''[[modus tollens]]'' (denying the consequent).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7129">{{other uses|Dirty Hands (disambiguation)}}
The problem of '''dirty hands''' concerns whether political leaders or other like actors can ever be justified in committing even gravely immoral actions when "dirtying their hands" in this way is necessary for realizing some important moral or political end, such as the preservation of a community's continued existence or the prevention of imminent societal catastrophe. If political actors can be so justified, a paradox or contradiction seems to emerge because it appears that these actors can, or even must, carry out actions that are, ''ex hypothesi'', morally impermissible. Classic examples of situations in which the problem of dirty hands could arise include [[ticking time bomb scenario]]s of the kind popularized by the television series, ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. The problem of dirty hands lies at the point where [[moral philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], and [[political ethics]] all intersect.

==Walzer and Williams on dirty hands==
Though the discourse on dirty hands goes back as far as [[Machiavelli]], contemporary philosophical interest in the problem of dirty hands had been revitalized by the works of American political theorist [[Michael Walzer]] and other thinkers. The term itself comes from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s 1948 play ''[[Dirty Hands]]'', in which Hoederer speaks of having dirty hands up to his elbows, then asks, "But what do you hope? Do you think you can govern innocently?"&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Dirty Hands'', in ''Three Plays by Jean-Paul Sartre'', trans. Lionel Abel (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept of dirty hands is much older. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth]], Lady Macbeth is plagued by guilt and believes her hands are covered in blood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/index.html|title=Macbeth: List of Scenes|website=shakespeare.mit.edu|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Bible in Isaiah 59, it reads, "For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Isaiah|title=The King James Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walzer argued that, in cases of "supreme emergency" in which a political community's continued existence is in imminent danger, its leaders might be obligated to dirty their hands and sanction gravely immoral actions for the sake of saving the community. Discussing the British bombing campaigns against German cities from 1940-1942, Walzer wrote:

{{quotation | [I]t does seem to me that the more certain a German victory appeared to be in the absence of a bomber offensive, the more justifiable was the decision to launch the offensive. It is not just that such a victory was frightening, but also that it seemed in those years very close; it is not just that it was close, but also that it was so frightening. Here was a supreme emergency where one might well be required to override the rights of innocent people and shatter the war convention.

Given the view of Nazism that I am assuming, the issue takes this form: should I wager this determinate crime (the killing of innocent people) against that immeasurable evil (a Nazi triumph)?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, ''Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations'', 2nd ed. (New York: Basic Books, 1992), 259.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] explored the problem of dirty hands in less hyperbolic situations, more the everyday necessities of political life than the extraordinary undertakings of defending one's community from outright destruction: "[I]t is a predictable and probable hazard of public life that there will be these situations in which something morally disagreeable is clearly required. To refuse on moral grounds ever to do anything of that sort is more than likely to mean that one cannot seriously pursue even the moral ends of politics".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Williams, "Politics and Moral Character", in ''Public and Private Morality'', ed.

[[Martin Hollis (philosopher)|Martin Hollis]], an English philosopher, also wrote about the dirty hands problem. He described the [[Massacre of Glencoe|Glencoe Massacre]] as an example. The act of committing murder under trust was a punishable offense and the order "should not have been given nor, once given, obeyed."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Martin|date=1982|title=Dirty Hands|jstor=193668|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=12|issue=4|pages=385–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hollis points out the utilitarian value of making a "bloody example" as a warning to the other chieftains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He said this was not a question of whether the ends justify the means because the other strategies to unify the nation may have had equally bad consequences. The value of uniting the country makes this a problem of dirty hands because the leaders involved had to make an ethically questionable decision for what they believed would promote the greater good. Hollis argues that politics is the art of compromise, and "the best is the enemy of the good."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example of the problem of dirty hands Hollis mentions is the decision [[Winston Churchill]] made in [[World War II]] not to warn the people of Coventry that the Germans were planning a massive air raid on their city. At first glance it seems wrong that he would send no warning, but had he done so, the Germans would have known that the British had broken their Enigma cypher, which Hollis argues Churchill believed to be a greater loss in the long term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The problem of dirty hands: paradox or confusion?==

Bernard Williams regarded as peculiar those morality systems that categorically privilege moral considerations over and above all others: "Ethical life itself is important, but it can see that things other than itself are important. It contains motivations that indeed serve these other ends but at the same time can be seen from within that life as part of what make it worth living".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Williams, ''Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard, 1985), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Donnie Fatso"''' is the ninth episode in the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|twenty-second season]] of the American animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 12, 2010. The plot revolves around an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]], who helps Homer go undercover to infiltrate Fat Tony's mob. Homer agrees to this in hopes of decreasing his sentence after being charged for bribery. This episode is a reference to ''[[Goodfellas]]'' as well as real-life FBI agent [[Donnie Brasco]].

"Donnie Fatso" was written by Chris Cluess and directed by Ralph Sosa. Critics were polarized with the episode, with criticism stemming from its main plot and cultural references. Upon its initial airing, the episode received 7.32 million viewers and attained a 3.2/8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. "Donnie Fatso" featured guest appearances from [[Jon Hamm]] and [[Joe Mantegna]], as well as several recurring voice actors and actresses for the series.

==Plot==
Homer and Marge wake on [[New Year's Day]] with hangovers after the family's [[New Year's Eve]] celebration. As Homer takes out the garbage, [[Chief Wiggum]], Eddie, and Lou arrive and issue him multiple citations and fines - the result of recently passed, frivolous laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s suggestion that he [[bribe]] a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]], who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.

Homer quickly gains favor with Fat Tony, due to a confrontation engineered by the FBI agent, and Fat Tony breaks him and the entire group out of prison and offers him a chance to join the syndicate. Homer's first task is to [[arson|burn down]] Moe's Tavern in revenge for Moe's rudeness toward Fat Tony on the phone, but Homer finds that Moe has already done the deed himself. Fat Tony accepts Homer into the syndicate and the two develop a special bond; however, complications over a scheme to import weapons put the syndicate under severe stress. Eventually Fat Tony discovers Homer's undercover status and, emotionally devastated by his betrayal, suffers a fatal heart attack. 

Meanwhile, Marge has begun to panic over being unable to communicate with Homer, as she knows nothing of his undercover work and cannot get any information on his whereabouts. She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells of the time he and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.

==Production==
[[File:Jon Hamm November 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jon Hamm]] made a guest appearance in the episode.]]
Donnie Fatso was written by Chris Cluess and directed by Ralph Sosa. In July 2010, it was announced that [[Jon Hamm]] would make a guest appearance in the episode as an agent for the [[FBI]]. In his interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', showrunner [[Al Jean]] was pleased with Hamm's performance, opining: "You gave him one note and he immediately did twelve great things with it. He was really funny. And handsome. He had it all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/20/jon-hamm-guest-star-mad-men-simpsons/|title='Simpsons' exclusive: John Hamm to guest|first=Dan|last=Snierson|date=2010-07-20|accessdate=2010-07-20|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm stated that appearing on the show was "an incredible experience". In his interview with ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', he continued, "I got to work on ''The Simpsons'', which I watched for 20 years and the show is still fresh and still funny and the characters still resonate. It’s one of the best shows on television. It was an honor to be asked to be a part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Mad Men's’ Jon Hamm On Joining 'The Simpsons': 'It Was An Honor' |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/mad-mens-jon-hamm-on-joining-the-simpsons-it-was-an-honor_article_34833|publisher=[[Access Hollywood]]|accessdate=2010-12-09|date=2010-07-21|author=Lash, Jolie}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Mantegna]] returned as [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]], and voiced Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4 |title=Schedule: December 5 - December 11 |publisher=FoxFlash |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328131804/http://foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4 |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Donnie Fatso" features several references to music, film, media, and other pop culture phenomenon. The episode's plot and title are parodical to that of the film ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/07/jon-hamm-to-lend-his-voice-to-the-simpsons.html|title=Jon Hamm to lend his voice to 'The Simpsons'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2010-07-21|author=Villarreal, Yvonne}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the episode, Homer's monologue serves as a homage to monologue of Henry Hill in ''[[Goodfellas]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/donnie-fatsothe-road-to-the-north-polefor-whom-the,48927/ |title="Donnie Fatso"/"The Road To The North Pole"/"For Whom The Sleigh Bell Tolls" |author=VanDerWerff, Todd |date=December 13, 2010 |work=''[[The A.V.

The final scene between Fat Tony and Homer is reminiscent to that of the television show ''[[Wiseguy]]''.&lt;ref name=tv&gt;{{cite web |title=The Simpsons "Donnie Fatso" Quotes|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/shows/the-simpsons/episodes/donnie-fatso/|work=TV Fanatic|date=December 13, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fox News 6th 48 jeh.JPG|left|thumb|[[Fox News]] was satirized in the opening sequence of the episode.]]
The opening sequence of "Donnie Fatso" featured a [[Fox News]] helicopter with the words "Merry Christmas from Fox News… But no other holidays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/12/13/the-simpsons-fox-news-christmas/ |title='The Simpsons' takes another jab at Fox News |author=Lyons, Margaret |date=December 13, 2010 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=2010-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third episode of the season to satirize Fox News in its opening sequence, having first done so in "[[The Fool Monty]]", in which helicopter can be seen hovering over New York City with the slogan "Fox News: Not Racist, But #1 With Racists".&lt;ref name=bill/&gt; [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', harshly criticized the show, calling the producers "pinheads".

==Reception==
"Donnie Fatso" was first broadcast on December 12, 2010 in the United States as part of the animation television night on Fox. It was succeeded by episodes of ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]''. The episode was viewed by an estimated 7.32 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with ''[[Extreme Makeover Home Edition]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'' on [[CBS]], and a game between the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as part of the [[2010 NFL season]] on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="overnight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/13/tv-ratings-sunday-bad-weather-close-game-sunday-night-football-highs-desperate-housewives-ties-season-lows/75182 |title=TV Ratings Sunday: Bad Weather, Close Game = 'Sunday Night Football' Highs; 'Desperate Housewives' Ties Season Lows |author=Seidman, Robert |date=December 13, 2010 |work=TVbythenumbers.zap2it.com |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/14/sunday-final-ratings-desperate-housewives-adjusted-up-the-simpsons-down-plus-amazing-race-undercover-boss-and-csi-miami/75412 |title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Desperate Housewives,' Adjusted Up; 'The Simpsons,' Down; Plus 'Amazing Race,' 'Undercover Boss,' and 'CSI: Miami' |author=Seidman, Robert |date=December 14, 2010 |work=TV by the Numbers |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Donnie Fatso" garnered a 3.2/8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref name="overnight"/&gt; The episode also became the third highest rated show of the week on Fox, only behind ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and'' Family Guy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/14/tv-ratings-broadcast-top-25-sunday-night-football-glee-two-and-a-half-men-modern-family-60-minutes-top-week-12-viewing/75340 |title=TV Ratings Broadcast Top 25: Sunday Night Football,' 'Glee,' 'Two and a Half Men,' 'Modern Family,' '60 Minutes' Top Week 12 Viewing |author=Seidman, Robert |date=December 14, 2010 |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total viewership and ratings were significantly down from the previous episode, "[[The Fight Before Christmas]]", which received 9.56 million viewers and achieved a 4.2/11 rating in the 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman |first=Bill |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/06/tv-ratings-sunday-football-lifts-nbc-amazing-race-and-desperate-housewives-brothers-sisters-hit-season-lows/74360 |title=TV ratings Sunday: Football lifts NBC &amp; Fox; ‘Amazing Race’ &amp; ‘Undercover Boss’ down; And ‘Desperate Housewives,’ ‘Brothers &amp; Sisters’ hit lows; ‘The Simpsons’ hits season high |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode attained mixed receptions from television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a 'C' grade, scoring lower than "[[Road to the North Pole]]" of ''Family Guy'' and "[[For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls]]" of ''American Dad''.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; VanDerWerff felt that the episode was "fairly lazy", and commented that the main plot was "too much of a mob movie pastiche."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Eric Hochberger of ''TV Fanatic'' criticized the humor of the episode, opining that "for an episode with such an overdone story, we could have forgiven things if it were at least funnier." He continued: "Unfortunately, there just weren't enough jokes to make the episode worth it." In conclusion of his review, Hochberger gave "Donnie Fatso" a 2.5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name=tv2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Simpsons Review: "Donnie Fatso"|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/the-simpsons-review-donnie-fatso/|first=Eric|last=Hochberger|work=TV Fanatic|date=December 13, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were also polarized with the conclusion of Fat Tony, and the addition of Fit Tony. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Darren Franich named Fat Tony's death the ninth Best TV Character Death of 2010, writing, "give the writers some credit for doing something different: In the middle of an otherwise straightforward mob-themed episode, they actually went ahead and killed off Fat Tony, a character who was first introduced almost twenty years ago."&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/12/21/best-tv-character-deaths-2010/#more-116552 |title=The Best TV Character Deaths of 2010 |author=Franich, Darren |date=December 21, 2010 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=2010-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Castellaneta]]'s performance in the episode, as Homer, Barney, Krusty and Louie, was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]], but lost to [[Maurice LaMarche]], who received the award for his role in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]".&lt;ref name="11noms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/PressReleaseNoms2011emmys.pdf|title=2011 Primetime Emmy Awards Nominations|accessdate=2011-07-14|date=2011-07-14|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''evolutionary argument against naturalism''' ('''EAAN''') is a philosophical argument asserting a problem with believing both [[theory of evolution|evolution]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] simultaneously. The argument was first proposed by [[Alvin Plantinga]] in 1993 and "raises issues of interest to epistemologists, philosophers of mind, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers of religion".&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Beilby(2002) p vii&lt;/ref&gt; The EAAN argues that the combined belief in both evolutionary theory and naturalism is epistemically [[self refuting idea|self-defeating]]. The argument for this is that if both evolution and naturalism are true, then the probability of having reliable cognitive faculties are low.

==Development of the idea==
The idea that "naturalism" undercuts its own justification was put forward by [[Arthur Balfour]].&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"&gt;Victor Reppert, C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason (2003) p 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] popularised it in the first edition of his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' in 1947.&lt;ref name = Nathan&gt;{{cite journal| last = Nathan| first = N.M.L.| year = 1997| title = Naturalism and Self-Defeat: Plantinga's Version| journal = Religious Studies| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 135–42| jstor = 20008086| doi = 10.1017/S0034412597003855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments were advanced by [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]] in ''Metaphysics'',&lt;ref name = Beilbyix&gt;Beilby(2002) p ix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen R. L. Clark|Stephen Clark]],&lt;ref name = Nathan/&gt;&lt;ref name = Balfour&gt;Arthur Balfour, The Foundations of Belief: Notes Introductory to the Study of Theology, 8th ed.

Moreland, "God and the Argument from Mind", in Scaling the Secular City (1978) pp 77-105&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[Victor Reppert]] developed a similar argument in detail in his book ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason''.&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt; Contemporary philosophers who have employed a similar argument against physical determinism are [[James N. Jordan|James Jordan]] and [[William Hasker]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason (2003) pp 204-275&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga proposed his "evolutionary argument against naturalism" in 1993.&lt;ref name = Beilbyix/&gt; In the twelfth chapter of his book ''Warrant and Proper Function'', Plantinga developed Lewis' idea,&lt;ref name = Nathan/&gt; and constructed two formal arguments against evolutionary naturalism.&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt; He further developed the idea in an unpublished manuscript entitled "Naturalism Defeated" and in his 2000 book ''Warranted Christian Belief'',&lt;ref name = Beilbyix/&gt; and expanded the idea in ''Naturalism Defeated?'', a 2002 anthology edited by [[James Beilby]]. He also responded to several objections to the argument in his essay "Reply to Beilby's Cohorts" in Beilby's anthology.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002 p 2"&gt;Beilby(2002) p 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 publication ''Knowledge of God'' Plantinga presented a formulation of the argument that solely focused on semantic [[epiphenomenalism]] instead of the former four jointly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name = Plantinga2008&gt;Alvin Plantinga, Michael Tooley, Knowledge of God (2008) pp 31-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plantinga's 1993 formulation of the argument==
Plantinga's argument attempted to show that to combine naturalism and evolution is self-defeating, because, under these assumptions, the probability that humans have reliable cognitive faculties is low or inscrutable.&lt;ref name = Warrant&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|authorlink=Alvin Plantinga|title=Warrant and Proper Function|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-507864-0|doi=10.1093/0195078640.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that several thinkers, including [[C. S. Lewis]], had seen that evolutionary naturalism seemed to lead to a deep and pervasive skepticism and to the conclusion that our unreliable cognitive or belief-producing faculties cannot be trusted to produce more true beliefs than false beliefs. He claimed that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] himself had worries along these lines" and quoted from an 1881 letter:&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2008/julaug/11.37.html |title=Evolution vs. Naturalism&amp;nbsp;— Books &amp; Culture |author=Alvin Plantinga |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |date=July–August 2008 |publisher=[[Christianity Today]] |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beilby p 3"&gt;Beilby p 3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trustworthy.

In the letter, Darwin had expressed agreement with William Graham's claim that natural laws implied purpose and the belief that the universe was "not the result of chance", but again showed his doubts about such beliefs and left the matter as insoluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[James Moore (biographer)|Moore, James William]] |author2=[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond, Adrian J.]] |title=Darwin |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth [Eng.] |year=1992 |page=653 |isbn=0-14-013192-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin only had this doubt about questions beyond the scope of science, and thought science was well within the scope of an evolved mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Isaak |title=The counter-creationism handbook |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2007 |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-520-24926-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]] said that by presenting it as "Darwin's doubt" that evolutionary naturalism is self-defeating, Plantinga failed to note that Darwin at once excused himself from philosophical matters he did not feel competent to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |title=Darwinism and its discontents |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-521-82947-X|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Evan Fales, agreed that this citation allowed Plantinga to call the source of the problem EAAN addresses ''Darwin's Doubt''.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby p 46&lt;/ref&gt; Also, contrary to Ruse's claim, Plantinga gave the name "Darwin's Doubt" not to the idea that the conjunction of naturalism and evolution is self-defeating, but rather to the view that given naturalism and evolution our cognitive faculties are unlikely to be reliable.  Plantinga asserts that "this doubt arises for naturalists or atheists, but not for those who believe in God. That is because if God has created us in his image, then even if he fashioned us by some evolutionary means, he would presumably want us to resemble him in being able to know; but then most of what we believe might be true even if our minds have developed from those of the lower animals."&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b/&gt;

Plantinga defined:
* ''N'' as naturalism, which he defined as "the idea that there is no such person as God or anything like God; we might think of it as high-octane atheism or perhaps atheism-plus."&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b/&gt;
* ''E'' as the belief that human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary theory
* ''R'' as the proposition that our faculties are "reliable", where, roughly, a cognitive faculty is "reliable" if the great bulk of its deliverances are true. He specifically cited the example of a thermometer stuck at {{convert|72|°F}} placed in an environment which happened to be at 72&amp;nbsp;°F as an example of something that is not "reliable" in this sense&lt;ref name="Beilby2002 p 2"/&gt;

and suggested that the [[conditional probability]] of R given N and E, or P(R|N&amp;E), is low or inscrutable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/plantinga_alvin/naturalism_defeated.pdf|title=Naturalism Defeated, by Alvin Plantinga|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's argument began with the observation that our beliefs can only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. To put this another way, natural selection does not directly select for true beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Plantinga distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four jointly exhaustive categories:

#[[epiphenomenalism]], where behaviour is not caused by beliefs. "if this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be ''invisible'' to evolution" so P(R|N&amp;E) would be low or inscrutable&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Semantic'' epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to behaviour but not by virtue of their ''semantic'' content.  Under this theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal event.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 6-7. Here Plantinga cites [[Robert Cummins]] as suggesting that this is the "received view"&lt;/ref&gt; However, on this view P(R|N&amp;E) would be low because the semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural selection, and it is semantic content that determines [[truth-value]].
#Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but ''maladaptive'', in which case P(R|N&amp;E) would be low, as R would be selected against.
#Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and also adaptive, but they may still be false. Since behaviour is caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus P(R|N&amp;E) in this case would also be low.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga pointed out that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a tiger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps Paul very much ''likes'' the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him.  This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief.&amp;nbsp;... Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it.&amp;nbsp;... Clearly there are any number of belief-cum-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plantinga | first1 =  | year = | title = Warrant and Proper Function | url = | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = 225–226 | doi = 10.1093/0195078640.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable under a conjunction of [[metaphysical naturalism|philosophical naturalism]] and [[Naturalistic Evolution|naturalistic evolution]] is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert that naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has a low or unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued, epistemically [[defeater|defeats]] the belief that naturalistic evolution is true and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally dubious or inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Fitelson and Sober's response===
In a 1998 paper [[Branden Fitelson]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] set out to show that the arguments presented by Plantinga contain serious errors. Plantinga construed evolutionary naturalism as the conjunction of the idea that human cognitive faculties arose through evolutionary mechanisms, and naturalism which he equated to atheism. Plantinga tried to throw doubt on this conjunction with a preliminary argument that the conjunction is probably false, and a main argument that it is self-defeating, if you believe it you should stop believing it.&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, they criticised Plantinga's use of a [[Bayes Theorem|Bayesian]] framework in which he arbitrarily assigned initial probabilities without [[empirical evidence]], predetermining the outcome in favor of traditional theism, and described this as a recipe for replacing any non-deterministic theory in the natural sciences, so that for example a probable outcome predicted by [[quantum mechanics]] would be seen as the outcome of God's will. Plantinga's use of R to mean that "the great bulk" of our beliefs are true fails to deal with the cumulative effect of adding beliefs which have variable reliability about different subjects. Plantinga asserted that the traditional theist believes being made in God's image includes a reflection of divine powers as a knower, but [[cognitive science]] finds human reasoning subject to biases and systematic error. Traditional theology is not shown to predict this varying reliability as well as science, and there is the [[theodicy|theological problem]] of the omnipotent Creator producing such imperfection. They described how Plantinga set out various scenarios of belief affecting evolutionary success, but undercut the low probability he previously required when he suggested an "inscrutable" probability, and by ignoring availability of variants he fails to show that false beliefs will be equally adaptive as his claim of low probability assumes. Even if his claims of improbability were correct, that need not affect belief in evolution, and they considered it would be more sensible to accept that evolutionary processes sometimes have improbable outcomes.&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt;

They assessed Plantinga's main argument which asserts that since the reliability of evolutionary naturalism is low or of inscrutable value, those believing it should withhold assent from its reliability, and thus withhold assent from anything else they believe including evolutionary naturalism, which is therefore self-defeating. They found this unconvincing, having already disputed his argument that the reliability is low. Even if ''E&amp;N'' defeated the claim that 'at least 90% of our beliefs are true,' they considered that Plantinga must show that it also defeats the more modest claim that 'at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true'. They considered his sentiment that high probability is required for rational belief to be repudiated by philosophical lessons such as the [[lottery paradox]], and that each step in his argument requires principles different from those he had described. They concluded that Plantinga has drawn attention to unreliability of cognitive processes that is already taken into account by evolutionary scientists who accept that science is a fallible exercise, and appreciate the need to be as scrupulous as possible with the fallible cognitive processes available. His [[hyperbolic doubt]] as a defeater for evolutionary naturalism is equally a defeater for theists who rely on their belief that their mind was designed by a non-deceiving God, and neither "can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt;

===Robbins' response===
[[Indiana University South Bend]] Professor of Philosophy J. Wesley Robbins contended that Plantinga's argument applied only to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian philosophies of mind]] but not to pragmatist philosophies of mind.  Robbins' argument, stated roughly, was that while in a Cartesian mind beliefs can be identified with no reference to the environmental factors that caused them, in a pragmatic mind they are identifiable ''only'' with reference to those factors. That is to say, in a pragmatic mind beliefs would not even exist if their holder had not come in contact with external belief-producing phenomena in the first place.&lt;ref name = Robbins&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robbins| first = J.

===''Naturalism Defeated?''===
A collection of essays entitled ''Naturalism Defeated?'' (2002) contains responses by 11 philosophers to EAAN.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised, unless otherwised referenced, from the [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1105 review by John F Post]&lt;/ref&gt; According to James K. Beilby, editor of the volume, Plantinga's proposition "raises issues of interest to epistemologists, philosophers of mind, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers of religion".&lt;ref name="Ref-1" /&gt; The responsive essays include the following:
* William Ramsey argued that Plantinga "overlooks the most sensible way . . . to get clear on how truth can be a property of beliefs that bestows an advantage on cognitive systems". He also argued that ''some'' of our cognitive faculties ''are'' slightly unreliable, and ''E&amp;N'' seems better suited than theism to explain this imperfection.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argued that there is a plausible historical scenario according to which our minds were selected because their cognitive mechanisms produced, by and large, adaptive true beliefs.
* Evan Fales&lt;ref&gt;Fales's article, "Plantinga's Case Against Naturalistic Epistemology" is also reprinted at p387 et seq. of ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics'' ([[Robert T. Pennock]], editor, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plantinga had not demonstrated that the reliability of our cognitive faculties is improbable, given Neo-Darwinism, and emphasizes that "if Plantinga's argument fails here, then he will not have shown that [N&amp;E] is probabilistically incoherent." Also, given how expensive (in biological terms) our brain is, and considering we are rather unremarkable creatures apart from our brains, it would be quite improbable that our rational faculties be selected if unreliable. "Most of our eggs are in that basket," said Fales. Fales argued along the same as Robbins: take a [[mental representation]], of heat, for example. Only so long as it is really caused by heat can we call it a mental representation of heat; otherwise, it is not at all a mental representation, of heat or of anything else: "so long as representations [semantics] are causally linked to the world via the syntactic structures in the brain to which they correspond [syntax], this will guarantee that syntax maps onto semantics in a generally truth-preserving way."&lt;ref name = Fales&gt;{{cite journal| last = Fales| first = Evan| year = 1996| title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology| journal = Philosophy of Science| volume = 63| issue = 3| pages = 432–51| jstor= 188104| doi = 10.1086/289920}}, cited in ''Naturalism Defeated?'' as being an earlier version of Fales' response.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct response to one of Plantinga's scenarios where, according to Plantinga, false-belief generating mechanisms may have been naturally selected.
* Michael Bergmann suggested that [[Thomas Reid]] offered the resources for a commonsense (Reidian) defense of naturalism against EAAN.
* [[Ernest Sosa]] drew on features of [[Descartes]]' epistemology to argue that while "[i]ssues of circularity do arise as to how we can rationally and knowledgeably adopt [an epistemically propitious] view about our own epistemic powers," nonetheless, "these problems are not exclusive to naturalism."
* James Van Cleve suggested that even if the probability thesis is true, it need not deliver an undefeated defeater to R, and that even if one has a defeater for R, it doesn't follow that one has a defeater for everything.
* Richard Otte thought that the argument "ignore[d] other information we have that would make R likely."
* William Talbott suggested that "Plantinga has misunderstood the role of undercutting defeaters in reasoning."
* [[Trenton Merricks]] said that "in general, inferences from low or inscrutable conditional probability to defeat are unjustified."
* [[William Alston]] argued that the claim that P(R/N&amp;E) is low is poorly supported; if, instead, it is inscrutable, this has no clear relevance to the claim that (1) is a defeater for N&amp;E.

''Naturalism Defeated?'' also included Plantinga's replies to both the critical responses contained in the book and to some objections raised by others, including Fitelson &amp; Sober:
* Plantinga expounded the notion of ''Rationality Defeaters'' in terms of his theory of warrant and proper function and distinguishes between Humean Defeaters and Purely Alethic Defeaters, suggesting that although a naturalist will continue to assume R "but (if he reflects on the matter) he will also think, sadly enough, that what he can't help believing is unlikely to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 211&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plantinga argued that ''semantic epiphenomenalism'' is very likely on N&amp;E because, if [[materialism]] is true, beliefs would have to be neurophysiological events whose ''propositional'' content cannot plausibly enter the causal chain.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp211-213 - he says that these arguments are "related in ways that are not entirely clear to arguments made by [[Jaegwon Kim]] in ''Mind in a Physical World''&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that the ''reliability'' of a cognitive process requires the truth of a substantial proportion of the beliefs it produces, and that a process which delivered beliefs whose probability of truth was in the neighbourhood of 0.5 would have a vanishingly unlikely chance of producing (say) 1000 beliefs 75% of which were true.
* In ''The conditionalisation problem,'' Plantinga discussed the possibility that N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. "Naturalism plus R," could be a basic belief thus staving off defeat of R, suggesting that this procedure cannot be right in general otherwise every defeater could automatically be defeated, introducing the term "''defeater-deflector''&lt;ref&gt;''ie'' something that prevents D (a supposed Defeater) from being a defeater in the first place, as opposed to a defeater-defeater which defeats D Beilby(2002) p224.&lt;/ref&gt; " and initially exploring the conditions under which a defeater-deflector can be valid.
* Plantinga concluded that the objections pose a challenge to EAAN, but that there are successful arguments against the objections.

===Ruse's response===
In a chapter titled 'The New Creationism: Its Philosophical Dimension', in ''The Cultures of Creationism'', philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]] discussed EAAN. He argued:
*That the EAAN conflates methodological and metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name=Coleman187&gt;Coleman(2004) p187&lt;/ref&gt;
*That "we need to make a distinction that Plantinga fudges" between "the world as we can in some sense discover" and "the world in some absolute sense, metaphysical reality if you like." Then, "Once this distinction is made, Plantinga's refutation of naturalism no longer seems so threatening."&lt;ref name=Coleman188&gt;Coleman(2004) p188&lt;/ref&gt;
*That "It is certainly the case that organisms are sometimes deceived about the world of appearances and that this includes humans. Sometimes we are systematically deceived, as instructors in elementary psychology classes delight in demonstrating. Moreover, evolution can often give good reasons as to why we are deceived." We know there are misconceptions arising from selection as we can measure them against reliable touchstones, but in Plantinga's hypothesised deceptions we are deceived all the time which is "not how evolution's deceptions work".&lt;ref name=Coleman188/&gt; He comments that in Plantinga's thinking we have confusion between the world as we know it, and the world as it might be knowable in some ultimate way, but "If we are all in an illusion then it makes no sense to talk of illusion, for we have no touchstone of reality to make absolute judgements."&lt;ref name=Coleman190/&gt;

Ruse concluded his discussion of the EAAN by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To be honest, even if Plantinga's argument [the EAAN] worked, I would still want to know where theism ends (and what form this theism must take) and where science can take over. Is it the case that evolution necessarily cannot function, or it is merely false and in another God-created world it might have held in some way&amp;nbsp;— and if so, in what way? Plantinga has certainly not shown that the theist must be a creationist, even though his own form of theism is creationism.&lt;ref name=Coleman190&gt;Coleman(2004) pp189–190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==C.S. Lewis framing==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It's like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can't trust my own thinking, of course I can't trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Plantinga's 2008 formulation of the argument==
In the 2008 publication ''Knowledge of God'' Plantinga presented a formulation of the argument that solely focused on semantic [[epiphenomenalism]] instead of the former four jointly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name = Plantinga2008/&gt;

Plantinga stated that from a materialist's point of view a belief will be a neuronal event. In this conception a belief will have two different sorts of properties:&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)pp 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;
*''electro-chemical'' or ''neurophysiological'' properties (''NP'' properties for short)
*and the property of having ''content'' (It will have to be the belief that ''p'', for some proposition ''p'').
Plantinga thought that we have something of an idea as to the history of NP properties: structures with these properties have come to exist by small increments, each increment such that it has proved to be useful in the struggle for survival. But he then asked how the ''content'' property of a belief came about: "How does it [the content] get to be associated in that way with a given proposition?"&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)p 34&lt;/ref&gt;

He said that materialists offer two theories for this question: According to the first, content ''[[Supervenience|supervenes]] upon'' NP properties; according to the second, content ''is reducible to'' NP properties. (He noted that if content properties are reducible to NP properties, then they also supervene upon them.) He explained the two theories as follows:
*Reducibility: A belief is a disjunction of conjunctions of NP properties.
*Strong Supervenience (S+): For any possible worlds ''W'' and ''W*'' and any structures ''S'' and ''S*'', if ''S'' has the same NP properties in ''W'' as ''S*'' has in ''W*'', then ''S'' has the same content in ''W'' as ''S*'' has in ''W*''. Supervenience can either be broadly logical supervenience or nomic supervenience.
Plantinga argued that neural structures that constitute beliefs have ''content'', in the following way: "At a certain level of complexity, these neural structures start to display content. Perhaps this starts gradually and early on (possibly C. elegans [a small worm with a nervous system composed of only a few neurons] displays just the merest glimmer of consciousness and the merest glimmer of content), or perhaps later and more abruptly; that doesn't matter. What does matter is that at a certain level of complexity of neural structures, content appears. This is true whether content properties are reducible to NP properties or supervene on them."&lt;ref name="Plantinga/Tooley 2008p 37"&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)p 37&lt;/ref&gt;
So given materialism some neural structures at a given level of complexity acquire content and become beliefs. The question then is according to Plantinga: "what is the likelihood, ''given materialism'', that the content that thus arises is in fact ''true''?"&lt;ref name="Plantinga/Tooley 2008p 37"/&gt;

This way of proceeding replaced the first step of Plantinga's earlier versions of the argument.

==EAAN, intelligent design and theistic evolution==
In his discussion of EAAN, [[Michael Ruse]] described Plantinga as believing in the truth of the attack on evolution presented by [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]], and as having endorsed Johnson's book ''[[Darwin on Trial]]''. Ruse said that Plantinga took the [[Conflict thesis|conflict between science and religion]] further than Johnson, seeing it as not just a clash between the philosophies of naturalism and theism, but as an attack on the true philosophy of theism by what he considers the incoherent and inconsistent philosophy of naturalism.&lt;ref name=Coleman187/&gt;

Plantinga has stated that EAAN is not directed against "the theory of evolution, or the claim that human beings have evolved from simian ancestors, or anything in that neighborhood".&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the problems raised by EAAN do not apply to the conjunction of [[theism]] and contemporary evolutionary science.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''Evolution and Design'' Plantinga outlines different ways in which [[theism]] and [[evolutionary theory]] can be combined.&lt;ref&gt;For Faith and Clarity, Philosophical Contributions to Christian Theology, Ed. James Beilby (2006) p 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foreword to the anthology ''Naturalism Defeated?'' James Beilby wrote: "Plantinga's argument should ''not'' be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic."&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

{{Democracy}}
A [[democracy]] is a [[political system]], or a system of decision-making within an institution or organization or a country, in which all members have an equal share of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=democracy, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/49755?redirectedFrom=Democracy#eid|website=OED Online.|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern democracies are characterized by two capabilities that differentiate them fundamentally from earlier forms of government: the capacity to intervene in their own societies and the recognition of their sovereignty by an international legalistic framework of similarly sovereign states. Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.

Democracy is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks and Romans, who were themselves considered the founders of Western civilization by the 18th century intellectuals who attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.&lt;ref&gt;Morris I. The Measure Of Civilization : How Social Development Decides The Fate Of Nations [e-book]. Princeton: Princeton University Press; 2013. Available from: eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Accessed May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which these 18th century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks and Romans into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be.  Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of empire following the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. 

Modern [[representative democracies]] attempt to bridge the gulf between the Hobbesian 'state of nature' and the grip of authoritarianism through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the [[right to vote]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Olson, M. (1993). Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development. American Political Science Review, 87(03), 567-576.&lt;/ref&gt; 
While they engage populations with some level of decision-making, they are defined by the premise of distrust in the ability of human populations to make a direct judgement about candidates or decisions on issues.

==Antiquity==

=== Historic origins ===
Anthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50-100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Given that these dynamics are still alive and well today, it is plausible to assume that democracy in one form or another arises naturally in any well-bonded group or [[tribe]].

These types of democracy are commonly identified as [[tribalism]], or ''primitive democracy''. In this sense, a ''primitive democracy'' usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.&lt;ref name="BA1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36707 Political System] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule – including [[monarchy]], [[tyranny]], [[aristocracy]], and [[oligarchy]] – have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.&lt;ref name="BA0"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233828 Democracy] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 B.C. In ancient Greece, where there were many [[Polis|city-states]] with different forms of government, democracy was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.

===Proto-democratic societies===
In recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred somewhere else (i.e. other than Greece) first, as [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] developed its complex social and political institutions long after the appearance of the earliest civilizations in [[Egypt]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesopotamia====
[[File:British Museum Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|right|The tablet containing the epic of [[Gilgamesh]]]]

Studying pre-[[Babylonia]]n Mesopotamia, [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] used [[Sumer]]ian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called ''primitive democracy''. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free male citizens, although "the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose". In early Sumer, kings like [[Gilgamesh]] did not hold the [[autocracy|autocratic]] power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major [[city-state]]s functioned with councils of elders and "young men" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, 1943, pp. 159–172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isakhan, B. (2007). Engaging "Primitive Democracy," Mideast Roots of Collective Governance. ''Middle East Policy'', 14(3), 97–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word "democracy" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted convincingly to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.&lt;ref&gt;Bailkey, 1967, pp. 1211–1236&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the ''Mesopotamian democracy'' from a ''primitive oligarchy''.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====
[[File:Anandastupa.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Ananda Stupa, built by the ''[[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]]'' at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], which served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]], one of the world's earliest [[republic]]s ([[Gaṇa sangha]]).&lt;ref name=Thapar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&amp;pg=PA147 |title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|last=Thapar|first=Romila|authorlink=Romila Thapar|year=2002|work=Google Books|publisher=University of California|pages=146–150|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent "republics" of India, ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]]'' and ''[[gana]]s'', which existed as early as the 6th century B.C. and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, [[Diodorus]]—a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of India—mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 2.39&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars note the word ''democracy'' at the time of the 3rd century B.C. and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 1973, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Sainte, 2006, pp. 321–3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|right|250px|thumb|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were the sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics of the era, there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]]. Among the Mahajanapadas and smaller states, the [[Shakya]]s, [[Koliya]]s, [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s, and [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s followed republican government.]]
Key characteristics of the ''gana'' seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name [[raja]], and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the ''gana'', the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of ''[[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]''. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]] had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the [[Shakya]]s, [[Koliya]]s, [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s, and [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s, during the period around [[Gautama Buddha]], had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Early "republics" or [[Gaṇa sangha]],&lt;ref name=Thapar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&amp;pg=PA147 |title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|last=Thapar|first=Romila|authorlink=Romila Thapar|year=2002|work=Google Books|publisher=University of California|pages=146–150|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Malla (Ancient India)|Mallas]], centered in the city of [[Kusinagara]], and the [[Vajji]] (or Vriji) confederation, centered in the city of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Raychaudhuri Hemchandra (1972), ''Political History of Ancient India'', Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Republics in ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=93–|id=GGKEY:HYY6LT5CFT0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions. 

Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an [[oligarchy]] or an [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref name="Bongard"&gt;Bongard-Levin, 1996, pp. 61–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;Sharma 1968, pp. 109–22&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the ''sangas'', which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens—a surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann T. R., ''Kautilya and the Arthashastra'', Leiden 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the persistence of the [[Varna (Hinduism)|four-tiered Varna class system]].&lt;ref name="Bongard"/&gt; The duties and privileges on the members of each particular caste—rigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another order—might have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ''ganas'' and ''sanghas'' is not comparable to truly democratic institutions.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

Hackin [https://books.google.com/books?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;pg=PA83 p.83ff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

====Sparta====
{{details|Sparta}}
[[File:Lycurgus bas-relief in the U.S. House of Representatives chamber.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Bas-relief of Lycurgus, one of 23 great lawgivers depicted in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives]]]]

Ancient Greece, in its early period, was a loose collection of independent [[city states]] called [[poleis]]. Many of these poleis were oligarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Ostwald 2000, pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Greek [[oligarchy]], and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared,  was Sparta. Yet Sparta, in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator, was a peculiar kind of oligarchy&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge 2001, p. xii, 276&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy.&lt;ref name="BKDunn1994_p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANPlato"&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 712e-d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANAristotle1294"&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', 1294b&lt;/ref&gt; In Spartan government, the political power was divided between four bodies: two [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan Kings]] ([[diarchy]]), [[gerousia]] (''Council of Gerontes'' (Elders), including the two kings), the [[ephors]] (representatives of the citizens who oversaw the Kings) and the [[apella]] (assembly of Spartans).

The two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously, but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory, any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However, in practice, they were selected from wealthy, aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella, the most democratic element, was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors, and accepted or rejected gerousia's proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, pp. 149–153&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and, if necessary, depose them. They served for one year and could not be re-elected for a second term. Over the years, the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of the state. Additionally, they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system, which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As [[Aristotle]] noted, ephors were the most important key institution of the state, but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office, with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1996, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1981, pp. 498–502&lt;/ref&gt;

The creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]]. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the [[helots]] in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt, Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city-states of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government, the [[gerousia]] and the [[apella]].&lt;ref name="BALycurgus"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049495 Lycurgus] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of rules/laws called [[Great Rhetra]], making it the world's first written constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub 2007, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries, Sparta became a military superpower, and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1996, pp. 65–85&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as ''όμοιοι'' (''Homoioi'', ''men of equal status''). It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system, [[agoge]], where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education.&lt;ref name="ANAristotle1294"/&gt;  This was admired almost universally by contemporaries, from historians such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]] to philosophers such as [[Plato]] and Aristotle. In addition, the Spartan women, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed "every kind of luxury and intemperance" including rights such as the right to inheritance, property ownership, and public education.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the Spartans were remarkably free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However, despite these ''democratic'' elements in the Spartan constitution, there are two cardinal criticisms, classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First, individual freedom was restricted, since as [[Plutarch]] writes ''"no man was allowed to live as he wished"'', but as in a ''"military camp"'' all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second, the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub 2007, pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;

The political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger, especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the [[Persian Wars]]. In addition, Athens, after the [[Persian Wars]], was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the [[Peloponnesian War]], with Sparta prevailing in the end. However, the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later, when [[Philip II of Macedon]] crushed what remained of the power of the factional city-states to his South.

===Athens===
{{details|Athenian democracy}}
[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|300px|thumb|The [[Acropolis of Athens]] by [[Leo von Klenze]].]]
Athens is often regarded{{Cref2|i}} as the birthplace of democracy and remains an important reference-point for democracy.

Athens emerged in the 7th century BCE, like many other [[poleis]], with a dominating powerful aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, pp. 159–164&lt;/ref&gt; However, this domination led to exploitation, creating significant economic, political, and social problems. These problems exacerbated early in the 6th century; and, as ''"the many were enslaved to few, the people rose against the notables"''.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. The constitutional reforms implemented by Lycurgus in Sparta introduced a [[hoplite]] state that showed, in turn, how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of unrest between the rich and poor, Athenians of all classes turned to [[Solon]] to act as a mediator between rival factions, and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BASolon/&gt;

====Solon and the foundations of democracy====
{{details|Solon}}
[[File:Solon.jpg|left|thumb|Bust of [[Solon]] from the National Museum, Naples]]

Solon({{circa}} 638 – {{circa}} 558 BC), an Athenian (Greek) of noble descent but moderate means, was a [[Lyric poetry| lyric]] poet and later a lawmaker; Plutarch ranked him as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] of the ancient world.&lt;ref name=BASolon&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068622 Solon], Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2003, pp. 54–5, 76–98&lt;/ref&gt; Solon divided the Athenians into four property-classes, with different rights and duties for each. As the [[Great Rhetra|Rhetra]] did in Lycurgian Sparta, Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. All citizens gained the right to attend the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] (Assembly) and to vote. The Ecclesia became, in principle, the sovereign body, entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the [[court]]s.&lt;ref name=BASolon/&gt; All but those in the poorest group might serve, a year at a time, on a new [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule of 400]], which was to prepare the agenda for the Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts, those of the [[archons]] (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups. The retired archons became members of the [[Areopagus]] (Council of the Hill of Ares), which like the Gerousia in Sparta, was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed [[timocracy|timocratic]] and democratic system of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, pp. 60–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Solon devised the reforms of 594 BC to avert the political, economic, and [[moral decline]] in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians, established rules for legal redress against over-reaching aristocratic archons, and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than of noble birth. Some of Solon's reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often{{quantify|date=November 2017}} credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2003, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democracy under Cleisthenes and Pericles====
{{See also|Cleisthenes|Ephialtes|Pericles}}

[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|thumb|250px|The [[Pnyx]] with the speaker's platform, the meeting place of the people of Athens]]
Even though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes, it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship, the chief executive post. [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]] became [[tyrant]] of Athens three times from 561 BCE and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]] and [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref name="BAPeisitratus"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058970 Peisistratus] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of tyranny (510 BCE) and before the year 508–507 was over, [[Cleisthenes]] proposed a complete reform of the system of government, which later was approved by the popular [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].&lt;ref name="BACleisthenes"/&gt; Cleisthenes reorganized the population of citizens into ten tribes, with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones,&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1996, pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt; and improve the army's organization.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all male citizens, [[isonomia]],&lt;ref name="BACleisthenes"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024296 Cleisthenes Of Athens] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; by expanding access to power to more citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007 pp. 144–9&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Athenians first used the word "democracy" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: δημοκρατία – "rule by the people") to define their new system of government.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, 2001, pp. 194–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the next generation, Athens entered its [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]], becoming a great center of [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]] and [[Ancient Greek art|art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, 2008, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Greek victories in [[Persian Wars]] (499–449 BCE) encouraged the poorest Athenians (who participated in the military campaigns) to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s, [[Ephialtes of Athens|Ephialtes]] and [[Pericles]] presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society, by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed [[thetes]] (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub, 2008, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Pericles became distinguished as the Athenians' greatest democratic leader, even though he has been accused of running a [[political machine]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} In the following passage, [[Thucydides]] recorded Pericles, in the funeral oration, describing the Athenian system of rule:

{{cquote|Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a ''democracy''. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides ''History of the Peloponnesian War'', [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2|2.37.2–3]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Pericles with the Corinthian helmet|bust of Pericles]] bearing the inscription "[[Pericles]], son of [[Xanthippus]], Athenian". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original from ca. 430 BCE.]]
The Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom of citizens(through the reforms of Solon) and on equality of citizens(isonomia) - introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles, the Athenians used [[sortition|lot]] for selecting officials. Casting lots aimed to ensure that all citizens were ''"equally"'' qualified for office, and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Hansen, J. A. Crook, ''The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8061-3143-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AgNdHQAACAAJ Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in most positions chosen by lot, Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once; this rotation in office meant that no-one could build up a power base through staying in a particular position.&lt;ref&gt;L. Carson, B. Martin, ''Random Selection in Politics'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|0-275-96702-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIieJo1Yo1EC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts formed another important political institution in Athens; they were composed of a large number of [[jury|juries]] with no [[judge]]s, and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool, also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders.&lt;ref name="BA0"/&gt; Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory,&lt;ref&gt;The exception was the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule of 500]], where the poor could refuse to serve.&lt;/ref&gt; and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being "drafted" to office.  The only officials chosen by elections, one from each tribe, were the ''strategoi'' (generals), where military knowledge was required, and the ''treasurers'', who had to be wealthy, since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurer's private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by [[majority]] vote in the Ecclesia (compare [[direct democracy]]), in which all male citizens could participate (in some cases with a quorum of 6000). The decisions taken in the Ecclesia were executed by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule of 500]], which had already approved the agenda for the Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year&lt;ref name="BABoule"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/75519/boule Boule (Ancient Greek Council)] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; and no citizen could serve more than twice.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, 2001, pp. 300–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the Athenian democracy was not only ''direct'' in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also ''directest'' in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule, and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.&lt;ref&gt;Raafaub, 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; And even though the rights of the individual (probably) were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense,{{Cref2|ii}} the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government, but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;
&lt;!-- We might need to add a small paragraph to describe the Athenian democracy under Demosthenes --&gt;

====The birth of political philosophy====
{{See also|Socrates|Plato|Aristotle}}

Within the Athenian democratic environment, many philosophers from all over the [[Greek colonies|Greek world]] gathered to develop their theories. [[Socrates]] (470-399 BCE) was the first to raise the question, further expanded by his pupil [[Plato]] (died 348/347), about the relation/position of an individual within a community. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) continued the work of his teacher, Plato, and laid the foundations of [[political philosophy]]. The political philosophy developed in Athens was, in the words of Peter Hall, ''"in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Hall| first= Peter| title= Cities in Civilisation| publisher= Orion| place= London| year= 1999| isbn= 9780753808153| page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek city-states had and divided them into three categories based on how many ruled: the many (democracy/polity), the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), a single person (tyranny, or today: autocracy/monarchy). For Aristotle, the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)| ''Politics'']]:

{{cquote|Now a fundamental principle of the democratic form of constitution is liberty—that is what is usually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate in liberty, for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich, because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign. This then is one mark of liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim not to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be governed in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes to equalitarian liberty.&lt;ref name="AristotlePol1317b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0058:book=6:section=1317b|title=Aristotle, Politics, Book 6, section 1317b|author=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Decline, revival, and criticisms====
The Athenian democracy, in its two centuries of life-time, twice voted against its democratic constitution (both times during the crisis at the end of the [[Pelopponesian War]] of 431 to 404 BC), establishing first the [[The Four Hundred (oligarchy)|Four Hundred]] (in 411 BCE) and second Sparta's puppet régime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (in 404 BCE). Both votes took place [[Demagogy|under manipulation and pressure]], but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] removed most law-making authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected law-making juries known as "nomothetai". Athens restored its democratic constitution again after King [[Phillip II of Macedon]] (reigned 359-336 BCE) and later [[Alexander the Great]] (reigned 336–323 BCE) unified Greece, but it was politically over-shadowed by the [[Hellenistic era|Hellenistic empires]]. Finally, after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens was restricted to matters of local administration.

However, democracy in Athens declined not only due to external powers, but due to its citizens, such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Because of their influential works, after the rediscovery of [[classics]] during the [[Renaissance]], Sparta's political stability was praised,&lt;ref name="PlatoRepublic"&gt;Plato, ''Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartledge"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
while the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule where either the less well-born, the mob (as a collective tyrant), or the poorer classes held power.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; Only centuries afterwards, after the publication of ''A History of Greece'' by [[George Grote]] from 1846 onwards, did modern political thinkers start to view the Athenian democracy of Pericles positively.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, (1992), pp. 14–30&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century scholars re-examined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and as a "post-modern" example for communities and organizations alike.&lt;ref&gt;Ober, 1996, pp. 15–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
{{See also|Roman Republic}}

Even though Rome is classified as a Republic and not a democracy, its history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 2005, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 2002, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and today's modern (representative) democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 2005, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Roman Republic====

{{see also|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic|Elections in the Roman Republic}}
[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Representation of a sitting of the Roman Senate: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catilina]], from a 19th-century fresco.]]

Rome was a city-state in [[Italy]] next to powerful neighbors; [[Etruscans]] had built city-states throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other city-states, Rome was ruled by a king. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]].&lt;ref name="Livy, 2002, p. 23"&gt;Livy, 2002, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant, 1942, p. 23"&gt;Durant, 1942, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families ([[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]) and the rest of the population, the [[plebeians]] continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands, the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers.&lt;ref name="Livy, 2002, p. 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant, 1942, p. 23"/&gt; When they returned, the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men – a ''decemviri'' – to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the supervision of a resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, transformed the old customary law of Rome into [[Twelve Tables]] and submitted them to the Assembly (which passed them with some changes) and they were displayed in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE, the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state.

The political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution&lt;ref&gt;This view was already ancient when Polybius brought it to bear on Rome (Walbank 2002: 281).&lt;/ref&gt; and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution: two consuls, embodying the monarchic form; the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], embodying the aristocratic form; and the people through the [[Roman assemblies|assemblies]].&lt;ref&gt;Balot, 2009, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate.&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"&gt;Balot, 2009, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consultum'' and were official advices to a magistrate. However, in practice, it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senate's advice.&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"/&gt; The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also, it managed Rome's civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100,000 [[denarius|denarii]] worth of land, being born of the patrician (noble aristocrats) class, and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members.&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"/&gt; The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had, in practice, the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"/&gt; and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as [[Livy]] writes ''"levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men"''.&lt;ref name="Liv1.43.11"&gt;Liv 1.43.11&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes.&lt;ref name=Liv1.43.11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dion. Ant. Rom. 4.20.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman stability, in [[Polybius]]’ assessment, was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other: a consul at war, for example, required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory, and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even: Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] constitution (another mixed constitution) at the time of the [[Punic Wars|Hannibalic War]] was an effect of the latter's greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Polyb. 6.51&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense – ''eleutheria'': living as you like – have fallen on stony ground, since ''eleutheria'' (which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens&lt;ref&gt;Balot, 2009, pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;) was anathema in the Roman eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Balot, 2009, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Rome's core values included order, hierarchy, discipline, and obedience. These values were enforced with laws regulating the private life of an individual. The laws were applied in particular to the upper classes, since the upper classes were the source of Roman moral examples.

Rome became the ruler of a great [[Mediterranean]] empire. The new provinces brought wealth to Italy, and fortunes were made through mineral concessions and enormous slave run estates. Slaves were imported to Italy and wealthy landowners soon began to buy up and displace the original peasant farmers. By the late 2nd century this led to renewed conflict between the rich and poor and demands from the latter for reform of the constitution. The background of social unease and the inability of the traditional republican constitutions to adapt to the needs of the growing empire led to the rise of a series of over-mighty generals, championing the cause of either the rich or the poor, in the last century BCE.

====Transition to empire====

{{See also|History of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:0005MAN-OctAugusto.jpg|thumb|A fragment of a bronze [[equestrian order]] statue of [[Augustus]], [[Roman Emperor]], 1st century AD.]]

Over the next few hundred years, various generals would bypass or overthrow the Senate for various reasons, mostly to address perceived injustices, either against themselves or against poorer citizens or soldiers. One of those generals was [[Julius Caesar]], where he marched on Rome and took supreme power over the republic. Caesar's career was cut short by his assassination at Rome in 44 BCE by a group of Senators including [[Marcus Junius Brutus]]. In the power vacuum that followed Caesar's assassination, his friend and chief lieutenant, [[Marcus Antonius]], and Caesar's grandnephew [[Octavian]] who also was the adopted son of Caesar, rose to prominence. Their combined strength gave the triumvirs absolute power. However, in 31 BC war between the two broke out. The final confrontation occurred on 2 September 31 BCE, at the naval [[Battle of Actium]] where the fleet of Octavian under the command of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] routed Antony's fleet. Thereafter, there was no one left in the Roman Republic who wanted to, or could stand against Octavian, and the adopted son of Caesar moved to take absolute control. Octavian left the majority of Republican institutions intact, though he influenced everything using personal authority and ultimately controlled the final decisions, having the military might to back up his rule if necessary. By 27 BCE the transition, though subtle, disguised, and relying on personal power over the power of offices, was complete. In that year, Octavian offered back all his powers to the Senate, and in a carefully staged way, the Senate refused and titled Octavian ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' — "the revered one". He was always careful to avoid the title of ''rex'' — "king", and instead took on the titles of ''princeps'' — "first citizen" and ''[[imperator]]'', a title given by Roman troops to their victorious commanders.

====The Roman Empire and late antiquities====

The [[Roman Empire]] had been born. Once Octavian named [[Tiberius]] as his heir, it was clear to everyone that even the hope of a restored Republic was dead. Most likely, by the time Augustus died, no one was old enough to know a time before an Emperor ruled Rome. The Roman Republic had been changed into a [[Despotism|despotic]] régime, which, underneath a competent and strong Emperor, could achieve military supremacy, economic prosperity, and a genuine peace, but under a weak or incompetent one saw its glory tarnished by cruelty, military defeats, revolts, and civil war.

The Roman Empire was eventually divided between the [[Western Roman Empire]] which fell in 476 AD and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (also called the Byzantine Empire) which lasted until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 AD.

* The [[Germanic tribe|Germanic tribal]] [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] assemblies described by [[Tacitus]] in his [[Germania]].
* The [[Christian Church]] well into the 6th century AD had its bishops elected by popular acclaim.
* The [[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]] of the Roman period: associations of various social, economic, religious, funerary and even sportive natures elected officers yearly, often directly modeled on the [[Senate of Rome]].

== Institutions in the medieval era ==
{{further|Medieval commune}}
[[File:Olav den helliges saga CK5.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker]] is teaching the Swedish king [[Olof Skötkonung]] that the power resides with the people, 1018, [[Uppsala]], by C. Krogh.]]

Most of the procedures used by modern democracies are very old. Almost all cultures have at some time had their new leaders approved, or at least accepted, by the people; and have changed the laws only after consultation with the assembly of the people or their leaders. Such institutions existed since before the times of the ''[[Iliad]]'' or of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and modern democracies are often derived from or inspired by them, or what remained of them.

Nevertheless, the direct result of these institutions was not always a democracy. It was often a narrow [[oligarchy]], as in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], or even an absolute monarchy, as in [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Florence]], in the Renaissance period; but during the medieval period [[Guild|guild democracies]] did evolve.

Early institutions included:

* The continuations of the early Germanic [[thing (assembly)|thing]]:
** The [[Witenagemot]] (folkmoot) of [[Anglo-Saxon England|Early Medieval England]], councils of advisors to the kings of the [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms|petty kingdoms]] and then that of a unified England before the [[Norman Conquest]].
** The [[Franks|Frankish]] custom of the [[Märzfeld]] or ''Camp of Mars''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]], chapters XLIX, LII; pp. 1685,1857 Heritage Club edition (1946). For a recent view, see [[David Nicolle]]; ''Carolingian cavalryman, AD 768–987,'' p. 45 ff. Intermediate sources tend to be colored by the "Free institutions of our Germanic ancestors" [[meme]].&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in Portuguese, Leonese, Castillian, Aragonese, Catalan and Valencian customs, [[Cortes Generales|cortes]] were periodically convened to debate the state of the Realms.
** [[Tynwald]], on the [[Isle of Man]], claims to be one of the oldest continuous [[parliament]]s in the world, with roots back to the late 9th or 10th century.
** The [[Althing]], the parliament of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], founded in 930. It consisted of the 39, later 55, ''goðar''; each owner of a ''goðarð''; and each hereditary ''goði'' kept a tight hold on his membership, which could in principle be lent or sold. Thus, for example, when [[Njál's saga|Burnt Njal]]'s stepson wanted to enter it, Njal had to persuade the Althing to enlarge itself so a seat would become available. But as each independent farmer in the country could choose what goði represented him, the system could be claimed as an early form of democracy. The Alþing has run nearly continuously to the present day. The Althing was preceded by less elaborate "[[Thing (assembly)|things]]" (assemblies) all over Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnt [[Njal's Saga]]'', tr. Magnus Magnusson, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ''[[Thing of all Swedes]]'', which took place annually at [[Uppsala]] at the end of February or in early March. As in Iceland, the [[lawspeaker]] presided over the assemblies, but the Swedish king functioned as a judge. A famous incident took place circa 1018, when King [[Olof Skötkonung]] wanted to pursue the war against Norway against the will of the people. [[Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker]] reminded the king in a long speech that the power resided with the Swedish people and not with the king. When the king heard the din of swords beating the shields in support of Þorgnýr's speech, he gave in. [[Adam of Bremen]] wrote that the people used to obey the king only when they thought his suggestions seemed better, although in war his power was absolute.
** The Swiss [[Landsgemeinde]].
* The [[election of Uthman]] in the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (7th century).
* The election of [[Gopala]] in the [[Pala Empire]] (8th century).
* The ''[[túath]]a'' system in [[History of Ireland#Early medieval era (circa 800 to 1100)|early medieval Ireland]]. Landowners and the masters of a profession or craft were members of a local assembly, known as a ''túath''. Each ''túath'' met in annual assembly which approved all common policies, declared war or peace on other ''tuatha'', and accepted the election of a new "king"; normally during the old king's lifetime, as a [[tanist]]. The new king had to be descended within four generations from a previous king, so this usually became, in practice, a hereditary kingship; although some kingships alternated between lines of cousins. About 80 to 100 ''túatha'' coexisted at any time throughout Ireland. Each ''túath'' controlled a more or less compact area of land which it could pretty much defend from cattle-raids, and this was divided among its members.

==Indigenous peoples of the Americas==
{{see also|Great Law of Peace#Influence on the United States Constitution}}
Historian [[Jack Weatherford]] has argued that the ideas leading to the [[United States Constitution]] and democracy derived from various [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] including the [[Iroquois]].  Weatherford claimed this democracy was founded between the years 1000–1450, and lasted several hundred years, and that the U.S. democratic system was continually changed and improved by the influence of Native Americans throughout North America.&lt;ref name="isbn0-449-90496-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weatherford, J. McIver |author-link=J. McIver Weatherford |title=Indian givers: how the Indians of the Americas transformed the world |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-449-90496-2 |oclc= |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Temple University]] professor of anthropology and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois Elizabeth Tooker has reviewed these claims and concluded they are myth rather than fact.  The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature.  The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and a speech by the Iroquois chief [[Canasatego]] in 1744.  Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.&lt;ref name="Tooker E 1990 https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: cultural fictions and government policies |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128] | chapter = The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1 |oclc= | author=Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary.  The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan.  Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe.  Tooker concludes that "...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois" and that the myth is largely based on a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer [[John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt|J.N.B. Hewitt]] which was exaggerated and misinterpreted after his death in 1937.&lt;ref name="Tooker E 1990 https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128"/&gt;

The [[Aztecs]] also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.&lt;ref name="isbn0-449-90496-2"/&gt;

===The secret ballot===
{{Main|Secret ballot}}
[[File:Cardiganshire Election ballot paper 1880.jpg|thumb|A British secret ballot paper, 1880]]
The notion of a secret ballot, where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes, is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.

The stone inscriptions in a temple say that ballot elections were held in South India by a method called Kudavolai system. Kudavolai means the ballot sheet of leaf that was put secretly in a pot vessel called "kudam". The details are found inscribed on the walls of the village assembly hall. Actually, the once village-assembly hall is the present temple. The details show that the village had a secret ballot electoral system and a written Constitution, prescribing the mode of elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Waves of democracy in the 20th century===
[[File:Waves of democracy.png|450px|thumb|right|The three 20th century waves of democracy, based on the number of nations 1800–2003 scoring 8 or higher on [[Polity IV]] scale, another widely used measure of democracy.]]
{{See also|Wave of democracy}}

The end of the [[First World War]] was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, [[universal suffrage]] for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in [[Finland]] as well as a [[proportional representation]], [[open list]] system. Likewise, the [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under [[Alexander Kerensky]] until [[Lenin]] took over in October. The terrible economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.

In 1918 the United Kingdom granted the right to vote to women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote, a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On August 18, 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944, but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29, 1945. 

The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called "Indians" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if "subject to the jurisdiction thereof"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924.  The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States.

===Post-World War II===
[[World War II]] was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe, where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However, many countries of [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet [[satellite state]]s. In Southern Europe, a number of right-wing [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] dictatorships (most notably in Spain and [[Portugal]]) continued to exist.
* MaxRange data has defined and categorised the level of democracy and political regime type to all states and months from 1789 to this day and updating. MaxRange shows a dramatic expansion of democracy, especially from 1989. The third wave of democracy has been successful and covered major parts of previous autocratic areas. MaxRange can show detailed correlations between success of democracy and many relevant variables, such as previous democratic history, the transitional phase and selection of institutional political system. Even though the number of democratic states has continued to grow since 2006, the share of weaker electoral democracies has grown significantly. This is the strongest causal factor behind fragile democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html|title=MaxRange|author=|date=|website=www.hh.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had moved towards democracy during the [[Taishō period]] during the 1920s, but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar [[Occupied Japan|Allied occupation]], with initial elections in 1946.

===Decolonisation and civil rights movements===
World War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan, as it weakened, with the exception of the USSR and the United States, all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive colonies/possessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war.

The aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations' decision to partition the British Mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel 1997, p. 257. "A current list of liberal democracies includes: Andorra, Argentina, ..., Cyprus, ..., Israel, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Global Survey 2006: Middle East Progress Amid Global Gains in Freedom". Freedom House (2005-12-19). Retrieved on 2007-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]] became a Democratic Republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952, [[India]] achieved the status of the world's largest liberal democracy with [[universal suffrage]] which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic; those that were formerly part of the [[British Empire]] often adopted the [[Westminster parliamentary system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[decolonisation]] created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia, with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government.

In the United States of America, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] enforced the 15th Amendment. The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] ended [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxing]] by removing all tax placed upon voting, which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] also granted voting rights to all Native Americans, irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]] in 1971.

===Late Cold War and after===
New waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s, as a number of right-wing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later, in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the [[communist state]]s in the [[USSR]] sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies.

Much of Eastern Europe, Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, and several Arab, central Asian and African states, and the not-yet-state that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s.

[[File:Electoral democracies.png|thumb|350px|Countries highlighted in &lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; are designated "[[representative democracy|electoral democracies]]" in Freedom House's 2017 survey "Freedom in the World", covering the year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf|title=Freedom in The World report, 2017 |author=|date=|website=freedomhouse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

An analysis by the U.S. Government funded [[Freedom House]] shows that there was not a single liberal democracy with [[universal suffrage]] in the world in 1900, but that in 2000, 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% were such democracies. They count 25 nations, or 13% of the world's nations with "restricted democratic practices" in 1900 and 16, or 8% of the world's nations today. They counted 19 constitutional monarchies in 1900, forming 14% of the world's nations, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none in the present. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House. 1999. [http://www.freedomhouse.org/reports/century.html "Democracy’s Century: A Survey of Global Political Change in the 20th Century."]&lt;/ref&gt; While the specifics may be open to debate (for example, [[New Zealand]] actually enacted [[universal suffrage]] in 1893, but is discounted due to a lack of complete sovereignty and certain restrictions on the [[Māori people|Māori]] vote), the numbers are indicative of the expansion of democracy during the twentieth century.

===Democracy in the 21st century===
In the 21st century, democracy movements have been seen across the world.
In the [[Arab world]], an unprecedented series of [[Arab Spring|major protests]] occurred with citizens of [[Egypt]], Tunisia, [[Bahrain]], Yemen, [[Jordan]], Syria and other countries across the [[MENA region]] demanding democratic rights. This [[revolutionary wave]] was given the term [[Tunisia Effect]], as well as the Arab Spring. The [[Palestinian Authority]] also took action to address democratic rights.

In Africa, continent of 55 countries, a process of democratization began in 1990 at the end of the Cold War in the transition from single parties to multiparty. However, undemocratic regimes began to organize elections: as a result, the diversions of electoral processes upstream essentially, the day of the vote sometimes, or the compilation of the minutes, in some cases of inversion of final result, have become very common. Out of 55 countries, the process of continental democratization seems almost stalled since 2005 because of the resistance of some 20 non-democratic regimes, most of which originated in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regardexcentrique.wordpress.com/2017/04/27/2016-annee-des-coups-detat-electoraux-en-afrique-et-democratisation-de-lafrique-depuis-1990|title=2016, année des coups d’Etat électoraux en Afrique et démocratisation de l’Afrique depuis 1990- 27 avril 2017|author=Régis Marzin|date=|website=regardexcentrique.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], following a highly disputed presidential vote fraught with corruption, Iranian citizens held a major series of protests calling for change and democratic rights (see: the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]] and the [[2011 Iranian protests]]). The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion of Iraq]] led to a toppling of [[Saddam Hussein]] and a new constitution with free and open elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deeks|first1=Ashley|last2=Burton|first2=Matthew|title=Iraq's Constitution: A Drafting History|journal=Cornell International Law Journal|date=2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1-88|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/cintl40&amp;i=7|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}{{POV statement|date=June 2014}}

In Asia, the country of [[Burma]] (also known as Myanmar) had long been ruled by a [[military junta]]; however, in 2011, the government changed to allow certain voting rights and released democracy-leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from house arrest. However, Burma still will not allow Suu Kyi to run for election and still has major human rights problems and not full democratic rights. However, this was later partially abrogated with the election of Suu Kyi's national league for democracy party and her appointment as the de facto leader of Burma (Myanmar) with the title "state councellor", as she is still not allowed to be president and therefore leads through a figurehead, Htin Kyaw. Human rights, however, have not improved. In [[Bhutan]], in December 2005, the 4th King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] announced that the first general elections would be held in 2008, and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son. Bhutan is currently undergoing further changes to allow for a [[constitutional monarchy]]. In the [[Maldives]], protests and political pressure led to a government reform which allowed democratic rights and [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|presidential elections]] in 2008. These were however undone by a coup in 2018.

Not all movement has been pro-democratic however. In Poland and Hungary, so-called 'illiberal democracies' have taken hold, with the ruling parties in both countries considered by the EU and civil society to be working to undermine democratic governance. Also in Europe, the Spanish government refused to allow a democratic vote on the future of Catalunya, a decision causing months of instability in the region. Meanwhile, in Thailand a military junta twice overthrew democratically elected governments and has changed the constitution in order to increase its own power. The authoritarian regime of Han Sen in Cambodia also dissolved the main opposition party and effectively implemented a one-man dictatorship. There are also large parts of the world such as China, Russia, Central and South East Asia, the Middle East and much of Africa which have consolidated authoritarian rule rather seeing it weaken.

==Contemporary trends==
{{further|E-democracy}}

Under the influence of the theory of [[deliberative democracy]], there have been several experiments since the start of the new millennium with what are called [[deliberative fora]], places (in [[real life]] or in [[cyber space]]) where citizens and their representatives assemble to exchange [[reason]]s.  One type of deliberative forum is called a [[minpublic]]: a body of randomly chosen or actively selected citizens that represents the whole population.  The use of random selection to form a representative deliberative body is known as [[sortition]].  Examples of this are [[citizens' assemblies]] and [[citizens' juries]].  Citizens' assemblies have been used in Canada (2004, 2006) and the Netherlands (2006) to debate electoral reform, and in Iceland (2009 and 2010) for broader constitutional change.

{{Cnote2|i| Literature about the Athenian democracy spans over centuries with the earliest works being [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]] of Plato and [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] of Aristotle, continuing with [[Discourses on Livy|Discourses]] of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. The latest, listed in the References section, include works from scholars such as [[John Dunn (political scientist)|J. Dunn]], [[Josiah Ober|J. Ober]], T. Buckley, J. Thorley and E. W. Robinson, who examine the origins and the reasons of Athens being the first&lt;ref name="BKDunn1994_p2"&gt;Dunn, 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartledge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, pp. 24–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BKThorley_p2"&gt;Thorley, 1996, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 2006, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; to developed a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy. Despite its flaws (slavery, no women's rights) it is often considered the closest to the ideal democracy and called as ''classical'' democracy. It is often compared with modern (representative) democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, 1994, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, 1994, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|ii| The ancient Greeks did not have a word to use for "rights".&lt;ref&gt;Ober, 1996, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|iii| The United States of America was and is, a republic, not a direct democracy. A direct democracy can be defined as a form of government in which the people decide matters directly, with prime example the Athenian democracy. A democratic republic, is a form of government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. The delegates who wrote the Constitution were fearful of direct democracy; in the words of James Madison: ''"[D]emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm|title=The Federalist #10|author=|date=|website=constitution.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the framers recognized that the public is required to impose a check to the government, in Madison words: ''"dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm|title=The Federalist #51|author=|date=|website=constitution.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By popular usage, however, the word "democracy" came to mean a form of government in which the government derives its power from the people and is accountable to them for the use of that power. In this sense the United States can be called a democratic republic. Many states allow for policy questions to be decided directly by the people by voting on ballot initiatives or referendums. (Initiatives originate with, or are initiated by, the people while referendums originate with, or are referred to the people by a state's legislative body.)}}

'''Huapalcalco''' is a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican archeological site located some 5 kilometers north of [[Tulancingo]] in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Zona arqueológica de Huapalcalco  |trans-title= Huapalcalco Archaeological Site|journal=INAH |location= Mexico |url= http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01102.html# |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was built on the west slope of the "Tecolote" hill; the slope is separated east-west by a ravine that forms two sectors at the foot of the hill and two more on the top, all of which contain archaeological vestiges.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site depicts Teotihuacán influence, and some believe that [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin|Topilitzin Quetzalcóatl]]&lt;ref name=Visiting&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Huapalcalco, Mexico|trans-title=Huapalcalco, Mexico|journal=Visiting Mexico|location=|url=http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/hidalgo/destinos-hidalgo-turismo-arqueologico-huapalcalco.php|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907172715/http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/hidalgo/destinos-hidalgo-turismo-arqueologico-huapalcalco.php|archivedate=2010-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; resided here, before governing [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]]. Also it is considered the oldest human occupation site in the Hidalgo State.&lt;ref name=Tula3   /&gt;

It is believed that it must have been a very important civil, religious and housing center. It is known that it was the second [[Toltec Empire]], before Tula.&lt;ref name=Tula3   /&gt;

The city was of olmeca-xicalanca origin, or the first settler tribes of the great central plateau of the mountain range. The meaning of such wooden building is not known, it was probably built when the ancient native people settled; perhaps it was a building destined as a Telpochcalli, for military training, justice administration, or learning dances or music.&lt;ref name="Tula1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=|trans-title=|url=http://www.tulancingo.com.mx/informacion/historia/leyenda/coapalcallico.htm|journal=Tulancingo Cultural.com.mx|language=Spanish|location=|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men passed through the Bering Straits 40 thousand years, 30 thousand years ago, men reached the Mexican plains and about 13 thousand years ago, men reached Huapalcalco in the Hidalgo, State, where vestiges have been located that date back to that period.&lt;ref name=Tula3   /&gt;

However, Huapalcalco is a mesoamerican classical period (100 to 650 CE), formed part of the State Teotihuacan, however, both its architecture and pottery is not equal to Teotihuacan, i.e. there is Teotihuacan influence, but are not Teotihuacan. It is not known what culture built these monuments; it can only be said that it is closely related to the Teotihuacan culture and had influence of the cultures of the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Background==
 {{Main|Mesoamerican_chronology}}
During the [[Lithic stage|Lithic]] period (10,000 - 3500 BCE) the first signs of human hunter-gatherers are noted in the valley. It's not until the gradual transition into the [[Archaic period in the Americas|archaic period]] (8000 – 2000 BCE) that we start to see the first human settlements developing in Mesoamerica along with the development of agriculture. The Pre-classical, or [[Formative stage|Formative Stage]], sees the emergence of the first civilization, the [[Olmecs]] lasting between (2000 BCE - 250 CE). During the Classical period (250-900 CE) Tulancingo becomes an important trade center, with roads and residential areas. It is during this period that Huapalcalco was built, of which today remain only a three-sided pyramid and stairway, built in the [[Toltec]] style. [[file:Pinturas rupestres en Huapalcalco.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Cave Paintings.|alt=|left]]

=== Cave Paintings ===
The earliest cave paintings in the area are located at the Huiztle hill and Huapalcalco plateau; these cave paintings transmit testimony of primitive groups’ life experiences in representations of men, schematic outlines, and astronomical figures dating back to 9,000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Tula4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulancingocultural.cc/historico/huapalcalco/pintrupestres/index.htm|title=Las pinturas rupestres de Huapalcalco|last=|first=|year=|publisher=Tulancingo Cultural|location=|language=Spanish|trans-title=The cave paintings of Huapalcalco|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lizard and men are portrayed. A man is depicted in the act of throwing a prehistoric version of the [[Spear-thrower|atlátl]] spear, a javelin-like weapon used with an arm extension, with a type of large spoon dart in the end, it was used mainly to hunt ducks that must have existed by the thousands in the lagoon located west of the site.&lt;ref name="Tula4" /&gt;

These were hunter-gatherer men that did not have animals in captivity but knew how to hunt and use fire to cook.&lt;ref name="Tula4" /&gt;

===Huapalcalco Legend===
The Huapalcalco (or Coapalcallico) City was punished by the Gods, the punishment was imposed because their people were not able to defend it against invaders and were conquered by other civilizations, they constructed buildings over their structures.&lt;ref name="Tula5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulancingo.com.mx/informacion/historia/leyenda/huapalcalco.htm|title=Leyenda de Huapalcalco|last=|first=|year=|publisher=Tulancingo.com.mx|location=|language=Spanish|trans-title=Huapalcalco Legend|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gods were angry by such a situation, hence they completely buried the city, a city that was very expansive, covering an area about 10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which would include the area of what today is from Huapalcalco up to Abra, Santiago and Acatlán.&lt;ref name="Tula5" /&gt;

There was only one solution to remove the curse, the Gods said to the [[Shamanism|Shamans]], the curse could only be removed on June 24 at midnight, at such exact time a bridge would appear between both Coapalcallico hills, over the Main Pyramid.&lt;ref name="Tula5" /&gt;

And only at that instant, a man, woman, boy or girl with the purest and bravest soul could cross it and pull on a gold chain that would appear in the other side of the bridge and after pulling on the chain, the city, buried by the curse of the Gods would reappear.&lt;ref name="Tula5" /&gt;

== Tulancingo City-State ==

 {{Main|Tulancingo}}
'''Tulancingo''', was a forerunner of the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization. The name derives from the [[Nahuatl]] words "tule" and "tzintle" which mean "in or behind the reeds." This is confirmed by its [[Aztec]] [[glyph]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/municipios/13077a.htm |title=Estado de Hidalgo Tulancingo de Bravo |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Hidalgo Tulancingo de Bravo |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617104725/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/municipios/13077a.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is home to some of the oldest settlements in Mesoamerica, such as Huapalcalco and El Pedregal. These first settlements have been attributed to the [[Olmecs]], Xicalancas and other tribes. The city was founded in 645 BCE by the [[Toltecs]] with the name Tolancingo as part of the empire centered in [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]]. During this period, the city was home to schools and temples. A calendar stone was sculpted here and a temple called Mitlancalco was built to receive the bodies of priests and princes. After 1116 CE, the Toltec empire declined and the city was abandoned.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

According to the Tribute Codex (Códice de los Tributos), the Tulancingo area was a commercial center for the [[Otomi people|Otomi]]-Tepehua and [[Totonac]] people since about 1000 CE bringing traders from lands now in the states of Hidalgo, Puebla and Veracruz. Traditional trading still exists in the form of the Thursday "[[Tianguis]]" or market.&lt;ref name="tianguis"&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.tulancingo.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=95%3Atianguis-tradicional&amp;catid=10%3Aarticuloturismo&amp;Itemid=57|title= Tianguis Tradicional |date=September 9, 2009 |publisher=Government of Tulancingo |location=Tulancingo |language=Spanish |trans-title= Traditional Outdoor Market |accessdate=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chichimeca]]s came to rule here under [[King Xolotl|King Xolotl (Chichimec ruler)]] starting around 1120. The city was refounded by these people and the remaining Toltecs.  The population increased with the arrival of the [[Tlaxcaltecas]]. In 1324, a king named Quinantzin, reorganized the area politically, making Tulancingo the head of a province. Tulancingo marched against [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], but was defeated. In the early 15th century, this same Texcoco, under Huitzilihuit, conquered Tulancingo, putting it within the [[Aztec Empire]]. In 1431, the Tulancingo area was again reorganized politically under [[Itzcoatl]] and [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

Eventually, Tulancingo became part of the Texcoco empire and in 1416, was taken by the [[Aztec]] might empire. Since then, Tulancingo was divided into two sectors: Tlaixpa, located to the east, inhabited mostly by native Otomi; and Tlatoca in the west, inhabited by Nahua. The inhabitants of both sides paid tribute to the Aztec kingdom; tributes consisted of cotton blankets and seeds, such as corn and amaranth.

Although Tulancingo was a tributary of the Mexicas, they maintained certain administrative independence, they choose their own authorities. This city was an important food stocking place for the Aztecs.

===Olmec-Xicalanca===
The mid-classical period ended in Northern Mesoamerica with the decline of Teotihuacan ca 700 CE. This allowed regional centers of power to flourish and compete for control of trade routes and the exploitation of natural resources. In this way the late Classic era commenced. As stated above, this was a time of political fragmentation during which no city had complete hegemony. Various population movements occurred during this period, caused by the incursion of groups from [[Aridoamerica]] and other northern regions, who pushed the older populations of Mesoamerica toward the south. Among these new groups were the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], who would found the cities of Tula and [[Tenochtitlan]], the two most important capitals of the Postclassical era. In addition to the migrations from the north, southern peoples finally established themselves in the center of Mexico. Among these were the [[:es:Olmeca-xicalanca|Olmec-Xicalanca]]&lt;!-- needs English page --&gt;, who came from the Yucatán Peninsula and founded [[Cacaxtla]] and [[Xochicalco]].

The term '''Olmec-Xicalancas''' refers to a particular culture (not to be confused with the pre-classical Olmec civilization), whom occupied and influenced the nearby areas. A unique difference between the Olmec-Xicalancas groups [and other Mesoamerican cities] were that each group (city-state) would have been governed by a tahualz, a King or ruler, independent of each other. In reality, they had two tahualz for each city-state.&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;

They had a writing system that at least included 10 signs, pictograms of the Sun, the Moon, a tree, a field harvest, a person, etc. Religion would have been polytheistic. The most important was the Sun God called different in both villages.

Other Olmec-Xicalanca Sites:

*[[Cacaxtla]]
*[[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)]]
*[[Xochicalco]]

==The Site==
[[File:Huapalcalco (Pyramid) Archaeological Site.jpg|alt=Huapalcalco Pyramid - Inspired by the builders of Teotihuacan|left|thumb|500x500px|'''Huapalcalco Pyramid''' - Archaeologists say it was influenced by, but not designed by the contemporary builders of Teotihuacan Valley of the Sun pyramids - fifty miles away.]]
'''Huapalcalco''' corresponds to the Mesoamerican Classical period (100 to 650 CE) and was part of the state of Teotihuacán, nevertheless, both their architecture and ceramics are not the same as to those used in Teotihuacán culture, that is to say, they have Teotihuacán influence but are not of Teotihuacan origin. It is not known who constructed these monuments, it can only be said that it has a large Teotihuacan cultural influence and it had influence on other Gulf Coast cultures.&lt;ref name="INAH" /&gt;

===Investigations===
The northwestern sector, perhaps the most important, was explored in 1954 by archaeologist Florencia Jacobs Müller and Cesar Lizardi Ramos. After nine expeditions, concluding in 1959, they discovered a pyramidal monument complex with evident Teotihuacán influence and a plaza with a [[Stele]] ([[Maya civilization|Mayan]] influence), [[Totonac]] yokes and a round altar.&lt;ref name="INAH" /&gt;

The remarkable finding of Totonac yokes shows the influence of the Gulf of Mexico coastal cultures, as well as the discovery of a sculpture of the Teotihuacan God of fire.&lt;ref name="INAH" /&gt;

An important finding was achieved when excavating the deepest part of one of the buildings, it consisted of arrowheads meserve type, that correspond to a pre-ceramic culture 7,000 BCE., and whose chronology matches a hand axe found of prehistoric type in the remains of a burnt cave in cliffs of "el Tecolote" hill, where also were found cave paintings of geometric human character predominating the red color, demonstrating the presence of Paleolithic man (approximately 10,000 BCE) in Huapalcalco.&lt;ref name="INAH" /&gt;

A recent finding on the highest part of "El Tecolote" hill, located at the south-eastern corner, consisting of a pyramid foundation built with stone slabs and stucco finishing. A symmetrical monument, not yet explored, is located at the north-east corner, at the other side of the ravine, natives know the place as "iglesias viejas".&lt;ref name="INAH" /&gt;

Huapalcalco has a 39 hectares extension, where more than 55 families currently live; within this area is the Archaeological Site in an enclosed 4 hectares perimeter.&lt;ref name="Tula3" /&gt;[[file:Mapa topografico de huapalcalco.JPG|thumb|400x400px|Topographic map of Huapalcalco.|alt=]]
===Toponymy===
Huapalcalco is a Nahuatl word, huapalli, "board or small beam "; calli, "house", y co, location proposition. Means "place of the wooden house ".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The Huapalcalco Glyph represents a battlement building, with three doors, apparently made from wood, different from the common calli glyph, is the graphical idea of huapalcalli [vapalcalli], which means "tent or house of tables."   Huapal calli, is composed of calli, house, and huapalli or huapalitl, board or small beam: Huapal cal co, "in the house of boards, "or the wooden building".&lt;ref name="Tula1" /&gt;

===Structures===
The site features a Teotihuacan influenced three-sided pyramid, 12 meters base by 8 meters high, with an altar that possibly was used for sacrificial offerings.&lt;ref name=Tula3   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title=Vista a Huapalcalco |trans-title=  |journal=Tulancingo Cultural  |location=  |url= http://www.tulancingocultural.cc/historico/huapalcalco/visitahuapalcalco/index.htm  |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 28 knolls: small pyramids buried, in which no archaeological work has been made.

The hill slope is divided by a ravine that divides the two sectors, this place is where Friar Bernardino de Sahagún passed and described it saying that it "has crystalline water cascades, at the foot stones, women were washing clothes while children swam and plunged into water".&lt;ref name=Tula3   /&gt;

Over the ravine stones are the cave paintings, which are difficult to see, these are dispersed over the "Cerro La Mesa" behind the pyramid. It is sad that graffiti has reached them, making them in some points confusing.  Also white crosses are painted in the stone by current inhabitants of the place, namely to scare away witches and nahuales.&lt;ref name=Tula3   /&gt;

On the slope, between rocky crags, the walls sink shaping the well-known caves of the place; villagers usually place altars to honor their dead.  In front of the "Tecolote" Cave, the remains of a prehistoric man was found, according to carbon 14 tests made, this man lived here 10 thousand years ago. The remains are kept in the National Museum of Anthropology and History of Mexico City, in the Prehistoric Room.&lt;ref name=Tula3   /&gt;

===Vandalism===
Vandals destroyed the Huapalcalco archaeological zone, considered one of Tulancingo cultural patrimonies.&lt;ref name=Elsol   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  October 10, 2006 |title=Huapalcalco, patrimonio destruido.

====Source of construction materials====
Stones originating from the pre-Hispanic ruins of the Huapalcalco archaeological zone, in the municipality of Tulancingo, have been used for the construction of houses by people living around the site. This happened due to the evident negligence on the part of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) state delegation.&lt;ref name=Usan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montoya|first=Ricardo|date=|title=Usan piedras de pirámide para construir casas|trans-title=Pyramid stones used to build houses|journal=Milenio Impreso|location=|url=http://impreso.milenio.com/node/7012512|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128211323/http://impreso.milenio.com/node/7012512|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-28|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claims of neglect====
The archaeological site appeared to be forgotten and neglected without regular maintenance.&lt;ref name="Olvido"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Jorge|date=2009-07-23|title=En el olvido, la zona de Huapalcalco|trans-title=The Huapalcalco site forgotten|journal=Milenio  Impreso|location=|url=http://impreso.milenio.com/node/8612546|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727180940/http://impreso.milenio.com/node/8612546|archivedate=2010-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to signs of vandalism in the area, putting the Huapalcalco cave paintings (more than 10 thousand years old) in danger from graffiti, bonfire soot, acts of vandalism and employee neglect.&lt;ref name="Olvido" /&gt;

Arriving to the site was difficult. On a side of the federal highway to Tuxpan, that crosses the city of Tulancingo, there is a deviation to Huapalcalco, where a rusty signboard welcomes people to the archaeological zone and cave paintings. The National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) logo was barely visible.&lt;ref name="Olvido" /&gt;

As of a visit in January, 2014, the road to the site is marked visibly with blue INAH signs and there are staff onsite to assist visitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Josip Hamm''' (3 December 1905 – 23 November 1986) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Slavic studies|Slavist]].

==Biography==

Hamm was born in the village of Gat near [[Belišće]] and [[Valpovo]]. In 1924 he finished the classical [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Osijek]], and in 1929 he graduated in Slavic and Germanic studies at the [[University of Zagreb]].

He worked as a lecturer at the gymnasiums in [[Pristina]], [[Karlovac]] and [[Zagreb]]. In 1931 he became a part-time [[lector]] for [[Polish language|Polish]] at the [[Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb]]. In 1934 he receives his Ph.D. with the thesis ''Matija Petar Katančić, njegova djela i njegov dijalekt'' ('[[Matija Petar Katančić]], his works and dialect'). In 1946 he became permanent lector for Polish. In 1948 he received a position of ''docent'' for Slavic philology, with special care for [[Old Church Slavonic]]. He became an associate professor in 1954, and a tenured professor in 1958.

In 1960, he accepted the position of a regular professor of Slavic philology at the Department for Slavic studies of the [[University of Vienna]], as well as the position of the head of the Institute for Slavic philology in Vienna. He also served as the head of the Linguistic department of Balkan commission (founded by [[Vatroslav Jagić]] in 1897) of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. He was a regular member of the Austrian as well as the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

In 1952, together with [[Svetozar Rittig]] and [[Vjekoslav Štefanić]], he founded the [[Old Church Slavonic Institute]] in Zagreb, under whose patronage the journal [[Slovo (journal)|Slovo]] was published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7848">{{more citations needed|date=January 2018}}'''Language convergence''' is a type of linguistic change in which languages come to structurally resemble one another as a result of prolonged language contact and mutual interference.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0195365542|location=New York|pages=269–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to other contact-induced language changes like [[creolization]] or the formation of [[Mixed language|mixed languages,]] convergence refers to a mutual process that results in changes in all the languages involved.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Contact: An Introduction|last=Thomason|first=Sarah|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2001|isbn=0748607196|location=Edinburgh|pages=89–90, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists use the term to describe changes in the linguistic patterns of the languages in contact rather than alterations of isolated lexical items.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Language Contact|last=|first=|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=1444318160|editor-last=Hickey|editor-first=Raymond|location=Malden, MA|pages=19, 68–9, 76, 285–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts ==

Language convergence occurs in geographic areas with two or more unrelated languages in contact, resulting in groups of languages with similar linguistic features that were not inherited from each language's [[proto-language]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These geographic and linguistic groups are called linguistic areas, or [[Sprachbund]] areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Contact Linguistics|last=Winford|first=Donald|publisher=Blackwell|year=2003|isbn=0631212515|location=Malden, MA|pages=65, 70–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic features shared by the languages in a language area as a result of language convergence are called areal features.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In situations with many languages in contact and a variety of areal features, linguists may use the term language convergence to indicate the impossibility of locating a singular source for each areal feature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, as the classification of linguistic areas and language convergence depends on shared areal features, linguists must distinguish between areal features resulting from convergence and internally motivated changes resulting in chance similarities between languages.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Appel, René; Pieter Muysken (1987). “Language Contact and Language Change,” In ''Language Contact and Bilingualism.'' New York: Edward Arnold. pp. 153-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

Language convergence occurs primarily through diffusion, the spread of a feature from one language to another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The causes of language convergence are highly dependent on the specifics of the contact between the languages involved. Often, convergence is motivated by bilingual [[code-switching]] or code-alternation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seeking full expressive capacity in both languages, bilingual speakers identify preexisting parallels between languages and use these structures to express similar meanings, eventually leading to convergence or increasing the frequency of the similar patterns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Sociolinguistics|Sociolinguistic]] factors may also influence the effects of language convergence, as ethnic boundaries can function as barriers to language convergence. Ethnic boundaries may help to explain areas in which linguists’ predictions about language convergence do not align with reality, such as areas with high inter-ethnic contact but low levels of convergence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Results ==

Language convergence often results in the increased frequency of preexisting patterns in a language; if one feature is present in two languages in contact, convergence results in increased use and cross-linguistic similarity of the parallel feature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As contact situations leading to language convergence lack defined [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate and superstrate languages,]] the outcomes of convergence often resemble structures found in all the languages involved without perfectly replicating any one pattern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Language convergence is most apparent in phonetics, with the phonological systems of the languages in contact gradually coming to resemble one another.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In some cases, the results of phonological convergence may be limited to a few phonemes, while in other linguistic areas phonological convergence can result in widespread changes that affect the entire phonological system, such as the development of phonemic tone distinctions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In contrast to the limited effects of lexical borrowing, phonetic, syntactic, or morphological convergence can have greater consequences, as converging patterns can influence an entire system rather than only a handful of lexical items.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Difficulties ==

When studying convergence, linguists take care to distinguish between features inherited from a language's proto-language, internally motivated changes, and diffusion from an outside source; in order to argue for language convergence, linguists try to argue for both an outside source and the mechanism that precipitated the change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The more drastic effects of language convergence, such as significant syntactic convergence and mixed languages, lead some linguists to question the validity of traditional historical linguistic methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of these far-reaching effects, other linguists are hesitant to accept convergence explanations for similar features and argue that often another explanation better represents changes that might otherwise attributed to language convergence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==

* [[Balkan sprachbund|Balkans Sprachbund]]: Contact between AD 800 and AD 170 lead to changes in [[phonology]], morphology, [[syntax]], and [[lexicon]] of [[Albanian language|Albanian,]] [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian,]] [[Romanian language|Romanian,]] and [[Greek language|Greek.]] The Balkans Sprachbund is an extreme case of language convergence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* [[Arnhem Land]], Australia: [[Morphosyntactic]] convergence and massive lexical diffusion in the Yuulgnu languages Ritharngnu, Dhayʔyi, and others and the “Prefixing” languages Ngandi, Nunggubuyu, and others, though long periods of separation helped to preserve language boundaries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua:]] Phonological convergence of the palatal /l/ in Spanish and Quechua. Northern variants of Ecuadorian Spanish and Quechua include the innovative /ž/ while southern variants of both languages maintain the /l̃/ pronunciation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese:]] Form a linguistic area based on the areal feature of [[Phoneme|phonemic]] tone distinctions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Dravidian languages]]: Include the shared areal feature of [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex consonants.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Chipewyan, Cree, French, and English: Phonological convergence of c and s-series consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scollon|first=Ronald|date=1979-01-01|title=Variable Data and Linguistic Convergence: Texts and Contexts in Chipewyan|jstor=4167072|journal=Language in Society|volume=8|issue=2|pages=223–243|doi=10.1017/s0047404500007442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Moustier''' is an [[archeological site]] consisting of two [[rock shelter]]s in [[Peyzac-le-Moustier]], a village in the [[Dordogne (département)|Dordogne]], [[France]]. It is known for a fossilized skull of the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' that was discovered in 1908. The [[Mousterian]] tool culture is named after Le Moustier, which was first excavated from 1863 by the Englishman [[Henry Christy]] and the Frenchman [[Édouard Lartet]].

The Le Moustier skull is estimated to be approximately 45,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianmuseum.net.au/image/Le-Moustier- Australian Museum] [&lt;small&gt;Retrieved 2012-01-06&lt;/small&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its characteristics include a large nasal cavity and a somewhat less developed [[brow ridge]] and [[occipital bun]], as might be expected in a juvenile.

After discovery, the skull was dismantled, cast and reconstructed at least four times. During this process, the skull received considerable amounts of damage; for example, when it was sold to the Museum für Völkerkunde in Berlin, a dentist broke the alveolar bone to access the teeth. The skull is now missing many parts, the teeth glued into the wrong position, and it has been dipped into glue, covered with varnish, and painted with plaster. Consequently its scientific value is much reduced. &lt;ref name="Weber 2011 p.

She received her doctorate at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London in 1989, studying under [[Robin Cormack]]. Her thesis discussed light and colour in Byzantine art and was entitled ''Colour Perception in Byzantium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kathleen|first=Maxwell,|date=1998|title=James, Liz. Light and Color in Byzantine Art|url=https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/a_ah/8/|journal=Scholar Commons|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, she embarked on postdoctoral fellowships, notably at the [[Barber Institute]]. In 1993 she joined the [[University of Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;AHRB Centre for Byzantine Cultural History, URL: http://www.byzantine-ahrb-centre.ac.uk/Staff/Liz.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research specialism ==
James is known as a keen promoter of all areas of [[Byzantine art]] and [[Byzantine culture]]. She has particular interests in mosaics and in gender issues. She has written extensively on mosaics, discussing practical, iconographic and materialistic approaches to the subject. She has also established a database of Byzantine glass mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;The Composition of Byzantine Glass Mosaic Tesserae, URL: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/byzantine/mosaic/&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of gender, she has discussed Byzantine empresses, eunuchs and the way Byzantine society reacted to gender. She is also interested in the relationship between text and image, believing Byzantine texts to be of equal importance to Byzantine art. James contributed to the [[Royal Academy]]'s 2008 Byzantium exhibition catalogue and gave a lecture to the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Women, Men and Eunuchs: The Three Sexes in Byzantium, Royal Academy Lecture, URL: http://static.royalacademy.org.uk/files/lizjames-414.mp3.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7341">A '''meat tax''' is a [[tax]] levied on the [[carbon]] emissions of [[meat]] and/or other animal products.

==Proponents==
[[Chatham House]] and Glasgow University, in a 2015 report called "Changing Climate, Changing Diets: Pathways to Lower Meat Consumption" have called for a tax on red meat.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-carbon-tax-on-meat/|title=A Carbon Tax on Meat?|first=Niina|last=Heikkinen|website=Scientificamerican.com|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/news/2015-11-18-reducing-meat-consumption-critical-achieving-global-climate-goal|title=Reducing meat consumption critical to achieving global climate goal|website=Chathamhouse.org|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/it-s-time-put-meat-climate-negotiating-table|title=It’s Time to Put Meat on the Climate Negotiating Table|website=Chathamhouse.org|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/changing-climate-changing-diets|title=Changing Climate, Changing Diets: Pathways to Lower Meat Consumption|website=Chathamhouse.org|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adam Briggs from the University of Oxford conducted a study that concluded that putting a carbon tax on high emissions foods (such as meat) could be a positive for both the planet and the health of U.K. consumers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12889-016-2723-8 |title=Simulating the impact on health of internalising the cost of carbon in food prices combined with a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=16 |year=2016 |last1=Briggs |first1=Adam D. M |last2=Kehlbacher |first2=Ariane |last3=Tiffin |first3=Richard |last4=Scarborough |first4=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists William J Ripple et al. have suggested the pushing up of the price of meat through a tax or emissions trading scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/tax-meat-cut-methane-emissions-scientists|title=Tax meat to cut methane emissions, say scientists|first=Adam|last=Vaughan|date=20 December 2013|accessdate=5 January 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nclimate2081 |title=Ruminants, climate change and climate policy |journal=Nature Climate Change |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=2–5 |year=2014 |last1=Ripple |first1=William J |last2=Smith |first2=Pete |last3=Haberl |first3=Helmut |last4=Montzka |first4=Stephen A |last5=McAlpine |first5=Clive |last6=Boucher |first6=Douglas H |bibcode=2014NatCC...4....2R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marco Springmann, from the Oxford University's Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food also proposed a tax on meat and dairy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nclimate3155 |title=Mitigation potential and global health impacts from emissions pricing of food commodities |journal=Nature Climate Change |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=69–74 |year=2016 |last1=Springmann |first1=Marco |last2=Mason-d'Croz |first2=Daniel |last3=Robinson |first3=Sherman |last4=Wiebe |first4=Keith |last5=Godfray |first5=H.

In 2017, the [[meat industry]]'s ''Farm Animal Investment &amp; Return (FAIRR) Initiative'' reports that meat taxes are becoming increasingly probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairr.org/news-item/climate-tax-meat-becoming-increasingly-probable/|title=CLIMATE TAX ON MEAT BECOMING ‘INCREASINGLY PROBABLE’ - FAIRR|website=Fairr.org|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">'''Mediated discourse analysis''' ('''MDA''') (coined by the late [[Ron Scollon]]) is a specialised form of [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[discourse analysis]] (similar to [[critical discourse analysis]])—it mediates [[discourse]], [[Agency (sociology)|agency]], and [[Praxis (process)|practice]] into what Scollon calls a "nexus of practice". The goal of MDA is to focus on discourse ''in'' action, as opposed to discourse ''as'' action, thus making discourse analysts responsible for applying discourse into various practical and useful contexts.

MDA is realized in practice through the [[Methodology|research strategy]] of nexus analysis which is suitable for studying complex, evolving processes in order to shed light on social action not only [[in situ]] but also as reaching across long-span timescales. Nexus analysis is used also in fields other than [[Linguistics|linguistic]] studies. Examples of studies using nexus analysis have focused on [[:wikt:micro|micro]] perspectives but also on issues on [[:wikt:macro|macro]] level, e.g. when interpreting video diaries produced by children (Iivari et al., 2014), studying [[Media culture|popular media]] as a pervasive educative force (Wohlwend &amp; Medina, 2012), and building an [[information infrastructure]] in a city (Halkola et al., 2012).

The Act amended several existing acts and mandated new directions for federal agencies with the purpose of:

* bringing technology and industrial innovation to market more quickly
* encouraging cooperative research and development between business and the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]] by providing access to federal laboratories
* making it easier for businesses to obtain exclusive licenses to technology and inventions that result from cooperative research with the federal government

The Act made a direct impact on the development of new industrial and technology standards by requiring that all Federal agencies use cooperatively developed standards, particularly those developed by [[standards organization|standards developing organizations]].

[[Image:Athen Stoa Ostrakismos 2.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Voting ostraca (for [[ostracism]], Ancient Greece)]]

An '''ostracon''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ὄστρακον}} ''ostrakon'', plural {{lang|grc|ὄστρακα}} ''ostraka'') is a piece of [[pottery]], usually broken off from a [[vase]] or other [[earthenware]] vessel. In an [[archaeology|archaeological]] or [[epigraphy|epigraphical]] context, ''ostraca'' refer to [[sherd]]s or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as convenient places to place writing for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases surprisingly long.

==Ostracism==
In [[Classical Athens]], when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the sherd of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was [[exile]]d for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term ''[[ostracism]]''.

==Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca==
[[Image:Heratic script limestone.jpg|right|thumb|210px|One of four official letters to [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Khay copied onto a [[limestone]] ostracon, in Egyptian [[Hieratic]] ]]

[[File:Egyptian - Ostracon with a Royal Head - Walters 321.jpg|left|thumb|The [[New Kingdom]] [[pharaoh]] depicted on this limestone fragment  bears the finesse of a master's hand. The two arms, however, are rendered more crudely. It is likely that a master used this ostracon to teach his student, and the work of both individuals can be seen on the piece. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].|251x251px]]

Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available and therefore frequently used  for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students' exercises and notes: pottery [[sherd]]s, limestone flakes,&lt;ref name="Donadoni"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Donadoni |editor-first=Sergio |title=The Egyptians |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1997 |isbn=0-226-15555-2 |page=78 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; thin fragments of other stone types, etc., but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter color, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Klauck |first=Hans-Josef |title=Ancient Letters And the New Testament: A Guide to Context and Exegesis |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-932792-40-6 |page=45 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at  Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the [[Story of Sinuhe]].&lt;ref name="Donadoni" /&gt;

The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michel |last=Chauveau |title=Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra: History and Society Under the Ptolemies |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=2000 |isbn=0-8014-8576-2 |page=7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries.

===Deir el-Medina Medical Ostraca===
{{See also|Medical Ostraca of Deir el-Medina}}
The many ostraca found at [[Deir el-Medina]] provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the [[New Kingdom]]. These ostraca have shown that, like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medical treatment]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|prayer]], and  [[Egyptian magic|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=53 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a “[[physician]]” who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a “scorpion charmer” who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janssen |first=Jac. J. |title=Absence from Work by the Necropolis Workmen of Thebes |journal=Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur |volume=8 |year=1980 |issue= |pages=127–152 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no “trained” intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, however, with only a handful of ostraca containing [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]], indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician’s prescription, or to fulfill a [[home remedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=57 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saqqara Dream Ostraca===
From 1964–1971, Bryan Emery excavated at [[Saqqara]] in search of [[Imhotep]]'s tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered.  Apparently it was a pilgrim site, with as many as 1½ million [[ibis]] birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims.

Emery's excavations uncovered the "Dream Ostraca", created by a scribe named ''Hor of Sebennytos.'' A devotee of the god [[Thoth]], he lived adjacent to Thoth's sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a "proto-therapist", advising and comforting clients. He transferred his divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] texts written on pottery and limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical period ostraca==
{{See also|List of artifacts significant to the Bible}}

Famous ostraca for [[Biblical archaeology]] have been found at:
* [[Arad, Israel]], or [[Tel Arad]]
* [[Lachish]]
* [[Mesad Hashavyahu]]
* [[Ostraca House]] at [[Samaria]]
* [[Elah Fortress]] at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]]&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/10/30/israel.ancient.text/ |title=Archeologist finds 3,000-year old Hebrew text |work=CNN |date=October 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the lots drawn at [[Masada]] are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found.

In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, [[Yosef Garfinkel]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], has discovered what he says to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an Ostracon shard; Garfinkel believes this shard dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the Ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave and judge have been translated. 
The shard was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Christian ostraca==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2014}}
Some Christian texts are preserved upon ostraca. In the late 19th century, 20 ostraca were found in [[Upper Egypt]], probably from the 7th century, written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].

The ostraca are of different sizes and shapes. The more extant is [[Luke 22]]:40-71, which runs over 10 pieces. The ostraca contain from 2 to 9 verses each, and cover {{bibleref|Matthew|27:31–32}}; Mark 5:40-41 (Mark 9:3); Mark 9:17-18, Mark 9:22; Mark 15:21; Luke 12:13-16; Luke 22:40-71; John 1:1-9; John 1:14-17; John 18:19-25; John 19:15-17. There is one ostracon with the inscription "St. Peter the evangelist," perhaps an allusion to the Gospel of Peter.

A Coptic Sa'idic ostracon preserves the [[Pericope Adulterae]] found in John 7:53-8:1, which is otherwise omitted in the Sa'idic New Testament. A Christian hymn to Mary, similar to the canticles of Luke, and some Christian letters have also been found.

Inscriptions on clay, wood, metal, and other hard materials, like [[Papyrus|papyri]], are valuable especially as literary sources for [[Early Christianity]]. They are found chiefly in Oriental countries (i.e. ''east'' of Rome or [[Southwest Asia]]), especially Egypt (which though east of Rome is technically [[North Africa]]). The greatest number are pieces of clay or scraps of pots inscribed with colors or ink. The oldest Christian ostraca, like the papyri, are Greek and date from the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]]; next come the Coptic and Arabian ostraca. Some of the texts not yet deciphered include several Nubian ostraca in a language spoken in the old Christian kingdoms in the vicinity of Aloa on the [[Blue Nile]]. 

In these inscriptions Greek letters are used, with some other signs. As to contents, ostraca are either profane or ecclesiastical. Potsherds were often used for correspondence in place of the less durable papyrus; occasionally the recipient wrote the answer on the back of the potsherd. Ostraca were also used for mercantile purposes, as bills, receipts, etc. C. M. Kaufmann and J. C. Ewald Falls, while excavating the town of Menas in the Libyan desert, discovered ostraca of this class—the oldest Christian potsherds in the Greek language (5th century)—and H. J. Bell and F. G. Kenyon of the British Museum deciphered them. 

They refer to the vine-culture of the sanctuaries of Menas and represent, for the most part, short vouchers for money or provisions. The currency is based upon gold [[solidi]] issued by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]; the date is reckoned by the year of indiction. Of historical interest is the assistance given to invalid workmen, the employment of the lower clergy, the manner of provisioning the workmen, and especially the statements about the harvest periods in the Libyan district. The series of Coptic ostraca which deals with the clergy and the monasteries in the Nile valley is particularly extensive. They refer to all phases of administration and popular life. 

The ecclesiastical ostraca, in a narrow sense, contain Biblical citations from the [[New Testament]], prayers, extracts from the [[synaxaria]] (lives of the saints), and are partly of a liturgic character. Greek, which was then the language of the Church, is much used, with the Coptic. Among the samples published by W.E. Crum, a fine judge of Coptic dialects, there is a local confession of faith from the 6th century, besides the Preface and Sanctus of the Mass, prayers from the [[Liturgy of St. Basil]] and of St. Mark, a part of the [[didascalia]] of [[Schenûte of Athribis]], a Greek confession, and an [[excommunication]], also in Greek.
 
Particularly remarkable are those ostraca which contain liturgical songs. They represent our present song-books for which purpose rolls of papyrus were less suited than the more durable potsherds; in some cases wooden books were used. Among the pieces translated by Crum we find petitions for ordination in which the petitioner promises to learn by heart one of the Gospels, and a reference to an ancient abstinence movement, against which is directed a decree that the consecration-wine should be pure or at least three-fourths pure.

'''Photoplay edition''' refers to movie tie-in [[book]]s of the [[silent film]] and early sound era at a time when [[motion pictures]] were known as "photoplays". Typically, photoplay editions were reprints of novels additionally illustrated with scenes from a film production. Less typically, photoplay editions were novelizations of films, where the film script was fictionalized in narrative form. Today, vintage photoplay editions are sought after by film buffs, bibliophiles, and collectors.

The first photoplay editions were published around 1912, and as a genre, they reached their height in the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of different titles were issued in the United States. Most photoplays were published in hardback by companies like [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] or A.L. Burt, and some in soft cover by companies like Jacobsen Hodgkinson. Similar movie related books were also published in England, France and elsewhere.

Typically, photoplay editions of the 1920s and 1930s contained stills and/or a dust jacket featuring artwork or actors from a film. Deluxe editions might also contain a special binding, illustrated end papers, or rarely, a written introduction by the star of the film. Sometimes, the spine or cover of the book will note the edition is a "photoplay edition."

Illustrated movie tie-in books continued to be published though the 1940s, 1950s, and into the 1960s. Today, novels published in conjunction with the release of a film will often feature an actor or actress on the cover of the book, but without the interior illustrations.

Today, the most sought after photoplays are those tie-in editions for favorite films such as ''Dracula'', ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'', or lost films such as ''London After Midnight''. Other collectors search for books featuring individuals stars, like [[Louise Brooks]] or [[Rudolph Valentino]]. Published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in 1927, ''The General'' is today one of the most sought after of photoplay books. Not only did the Joseph Warren novel make its first appearance in print as a photoplay, but the book is the only photoplay edition to feature film star [[Buster Keaton]].

== Guidebooks ==

[[Image:Photoplayedition.jpg|thumb|170px|Emil Petaja's ''Photoplay Edition'' was the first book published on the subject.]]

''Photoplay Edition'' (SISU, 1975), by the noted science fiction and fantasy author [[Emil Petaja]], was the first book on the subject. Petaja based the book on his collection of photoplays, which at the time of publication numbered more than eight hundred. Petaja had owned many rare examples, including a few autographed by film stars.

Petaja's ''Photoplay Edition'' is composed of a checklist of books, with each entry detailing the book's movie title (which sometimes differed from the title of the novel), as well as its author, publisher, date of release, the motion picture company which produced the film, its leading actors, and the number of illustrations included within the book. Illustrating Petaja's guide are dozens of dust jackets and scene stills, each of which graced the original editions. Petaja also offers a short prologue, a longer history of photoplay books, and an anecdotal chapter telling the story of the author's involvement in collecting these books.

''Photoplay Edition'' has been surpassed by later, more comprehensive, illustrated guides. These include Arnie Davis' ''Photoplay Editions and Other Movie Tie-In Books'' (Mainely Books, 2002), and Rick Miller's ''Photoplay Editions: A Collector's Guide'' (McFarland, 2002). Each list more than the 800 examples found in Petaja's pioneering guide. Thomas Mann's ''Horror and Mystery Photoplay Editions and Magazine Fictionizations'' (McFarland, 2004) examines genre editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''Prohibitionism''' is a [[legal philosophy]] and [[political theory]] often used in [[lobbying]] which holds that citizens will abstain from actions if the actions are typed as unlawful (i.e. prohibited) and the prohibitions are enforced by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies&gt;C Canty, A Sutton. ''Strategies for community-based drug law enforcement: From prohibition to harm reduction''; in T Stockwell, PJ Gruenewald, JW Toumbourou, WLoxley W, eds. ''Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2005. pp. 225-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy has been the basis for many acts of [[statutory law]] throughout history, most notably when a large group of a given population disapproves of and/or feels threatened by an activity in which a smaller group of that population engages, and seeks to render that activity legally prohibited.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies/&gt;

== Examples ==
Acts of prohibition have included [[sumptuary law|prohibitions on types of clothing]] (and [[Public nudity|prohibitions on lack of clothing]]), prohibitions on [[gambling]] and [[striptease|exotic dancing]], the [[prohibition of drugs]] (for example, [[prohibition of alcohol|alcohol prohibition]] and [[cannabis prohibition]]), [[smoking ban|prohibitions on tobacco smoking]], and [[gun prohibition]]. Indeed, the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] between 1920 and 1933 due to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] often is referred to simply as "[[Prohibition]]", as is the "[[War on Drugs]]" that succeeded it. &lt;br /&gt;
An additional example, called ''nettle war'': Since 2002 in [[France]] the sale of nettle liquid manure was prohibited, and since 2006, unauthorized plant protection products (such as nettle liquid manure) to sell, own and operate.  Even [[advertising]] and recommendations for these products were not allowed. Only since 2011, it was legalized again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023912654 Decree 2011: Nettles were legalized again (fr)] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The film by [[Arte]] about it was completed in 2010 (''Nettle-war, mysterious plants - Nettle'', 42:04 minutes)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eraclito450.blogspot.de/2013/09/brennessel-krieg-geheimnisvolle.html nettle-war in France] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The success of a measure of prohibitionism has been criticized as often depending too much upon effective enforcement of the relevant legislation. Some people{{Who|date=July 2011}} have argued this is because the majority of the targets of prohibitionism are in the category of [[victimless crime]], where they claim the harm that comes from the crime is non-existent, questionable, or only to the person who performs the act and even then the magnitude of the harm being relatively small.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Under this interpretation enforcement becomes a conflict between violation of statue and violation of free will.{{Why?|date=July 2011}} Since the acts prohibited often are enjoyable, enforcement is often the most harmful choice to the individual. This sometimes results in laws which rarely are enforced by anybody who does not have a financial or personal motivation to do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The difficulty of enforcing prohibitionist laws also criticized as resulting in selective enforcement, wherein the enforcers select the people they wish to prosecute based on other criteria, resulting in [[discrimination]] based on races, culture, nationality, or financial status. For example, [[United States|American]] philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized drug prohibition as being a technique of [[social control]] of the "so-called dangerous classes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm Noam Chomsky, "On the War on Drugs", ''Week Online'', DRCNet, February 8, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibitionism based laws have the added problem of calling attention to the behavior that they are attempting to prohibit.  This can make the behavior interesting and exciting, and cause its popularity to increase. This is essentially in relation with the [[Streisand effect]].

The secular movement in the United States has caused friction in the [[culture war]] and in other areas of American society. It is generally opposed to the [[Christian right]] and promotes [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions on social issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]], [[reproductive rights]], and [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/majority-of-atheists-are-liberal/article/2510230|title=Majority of atheists are liberal|author=Paul Bedard|work=Washington Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-social-and-political-views/|title=Social and Political Views of the Unaffiliated|date=9 October 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This doesn't mean that all "secularists" believe these things, just the movement as a whole has moved in a more "liberal" or "civil libertarian" direction.

== Organizations ==
The secular movement has involved the rapid growth of national and local atheist, agnostic, freethinker, and humanist groups, with organizations such as [[American Atheists]], the [[American Humanist Association]], the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation|Freedom From Religion Foundation]], and the [[Atheist Republic]] reporting rising membership and like-minded groups appearing in communities around the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/us/27atheist.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has been aided in part by the [[Internet]], which has allowed atheists and other secularists to connect through blogs and [[social media]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com|title=Find your people   - Meetup|work=meetup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/|title=Friendly Atheist|work=Friendly Atheist}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has enabled the formation of secular groups even in conservative, [[Bible Belt]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/atheists-64/|title=Freethought Society of the Midlands (FSM)|work=Meetup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alabama-Atheists-and-Agnostics/209597389100821|title=Alabama Atheists and Agnostics|work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/atheists-131/|title=Mississippi Gulf Coast Atheist and Freethinking Association|work=Meetup}}&lt;/ref&gt; National secular groups that once had constituencies of a few thousand have used social media to attract followings in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/americanhumanist|title=American Humanist Association|work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/4ffrf|title=Freedom From Religion Foundation|work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular student groups in colleges and high schools have also seen rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0712/atheists_high_school.php3#.VPB-8bPF-Ac|title=This fall, get ready for more atheist clubs at high schools|work=jewishworldreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secular Student Alliance]], a national group formed in 2001, grew from 80 campus affiliates in 2007 to almost 400 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/16/non_believers_taking_college_campuses_by_storm_partner/|title=Non-believers taking college campuses by storm|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, reflecting an approach similar to the "[[coming out]]" strategy of the gay rights movement, a group called Openly Secular was formed to encourage nonreligious and nontheistic Americans to speak out. The group's mission "is to eliminate discrimination and increase acceptance by getting secular people—including atheists, freethinkers, agnostics, humanists, and nonreligious people—to be open about their beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openlysecular.org/about|title=Openly Secular|work=openlysecular.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one video produced for the group, comedian and television personality [[Bill Maher]] urged atheists to be open about their [[religious skepticism]], dismissing the [[Bible]] as a book "based on ancient myths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bill-maher-urges-atheists-to-speak-up-knocks-the-bible-as-book-based-on-ancient-myths-in-new-ad-for-openly-secular-132831/|title=Bill Maher Urges Atheists to Speak Up; Knocks the Bible as Book Based on 'Ancient Myths' in New Ad for Openly Secular|work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secular movement works to increase the visibility of nonbelievers, including through [[Advertising campaign|advertising campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/atheist.christmas.billboard.ads.target.americas.bible.belt/43768.htm|title=Atheist Christmas billboard ads target America's Bible Belt - Christian News on Christian Today|work=christiantoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/20732-first-%E2%80%98atheist-ad%E2%80%99-on-%E2%80%98daily-show%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98colbert-report%E2%80%99-features-ron-reagan|title=First ‘atheist ad’ on ‘Daily Show,’ ‘Colbert Report’ features Ron Reagan|work=ffrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-11-humanists-launch-largest-national-advertising-campai|title=Humanists Launch Largest National Advertising Campaign Critical of Religious Scripture|work=American Humanist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the number of local secular groups growing, a national group, the [[United Coalition of Reason]], was formed in 2009 to use advertising as a means of promoting those groups. It operates by entering a media market and working with local atheist and humanist groups to form a local "Coalition of Reason", and then purchasing local advertising, usually [[Billboard|billboards]] or transit ads, to promote that coalition. The group has executed this strategy in over 75 media markets in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitedcor.org/national/page/home|title=Home|work=unitedcor.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224083647/http://unitedcor.org/national/page/home|archivedate=2015-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical ads convey messages such as "Are You Good Without God? Millions Are" and "Don't believe in God? You are not alone." These ads often create local controversies, and have sometimes been vandalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/12/atheist-groups-anti-god-sign-vandalized-in-arlington-heights.html|title=Illinois atheist group's|work=Illinois Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political involvement ==
In 2002, the [[Secular Coalition for America]] was formed to lobby on behalf of secular Americans in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2007, as a result of a campaign by the group, Rep. [[Pete Stark]] of California became the first open atheist in the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Stark-s-atheist-views-break-political-taboo-2570270.php|title=Stark's atheist views break political taboo|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secular.org/news/pete_stark_070312.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021401/http://www.secular.org/news/pete_stark_070312.html|title=Rep. Pete Stark (D-Cal.): first openly nontheistic member of Congress|archivedate=28 September 2007|work=secular.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a political action committee was launched to support nonreligious political candidates and candidates sympathetic to atheist and humanist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/09/18/223784072/atheists-start-pac-to-elect-non-religious-candidates.|title=Atheists Start PAC To Elect Nonreligious Candidates|date=18 September 2013|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secular Coalition for America claims that over two dozen members of Congress have privately reported being atheists, but refrain from openly identifying as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/group-claims-28-atheists-in-congress-27-closeted-57292/|title=Group Claims 28 Atheists in Congress; 27 Closeted|work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although open atheists are still rarely elected in American politics, atheists frequently challenge religious conservatives on political issues. The American Humanist Association wrote letters in 2013 and 2015 to discourage newly elected members of Congress from joining the [[Congressional Prayer Caucus]], which advocates for more prayer and religion in American government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/25/atheists-say-prayer-caucus-a-threat-to-us-constitution/|title=Atheists Say Prayer Caucus A Threat To US Constitution|work=The Daily Caller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuits ==
As America's secular demographic has grown and become more visible and active, a number of lawsuits have been brought to challenge references to God and religion in government. These cases have had limited success.

In 2002, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that the inclusion of the words "under God" in the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. That ruling was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', 542 U.S. 1 (2004). The Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff, [[Michael Newdow]], not on the substantive legal issue but on a technicality, declaring that he lacked [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] because he did not have [[Child custody|custody]] of his daughter, on whose behalf he had brought the suit. Newdow subsequently filed a second case, and in 2010, the Ninth Circuit reversed its earlier decision and ruled that the "under God" wording did not violate the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/05-17257.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled against the Freedom From Religion Foundation in ''[[Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation]]'', 551 U.S. 587 (2007), which challenged the expenditure of tax money through the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]]. The court ruled that taxpayers do not have legal standing to challenge expenditures by the executive branch. In 2011, the [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] rejected a challenge to the [[National Day of Prayer]], again on standing grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/14/national-day-of-prayer-_n_849295.html|title=National Day Of Prayer Lawsuit Thrown Out By Federal Appeals Court|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a federal court rejected a challenge, brought by Newdow and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, to remove "[[In God we trust|In God We Trust]]" from American currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=1016&amp;sid=26823999&amp;fm=most_popular|title=Lawsuit to remove 'In God We Trust' from money gets dismissed - KSL.com|work=ksl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, courts in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Jersey]] rejected challenges to state laws requiring daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. The lawsuits, brought by the American Humanist Association, claimed that [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] guarantees under the respective state constitutions prohibited daily recitation of the pledge because the "under God" wording discriminated against atheists. The courts ruled that, because participation in the exercise is voluntary, the laws do not violate equal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/09/under-god-in-pledge-of-allegiance-is-constitutional-says-massachusettss-highest-court/|title=‘Under God’ in Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional, says Massachusetts’s highest court|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/school_law/2015/02/nj_court_rejects_challenge_to_.html|title=N.J. Court Rejects Challenge to Pledge of Allegiance in Schools|work=Education Week - The School Law Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Town of Greece v. Galloway]]'', the Supreme Court in 2014 rejected a challenge to the use of sectarian prayers by some local legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/town-of-greece-v-galloway/|title=Town of Greece v. Galloway|work=SCOTUSblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though seen as a setback for church-state separation, the ruling also stated that municipalities cannot discriminate against minority faiths in allowing invocations, and atheists and humanists subsequently used it to assert their right to participate in the invocation process. Months after the ''Galloway'' ruling, an atheist gave the invocation at a regular meeting of the Town of Greece board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/07/16/atheist-invocation/12726957/|title=Atheist gives invocation, first since high court decision|author=Meaghan M. McDermott, Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle|date=16 July 2014|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secular movement has also been active in public discourse over the definition of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]]. Atheist and humanist groups opposed the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.]]'', which gave corporate employers the right to opt out of the [[Contraceptive mandate (United States)|birth control mandate]] of the [[Affordable Care Act]] on religious freedom grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.atheists.org/2014/06/30/atheists-decry-courts-grant-of-religious-rights-to-corporations-in-hobby-lobby/|title=American Atheists -   Atheists Decry Court’s Grant of Religious Rights to Corporations in Hobby Lobby|work=American Atheists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reason Rally ==
In March 2012, several national secular groups sponsored a [[Reason Rally]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., with a lineup of speakers and performers that included [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Tim Minchin]], [[Bad Religion]], and [[James Randi]]. The stated purpose of the rally was "to unify, energize, and embolden secular people nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reasonrally.org/about/|title=About|work=reasonrally.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/|archivedate=2012-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowd estimates ranged from 8000 to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/11/the-origins-of-aggressive-atheism/383088/|title=The Origins of Aggressive Atheism|author=Emma Green|date=24 November 2014|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-unbelievers/id860364931|title=iTunes - Movies - The Unbelievers|work=iTunes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, organizers announced plans for a second Reason Rally, but did not set a date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/25/will-atheists-march-on-washington-in-2016-planning-for-the-second-reason-rally-has-begun/|title=Will Atheists March on Washington in 2016?

== Connection to New Atheism ==
[[New Atheism|New Atheist]] authors such as Dawkins, [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]], and [[Christopher Hitchens]] helped give the secular movement momentum, though many American secularists disagree with the politics and style of the New Atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8885481/after-the-new-atheism/|title=Richard Dawkins has lost: meet the new atheists|work=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/06/23/christopher_hitchens_lies_do_atheism_no_favors/|title=Christopher Hitchens’ lies do atheism no favors|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins has been involved in public disputes with atheist [[Feminism|feminists]] who have criticized remarks he has made about [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2011/07/richard-dawkins-draws-feminist-wrath-over-sexual-harassment-comments/39637/|title=Richard Dawkins Gets into a Comments War with Feminists|author=Caitlin Dickson|work=The Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Atheist authors have been highly critical of Islam, connecting terrorism to the religion of the perpetrators, and many secularists have denounced such views as [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/30/dawkins_harris_hitchens_new_atheists_flirt_with_islamophobia/|title=Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens: New Atheists flirt with Islamophobia|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some within the secular movement, such as the [[American Humanist Association]], have expressed "a strong distaste for efforts to propagate a crusade mentality against Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2014-11-a-humanist-approach-to-islam|title=A Humanist Approach to Islam|work=American Humanist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However other prominent figures in the Secular movement disagree, such as [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], who believes that "political correctness is counterproductive" and that we must "acknowledge the issue of [[Islam]]."&lt;ref name="Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Tackle Islam or Face Civil War"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Tackle Islam or Face Civil War|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/ayaan-hirsi-ali-tackle-islam-or-face-civil-war/|publisher= Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aquitania''' is a luxury, 82-unit [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]] apartment building in the Margate Park neighborhood of the [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]] community of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It is officially designated on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by The United States Department of the Interior.

The Aquitania, known legally as the 5000 North Marine Drive Corporation, was built by [[Ralph C. Harris]] and [[Byron H. Jillson]] in the [[Classical Revival]] style. Its developer was [[George K. Spoor]], the co-founder of [[Essanay Studios]] and a producer of silent movies during the first two decades of the twentieth century. At that time, Chicago rivaled both [[New York City]] and [[Hollywood]] in film production, and Spoor was able to use his considerable wealth to plan and develop a property, which he felt was befitting the celebrities connected with Chicago's growing entertainment industry.  A legend, which purports that Essanay Studio actors Charlie Chaplain and Gloria Swanson once resided at The Aquitania, is likely unfounded.  This probable factual inaccuracy reflects nothing more than film lore since all silent film production left Chicago's Essanay studios for southern California by 1918 at the very latest, and The Aquitania was not built until 1923, although there are historical accounts of both silent-film era stars staying as guests at The Aquitania when it was a hotel in its earliest days.

When the Aquitania was built, it was situated directly on the Lake Michigan shore; subsequent development of both [[Lake Shore Drive]] and the lakefront park have moved the shore some two blocks east of the building. The fifteen-story building has a courtyard and an [[Art Moderne]] lobby. Construction was completed in 1923, and it became a cooperative in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wibiti.com/HomePageView.aspx?v=v&amp;c=0&amp;HpID=%c2%b3%5eX%e2%80%a0 Real estate Housing profiles The Aquitania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719094859/http://wibiti.com/HomePageView.aspx?v=v&amp;c=0&amp;HpID=%C2%B3%5EX%E2%80%A0 |date=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, theme is usually about [[life]], [[society]] or [[human nature]], but can be any other subject. Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work. Themes are usually implied rather than explicitly stated. Deep thematic content is not required in a work, but the great majority of works have some kind of thematic content, not always [[Authorial intentionality|intended by the author]]. Analysis of changes (or implied change) in dynamic characteristics of the work can provide insight into a particular theme.

A theme is not the same as the subject of a work. For example, the ''subject'' of ''[[Star Wars]]'' is "the battle for control of the galaxy between the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Rebel Alliance]]". The ''themes'' explored in the films might be "moral ambiguity" or "the conflict between technology and nature".

Themes differ from [[motif (visual arts)|motifs in the visual arts]] in that themes are ideas conveyed by the visual experience as a whole, while motifs are elements of the content.  In the same way, a literary story with repeated symbolism related to chess does not make the story's theme the similarity of life to chess. Themes arise from the interplay of the plot, the characters, and the attitude the author takes to them, and the same story can be given very different themes in the hands of different authors.

'''Trustworthy Repositories Audit &amp; Certification (TRAC)''' is a document describing the metrics of an [[Open Archival Information System|OAIS]]-compliant digital repository that developed from work done by the [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]]/[[Research Libraries Group|RLG]] Programs and [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) task force initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9783642168086|first=David|last=Giaretta|title=Advanced Digital Preservation|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRAC checklist is an Auditing tool to assess the reliability, commitment and readiness of institutions to assume long-term preservation responsibilities. Currently the repository is under the care of the [[Center for Research Libraries|CRL]] who are utilizing it in several independent projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crl.edu/archiving-preservation/digital-archives/metrics&lt;/ref&gt;  The TRAC checklist was superseded in 2012 by the ISO 16363, known as the Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) Checklist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf | title=September 2011 Magenta Draft of ISO 16363 | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Digitalrepositorystandards.png|thumb|alt=A diagram of the development of digital repository standards|A diagram of the development of digital repository standards]]In 1996 the [[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems]] established a task force that developed [[OAIS]], a high-level model for the operation of archives. OAIS was accepted as [[International Standards Organization|ISO]] 14721 in 2002. The original task force stated that an independent auditing method was necessary to certify OAIS-compliance and thus engender trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserving Digital Information|url=https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/09/pub63watersgarrett.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the lack of certified auditors and auditing metrics, repositories were already implementing OAIS concepts and labeling themselves OAIS-compliant.&lt;ref name="Narations"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.archives.gov/online-public-access/?p=4697 | title=NARAtions | accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of OAIS auditing metrics began in 2003. A joint task force of OCLC/RLG and NARA built upon a previous OCLC/RLG project, Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/past/rlg/trustedrep/repositories.pdf | title=Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities | accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the metrics collectively known as Trustworthy Repositories Audit &amp; Certification (TRAC). After the publication of TRAC in 2007, CRL was given the responsibility to carry out test audits using the metrics.

TRAC is the basis of the Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) document that was accepted as ISO 16363 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf | title=September 2011 Magenta Draft of ISO 16363 | accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The TRAC metrics are split into three subject groups:
*Organizational Infrastructure - the repository's administrative, staffing, financial, and legal functions
*Digital Object Management - the handling of digital objects from ingest to access
*Technology, Technical Infrastructure, and Security - the technology used to handle ingested objects

A TRAC audit consists of a repository completing the TRAC checklist by citing they fulfill each metric. Metrics can be fulfilled by citing relevant documentation, typical practice, or a combination of both. The TRAC auditors then examine this self-audit. After an on-site visit to discuss any concerns with the provided evidence, the auditors grade the repository on a scale of 1 to 5 for each of the three subject groups.

To retain certification, repositories meet with the auditors within 18 to 24 months for a consultation. After 4 years, the certification expires and the repository must begin a new audit.

==Trustworthiness as concept==
The concept of [[Trust (emotion)#Systems|trust]] underpins the relationship between repositories and their users. The development of the OAIS model (Open Archival Information System) was accompanied by a demand for assurance that repositories claiming to use OAIS actually adhere to those standards; that is, a demand for trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Christopher|title=Digital Curation and Trusted Repositories: Steps Toward Success|journal=Texas Digital Library|date=2007|volume=8|issue=2|url=https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/index.php/jodi/article/view/229/183|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team behind TRAC, led by Robin Dale and Bruce Ambacher, conceived of the trustworthiness of the TRAC-certified repositories as not only providing for well-sourced and well-formatted records and metadata, but transparent managerial procedures and sustainable, long-term structural support.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/d6/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The TRAC creators conceived of four core principles that underpin the checklist's criteria for a trusted digital repository (TDR): documentation (evidence), transparency, adequacy and measurability.

TRAC expanded upon the previous definition of a TDR that had been developed from the seminal 1996 PDI report that first called for audit and certification of digital repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserving Digital Information|url=https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/09/pub63watersgarrett.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It selectively drew upon models such as Germany's nestor, RLG and OCLC's original TDR description and the Cornell model for Trusted Digital Repository Attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGovern|first1=Nancy|title=A Digital Decade: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going in Digital Preservation?|journal=RLG DigiNews|date=April 15, 2007|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/60441/McGovern-Digital_Decade.html?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Elizabeth Yakel]], Ixchel Faniel, Adam Kriesberg and Ayoung Yoon, it still overlooked key factors in perceived trustworthiness. They demonstrated that understandings of trustworthiness vary across disciplines, and the 2007 TRAC checklist did not address or fully weigh the impact of differences within designated communities in perceptions of trust.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/8.1.143&lt;/ref&gt; Another key conclusion of their study was there is a difference between users' trust in data and their trust in repositories. Further research by Yoon identified a strong correlation between TRAC's first two metrics (organizational infrastructure and digital object management) and user trust of repositories, but little user interest in the third metric (technical infrastructure and security).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoon|first1=Ayoung|title=End users' trust in data repositories: definition and influences on trust development|url=https://link-springer-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/article/10.1007/s10502-013-9207-8/fulltext.html|doi=10.1007/s10502-013-9207-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on previous work on TRAC, Yoon identified a "lack of deception" as the key feature in establishing trust in both sources and repositories. In 2012, ISO 16363 expanded upon and superseded the 2007 TRAC checklist by adding more detailed criteria, as well as providing a new standard for bodies seeking to be certified to perform certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aligning National Approaches to Digital Preservation Proceedings|date=August 2012|publisher=Educopia Institute|isbn=978 - 0 - 9826653 - 1 - 2|url=https://educopia.org/sites/educopia.org/files/publications/Aligning_National_Approaches_to_Digital_Preservation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
TRAC is not the only certification system to assess the trustworthiness of a digital information system. Other systems include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aligning National Approaches to Digital Preservation Proceedings|date=August 2012|publisher=Educopia Institute|isbn=978 - 0 - 9826653 - 1 - 2|url=https://educopia.org/sites/educopia.org/files/publications/Aligning_National_Approaches_to_Digital_Preservation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* nestorSEAL (Germany) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnb.de/Subsites/nestor/EN/Siegel/siegel.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* ISO 16363 (CRL, CCSDS and PTAB) &lt;ref&gt;https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/652x0m1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (note that this is the successor to TRAC)

Because of the time and resources required by the certification process, information professionals have also developed other models for trustworthiness assessment of digital repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maemura|first1=et al.|title=Organizational assessment frameworks for digital preservation: A literature review and mapping|journal=AIS Review|date=July 2017|volume=68|issue=7|pages=1619–1637|doi=10.1002/asi.23807|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/doi/10.1002/asi.23807/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

==Implementation and impact==
The CRL lays out and oversees the TRAC metrics. To date, CRL has certified six repositories according to criteria set out in the TRAC checklist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crl.edu/archiving-preservation/digital-archives/certification-assessment&lt;/ref&gt; However, its influence has spread far beyond CRL-certified repositories since TRAC is commonly used as a self-auditing tool, such as at the University of North Texas and Cornell University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.unt.edu/digital-libraries/trusted-digital-repository&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinhart|first1=Gail|title=Establishing Trust in a Chain of Preservation The TRAC Checklist Applied to a Data Staging Repository (DataStaR)|journal=DLib|date=September–October 2009|volume=15|issue=9/10|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september09/steinhart/09steinhart.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRAC's successor, ISO 16363, also provides the basis of the services provided by the Primary Trustworthy Digital Repository Authorization Body (PTAB), a private sector agency providing outside auditing services.&lt;ref name="ptab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso16363.org/ |title=PTAB - Primary Trustworthy Digital Repository Authorisation Body Ltd| access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first certification of a repository by PTAB was for the [[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]], completed in January 2018.&lt;ref name="ptab.2018"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iso16363.org/first-repository-in-the-world-has-been-awarded-iso-16363-certification/ |title=First repository in the world has been awarded ISO 16363 certification |last=Giaretta |first=David |date=2018-01-17 |access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these direct successors, TRAC remains among the most influential resource for independent systems of self-audit and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Joyce|title=The rise of digital curation and cyberinfrastructure: From experimentation to implementation and maybe integration|journal=Library Hi Tech|date=2012|volume=30|issue=4|pages=604–622|doi=10.1108/07378831211285086|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maemura|first1=et al.|title=Organizational assessment frameworks for digital preservation: A literature review and mapping|journal=AIS Review|date=July 2017|volume=68|issue=7|pages=1619–1637|doi=10.1002/asi.23807|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/doi/10.1002/asi.23807/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
