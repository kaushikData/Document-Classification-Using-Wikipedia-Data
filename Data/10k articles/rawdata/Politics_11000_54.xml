      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7861">The '''Sidekick data outage of 2009''' resulted in an estimated 800,000 [[smartphone]] users in the [[United States]] temporarily losing personal data, such as emails, address books and photos from their mobile handsets. The [[Server (computing)|computer servers]] holding the data were run by [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="FT_1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Data loss puts cloud on Microsoft |author= |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cce17b14-b78e-11de-9812-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss&amp;nclick_check=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand of phone affected was the [[Danger Hiptop]], also known as the "Sidekick", and were connected via the [[T-Mobile]] cellular network. At the time, it was described as the biggest disaster in [[cloud computing]] history.&lt;ref name="BBC_1"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Sidekick Cloud Disaster |newspaper= |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/10/the_sidekick_cloud_disaster.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SidekickII.jpg|thumb|right|T-Mobile Sidekick 2]]
The Sidekick smartphones were originally produced by [[Danger (company)|Danger, Inc.]], a company that was bought by Microsoft in February 2007. After the acquisition, the former Danger staff were then absorbed into the Mobile Communications Business (MCB) of the Entertainment and Devices Division at Microsoft, where they worked on a future Microsoft mobile phone platform known as ''[[Microsoft Kin|Project Pink]]''.&lt;ref name=Channel_Struggles&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft's Pink Struggles Spill Over To Sidekick |newspaper=ChannelWeb |publisher=[[UBM Channel|UMB]] |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.crn.com/software/220600334;jsessionid=KCFRRMAUPYH2NQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?pgno=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720120730/http://www.crn.com/software/220600334 |archivedate=20 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the ex-Danger employees soon left Microsoft to pursue other things.&lt;ref name=Betanews&gt;{{cite news |title=The Sidekick catastrophe: A curse for Microsoft, but a blessing for Motorola? |newspaper=Betanews |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/The-Sidekick-catastrophe-A-curse-for-Microsoft-but-a-blessing-for-Motorola/1255361704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft took over the running of the data servers, and its data centers were hosting the customers' data at the time it was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danger no backups |author= |newspaper=[[The Inquirer]] |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1558214/danger-backups }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, October 2, 2009, T-Mobile Sidekick phone users started noticing data service outages occurring. The outages lasted approximately two weeks, and on October 10, 2009, T-Mobile announced that personal information stored on Sidekick phones would be permanently lost, which turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="ZDNet_1"&gt;{{cite news |title=T-Mobile Sidekick data outage tests mettle of 800,000 customers, carrier |newspaper=[[ZDNet]] |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/gadgetreviews/?p=8306&amp;tag=col1;post-11306 |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015043932/http://blogs.zdnet.com/gadgetreviews/?p=8306 |archive-date=2009-10-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Financial Times, Microsoft said the data center it acquired from Danger 18 months previously had not been "updated to run on Microsoft technology."&lt;ref name="FT_1"/&gt; A company statement said the mishap was due to ''"a confluence of errors from a server failure that hurt its main and backup databases supporting Sidekick users."''&lt;ref name="BBC_1"/&gt; T-Mobile blamed Microsoft for the loss of data.&lt;ref name="FT_1"/&gt;

The incident caused a public loss of confidence in the concept of [[cloud computing]], which had been plagued by a series of outages and data losses in 2009.&lt;ref name="NW_1"&gt;{{cite news |title=From Sidekick to Gmail: A short history of cloud computing outages |author= |newspaper=[[Network World]] |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101209-sidekick-cloud-computing-outages-short-history.html?hpg1=bn |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615013317/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101209-sidekick-cloud-computing-outages-short-history.html?hpg1=bn |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also was problematic for Microsoft, which at the time was trying to convince corporate clients to use its cloud computing services, such as [[Azure Services Platform|Azure]] and [[My Phone]].&lt;ref name="FT_1"/&gt;

On October 14, 2009, a class action lawsuit was launched against Microsoft and T-mobile. The lawsuit alleged:

&lt;blockquote&gt;T-Mobile and Microsoft promised to safeguard the most important data their customers possess and then apparently failed to follow even the most basic data protection principles.  What they did is unthinkable in this day and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Class Action Suit Filed after T-Mobile and Microsoft Lose Data |newspaper=PR NewsChannel |date=14 October 2009 |url=http://www.prnewschannel.com/absolutenm/templates/?a=1732&amp;z=4 |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018063313/http://www.prnewschannel.com/absolutenm/templates/?a=1732&amp;z=4 |archive-date=2009-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The class action lawsuit was settled in 2011, with affected users compensated with a "$35 T-Mobile gift card, a $17.50 check payment, or up to 12 free downloadable items."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=T-Mobile Sidekick Class Action Settlement |url=http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/992-t-mobile-sidekick-class-action-settlement/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, Microsoft said they had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091015-710685.html |title=UPDATE: Microsoft Says It Has Recovered Lost Sidekick Data |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017225510/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091015-710685.html |archivedate=October 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8309218.stm|title=Microsoft recovers Sidekick data|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft CEO, [[Steve Ballmer]] disputed whether there had been a data loss at all, instead describing it as an outage. Ballmer said, “It is not clear there was data loss". However, he said the incident was "not good" for Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ballmer: Sidekick outage 'not good' |newspaper=[[Network World]] |date=19 October 2009 |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101909-microsoft-balmer-sidekick.html |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615013749/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101909-microsoft-balmer-sidekick.html |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that even before this data loss, Danger had marketed an application for Windows computers which would back up all Sidekick data onto a user's computer and also to allow changes to be made and then re-downloaded to the Sidekick in real-time. Users who had this backup storage option were able to save all of their data. In the United States, T-mobile marketed this application for a one-time charge of $10. Immediately after the data had been restored to all their users, T-mobile incorporated the Sidekick storage website with the regular T-mobile backup site. The application to the user's personal computer, the Danger backup site, and the T-mobile backup site could then be synchronized together.

The '''Accademia della Crusca''' {{IPA-it|akkaˈdɛːmja della ˈkruska|}} ("Academy of the Bran"), generally abbreviated as '''La Crusca''', is an Italian society for scholars and Italian linguists and philologists established in [[Florence]]. It is the most important research institution on the [[Italian language]]&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia|title=The Accademia|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the oldest [[Academy#Linguistic academies|linguistic academy]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/laccademia/storia/primordi-fondazione Informazioni sulle origini] from La Crusca website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accademia was founded in Florence in 1583. It has been characterized by its efforts to maintain the purity of the [[Italian language]].&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/reopening-accademia-1811-and-fifth-edition-vocabolario-1863-1923|title=The reopening of the Accademia (1811) and the fifth edition of the Vocabolario (1863–1923)|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{wiktita|Crusca}}'' means "bran" in Italian, which conveys the metaphor that its work is similar to winnowing as it is well explained by the emblem of the Accademia della Crusca that depicts a [[sifter]] that is straining out corrupt words and structures (as wheat is separated from bran). The academy motto is ''"Il più bel fior ne coglie"'' ('She gathers the fairest flower'), a famous verse of the Italian poet [[Francesco Petrarca]]. In 1612, the ''Accademia'' published the first edition of its Dictionary, the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]'',&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/first-edition-vocabolario-1612|title=The first edition of the Vocabolario (1612)|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also served as the model for similar works in French, Spanish, German and English.&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it"/&gt;

The academy is a member of the European Federation of National Linguistic Institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efnil.org/partners|title=Partner List|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Villa medicea di Castello Facciata (vista frontale).JPG|thumb|left|[[Villa di Castello]], headquarters of the Accademia della Crusca]]
The founders were originally called the ''brigata dei Crusconi'' and constituted a circle composed of poets, men of letters, and lawyers. The members usually assembled on pleasant and convivial occasions, during which ''cruscate'' — discourses in a merry and playful style, which have neither a beginning nor an end — were recited. The Crusconi used humour, satire, and irony to distance itself from the pedantry of the Accademia Fiorentina, protected by Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], and to contrast itself with the severe and classic style of that body. This battle was fought without compromising the primary intention of the group, which was typically literary, and expounded in high quality literary disputes.

The founders of the Accademia della Crusca are traditionally identified as Giovanni Battista Deti (‘Sollo’), [[Antonio Francesco Grazzini]] (‘Lasca’), Bernardo Canigiani (‘Gramolato’), Bernardo Zanchini (‘Macerato’), Bastiano de’ Rossi (‘Inferigno’); they were joined in October 1582 by Lionardo Salviati&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/laccademia/pale/infarinato|title=Infarinato|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('Infarinato') (1540–1589). Under his leadership, at the beginning of 1583, the Accademia took on a new form, directing itself to demonstrate and to conserve the beauty of the Florentine vulgar tongue, modelled upon the authors of the Trecento.&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/origins-and-foundation|title=Origins and foundation|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monosini and the first Vocabolario ===
One of the earliest scholars to influence the work of the Crusca was [[Agnolo Monosini]]. He contributed greatly to the 1612 edition of ''[[Vocabolario della Crusca|Vocabolario della lingua italiana]]'', especially with regard&lt;ref&gt;See online manuscripts in Crusca Biblioteca Digitale&lt;/ref&gt; to the influence of Greek, which, he maintained, made a significant contribution to the Fiorentine idiom of the period.&lt;ref&gt;However, Monosini's key work was the ''[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem]]'' ("The Flower of Italian Language in a new book") published in 1604, in which he collected many vernacular Italian proverbs and Idioms, and compared and contrasted them with Greek and Latin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it2"/&gt;

The Accademia thus abandoned the jocular character of its earlier meetings in order to take up the normative role it would assume from then on. The very title of the Accademia came to be interpreted in a new way: the academicians of the Crusca would now work to distinguish the good and pure part of the language (the ''farina'', or whole wheat) from the bad and impure part (the ''crusca'', or bran). From this is derived the symbolism of the Crusca: its logo shows a ''frullone'' or sifter &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario_inglese/Italiano/F/frullone.shtml|title=Frullone: Traduzione in inglese di Frullone Dizionario inglese Corriere.it|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/location/sala-pale|title=The Sala delle Pale|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Petrarchan motto ''Il più bel fior ne coglie'' (She gathers the fairest flower).&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it3"/&gt; The members of the Accademia were given nicknames associated with corn and flour, and seats in the form of breadbaskets with backs in the shape of bread shovel were used for their meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/second-edition-vocabolario-1623|title=The second edition of the Vocabolario (1623)|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/third-edition-vocabolario-1691|title=The third edition of the Vocabolario (1691)|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1636, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] created the [[Académie française]] on the model of the Accademia della Crusca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.libertaddigital.com/presente-y-pasado/aspectos-de-la-ilustracion-5147/|title=Aspectos de la Ilustración|website=Libertaddigital.com|date=26 August 2009|author=Pío Moa|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beccaria and Verri opposition ===
The [[linguistic purism]] of the Accademia found opposition in [[Cesare Beccaria]] and the Verri brothers ([[Pietro Verri|Pietro]] and [[Alessandro Verri|Alessandro]]), who through their journal ''[[Il Caffè]]'' systematically attacked the Accademia's archaisms as pedantic, denouncing the Accademia while invoking for contrast no less than the likes of Galileo and Newton and even modern intellectual cosmopolitanism itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Italian|author=Alberto Arbasino |url=http://www.arts.ed.ac.uk/italian/gadda/Pages/resources/archive/classics/arbasinogeniuslocii.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415100015/http://www.gadda.ed.ac.uk/Pages/resources/archive/classics/arbasinogeniuslocii.php |archivedate=15 April 2012 | title=Genius Loci |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since [[Galileo]] published his scientific works in his native Florentine Italian, as opposed to the Latin which was customary for academic works of the time, it has also been argued that he implicitly supported the Accademia's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://literaturkritik.de/id/12662|title=Galileo Galileis "Lettera a Cristina di Lorena" auf deutsch übersetzt und reichhaltig kontextualisiert|website=Literaturkritik.de|date=19 January 2009|author=Michael Gamper|language=german|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baroque Period ===
The Accademia's activities carried on with both high- and low- points until 1783, when Pietro Leopoldo quit and, with several other academicians, created the second Accademia Fiorentina. In 1808, however, the third Accademia Fiorentina was founded and, by a decree of 19 January 1811, signed by Napoleon, the Crusca was re-established with its own status of autonomy, statutes and previous aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/fourth-edition-vocabolario-1729-1738-and-suppression-accademia-1783|title=The fourth edition of the Vocabolario (1729–1738) and the suppression of the Accademia (1783)|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accademiadellacrusca.it1"/&gt;

In the 20th century, the decree of 11 March 1923 changed its composition and its purpose. The compilation of the ''Vocabolario'', hitherto the duty of the Crusca, was removed from it and passed to a private society of scholars; the Crusca was entrusted with the compilation of philological texts. In 1955, however, [[Bruno Migliorini]] and others began discussion of the return of the work of preparing the '' Vocabolario'' to the Crusca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/en/accademia/history/accademia-today|title=The Accademia today|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In recent years ===

In 2007, the website E-leo compiling 3,000 drawings and writings of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was launched, with the linguistic help of the Accademia della Crusca to decipher some of the inventor's scribblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/06/eleonardo/|title=Digital Da Vinci Codes: Thousands of Leonardo's papers go online|website=Wired.com|date=21 June 2007|author=Nicole Martinelli|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the existence of the Accademia was threatened when [[Giulio Tremonti]] and [[Silvio Berlusconi]] introduced a proposition to eradicate all  public-funded entities with less than 70 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/08/14/manovra-laccademia-della-crusca-tra-gli-enti-inutili-e-polemica-paradossale/151605/|title=Manovra, l’accademia della Crusca tra gli "enti inutili"? E’ polemica: "Paradossale"|website=Ilfattoquotidiano.it|date=14 August 2011|language=it|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the Accademia's website was defaced by a hacker linked to ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2015/08/09/italia/cronache/hacker-dellisis-allattacco-dellaccademia-delle-crusca-questa-guerra-appena-iniziata-sNlipLpz3qtzyh0YfCR7zK/pagina.html|title=Hacker dell’Isis all’attacco dell’Accademia della Crusca: "Questa guerra è appena iniziata"|website=Lastampa.it|date=9 August 2015|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016,  the Accademia approved the submission of an 8-year old for a new Italian word, ''Petaloso'' (full of petals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.illibraio.it/bambino-inventa-nuova-parola-accademia-crusca-323175/|title=Un bambino inventa una nuova parola: "petaloso".

The '''Atatürkist''' '''''(Kemalist)''''' '''Thought Association''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''Atatürkçü Düşünce Derneği''' or '''ADD''') is a [[secularism|secularist]] organization that espouses [[Kemalism|the ideas of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the founder of modern [[Turkey]]. It was founded by Professor [[Hıfzı Veldet Velidedeoğlu]], Professor [[Muammer Aksoy]] and Associate Professor [[Bahriye Üçok]].

The association is opposed to the [[Islamism|Islamist]] tenets enacted by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in [[Iran]] and wants to ensure that  religion and state remain separate in Turkey. The organization is known for initiating court cases against web sites which insult Atatürk, or with links to sites that insult Atatürk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 13 April 2009, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120927074059/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=172297 ADD moves to ban Google sites for defaming Atatürk]&lt;/ref&gt; It is credited with organising the 2007 [[Republic Protests]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">In [[Marxism]], '''bourgeois nationalism''' is the practice by the [[ruling class]]es of deliberately dividing people by [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], or [[religion]], so as to [[distraction|distract]] them from initiating [[class conflict|class warfare]]. It is seen as a [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] [[strategy]] used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them (hence the Marxist slogan, ''[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]'').

[[File:Leonid Brezhnev Portrait (1).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonid Brezhnev]]]]
After the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] government based its [[Nationality|nationalities]] policy ([[korenization]]) on the principles of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. According to these principles, all nations should disappear with time, and [[nationalism]] was considered a [[bourgeois]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100886.html Khiterer, V. (2004) 'Nationalism in the Soviet Union'], in ''Encyclopedia of Russian History'',  Macmillan Reference USA&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Report on the 50th anniversary of the formation of the [[USSR]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]] emphasized: "That is why Communists and all fighters for socialism believe that the main aspect of the national question is unification of the working people, regardless of their national origin, in the common battle against every type of oppression, and for a new social system which rules out exploitation of the working people."&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Brezhnev, ''The 50th Anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'', Moscow, 1972, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:LiuShaoqi_Colour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liu Shaoqi]]]]
''Bourgeois nationalism'' as a concept was discussed in China by [[Liu Shaoqi]] as follows:
{{quote|The exploitation of wage labour, competition, the squeezing out, suppressing and swallowing of rivals among the capitalists themselves, the resorting to war and even world war, the utilisation of all means to secure a monopoly position in its own country and throughout the world - such is the inherent character of the profit-seeking bourgeoisie. This is the class basis of bourgeois nationalism and of all bourgeois ideologies. [...]
The most vicious manifestations of the development of bourgeois nationalism include the enslavement of the colonial and semi-colonial countries by the imperialist powers, the First World War, the aggression of Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese warlords during the Second World War, and the schemes for the enslavement of the whole world undertaken by the international imperialist camp, headed by American imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaoqi|first1=Liu|title=Internationalism and Nationalism|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/liu-shaoqi/1952/internationalism_nationalism/ch01.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''British Ladies' Football Club''' was an all-woman football team formed in the United Kingdom in 1885. The team had as its patron [[Lady Florence Dixie]], an aristocrat from [[Dumfries]], and its first captain was [[Nettie Honeyball]] (real name likely Mary Hutson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Honeyballers: Women who fought to play football|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24176354|website=BBC News|date=26 September 2013|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's first public match took place at [[Crouch End]], London on 23 March 1895, between teams representing 'The North' and 'The South'. The North won 7–1 in front of an estimated 11,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=LFM&gt;{{cite news|title=Ladies' Football Match|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000183/18950325/062/0006|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=The Standard|place=London|date=25 March 1895|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical perspective ==
Until the 19th century, women's participation in football was limited to folk rituals linked with marriage customs. In Inverness, for example, single women would annually play a match with married women, whilst prospective husbands watched from the sidelines.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;Seddon, P. (2004) ''Football Talk: The Language &amp; Folklore of the World's Greatest Game'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7N3iYWotTPYC&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 156] Robson. {{ISBN|1861056834}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The first record of a woman's team coming together to play football occurred on 9 May 1881, at Edinburgh's [[Easter Road Stadium]]. The match was billed as a Scotland v England international and featured [[Mrs Graham's XI]].&lt;ref name=BTF&gt;Domeneghetti, R. (2014) ''From the Back Page to the Front Room: Football's journey through the Englismedia'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lmWLBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PT155#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 155] Ockley Books. {{ISBN|1783015586}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GwB&gt;Tate, T.

Just over a week later, on 20 May 1881,&lt;ref name=GwB/&gt; the teams played in Glasgow in front of a crowd of 5,000. This match had to be abandoned following a violent pitch invasion during which the women were "roughly ", and chased by a mob as they left the grounds.&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; Further games resulted in similar pitch invasions, which soon resulting in ending this early attempt to introduce women's football.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

It is uncertain, from the coverage of the time, what the pitch invasions were in protest against. However, the press tone, which would dominate coverage of women's football for the next century, was clearly established in 1881: barely disguised contempt regarding player appearance, including costume, and the standard of play,&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; overlaid with a certainty that football was a rough man's game unsuitable for women.&lt;ref name=UB&gt;Laycock, S. &amp; Laycock, P.

== Reception ==
The club divided into a north and south team and on 23 March 1895, 10,000{{refn|name=note1|group=notes|Variously reported in newspapers at the time as up to 11,000&lt;ref name=LFM/&gt;}} spectators watched the inaugural game at [[Crouch End]], London. Unlike in the matches of 1881, players no longer had to wear corsets&lt;ref name=TLF/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} and high-heeled boots, but acquired standard man's boots in suitable sizes. They still had to wear bonnets, with the game being stopped if any woman headed the ball and it dislodged either bonnet or hairpin which had to be replaced before the game could resume.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

The reaction was generally one of being heckled by the crowd, and press censure,&lt;ref name=SAS&gt;Mangan, J.A. &amp; Nauright, J. (2013) ''Sport in Australasian Society: Past and Present'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=164sBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 134] Routledge {{ISBN|1136332243}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; bordering on derision.&lt;ref name=VFM/&gt;

Despite this, the club went on tour, sponsored by Lady Dixie,&lt;ref name=AGRG/&gt; and in the following two years played some 100 exhibition matches.&lt;ref Name=VFM/&gt; The tour attracted great publicity from the press, though not entirely restricted to the sport as, at the time, women playing football was intricately linked to the [[Women's rights|'Rights question']].&lt;ref name=AGRG/&gt;

The strain of playing so often took its toll, and by September 1896 the ladies could only field a few players. They were also broke, and arriving in [[Exeter]] found they had insufficient funds to either leave or pay their hotel bill. Appeals to the mayor of Exeter fell on deaf ears and he refused to pay. The ladies had to be rescued by friends, and the activities of the club came to an end.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

Women's football once again fell into obscurity until the [[First World War]], when [[Lloyd George]] required women to work in factories whilst the men were at the front. On Christmas Day, 1916, the first recorded match between factory organised women's teams, occurred in [[Ulverston]], Cumbria.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

Nettie Honeyball was well aware of the political ramifications, telling an interviewer that:

::''There is nothing of the farcical nature about the British Ladies' Football Club. I founded the association late last year, with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess my convictions on all matters, where the sexes are so widely divided, are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.''&lt;ref name=TLF/&gt;{{rp|25}}

A '''building code''' (also '''building control''' or '''building regulations''') is a set of rules that specify the standards for constructed objects such as [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure]]s. Buildings must conform to the code to obtain [[planning permission]], usually from a local council. The main purpose of building codes is to protect [[public health]], safety and general welfare as they relate to the construction and occupancy of buildings and structures.  The building code becomes [[law]] of a particular jurisdiction when formally [[enactment of a bill|enacted]] by the appropriate governmental or private authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=danQCwAAQBAJ|title=Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2015 International Building Code|last=Ching|first=Francis D.

Building codes are generally intended to be applied by [[architect]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[interior designer]]s, constructors and [[regulatory agency|regulators]] but are also used for various purposes by [[fire safety inspector|safety inspectors]], [[environmental scientist]]s, [[real estate developer]]s, subcontractors, manufacturers of building products and materials, [[insurance]] companies, facility managers, [[leasehold estate|tenants]], and others. Codes regulate the design and construction of structures where adopted into law.

Examples of building codes began in ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |title=Hammurabi's Code of Laws |date= |publisher= |accessdate=2008-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509192326/http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA the main codes are the [[International Building Code|International Commercial or Residential Code [ICC/IRC]]], electrical codes and plumbing, mechanical codes.

The practice of developing, approving, and enforcing building codes varies considerably among nations.  In some countries building codes are developed by the government agencies or quasi-governmental [[standards organizations]] and then enforced across the country by the [[central government]]. Such codes are known as the '''national building codes''' (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide application).

In other countries, where the power of regulating construction and fire [[safety]] is vested in [[local authorities]], a system of [[model building code]]s is used. Model building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative orders. When referenced in any of these legal instruments, a particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as ''adoption by reference''. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any portions of the [[model building code|model code]] adopted, it is usually required by the [[model building code|model code]] developer to follow a formal adoption procedure in which those modifications can be documented for legal purposes.

There are instances when some [[local authorities|local jurisdictions]] choose to develop their own building codes. At some point in time all major cities in the [[United States]] had their own building codes. However, due to ever increasing complexity and cost of developing building regulations, virtually all municipalities in the country have chosen to adopt [[model building code|model codes]] instead. For example, in 2008 New York City abandoned its proprietary ''1968 New York City Building Code'' in favor of a customized version of the [[International Building Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml NYC Construction Codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702014751/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml |date=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardnewyork.com/building-code/|title=Building Code|last=|first=|date=|website=Vanguard New York|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of [[Chicago]] remains the only [[municipality]] in America that continues to use a building code the city developed on its own as part of the ''[[Municipal Code of Chicago]]''.

In Europe, the [[Eurocode]] is a pan-European building code that has superseded the older national building codes.  Each country now has National Annexes to localize the contents of the Eurocode.

Similarly, in [[India]], each municipality and urban development authority has its own building code, which is mandatory for all construction within their jurisdiction. All these local building codes are variants of a [http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm National Building Code], which serves as model code proving guidelines for regulating building construction activity.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Building codes have a long history. The earliest known written building code is included in the [[Code of Hammurabi]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which dates from circa 1772 BC.

The book of [[Deuteronomy]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] stipulated that [[parapet]]s must be constructed on all houses to prevent people from falling off.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, which had been able to spread so rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city, the [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] was passed in the same year as the first significant building regulation.&lt;ref&gt;'Charles II, 1666: An Act for rebuilding the City of London.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819), pp. 603–12. URL: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47390 british-history.ac.uk], date accessed: 08 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawn up by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]], the Act regulated the rebuilding of the city, required housing to have some fire resistance capacity and authorised the [[City of London Corporation]] to reopen and widen roads.&lt;ref&gt;'Book 1, Ch. 15: From the Fire to the death of Charles II', A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 230–55. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46732. Date accessed: 07 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laws of the Indies]] were passed in the 1680s by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] to regulate the urban planning for colonies throughout Spain's worldwide imperial possessions.

The first systematic national building standard was established with the London Building Act of 1844. Among the provisions, builders were required to give the district surveyor two days' notice before building, regulations regarding the thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of [[chimney]]s, [[fireplace]]s and [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] were to be enforced and streets had to be built to minimum requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npt.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=478|title=A Brief History of Building Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Buildings Office]] was formed to regulate the construction and use of buildings throughout London. Surveyors were empowered to enforce building regulations, which sought to improve the standard of houses and business premises, and to regulate activities that might threaten public health. In 1855 the assets, powers and responsibilities of the office passed to the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]].

The City of [[Baltimore]] passed its first building code in 1859. The [[Great Baltimore Fire]] occurred in February, 1904. Subsequent changes were made that matched other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore: The Building of an American City, Sherry H. Olson, Published 1997, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (Md.), {{ISBN|0-8018-5640-X}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, a Handbook of the Baltimore City Building Laws was published. It served as the building code for four years. Very soon, a formal building code was drafted and eventually adopted in 1908.

In Paris, under the reconstruction of much of the city under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire (1852–70)]], great blocks of apartments were erected&lt;ref name="New International Encyclopedia"&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the height of buildings was limited by law to five or six stories at most.

== Scope ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Hageman, Jack M., and Brian E. P. Beeston. ''Contractor's guide to the building code''. 6th ed. Carlsbad, CA: Craftsman Book Co., 2008. 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Harry J., and Richard Peck. ''Housing and local government: a research guide for policy makers and planners''. Lexington, Mass. u.a.: Lexington Books, 1974. 53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Building codes generally include:
* Standards for structure, placement, size, usage, wall assemblies, fenestration size/locations, egress rules, size/location of rooms, foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures/assemblies, energy efficiency, stairs and halls, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site drainage &amp; storage, appliance, lighting, fixtures standards, occupancy rules, and swimming pool regulations.
* Rules regarding [[parking]] and [[traffic]] impact
* [[Fire code]] rules to minimize the risk of a fire and to ensure safe evacuation in the event of such an emergency[citation needed]
* Requirements for [[earthquake]] ([[seismic code]]), [[hurricane]], [[flood]], and [[tsunami]] resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large buildings where a failure would be catastrophic{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of flammable substances, or housing a large number of people)
* Energy provisions and consumption
* [[Grandfathering]] provisions: Unless the building is being renovated, the building code usually does not apply to existing buildings.
* [[Specification]]s on components
* Allowable installation methodologies
* Minimum and maximum room and exit sizes and location
* Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work
* For high structures, anti-collision markers for the benefit of aircraft

Building codes are generally separate from [[zoning]] ordinances, but exterior restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.

Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these standards at the site during construction.

There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that have more specific requirements that apply to [[dwelling]]s or places of business and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, [[pedestrian]] walkways, [[parking lot]]s, and radio and [[television antenna]]s.

== Current Codes ==
===Energy codes in the United States===

The energy codes of the United States are adopted at the state and municipal levels and are based on the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC). Previously, they were based on the Model Energy Code (MEC).

As of March 2017, the following residential codes have been partially or fully adopted by states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcapcodes.org/code-status/residential/|title=Residential Code Status {{!}} The Building Codes Assistance Project|website=bcapcodes.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2012 IECC or equivalent (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas)
* 2009 IECC or equivalent (Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin)
* 2006 IECC or equivalent (Utah)

A consultation in 2006 showed strong support for it to be mandatory, rather than voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/carbon-emissions/index.htm Consultation on measures to reduce carbon emissions in the large non-energy intensive business and public sectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531221939/http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/carbon-emissions/index.htm |date=2007-05-31 }}, ''[[DEFRA]]'', published 2006-12-13, accessed 2007-05-23&lt;/ref&gt; The Commitment was introduced under enabling powers in Part 3 of the [[Climate Change Act 2008]].&lt;ref name="2007EWP" /&gt; A consultation into the scheme's implementation was launched in June 2007.&lt;ref name="DEFRA-CRC" /&gt; The Scheme is being introduced under the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme Order 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statutory Instrument]] 2010/768&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance league table==
The first performance league table was published on 8 November 2011. It was based on the scheme's early action metric, which is a measure of good energy management prior to the establishment of an energy baseline.&lt;ref&gt;http://crc.environment-agency.gov.uk/pplt/web/plt/public/2010-11/CRCPerformanceLeagueTable20102011&lt;/ref&gt; In the future the table will use a growth and an absolute metrics from this baseline. The table is expected to be particularly useful to ethical and green investors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a43ddae8-00b3-11e1-8590-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1dCFFgPaW&lt;/ref&gt; Many notable brands are listed in the League table including the big four supermarkets, [[Asda]] (37), [[Morrisons]] (56), [[Tesco]] (93), and [[Sainsburys]] (164).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/134754.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In all 22 organisations shared first position, news stories focused on the fact that [[Manchester United Football Club]] was one of those at the top of the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/08/manchester-united-energy-efficiency | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Manchester United tops energy efficiency league table | date=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corpcommsmagazine.co.uk/news/1824-man-united-tops-energy-efficiency-league-table&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/comment/the-crc-not-yet-a-premier-league-45214&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been announced that after July 2013, these league and performance tables will no longer be published, and will instead be replaced by a publication of participants' energy use and emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/guides/carbon-footprinting-and-reporting/crc-carbon-reduction-commitment | title=CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme | publisher=The Carbon Trust|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==
The CRC scheme will apply to organisations that have a half-hourly metered electricity consumption greater than 6,000 [[MWh]] per year. Organisations qualifying for CRC would have all their energy use covered by the scheme, including emissions from direct energy use as well as electricity purchased.&lt;ref name="2007EWP"&gt;[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=286525&amp;NewsAreaID=2 2007 Energy White Paper: Meeting the Energy Challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930170847/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=286525&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |date=2007-09-30 }}, ''[[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]'', published 2007-05-23, accessed 2007-05-25&lt;/ref&gt; Such organisations - including hotel chains, supermarkets, banks, central government and large [[Local government in the United Kingdom|Local Authorities]] - mostly fall below the threshold for the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], but account for around 10% of the UK [[carbon emissions]]. Emissions covered by the EU Energy Trading Scheme and by a Climate Change Agreement would be exempt from the CRC, as would organisations with more than 25% of their emissions covered by [[Climate Change Agreement]]s.&lt;ref name="2007EWP" /&gt;

[[MPAN#PC|Half-hourly meters]] (HHM) record electricity consumption for every half-hour of every day, and generally provide this data to the supplier automatically via a telephone connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfenergy.com/products-services/large-business/PDF/MBC-FS-HHM-002-1009.pdf Half-hourly metering terms explained], factsheet from [[EDF Energy]]. Retrieved 2010-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisations with high annual energy consumption do not use HHM, as their supplies are mainly on unrestricted or [[Economy 7]] (day/night or 'evening and weekend') tariffs. However, they may nevertheless have to provide 'footprint reports'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/116646.aspx Meters and metering], Environment Agency. Retrieved 2010-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating mechanisms==
Although mandatory, the CRC will involve self-certification of emissions, backed up by spot audits, as opposed to third-party verification. Emission allowances are to be auctioned rather than [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] (as was the case in the initial stages of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme). The original proposal envisaged a revenue recycling mechanism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/business/crc/index.htm implementation proposals for the Carbon Reduction Commitment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626091712/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/business/crc/index.htm |date=2007-06-26 }}, [[DEFRA]], published 2008-03-13, accessed 2008-04-05&lt;/ref&gt; however this was removed to support the public finances after the comprehensive spending review. The Government announced in the budget the allowance price of £12/tCO2 for the first sale. They have also suggested there should be two fixed price sales in the first year of the scheme.

==Simplification==
On 30 June 2011 the Government announced its initial proposals on simplifying the scheme. This came from the dialogue process the Department of Energy and Climate Change had been running from January, which was in response to the concerns of those organisations participating in the scheme that it was overly complex and this made compliance difficult and costly. The draft legislative proposals will be published in early 2012 for formal public consultation which will amend the existing CRC scheme. Among these proposals will be,  continuing the fixed price sale (rather than auctions of allowances in a capped system) into the second phase, as recommended by the Committee on Climate Change, provide business with greater flexibility by allowing organisations to participate as natural business units, reducing the number of the fuels which are subject to the scheme from 30 to 4, removing the complex 90% rule and CCA exemption rules, whilst achieving broadly the same outcomes) and reducing overlap with other government schemes such as EU Emission Trading Scheme and Climate Change Agreements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/wms_300611/wms_300611.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
It has been suggested that the effectiveness of the CRC is limited by its overlap with the EU ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kahya|first=Damian|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12649143|title=BBC News - Carbon tax 'may not reduce CO2'|publisher=BBC News |date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that as companies reduce their electricity consumption, power stations produce less electricity and so require fewer [[EU Allowances]]; other entities covered by the ETS are then able to use these allowances for their own emissions. It has been suggested that allowances should be removed from the ETS in accordance with electricity reductions made under the CRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonretirement.com/content/maximising-efficiency-crc|title=Carbon Retirement report: Maximising the efficiency of the CRC|date=2011-03-03|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Polizia di Stato]], one of Italy's other main [[law enforcement]] agencies, the Carabinieri are a military force ([[Guardia di Finanza]], another law enforcement agency in Italy is military too). As the fourth branch of the [[Italian Armed Forces]], they come under the authority of the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of Defence]]. In practice, there is a significant overlap between the jurisdiction of the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri, who are contacted on separate emergency telephone numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28254297|publisher=BBC News|title=It's 200 years old, but what is Italy's carabinieri?|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Polizia di Stato, the Carabinieri have responsibility for policing the military, and a number of members regularly participates in military missions abroad.

Carabinieri have policing powers that can be exercised at any time and in any part of the country, and they are always permitted to carry their assigned weapon as personal equipment ([[Beretta 92|Beretta 92FS]] pistol). It was originally founded as the police force of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the forerunner of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].  During the process of [[Italian unification]], it was appointed the "First Force" of the new national military organisation.  Although the Carabinieri assisted in the suppression of opposition during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]], they were also responsible for his downfall and many units were disbanded during [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]], which resulted in large numbers of Carabinieri joining the [[Italian resistance movement]].  Since 2001, it has been one of the four [[Italian Armed Forces]].

==History==
===Early history===
Inspired by the French [[Gendarmerie]], the corps was created by King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy|Victor Emmanuel I]] of [[Savoy]] with the aim of providing the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] with a police corps. Previously, police duties were managed by the ''Dragoni di Sardegna Corps,'' created in 1726 and composed of volunteers. After French soldiers had occupied [[Turin]] at the end of the 18th century and later abandoned it to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont]], the Royal Carabinieri Corps was instituted under the Royal Patents of 13 July 1814.&lt;ref name=cab/&gt;

The name derives from the French word ''carabinier'', meaning "[[soldier]] armed with a [[carbine]]."&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymological Dictionary |url="https://www.etymonline.com/word/carabinieri"&lt;/ref&gt;

The new force was divided into divisions on the scale of one division for each province. The divisions were further divided into companies and subdivided into lieutenancies, which commanded and coordinated the local police stations and were distributed throughout the national territory in direct contact with the public.&lt;ref name=cab/&gt;
[[File:Carb1875.jpg|thumb|Photo of a Carabiniere around 1875. The 'Medal of Italian Independence' is worn, indicating a veteran of the [[Risorgimento]] (The Wars for Italian Unification).]]
In 1868, the ''[[Corazzieri]]''  mounted division was formed – initially as an escort of honour for the sovereign, and since 1946 for the President of the Republic.&lt;ref name=cab/&gt; The Italian unification saw the number of divisions increased,&lt;ref name=cab/&gt; and on 24 January 1861 the ''Carabinieri'' were appointed the "First Force" of the new national military organization.&lt;ref name=cab/&gt;

In May 1915 Italian troops marched to encompass [[South Tyrol]], territory of their former allies the  [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], in the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Fronte italiano]] campaign. The defenders had sufficient time to prepare strong fortifications there, and in the [[Carso]] [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]] to the east, and the Italian regiments, under overall command of [[Luigi Cadorna|General Cadorna]], found themselves repeatedly repulsed in harsh fighting. The role of the Carabinieri was to act as [[barrier troops]], setting up machine gun posts to control the rear of the attacking regiments and prevent desertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Mark|title=The White War|year=2009|publisher=Faber|location=London|isbn=978-0-5712-2334-3|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and 1940s===
During the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922–1943), the Carabinieri were one of the police forces entrusted with suppressing opposition in Italy.&lt;ref name="collab"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZQlNLN3YXQC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=carabinieri+collaboration+mussolini |title=The Oxford illustrated history of Italy - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19|isbn=9780198205272|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, while part of the [[Italian Africa Police]] (mainly in the late 1930s), they were involved in atrocities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html |title=Massacres and Atrocities of WWII in the Axis Countries |publisher=Members.iinet.net.au |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194232/http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html# |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/petros2_abuna.html |title=Pétros, Ethiopia, Orthodox |publisher=Dacb.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-U7aydmefrgC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=carabinieri+ethiopia |title=The history of Ethiopia - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19|isbn=9780313322730|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vCb_nQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=carabinieri+ethiopia+%22Addis+Ababa%22 |title=Haile Selassie's war - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-01-01|accessdate=2009-09-19|isbn=9781902669533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/ethiopian_patriots/ethiopian_patriots_4.html |title=The Pankhurst History Library |publisher=[[Link Ethiopia]] |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706001537/http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/ethiopian_patriots/ethiopian_patriots_4.html |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in colonial [[Italian East Africa]] during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. During [[World War II]] they fought in their function as military police against the Allied forces, and against [[Yugoslav partisans]] as part of the Italian occupation force in [[Yugoslavia]].

After [[25 Luglio|Mussolini's fall]] on 25 July 1943, he was arrested by the Carabinieri as he left the [[Villa Ada|king's private residence]] in Rome and subsequently imprisoned on [[Campo Imperatore]] by Carabinieri forces. After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice between Italy and the Allies on 3 September 1943]] and the country's split into the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] in the north and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the south, the Carabinieri split into two groups. In southern Italy the Carabinieri Command for Liberated Italy was founded in Bari, mobilizing new units for the Italian war of liberation. These units were attached to the Italian Liberation Corps and the six Italian Combat Groups of the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]], fighting with the Allied forces. In northern Italy the fascist regime organized the [[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]] (composed of Carabinieri, former colonial policemen,  [[Guardia di Finanza]] and customs police), to employ it as a military police and rapid-deployment anti-guerilla force. GNR was later joined (but not taken over) by the [[Black Brigades]] which should have represented a new militant incarnation of the Fascist party.

Due to the role the Carabinieri had played in the downfall of Mussolini, and since one of the few units which fought the German occupation of Rome were the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]] regiments and the II Carabinieri cadet battalion, the Germans did not view the Carabinieri as loyal to the fascist cause{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and ordered the disbanding of all Carabinieri units in Axis-controlled territory on 7 October 1943. As German forces subsequently began to arrest and deport members of the Carabinieri to Germany for [[forced labour]], large numbers of Carabinieri joined the [[Italian resistance movement]]. After the war the Carabinieri counted at least 2,735 fallen and 6,500 wounded, out of approximately 14,000 who had joined the Resistance in northern and central Italy. In Yugoslavia the Carabinieri formed a battalion of the Italian partisan [[Garibaldi Division]], which fought alongside the Yugoslav partisans against [[Wehrmacht|German]] and [[Ustaše|Croatian Ustaše Forces]]. The battalion lost over 80% of its members in combat and was awarded the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]] to commemorate the fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Curiosita/Non+tutti+sanno+che/R/21+R.htm |title=Arma dei Carabinieri - Home - L'Arma - Curiosità - Non tutti sanno che... - R |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milhist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/MilitaryOperations/ |title=Arma dei Carabinieri - Home - &gt; - EN - Military Operations |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable act of heroism in this era came from Vice [[Brigadier#Italy|Brigadiere]] [[Salvo D'Acquisto]], who was executed by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in Palidoro (near [[Rome]]) during World War II. D'Acquisto exchanged his life for the lives of citizens due to be executed in retaliation for the killing of a German soldier; instead, he claimed responsibility and was executed for the offence.

===Present day===
[[File:Alfa-Romeo159-Carabinieri-di-Roma.JPG|thumb|[[Alfa Romeo 159]]]]
Until 2000, the Carabinieri were part of the [[Italian Army]]. On 31 March 2000, they were separated to become the fourth branch of the Italian Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=cab/&gt;

In recent years Carabinieri units have been dispatched on [[peacekeeping]] missions, including [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2003, 12 Carabinieri [[2003 Nasiriyah bombing|were killed in a suicide bombing]] on their base in [[Nasiriyah]], near [[Basra]] in southern Iraq, in the largest Italian military loss of life in a single action since the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/arma/ieri/storia/vista-da-2015/fascicolo-43/la-strage-di-nassiriya |title=Arma dei Carabinieri - La strage di Nassiriya |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Sea Island Conference of the [[G8]] in 2004, Carabinieri were given a mandate to establish a [[Centre of Excellence for Stability Police Units]] to spearhead the development of training and doctrinal standards for civilian police units attached to international peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;Formed Police Units Workshop and

[[File:Carabinieri eng.png|thumb|Structure Specialist &amp; Mobile Units Command]]
The corps is headed by the ''{{lang|it|Comando}}'', consisting of the ''[[Commandant-general#Italy|Comandante Generale]]'' (a [[General]]), the ''{{lang|it|Vice-Comandante Generale}}'' ( a [[Lieutenant General]]) and the Chief of Staff, all located in [[Rome]]. The Chief of Staff directs, coordinates and supervises all activities of the force. It directly supervises the Directors of Administration, Health, Engineering, the motor pool and the Veterinary Commission. On the Deputy Chiefs of Staff depend the National Center for Recruitment and Selection, the Administration National Center and the Legislation Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Oggi/Reparti/Organizzazione+Centrale/ |title=Organizzazione Centrale |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227104549/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Oggi/Reparti/Organizzazione%2BCentrale/ |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Territorial Organization ==
The Carabinieri are organised on a territorial basis for law-enforcement missions. The territorial organization represents the core of the institution; it contains 80 percent of the force and is organized hierarchically in five inter-regional commands, 19 regional commands and 102 provincial commands, 504 Company Commands and approximately 5000 Station Commands (one or more for each Italian city). The territorial organization includes exceptionally a special force unit (100 military employees): Elliported Squadron "Hunters of Calabria", exclusively used against the kidnapping and predominantly Calabrian mafia.

== Specialist and Mobile Units Command Organization ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--only last sentence has a citation--&gt;
Outside the territorial organisation, the Specialist and Mobile Units Command ''Palidoro'' ({{lang|it|Comando delle Unità Mobili e Specializzate "Palidoro"}}, based in Rome) controls the [[Carabinieri Mobile Units Division]], the [[Carabinieri Specialist Units Division]] and the [[Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale|ROS]].

=== Carabinieri Specialist Units Division ===
{{see also|Carabinieri Specialist Units Division}}
The [[Carabinieri Specialist Units Division]] is the Carabinieri formation, established in 2001, dedicated to the performance of specialist police activities and the support to Territorial Organization. The Division directs, controls, and coordinates its own units, which carry out tasks related to the protection of Italian artistic heritage, to the currency protection, to the protection of Italian embassies abroad, to the health protection, to the labour policing, to Bank of Italy needs, to the Carabinieri forensics police services. In addition, the Division provides Carabinieri air support.

=== Mobile Units Division===
{{see also|Carabinieri Mobile Units Division}}
The [[Carabinieri Mobile Units Division]] is located in [[Rome]] and has two brigades tasked with mass manoeuvres during emergencies, defending the nation and participating in military operations abroad. It supports [[public order]] and territorial control in urban areas, and contributes to the operations of civil authorities in terms of public safety. 1st Mobile Brigade, whose headquarter is located in Rome and includes six Regiments e four Battalions mainly employed in public order tasks. 2nd Mobile Brigade headquartered in Livorno includes the [[Gruppo di Intervento Speciale]]  special forces group, the [[1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment "Tuscania"]], and the 7th "Trentino-Alto Adige" and 13th "Friuli-Venezia Giulia" regiments, which are mainly engaged in international missions.

=== Special forces===
{{see also|Gruppo di Intervento Speciale}}
The [[Gruppo di Intervento Speciale]] in one of the four [[Italian special forces]].

=== ROS ===
The ROS (''[[Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale]]'' or Special Operational Group) is an elite unit founded in 1990 to deal with [[organised crime]] ([[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] and others), subversive activities, [[terrorism]] and more complex types of crime. An anti-crime section is found in every city and district public prosecutor's office.

===Special Tasks Departments===
[[File:2june2006 374.jpg|thumb|Corazzieri]]
Special Tasks Departments are outside the ordinary organisational framework and are used for special missions:
''[[Corazzieri]]'' ([[Cuirassier]]s) are an elite corps and honour guard of the [[President of the Italian Republic]], located in the [[Quirinal Palace]]. They are distinguished by their uniforms and height (the minimum height for admission is {{convert|1.9|m|ftin|abbr=on|disp=or}}). They have almost no other everyday duties, although they may be seen patrolling occasionally. Other departments are in service to constitutional bodies such as the Presidency of the Republic, the Senate, Parliament, the Judiciary, the [[Prime Minister]] and the National Council of Economy and Labour. Carabinieri also perform [[military police]] and security duties for the Ministry of Defence, military high commands, the offices of the military judiciary and allied military organisations in Italy and abroad. They also have personnel attached to the [[Polizia di Stato|Department of Public Security]] in various departments, as well as anti-Mafia and anti-drug investigative task forces. ''Carabinieri'' officers are charged with surveillance and security at Italian embassies and consulates abroad, performing the same services entrusted to the [[Marine Corps Embassy Security Group]] in United States diplomatic and consular offices.

Together with the [[Polizia di Stato]] and the [[Guardia di Finanza]], the Carabinieri is also responsible for [[border control]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/List%20of%20national%20services%20responsible%20for%20border%20control.pdf List of national services responsible for border control]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Command Unit for environmental, agri-food and forestry protection===
The specialized [[Comando unità per la tutela forestale, ambientale e agroalimentare]] has headquarter located in Rome and organized in 15 regional command and approximately 700 Station Commands on the territory. It counts 7,000 personnel involved in contrast of illicit agri-foodstuffs, environmental and biodiversity protection, contrast to poaching, contrast to all criminal organizations that, with their activity, affect the environment. In the Unit there are also 29 NOE (Nucleo Operativo Ecologico), nucleus highly specialized in complex investigations in environmental matters against organized crime.

==War service==
[[File:2june2006 134.jpg|thumb|1st Paratroopers [[Carabinieri Regiment "Tuscania"]]]]
The main battles in which the Carabinieri took part before World War I are:

From 1943 to 1945, the Carabinieri were accountable to the Control Commission of the [[Allied Military Government]] (AMGOT). Their reorganization and reform was organized by Colonel [[Arthur Young (police officer)|Arthur Young]], a British [[police officer]] seconded as Director of Public Safety and Director of Security.

==Uniforms==
[[File:2june 2007 035d.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Dress uniform]]
[[File:Arma dei Carabinieri female officer.jpg|thumb|A female carabiniere in uniform]]
The Carabinieri were issued a distinctive uniform in black with silver braid around the collar and cuffs, edges trimmed in scarlet and epaulettes in silver. The mounted division had white fringes, and the infantry had light blue. Their headgear was a distinctive
[[bicorne]], popularly called the ''lucerna'' (in use only for historical uniform and ceremonies).&lt;ref name=cab&gt;{{cite web|title=The ancient Corps of the Royal Carabinieri|accessdate=2009-05-20|publisher=Carabinieri|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/HistoricalReferences/01_EN.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They still use a version of the historic uniform today for ceremonies.&lt;ref name=cab/&gt;

==Vehicles and equipment==
Until very recently the Italian police (including the ''Carabinieri'') operated only Italian-made vehicles, but that changed with the introduction of [[Land Rover Defender]]s and [[Subaru]]s into service. Normal ''Carabinieri'' patrol vehicles are dark blue with a white roof, with a red stripe along the side. Carabinieri license plates begin with "CC" or previously with "EI" (formerly Esercito Italiano, Italian Army), and a Carabinieri car is traditionally called a ''Gazzella'' ([[gazelle]]). Small or medium-sized cars are used for ordinary patrol work, with larger and more powerful vehicles being used for emergency response, highway patrol, and special services. The vehicles of the ''Carabinieri'' military police and mobile units are painted in NATO camouflage scheme as done with the other Italian Armed Forces vehicles.

[[File:WWIchartX.svg|350px|thumb|European diplomatic alignments shortly before the war. Note: Germany and the Ottoman Empire only formed an alliance shortly following the outbreak of the war.]]
[[File:WWI-re.png|thumb|350px|Map of the world with the [[participants in World War I]] in 1917. Allies are in green, the Central Powers in orange and neutral countries in grey.]]

The '''causes of World War I''' remain controversial. [[World War I]] began in the [[Balkans]] in late July 1914 and [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|ended in November 1918]], leaving [[World War I casualties|17 million dead and 20 million wounded]].

Scholars looking at the long-term seek to explain why two rival sets of powers – Germany and Austria-Hungary on the one hand, and Russia, France, and Great Britain on the other – had come into conflict by 1914. They look at such factors as political, territorial and economic conflicts, [[militarism]], a complex web of alliances and alignments, [[imperialism]], the growth of [[nationalism]], and the power vacuum created by the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]]. Other important long-term or structural factors that are often studied include unresolved [[territorial dispute]]s, the perceived breakdown of the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Evera |first=Stephen |title=The Cult of the Offensive and the Origins of the First World War |journal=International Security |date=Summer 1984 |volume=9 |issue=1 |p=62 |jstor=2538636 |doi=10.2307/2538636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Fritz |title=War of illusions: German policies from 1911 to 1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=owZoAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA69 |year=1975 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |page=69 |isbn=978-0-3930-5480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; convoluted and fragmented [[governance]], the [[arms race]]s of the previous decades, and [[military planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sagan |first=Scott D. |title=1914 Revisited: Allies, Offense, and Instability |journal=International Security |date=Fall 1986 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pp=151–175 |jstor=2538961 |doi=10.2307/2538961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars doing short-term analysis focused on the summer of 1914 ask if the conflict could have been stopped, or whether it was out of control. The immediate causes lay in decisions made by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis|July Crisis of 1914]]. This crisis was triggered by the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] by a [[Bosnian Serb]] who had been supported by a nationalist organization in [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name="Henig2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henig |first=Ruth |authorlink=Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig |title=The Origins of the First World War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67iTFLWcsqQC |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-85200-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis escalated as the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia came to involve Russia, Germany, France, and ultimately [[Belgium]] and Great Britain. Other factors that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent (e.g., the German belief that Britain would remain neutral), fatalism that war was inevitable, and the speed of the crisis, which was exacerbated by delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications.

The crisis followed a series of diplomatic clashes among the [[Great Powers]] ([[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[British Empire|Britain]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) over European and [[colonialism|colonial issues]] in the decades before 1914 that had left tensions high. In turn, these public clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lieven |first=D. C. B. |authorlink=Dominic Lieven |title=Russia and the Origins of the First World War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALhrHQAACAAJ |year=1983 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-69611-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensus on the origins of the war remains elusive since historians disagree on key factors, and place differing emphasis on a variety of factors. This is compounded by changing [[Historical revisionism|historical arguments over time]], particularly the delayed availability of classified historical archives. The deepest distinction among historians is between those who focus on the actions of Germany and Austria-Hungary as key and those who focus on a wider group of actors. Secondary fault lines exist between those who believe that Germany deliberately planned a European war, those who believe that the war was ultimately unplanned but still caused principally by Germany and Austria-Hungary taking risks, and those who believe that either all or some of the other powers, namely Russia, France, Serbia and Great Britain, played a more significant role in causing the war than has been traditionally suggested.

== Polarization of Europe, 1887–1914 ==
To understand the long term origins of the war in 1914, it is essential to understand how the powers formed into two competing sets sharing common aims and enemies. These two sets became, by August 1914, Germany and Austria-Hungary on one side and Russia, France, Serbia and Great Britain on the other.

=== German re-alignment to Austria-Hungary and Russian re-alignment to France, 1887–1892 ===

In 1887 German and Russian alignment was secured by means of a secret [[Reinsurance Treaty]] arranged by [[Otto von Bismarck]]. However, in 1890 the treaty was allowed to lapse in favor of the [[Dual Alliance (1879)]] between Germany and Austria-Hungary. This development was attributed to [[Leo von Caprivi|Count Leo von Caprivi]], the [[Prussia]]n general who replaced Bismarck as chancellor. It is claimed that the new chancellor recognized a personal inability to manage the European system as his predecessor had and so he was counseled by contemporary figures such as [[Friedrich von Holstein]] to follow a more logical approach as opposed to Bismarck's complex and even duplicitous strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Imperial Germany|last=Jefferies|first=Matthew|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781409435518|location=Oxon|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the treaty with Austria-Hungary was concluded despite the Russian willingness to amend the Reinsurance Treaty and sacrifice a provision referred to as the "very secret additions"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that concerned the [[Turkish Straits|Straits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacFie|first=A. L.|date=1983|title=The Straits Question in the First World War, 1914-18|jstor=4282922|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=43–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Caprivi's decision was also driven by the belief that the Reinsurance Treaty was no longer needed to ensure Russian neutrality in case France attacked Germany and it would even preclude an offensive against France.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon|last=Gardner|first=Hall|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781472430564|location=Burlington, VT|pages=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking a capacity for Bismarck's strategic ambiguity, the new chancellor pursued a policy that was oriented towards "getting Russia to accept Berlin's promises on good faith and to encourage St. Petersburg to engage in a direct understanding with Vienna, without a written accord."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 1892, the Dual Alliance was expanded to include Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change|last=Bideleux|first=Robert|last2=Jeffries|first2=Ian|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=978-0415161114|location=London|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Russia secured in the same year the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], a strong military relationship that was to last until 1917. This move was prompted by the Russian need for an ally since, during this period, it was experiencing a major famine and a rise in anti-government revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This alliance was gradually built through the years starting from the time Bismarck refused the sale of Russian bonds in Berlin, which drove Russia to the Paris capital market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Europe 1850-1914: Progress, Participation and Apprehension|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781405801348|location=London|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began the expansion of Russian and French financial ties, which eventually helped elevate the Franco-Russian entente to the diplomatic and military arenas.

Von Caprivi's strategy appeared to work when, during the outbreak of the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908, it demanded that Russia step back and demobilize, which it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ANZACs in Arkhangel|last=Challinger|first=Michael|publisher=Hardie Grant Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781740667517|location=Melbourne|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Germany asked Russia again in a later conflict, Russia refused, which finally helped precipitate the war.

=== French distrust of Germany ===
{{Main|French entry into World War I}}
Some of the distant origins of World War I can be seen in the results and consequences of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870-1871 and the concurrent [[unification of Germany]]. Germany had won decisively and established a powerful [[German Empire|Empire]], while France fell into chaos and military decline for years. A legacy of animosity grew between France and Germany following the German annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. The annexation caused widespread resentment in France, giving rise to the desire for revenge, known as [[revanchism]]. French sentiments were based on a desire to avenge military and territorial losses and the displacement of France as the preeminent continental military power.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Mayeur, and Madeleine Rebirioux, ''The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871–1914'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Bismarck was wary of French desire for revenge; he achieved peace by isolating France and balancing the ambitions of Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. During his later years, he tried to placate the French by encouraging their overseas expansion. However, anti-German sentiment remained.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Gooch, ''Franco-german relations, 1871-1914'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

France eventually recovered from its defeat, paid its war indemnity, and rebuilt its military strength again. But the French nation was smaller than Germany in terms of population and industry, and thus many French felt insecure next to a more powerful neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewitson | first1 = Mark | year = 2000 | title = Germany and France before the First World War: a reassessment of Wilhelmine foreign policy | url = | journal = English Historical Review | volume = 115 | issue = 462| pages = 570–606 | doi=10.1093/ehr/115.462.570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1890s the desire for revenge over Alsace-Lorraine no longer was a major factor for the leaders of France, but it remained a force in general public opinion.  [[Jules Cambon]], the French ambassador to Berlin (1907-1914), worked hard to secure a détente but French leaders decided Berlin was trying to weaken the Triple Entente and was not sincere in seeking peace.  The French consensus was that war was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;John Keiger, ''France and the Origins of the First World War'' (1985) p 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British alignment towards France and Russia, 1898–1907: The Triple Entente ===

After Bismarck's removal in 1890, French efforts to isolate Germany became successful. With the formation of the [[Triple Entente]], Germany began to feel encircled.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel R. Williamson Jr., "German Perceptions of the Triple Entente after 1911: Their Mounting Apprehensions Reconsidered" ''Foreign Policy Analysis'' 7#2 (2011): 205-214.&lt;/ref&gt; The French foreign minister, [[Théophile Delcassé]] went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain. Key markers were the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907, which became the [[Triple Entente]]. This informal alignment with Britain and formal alliance with Russia against Germany and Austria eventually led Russia and Britain to enter World War I as France's allies.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 345, 403–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Gooch, ''Before the war: studies in diplomacy'' (1936), chapter on Delcassé pp 87-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain abandoned its [[Splendid Isolation|"splendid isolation]]" policy in the 1900s after having been isolated during the [[Boer War]]. Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with its two major colonial rivals: the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France in 1904 and the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907. Some historians see Britain's alignment as principally a reaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the buildup of its navy from 1898 that led to the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strachan |first=Hew |title=The First World War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZHITOPMf4gC |year=2005|isbn=9781101153413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Spender, ''Fifty years of Europe: a study in pre-war documents'' (1933) pp 212-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other scholars, most notably [[Niall Ferguson]], argue that Britain chose France and Russia over Germany because Germany was too weak an ally to provide an effective counterbalance to the other powers and could not provide Britain with the imperial security achieved by the entente agreements.{{sfnp|Ferguson|1999}} In the words of British diplomat [[Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock|Arthur Nicolson]], it was "far more disadvantageous to us to have an unfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany".{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=324}} Ferguson argues that the British government rejected German alliance overtures "not because Germany began to pose a threat to Britain, but, on the contrary because they realized she did not pose a threat".{{sfnp|Ferguson|1999|p=53}} The impact of the Triple Entente was therefore twofold, to improve British relations with France and her ally Russia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany. It was "not that antagonism toward Germany caused its isolation, but rather that the new system itself channeled and intensified hostility towards the German Empire".{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=159}}

The Triple Entente involving Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] between Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], was not an alliance of mutual defence, and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. As [[British Foreign office|British Foreign Office]] official [[Eyre Crowe]] minuted: "The fundamental fact of course is that the ''Entente'' is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the ''Entente'' is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=K.A.|editor-last=Hinsley |editor-first=F.H. |title=British Foreign Policy Under Sir Edward Grey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 |year=1977 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-21347-9 |page=324 |chapter=Great Britain and France, 1911–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of diplomatic incidents between 1905 and 1914 heightened tensions between the Great Powers and reinforced the existing alignments, beginning with the First Moroccan Crisis.

=== First Moroccan Crisis, 1905–06: Strengthening the Entente ===

The [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (also known as the Tangier Crisis) was an international dispute between March 1905 and May 1906 over the status of Morocco. The crisis worsened German relations with both France and the United Kingdom, and helped ensure the success of the new Anglo-French Entente Cordiale. In the words of historian [[Christopher Clark]], "The Anglo-French Entente was strengthened rather than weakened by the German challenge to France in Morocco".{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=157}}

=== Bosnian Crisis, 1908: Worsening relations of Russia and Serbia with Austria-Hungary ===
{{Main|Bosnian crisis}}

In 1909 Austria-Hungary announced its annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], dual provinces in the [[Balkan]] region of Europe formerly under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Though Bosnia and Herzegovina were still nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary had administered the provinces since the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, when the great powers of Europe awarded it the right to occupy the two provinces, with the legal title to remain with Turkey. The announcement in October 1908 of Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina upset the fragile balance of power in the Balkans, enraging Serbia and pan-Slavic nationalists throughout Europe. Though weakened Russia was forced to submit, to its humiliation, its foreign office still viewed Austria-Hungary's actions as overly aggressive and threatening. Russia's response was to encourage pro-Russian, [[anti-Austrian sentiment]] in Serbia and other Balkan provinces, provoking Austrian fears of Slavic expansionism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Spender, ''Fifty years of Europe: a study in pre-war documents'' (1933) pp 297-312&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agadir crisis in Morocco, 1911===
{{Main|Agadir crisis}}
[[File:French troops in Morocco during the Agadir Crisis, March 30, 1912.jpg|thumb|250px|French troops in Morocco, 1912]]

Imperial rivalries pushed France, Germany and Britain to compete for control of Morocco, leading to a short-lived war scare in 1911. In the end, France established a protectorate over Morocco that increased European tensions. The [[Agadir Crisis]] resulted from the deployment of a substantial force of French troops into the interior of Morocco in April 1911. Germany reacted by sending the gunboat [[SMS Panther|SMS ''Panther'']] to the Moroccan port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. The main result was deeper suspicion between London and Berlin, and closer military ties between London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, ''The war that ended peace'' pp 438-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falls | first1 = Nigel | year = 2007 | title = The Panther at Agadir | url = | journal = History Today | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 33–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased fear and hostility drew Britain closer to France rather than Germany. British backing of France during the crisis reinforced the Entente between the two countries (and with Russia as well), increasing Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would erupt in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney B. Fay, "The Origins of the World War"  (2nd ed. 1930): 1:290-93.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of internal British jousting, the crisis was part of a five-year struggle inside the British cabinet between radical isolationists and the Liberal Party's imperialist interventionists. The interventionists sought to use the Triple Entente to contain German expansion. The radicals obtained an agreement for official cabinet approval of all initiatives that might lead to war. However, the interventionists were joined by the two leading Radicals, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. Lloyd George's famous "Mansion House speech" of 21 July 1911 angered the Germans and encouraged the French. By 1914 the interventionists and Radicals had agreed to share responsibility for decisions culminating in the declaration of war, and so the decision was almost unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaylani | first1 = Nabil M. | year = 1975 | title = Liberal Politics and British-Foreign-Office 1906-1912-Overview | url = | journal = International Review of History and Political Science | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 17–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly for the events of August 1914, the crisis led British foreign secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] and France to make a secret naval agreement by which the [[Royal Navy]] would protect the northern coast of France from German attack, while France concentrated her fleet in the western Mediterranean and agreed to protect British interests there. France was thus able to guard her communications with her North African colonies, and Britain to concentrate more force in home waters to oppose the [[German High Seas Fleet]]. The cabinet was not informed of this agreement until August 1914. Meanwhile, the episode strengthened the hand of Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], who was calling for a greatly increased navy and obtained it in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Spender, ''Fifty years of Europe: a study in pre-war documents'' (1933) pp 329-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italo-Turkish War: Abandonment of the Ottomans, 1911–12 ===

In the [[Italo-Turkish War]] or Turco-Italian War Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in North Africa in 1911-12.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Askew, ''Europe and Italy's Acquisition of Libya, 1911–1912'' (1942) [https://www.questia.com/read/3044731/europe-and-italy-s-acquisition-of-libya-1911-1912 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Italy easily captured the important coastal cities but its army failed to advance far into the interior.  Italy captured the Ottoman [[Tripolitania Vilayet]] (province), of which the most notable sub-provinces (sanjaks) were [[Fezzan]], [[Cyrenaica]], and [[Tripoli]] itself. These territories together formed what became known as [[Italian Libya]]. The main significance for the First World War was that this war made it clear that no Great Power appeared to wish to support the Ottoman Empire any longer and this paved the way for the [[Balkan Wars]]. Christopher Clark stated: "Italy launched a war of conquest on an African province of the Ottoman Empire, triggering a chain of opportunistic assaults on Ottoman territories across the Balkans. The system of geographical balances that had enabled local conflicts to be contained was swept away."   {{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=242}}

=== Balkan Wars, 1912–13: Growth of Serbian and Russian power ===
The Balkan Wars were two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, was defeated in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its holdings in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, was weakened as a much-enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.

The Balkan Wars in 1912–1913 increased international tension between the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary. It also led to a strengthening of Serbia and a weakening of the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, who might otherwise have kept Serbia under control, thus disrupting the balance of power in Europe in favor of Russia.

Russia initially agreed to avoid territorial changes, but later in 1912 supported Serbia's demand for an Albanian port. The [[London Conference of 1912–13]] agreed to create an independent [[Albania]]; however both Serbia and Montenegro refused to comply. After an Austrian, and then an international, naval demonstration in early 1912 and Russia's withdrawal of support, Serbia backed down. Montenegro was not as compliant and on May 2, the Austrian council of ministers met and decided to give Montenegro a last chance to comply and, if it would not, then to resort to military action. However, seeing the Austrian military preparations, the Montenegrins requested the ultimatum be delayed and complied.{{sfnp|Williamson|1991|pp=125–140}}

The Serbian government, having failed to get Albania, now demanded that the other spoils of the First Balkan War be reapportioned, and Russia failed to pressure Serbia to back down. Serbia and Greece allied against Bulgaria, which responded with a preemptive strike against their forces, beginning the Second Balkan War.{{sfnp|Williamson|1991|pp=143-145}} The Bulgarian army crumbled quickly when Turkey and Romania joined the war.

The Balkan Wars strained the German/Austro-Hungarian alliance. The attitude of the German government to Austrian requests of support against Serbia was initially both divided and inconsistent. After the German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912, it was clear that Germany was not ready to support Austria-Hungary in a war against Serbia and her likely allies.

In addition, German diplomacy before, during, and after the Second Balkan War was pro-Greek and pro-Romanian and in opposition to Austria-Hungary's increasingly pro-Bulgarian views. The result was tremendous damage to Austro-German relations. Austrian foreign minister [[Leopold von Berchtold]] remarked to German ambassador [[Heinrich von Tschirschky]] in July 1913 that "Austria-Hungary might as well belong 'to the other grouping' for all the good Berlin had been".{{sfnp|Williamson|1991|pp=147-149}}

In September 1913, it was learned that Serbia was moving into Albania and Russia was doing nothing to restrain it, while the Serbian government would not guarantee to respect Albania's territorial integrity and suggested there would be some frontier modifications. In October 1913, the council of ministers decided to send Serbia a warning followed by an ultimatum: that Germany and Italy be notified of some action and asked for support, and that spies be sent to report if there was an actual withdrawal. Serbia responded to the warning with defiance and the Ultimatum was dispatched on October 17 and received the following day. It demanded that Serbia evacuate Albanian territory within eight days. Serbia complied, and the Kaiser made a congratulatory visit to Vienna to try to fix some of the damage done earlier in the year.{{sfnp|Williamson|1991|pp=151-154}}

By this time, Russia had mostly recovered from its defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the calculations of Germany and Austria were driven by a fear that Russia would eventually become too strong to be challenged. Their conclusion was that any war with Russia had to occur within the next few years in order to have any chance of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wohlforth |first=William C. |title=The Perception of Power: Russia in the Pre-1914 Balance |journal=[[World Politics]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=353–381 |date=April 1987 |url=http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/wohlwforth%20perceptions%20of%20power%20russia.pdf |jstor=2010224 |doi=10.2307/2010224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Franco-Russian Alliance changes: The Balkan inception scenario, 1911–1913 ===

The original Franco-Russian alliance was formed to protect both France and Russia from a German attack. In the event of such an attack both states would mobilize in tandem, placing Germany under the threat of a two-front war. However, there were limits placed on the alliance so that it was essentially defensive in character.

Throughout the 1890s and the 1900s the French and the Russians made clear the limits of the alliance did not extend to provocations caused by the others' adventurous foreign policy. For example, Russia warned France that the alliance would not operate if the French provoked the Germans in North Africa. Equally, the French insisted to the Russians that they should not use the alliance to provoke Austria-Hungary or Germany in the Balkans, and that France did not recognise in the Balkans a vital strategic interest for France or for Russia.

In the last 18 to 24 months before the outbreak of the war, this changed. At the end of 1911 and particularly during the Balkan wars themselves in 1912–13, the French view changed. France now accepted the importance of the Balkans to Russia. Moreover, France clearly stated that if, as a result of a conflict in the Balkans, war were to break out between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, France would stand by Russia. Thus the Franco-Russian alliance changed in character, and by a consequence of that Serbia became a security salient for Russia and France. As they bought into the future scenario of a war of Balkan inception, regardless of who started such a war, the alliance would respond nonetheless. It would view this conflict as a [[casus foederis]]: as a trigger for the alliance. Christopher Clark described this change as "a very important development in the pre-war system which made the events of 1914 possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |first=Christopher |last=Clark |title=Europe: Then and Now |publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies l |date=17 April 2014 |minutes=26-27 |via=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMPprNYRzs4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Liman von Sanders "Affair" 1913-14===

This was a crisis caused by the appointment of a German officer, [[Liman von Sanders]] to command the Turkish First Army Corps guarding Constantinople, and the subsequent Russian objections.
The “Liman von Sanders Affair,” began on November 10, 1913, when the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Sazonov, instructed the Russian ambassador in Berlin, Sergei Sverbeev, to tell the Germans that the von Sanders mission, would be regarded by Russia as an “openly hostile act.” In addition to threatening Russia's foreign trade, half of which flowed through the Turkish straits, the mission raised the possibility of a German-led Turkish assault on Russia's Black Sea ports and imperilled Russian plans for expansion in eastern Anatolia.

Liman's appointment brought a storm of protest from Russia, who suspected German designs on the Ottoman capital.  A compromise arrangement was subsequently agreed whereby Liman was appointed to the rather less senior (and less influential) position of Inspector General in January 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/liman.htm|title=First World War.com - Who's Who - Otto Liman von Sanders|website=www.firstworldwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the crisis, Russia's weakness in military power prevailed. The Russians could not rely upon their financial means as a tool for foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the First World War|last=Mulligan|first=William|publisher=University Printing House|year=2017|isbn=978-1-316-61235-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglo-German détente, 1912–14 ===

Historians caution that, taken together, the preceding crisis should not be seen as an argument that a European war was inevitable in 1914.

Significantly, the Anglo-German Naval Race was over by 1912. In April 1913, Britain and Germany signed an agreement over the African territories of the [[Portuguese empire]] which was expected to collapse imminently. Moreover, the Russians were threatening British interests in Persia and India to the extent that in 1914, there were signs that the British were cooling in their relations with Russia and that an understanding with Germany might be useful. The British were "deeply annoyed by St Petersburg's failure to observe the terms of the agreement struck in 1907 and began to feel an arrangement of some kind with Germany might serve as a useful corrective."{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=324}}

British Diplomat Arthur Nicolson wrote in May 1914, “Since I have been at the Foreign Office I have not seen such calm waters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bang! Europe At War.|last=Martin|first=Connor|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-1366291004|location=United Kingdom|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian irredentists, 28 June 1914 ===

On 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], were shot dead, by two gun shots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bang! Europe At War.|last=Martin|first=Connor|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781389913839|location=United Kingdom|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sarajevo by [[Gavrilo Princip]], one of a group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by [[Danilo Ilić]], a Bosnian Serb and a member of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] secret society.

The assassination is significant because it was perceived by Austria-Hungary as an existential challenge to her and in her view provided a [[casus belli]] with Serbia. The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph was aged 84, so the assassination of his heir, so soon before he was likely to hand over the crown, was seen as a direct challenge to Austrian polity. Many ministers in Austria, especially Berchtold, argue this act must be avenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bang! Europe At War.|last=Martin|first=Connor|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781389913839|location=United Kingdom|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Archduke, who had been a decisive voice for peace in the previous years, had now been removed from the discussions. The assassination triggered the [[July Crisis]], which turned a local conflict into a European, and then a worldwide, war.

=== Austria edges towards war with Serbia ===

The assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], the heir apparent to the Austrian throne, sent deep shockwaves through Austrian elites, and the murder has been described as a "9/11 effect, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna.”   It gave free rein to elements clamouring for war with Serbia, especially in the Army&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark 2014"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Month of Madness |first=Christopher |last=Clark |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t7p27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It quickly emerged that three leading members of the assassination squad had spent long periods of time in Belgrade, had only recently crossed the border from Serbia, and were carrying weapons and bombs of Serbian manufacture. They were secretly sponsored by the Black Hand, whose objectives included the liberation of all Bosnian Slavs from Austrian rule, and masterminded by the Head of Serbian Military intelligence, [[Dragutin Dimitrijević|Apis]].

Two days after the assassination, Foreign Minister Berchtold and the Emperor agreed that the “policy of patience” with Serbia was at an end. Austria feared that if she displayed weakness, their neighbours to the South and East would be emboldened, whereas war with Serbia would put to an end the problems the dual monarchy had experienced with Serbia. Chief of Staff [[Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]] stated of Serbia: ”If you have a poisonous adder at your heel, you stamp on its head, you don’t wait for the bite.”   &lt;ref name="Christopher Clark 2014"/&gt;

There was also a feeling that the moral effects of military action would breathe new life into the exhausted structures of the Habsburg monarchy, restoring it to the vigour and virility of an imagined past, and that Serbia must be dealt with before it became too powerful to defeat militarily.&lt;ref name="Sked"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sked |first=Alan |title=The Decline and Fall of the Habsburg Empire: 1815 - 1918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqhnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA254 |year=1989 |publisher=Addison-Wesley Longman |isbn=978-0-582-02530-1 |page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal voices for peace in previous years included Franz Ferdinand himself. His removal not only provided the [[casus belli]] but removed one of the most prominent doves from policymaking.

Since taking on Serbia involved the risk of war with Russia, Vienna sought the views of Berlin. The Germans provided their unconditional support for war with Serbia, the so-called "Blank Cheque.” Buoyed up by German support the Austrians began drawing up an ultimatum, giving the Serbs forty-eight hours to respond to ten demands. The Austrians hoped that the ultimatum would be rejected in order to provide the pretext for war with a neighbour they considered to be impossibly turbulent.

[[Samuel R. Williamson, Jr.]] has emphasized the role of Austria-Hungary in starting the war. Convinced Serbian nationalism and Russian Balkan ambitions were disintegrating the Empire, Austria-Hungary hoped for a limited war against Serbia and that strong German support would force Russia to keep out of the war and weaken its Balkan prestige.{{sfnp|Williamson|1991|pp=}}

At this stage in the crisis the possibility of determined Russian support for Serbia, and its attendant risks,  was never properly weighed up. The Austrians remained fixated on Serbia but did not decide on their precise objectives other than war.&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark 2014"/&gt;

Nevertheless, having decided upon war with German support, Austria was slow to act publicly, and did not deliver the ultimatum until July 23, some three weeks after the assassinations on 28 June. Thus Austria lost the reflex sympathies attendant to the Sarajevo murders and gave the further impression to the Entente powers that Austria was merely using the assassinations as a pretext for aggression.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|pp=402-403}}

=== "Blank Cheque" — Germany supports Austria-Hungary, 6 July ===

On July 6 Germany provided its unconditional support to its ally Austria-Hungary in its quarrel with Serbia – the so-called "blank cheque”. In response to a request for support, Vienna was told the Kaiser's position was that, if Austria-Hungary  "recognised the necessity of taking military measures against Serbia he would deplore our not taking advantage of the present moment which is so favourable to us...we might in this case, as in all others, rely upon German support”{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bang! Europe At War.|last=Martin|first=Connor|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-1366291004|location=United Kingdom|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thinking was as Austria-Hungary was Germany's only ally, if its prestige was not restored then its position in the Balkans might be irreparably damaged, encouraging further irredentism by Serbia and Romania.{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=70}}  A quick war against Serbia would not only eliminate her, but also probably lead to further diplomatic gains vis a vis Bulgaria and Romania. A Serbian defeat would also be a defeat for Russia and reduce her influence in the Balkans.

The benefits were clear but there were risks, namely that Russia would intervene and this would lead to a continental war. However, this was thought even more unlikely since the Russians had not yet finished their French-funded rearmament programme scheduled for completion in 1917. Moreover, they did not believe that Russia, as an absolute monarchy, would support regicides, and more broadly “the mood across Europe was so anti-Serbian that even Russia would not intervene.”  Personal factors also weighed heavily and the German Kaiser was close to the murdered Franz Ferdinand and was affected by his death, to the extent that German counsels of restraint vis a vis Serbia in 1913 changed to an aggressive stance.{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=73}}

On the other hand, the military thought that if Russia did intervene then St Petersburg clearly desired war and now would be a better time to fight, when Germany had a guaranteed ally in Austria-Hungary, Russia was not ready and Europe was sympathetic to them. On balance, at this point in the crisis, the  Germans anticipated that their support would mean the war would be a localised affair between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. This would be particularly true if Austria moved quickly, "while the other European powers were still disgusted over the assassinations and therefore likely to be sympathetic to any action Austria-Hungary took”.{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=74}}

===  France backs Russia, 20–23 July ===

French President Raymond Poincaré arrived in St. Petersburg for a long-scheduled state visit on 20 July and departed on 23 July. The French and the Russians agreed their alliance extended to supporting Serbia against Austria, confirming the already established policy behind the Balkan inception scenario. As Christopher Clark notes "Poincare had come to preach the gospel of firmness and his words had fallen on ready ears. Firmness in this context meant an intransigent opposition to any Austrian measure against Serbia. At no point do the sources suggest that Poincare or his Russian interlocutors gave any thought whatsoever to what measures Austria-Hungary might legitimately be entitled to take in the aftermath of the assassinations".{{sfnp|Clark|2013|pp=449–450}}

On 21 July, the Russian Foreign Minister warned the German ambassador to Russia that "Russia would not be able to tolerate Austria-Hungary's using threatening language to Serbia or taking military measures." The leaders in Berlin discounted this threat of war. German foreign minister [[Gottlieb von Jagow]] noted “there is certain to be some blustering in St. Petersburg.” German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] told his assistant that Britain and France did not realize that Germany would go to war if Russia mobilized. He thought London saw a German "bluff" and was responding with a "counterbluff."&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Jarausch, "The Illusion of Limited War: Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's Calculated Risk," ''Central European History'' 2#1 (1969), pp. 48-76 at p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;   Political scientist [[James Fearon]] argues from this episode that the Germans believed Russia were expressing greater verbal support for Serbia than they would actually provide, in order to pressure Germany and Austria-Hungary to accept some Russian demands in negotiation. Meanwhile, Berlin was downplaying its actual strong support for Vienna so as to not appear the aggressor, for that would alienate German socialists.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Fearon, "Rationalist explanations for war." ''International organization'' 49#3 (1995): 379-414 at pp 397-98.

===Austria-Hungary presents ultimatum to Serbia, 23 July===

On 23 July, Austria-Hungary, following their own enquiry into the assassinations, sends an ultimatum to Serbia, containing their demands, giving forty-eight hours to comply.

=== Russia mobilises — The Crisis escalates, 24–25 July ===

On 24–25 July the Russian Council of Ministers met, and in response to the crisis and despite the fact that she had no alliance with Serbia, agreed to a secret partial mobilisation of over one million men of the Russian Army and the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. It is worth stressing, since this is a cause of some confusion in general narratives of the war, that this was done prior to the Serbian rejection of the ultimatum, the Austrian declaration of war on 28 July or any military measures taken by Germany. As a diplomatic move this had limited value since the Russians did not make this mobilisation public until 28 July.

The arguments used to support this move in the Council of Ministers were:

* The crisis was being used as a pretext by the Germans to increase their power
* Acceptance of the ultimatum would mean that Serbia would become a protectorate of Austria
* Russia had backed down in the past  – for example in the Liman von Sanders affair and the Bosnian Crisis – and this had encouraged the Germans rather than appeased them
* Russian arms had recovered sufficiently since the disasters of 1904–06

In addition Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] believed that war was inevitable and refused to acknowledge that Austria-Hungary had a right to counter measures in the face of Serbian irredentism. On the contrary, Sazonov had aligned himself with the irredentism, and expected the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Crucially, the French had provided their clear support for their Russian allies for a robust response in their recent state visit just days before. Also in the background was Russian anxiety of the future of the Turkish straits – "where Russian control of the Balkans would place Saint Petersburg in a far better position to prevent unwanted intrusions on the Bosphorus” {{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=486}}

The policy was intended to be a mobilisation against Austria-Hungary only. However, due to Russian incompetence, the Russians realised by 29 July that partial mobilisation was not militarily possible, and as it would interfere with general mobilisation, only full mobilisation could prevent the entire operation being botched. The Russians therefore moved to full mobilisation on 30 July.

Christopher Clark stated "It would be difficult to overstate the historical importance of the meetings of 24 and 25 July"{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=475}} and "In taking these steps, [Russian Foreign Minister] Sazonov and his colleagues escalated the crisis and greatly increased the likelihood of a general European war. For one thing, Russian pre-mobilization altered the political chemistry in Serbia, making it unthinkable that the Belgrade government, which had originally given serious consideration to accepting the ultimatum, would back down in the face of Austrian pressure. It heightened the domestic pressure on the Russian administration...it sounded alarm bells in Austria-Hungary. Most importantly of all, these measures drastically raised the pressure on Germany, which had so far abstained from military preparations and was still counting on the localisation of the Austro-Serbian conflict."{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=480}}

=== Serbia rejects the ultimatum, Austria declares war on Serbia 25–28 July ===

Serbia initially considered accepting all the terms of the Austrian ultimatum before news from Russia of pre mobilisation measures stiffened their resolve.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=463}}

The Serbs drafted their reply to the ultimatum in such a way as to give the impression of making significant concessions but, as Christopher Clark states "In reality, then, this was a highly perfumed rejection on most points”.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=466}}  In response to the rejection of the ultimatum, Austria immediately broke off diplomatic relations on 25 July and declared war on 28 July.

=== Russia — general mobilisation is ordered, 29–30 July ===

On July 29, 1914, the Tsar ordered full mobilization, then changed his mind after receiving a telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm. Partial mobilization was ordered instead.  The next day, the Tsar's foreign minister, Sergey Sazonov once more persuaded Nicholas of the need for general mobilization, and the order was issued that day, July 30

Christopher Clark states: "The Russian general mobilisation was one of the most momentous decisions of the July crisis. This was the first of the general mobilisations. It came at the moment when the German government had not yet even declared the State of Impending War"{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=509}}

Why did Russia do this?

* In response to the Austrian declaration of war on 28 July.
* The previously ordered partial mobilisation was incompatible with a future general mobilisation
* Sazonov's conviction that Austrian intransigence was Germany's policy, and therefore given that Germany was driving Austria, there was no longer any point in mobilising against Austria only
* France reiterated her support for Russia, and there was significant cause to think that Britain would also support Russia {{sfnp|Clark|2013|pp=510-511}}

=== German mobilisation and war with Russia and France, 1–3 August ===

On 28 July, Germany learned through its spy network that Russia had implemented its "Period Preparatory to War".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Germans assumed that Russia had, after all, decided upon war and that her mobilisation put Germany in danger.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} This was doubly so because German war plans, the so-called [[Schlieffen Plan]], relied upon Germany to mobilise speedily enough to defeat France first (by attacking largely through neutral Belgium) before turning to defeat the slower-moving Russians.

Christopher Clarke states: "German efforts at mediation – which suggested that Austria should “Halt in Belgrade” and use the occupation of the Serbian capital to ensure its terms were met – were rendered futile by the speed of Russian preparations, which threatened to force the Germans to take counter–measures before mediation could begin to take effect" {{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=525}}

Thus, in response to Russian mobilisation,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Germany ordered the state of Imminent Danger of War (SIDW) on 31 July, and when the Russian government refused to rescind its mobilisation order, Germany mobilised and declared war on Russia on 1 August. Given the Franco-Russian alliance, countermeasures by France were, correctly, assumed to be inevitable and Germany therefore declared war on France on 3 August 1914.

===Britain declares war on Germany, 4 August 1914 ===

Following the German invasion of neutral Belgium, Britain issued an ultimatum to Germany on 2 August that she must withdraw or face war. The Germans did not comply and Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914.

Britain's reasons for declaring war were complex. The ostensible reason given was that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the [[Treaty of London 1839]]. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the ''casus belli'' and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war.

Strategic risk posed by German control of the Belgian and ultimately French coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war behavior were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian neutrality. However, the Treaty of London of 1839 had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) in the event of war with Germany.

Rather Britain's relationship with her Entente partners, both France and Russia, were equally significant factors. [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] argued that the secret naval agreements with France (although they had not been approved by the Cabinet) created a moral obligation vis a vis Britain and France.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=544}}

What is more, in the event that Britain abandoned its Entente friends, it was feared that if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, Britain would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to attack.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=544}}

British Foreign office mandarin Eyre Crowe stated:

''"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the Mediterranean?"'' {{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=544}}

Domestically, the Liberal Cabinet was split and in the event that war was not declared the Government would fall as [[Prime Minister Asquith]], [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] and [[Winston Churchill]] made it clear they would resign. In that event, the existing Liberal Cabinet would lose their jobs. Since it was likely the pro-war Conservatives would be elected to power this would lead to a slightly belated British entry into the war in any event, so wavering Cabinet ministers were also likely motivated by the desire to avoid senselessly splitting their party and sacrificing their jobs.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=545}}

== Domestic political factors ==

=== German domestic politics ===
Left-wing parties, especially the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), made large gains in the [[German election, 1912|1912 German election]]. German government at the time was still dominated by the [[Prussian Junkers]] who feared the rise of these left-wing parties. [[Fritz Fischer]] famously argued that they deliberately sought an external war to distract the population and whip up patriotic support for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Fritz |authorlink=Fritz Fischer |title=Germany's Aims in the First World War |url=https://archive.org/details/FischerFritzGermanysAimsInTheFirstWorldWar |year=1967 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one German military leader Moritz von Lynker, the chief of the military cabinet, favored war in 1909 because it was "desirable in order to escape from difficulties at home and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hull |first=Isabel V. |title=The Entourage of Kaiser Wilhelm II, 1888-1918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pesmqV6vskkC&amp;pg=PA259 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-53321-8 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Conservative Party leader Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa suggested that "a war would strengthen patriarchal order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neiberg |first=Michael S. |title=The World War I Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zof_mkPPJzgC&amp;pg=PA309 |year=2007 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-5833-5 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors argue that German conservatives were ambivalent about a war, worrying that losing a war would have disastrous consequences, and even a successful war might alienate the population if it were lengthy or difficult.{{sfnp|Ferguson|1999|p=}} Scenes of mass "war euphoria" were often doctored for propaganda purposes, and even those scenes which were genuine would not be reflective of the general population;  many German people at the time complained of a need to conform to the euphoria around them, which allowed later Nazi propagandists to "foster an image of national fulfillment later destroyed by wartime betrayal and subversion culminating in the alleged ''[[Dolchstoss]]'' (stab in the back) of the army by socialists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lebow |first1=Richard Ned |title=Forbidden Fruit: Counterfactuals and International Relations |date=2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1400835127 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XpCYr9f2QagC&amp;pg=PA70 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The drivers of Austro-Hungarian policy===

The argument that Austro-Hungary was a moribund political entity, whose disappearance was only a matter of time, was deployed by hostile contemporaries to suggest that the empire's efforts to defend its integrity during the last years before the war were in some sense illegitimate.{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=68}}

Clark states: "Evaluating the prospects of the Austo-Hungarian empire on the eve of the first world war confronts us in an acute way with the problem of temporal perspective....The collapse of the empire amid war and defeat in 1918 impressed itself upon the retrospective view of the Habsburg lands, overshadowing the scene with auguries of imminent and ineluctable decline."{{sfnp|Clark|2013|pp=77-78}}

It is true that in Austro-Hungary, the political scene of the last decades before the war were increasingly dominated by the struggle for national rights among the empire's eleven official nationalities – German, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ruthenians, Poles and Italians. Yet before 1914, radical nationalists seeking full separation from the empire were still in a small minority and the roots of Austro-Hungary's political turbulence went less deep than appearances suggested.

In fact, during the pre-war decade the Habsburg lands passed through a phase of strong economic growth with a corresponding rise in general prosperity. Most inhabitants of the empire associated the Habsburg state with the benefits of orderly government, public education, welfare, sanitation, the rule of law, and the maintenance of a sophisticated infrastructure.

Christopher Clark states: "Prosperous and relatively well administered, the empire, like its elderly sovereign, exhibited a curious stability amid turmoil.  Crises came and went without appearing to threaten the existence of the system as such.  The situation was always, as the Viennese journalist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] quipped, ‘desperate but not serious’."{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=77}}

===The drivers of Serbian Policy===

The principal drivers of Serbian policy were to consolidate the Russian-backed expansion of Serbia during the Balkan wars of 1912-13 and achieve dreams of a [[Greater Serbia]], which included “unification” of lands with large ethnic Serb populations inside the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including Bosnia &lt;ref name="Clark, Christopher 2013 p.22"&gt;Clark, Christopher (2013). ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''. HarperCollins. {{ISBN|978-0-06-219922-5}}., p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlaying this was a culture of extreme nationalism, and a cult of assassination, derived from the slaying of the Ottoman Sultan as the heroic epilogue to the otherwise disastrous [[Battle of Kosovo]] on 28 June 1389. Clark states: “The Greater Serbian vision was not just a question of government policy, however, or even of propaganda.  It was woven deeply into the culture and identity of the Serbs”.&lt;ref name="Clark, Christopher 2013 p.22"/&gt;

Serbian policy was complicated by the fact that the main actors in 1914 were both the official Serb government led by [[Nikola Pašić]] and the “Black Hand” terrorists led by the Head of Serb Military Intelligence, known as Apis. The Black Hand believed that a Greater Serbia would be achieved by provoking a war with Austro-Hungary through an act of terror which, with Russian backing, would be won.

The official government position was to focus on consolidating the gains made during the Balkan war, and avoid any further conflict, since recent wars had somewhat exhausted the Serb state. Nevertheless, the official policy was  muted by the political necessity of simultaneously and clandestinely supporting dreams of a Greater Serb state in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Christopher (2013). ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''. HarperCollins. {{ISBN|978-0-06-219922-5}}., p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The Serb government found it impossible to put and end to the machinations of the Black Hand for fear it would itself be overthrown. Clark states:  “Serbian authorities were partly unwilling and partly unable to suppress the irredentist activity that had given rise to the assassinations in the first place” &lt;ref&gt;Clark, Christopher (2013). ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''. HarperCollins. {{ISBN|978-0-06-219922-5}}., p.559&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia, for its part, tended to support Serbian as a fellow Slav state and considered Serbia her “client”. Russia also encouraged Serbia to focus its irredentism against Austro-Hungary because it would discourage conflict between Serbia and Bulgaria (another prospective Russian ally) in Macedonia.

== Imperialism ==
{{see also|New Imperialism}}

===The impact of Colonial rivalry and aggression on Europe in 1914===
Imperial rivalry, and the consequences of the search for imperial security or for imperial expansion, had important consequences for the origins of the First World War.

Imperial rivalries between France, Great Britain, Russia and Germany played an important part in the creation of the [[Triple Entente]] and the relative isolation of Germany. Imperial opportunism, in the form of the Italian attack on Ottoman Libyan provinces, also encouraged the Balkan wars of 1912-13, which changed the balance of power in the Balkans to the detriment of Austro-Hungary.

Some historians, such as [[Margaret MacMillan]], believe that Germany created its own diplomatic isolation in Europe in part through an aggressive and pointless imperial policy, known as [[Weltpolitik]]. Others, such as Clark, believe that German isolation was the unintended consequence of a détente between Great Britain, France and Russia. This détente was driven by Britain's desire for imperial security in relation to France in North Africa and in relation to Russia in Persia and India.

Either way, this isolation is important for the causes of WW1 because it left Germany few options but to ally herself more strongly with Austro-Hungary, leading ultimately to unconditional support for Austria's punitive war on Serbia during the July crisis of 1914.

===German isolation: Consequence of Weltpolitik?===
Germany's Chancellor in the 1870s and 1880s Otto von Bismarck disliked the idea of an overseas empire. Rather Bismarck supported French colonization in Africa because it diverted government attention and resources away from continental Europe and revanchism post 1870. Germany's "New Course" in foreign affairs, termed "Weltpolitik" ("world policy”) was adopted in the 1890s after Bismarck's dismissal.

The aim of Weltpolitik was ostensibly to transform Germany into a global power through assertive diplomacy, the acquisition of overseas colonies, and the development of a large navy.

Some historians, notably MacMillan and [[Hew Strachan]], believe that a consequence of the policy of Weltpolitik and the associated assertiveness was to isolate Germany.

Weltpolitik, particularly as expressed in Germany's objections to France's growing influence in Morocco in 1904 and 1907, also helped cement the Triple Entente. The Anglo-German Naval race also isolated Germany by reinforcing Britain's preference for agreements with Germany's continental rivals, France and Russia.

===German isolation: Consequence of The Triple Entente?===
Historians, including Ferguson and Clark, believe that Germany's isolation was the unintended consequences of the need for Britain to defend her Empire against threats from France and Russia. They also downplay the impact of Weltpolitik and the Anglo-German naval race, which ended in 1911.

Britain and France signed a series of agreements in 1904,which became known as the Entente Cordiale.  The most important feature of the agreement was that it granted freedom of action to the UK in Egypt and to France in Morocco. 
Equally, the [[Anglo-Russian Convention|Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]] is the common name used for the Convention between the United Kingdom and Russia relating to Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet.  The convention brought shaky British–Russian relations to the forefront by solidifying boundaries that identified respective control in Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet.

The alignment between Great Britain, France and Russia became known as the Triple Entente.  Therefore, the Triple Entente was not conceived as a counterweight to the Triple Alliance, but rather as a formula to secure imperial security between these three powers.  The impact of the Triple Entente was therefore twofold, to improve British relations with France and her ally Russia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany. Clark states it was "not that antagonism toward Germany caused its isolation, but rather that the new system itself channeled and intensified hostility towards the German Empire".

===Imperial opportunism: Italy – Ottomans ===
The Italo-Turkish War of 1911-12 was fought between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Italy in North Africa.  The main significance for the First World War was that this war made it clear that no Great Power appeared to wish to support the Ottoman Empire any longer and this paved the way for the Balkan Wars.

===Imperial opportunism France – North Africa===
The status of Morocco had been guaranteed by international agreement, and when France attempted to greatly expand its influence there without the assent of all the other signatories Germany opposed it prompting the Moroccan Crises, the Tangier Crisis of 1905 and the Agadir Crisis of 1911. The intent of German policy was to drive a wedge between the British and French, but in both cases produced the opposite effect and Germany was isolated diplomatically, most notably lacking the support of Italy despite Italian membership in the Triple Alliance. The French protectorate over Morocco was established officially in 1912.

In 1914, however, the African scene was peaceful. The continent was almost fully divided up by the imperial powers (with only Liberia and Ethiopia still independent). There were no major disputes there pitting any two European powers against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Mowat|editor-first=C. L. |editorlink = C. L. Mowat |title=The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 12, The Shifting Balance of World Forces, 1898-1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpfJoQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA151 |year=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-04551-3 |pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist interpretation===
Marxists typically attributed the start of the war to imperialism. "Imperialism," argued Lenin, "is the monopoly stage of capitalism." He thought the monopoly capitalists went to war to control markets and raw materials.

== Social Darwinism ==
[[Social Darwinism]] was a theory of human evolution loosely based on Darwinism that influenced most European intellectuals and strategic thinkers in the 1870-1914 era. These theories emphasized that struggle between nations and "races" was natural and that only the fittest nation deserved to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weikart, "The Origins of Social Darwinism in Germany, 1859-1895." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 54.3 (1993): 469-488 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2710024 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;   It gave an impetus to German assertiveness as a world economic and military power, aimed at competing with France and Britain for world power.  German colonial rule in Africa 1884-1914 was an expression of nationalism and moral superiority that was justified by constructing an image of the natives as "Other". This approach highlighted racist views of mankind. German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of ‘culture’ and ‘civilization’. Germany's cultural-missionary project boasted that its colonial programs were humanitarian and educational endeavors.  Furthermore, the wide acceptance among intellectuals of [[social Darwinism]] justified Germany's right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the ‘survival of the fittest’, according to historian Michael Schubert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schubert | first1 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = The 'German nation' and the 'black Other': social Darwinism and the cultural mission in German colonial discourse | url = | journal = Patterns of Prejudice | volume = 45 | issue = 5| pages = 399–416 | doi=10.1080/0031322x.2011.624754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Rash, ''The Discourse Strategies of Imperialist Writing: The German Colonial Idea and Africa, 1848-1945'' (Routledge, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The model suggested an explanation of why some ethnic groups (called "races" at the time) had been so antagonistic for so long, such as Germans and Slavs. They were natural rivals, destined to clash.  Senior German generals such as [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Helmuth von Moltke]] talked in apocalyptic terms about the need for Germans to fight for their existence as a people and culture.

War was seen as natural and a viable or even useful instrument of policy. "War was compared to a tonic for a sick patient or a life-saving operation to cut out diseased flesh".&lt;ref name="MacMillan, Margaret 2013 p524"/&gt; Since war was natural for some leaders it was simply a question of timing, and it would be therefore better to have a war when the circumstances were most precipitous. “I consider a war inevitable", declared Moltke in 1912, "The sooner the better".&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, Margaret (2013).

Nationalism made war a competition between peoples, nations or races rather than kings and elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weikart |first=Richard |title=From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics and Racism in Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UySSQgAACAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US |isbn=978-1-4039-6502-8}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Darwinism carried a sense of inevitability to conflict and downplayed the use of diplomacy or international agreements to end warfare.

Social Darwinism played an important role across Europe, but J.

== Web of alliances ==
[[File:Chain of Friendship cartoon.gif|300px|thumb|"The Chain of Friendship", an American editorial cartoon depicting the supposed web of alliances, captioned, "If Austria attacks Serbia, Russia will fall upon Austria, Germany upon Russia, and France and England upon Germany." This dimension developed into the concept of [[Chain ganging]].]]

General narratives of the war tend to emphasis the importance of Alliances in binding the major powers to act in the event of a crisis such as the July crisis. Historians such as Margaret MacMillan warn against the argument that alliances forced the great powers to act as they did during the July crisis. MacMillan states: "What we tend to think of as fixed alliances before the First World War were nothing of the sort. They were much more loose, much more porous, much more capable of change."&lt;ref&gt;Explaining the Outbreak of the First World War - Closing Conference Genève Histoire et Cité 2015; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWDJfraJWf0 See13:50&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important [[Political alliance|alliances]] in Europe required participants to agree to collective defence if attacked.  Some of these represented formal alliances while the Triple Entente represented only a frame of mind. These included:

* [[German-Austrian treaty]] (1879) or [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]
* The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] (1894)
* The addition of Italy to the Germany and Austrian alliance in 1882, forming the "Triple Alliance".
* [[Treaty of London, 1839]], guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium

There are three notable exceptions which demonstrate that alliances did not in themselves force the great powers to act:

* The "[[Entente Cordiale]]" between Britain and France in 1905 included a secret agreement which left the northern coast of France and the Channel to be defended by the British navy only, and the separate "[[Anglo-Russian Entente|entente]]" between Britain and Russia (1907) that formed the so-called [[Triple Entente]]. However, the Triple Entente between Russia, France and the United Kingdom did not in fact force the United Kingdom to mobilize because it was not a military treaty.  
* Moreover, general narratives of the war regularly misstate that Russia was allied to Serbia. [[Clive Ponting]] noted: "Russia had no treaty of alliance with Serbia and was under no obligation to support it diplomatically, let alone go to its defence".{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=122}}
* Italy, despite being part of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] did not enter the war in defence of its alliance partners.

== Arms race ==
By the 1870s or 1880s all the major powers were preparing for a large-scale war, although none expected one. Britain focused on building up its Royal Navy, already stronger than the next two navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Russia, and some smaller countries, set up conscription systems whereby young men would serve from 1 to three years in the army, then spend the next 20 years or so in the reserves with annual summer training. Men from higher social statuses became officers. Each country devised a mobilisation system whereby the reserves could be called up quickly and sent to key points by rail. Every year the plans were updated and expanded in terms of complexity. Each country stockpiled arms and supplies for an army that ran into the millions. Germany in 1874 had a regular professional army of 420,000 with an additional 1.3 million reserves. By 1897 the regular army was 545,000 strong and the reserves 3.4 million. The French in 1897 had 3.4 million reservists, Austria 2.6 million, and Russia 4.0 million. The various national war plans had been perfected by 1914, albeit with Russia and Austria trailing in effectiveness. Recent wars (since 1865) had typically been short—a matter of months. All the war plans called for a decisive opening and assumed victory would come after a short war; no one planned for or was ready for the food and munitions needs of a long stalemate as actually happened in 1914–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hinsley |editor-first=F.

As [[David Stevenson (historian)|David Stevenson]] has put it, "A self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness&amp;nbsp;... was an essential element in the conjuncture that led to disaster&amp;nbsp;... The armaments race&amp;nbsp;... was a necessary precondition for the outbreak of hostilities." David Herrmann goes further, arguing that the fear that "windows of opportunity for victorious wars" were closing, "the arms race did precipitate the First World War."  If Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been assassinated in 1904 or even in 1911, Herrmann speculates, there might have been no war. It was "...&amp;nbsp;the armaments race&amp;nbsp;... and the speculation about imminent or preventive wars" that made his death in 1914 the trigger for war.{{sfnp|Ferguson|1999|p=82}}

One of the aims of the '''[[First Hague Conference]]''' of 1899, held at the suggestion of Tsar Nicholas II, was to discuss disarmament. The '''[[Second Hague Conference]]''' was held in 1907. All the signatories except for Germany supported disarmament. Germany also did not want to agree to binding arbitration and mediation. The Kaiser was concerned that the United States would propose disarmament measures, which he opposed. All parties tried to revise international law to their own advantage.{{sfnp|Mulligan|2014|pp=646–647}}

=== Anglo-German naval race ===
{{Main|Anglo–German naval arms race}}
[[File:Naval-race-1909.jpg|thumb|290px|right|1909 cartoon in the American magazine ''Puck'' shows (clockwise) US, Germany, Britain, France and Japan engaged in naval race in a "no limit" game.]]
Historians have debated the role of the German naval build-up as the principal cause of deteriorating Anglo-German relations. In any case Germany never came close to catching up with Britain.

Supported by [[Wilhelm II]]'s enthusiasm for an expanded German navy, Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] championed four [[German Naval Laws|Fleet Acts]] from 1898 to 1912, and, from 1902 to 1910, the [[Royal Navy]] embarked on its own massive expansion to keep ahead of the Germans. This competition came to focus on the revolutionary new ships based on the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|''Dreadnought'']], which was launched in 1906, and which gave Britain a battleship that far outclassed any other in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Angus |last=Ross |title=HMS ''Dreadnought'' (1906) — A Naval Revolution Misinterpreted or Mishandled? |journal=[[Northern Mariner]] |date=April 2010 |volume=XX |issue=2 |pp=175–198 |url=http://www.cnrs-scrn.org/northern_mariner/vol20/tnm_20_175-198.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Blyth |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Lambert |editor2-first=Andrew |editor3-last=Rüger |editor3-first=Jan |title=The Dreadnought and the Edwardian Age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzU2NdB7GAIC |year=2011 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-6315-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming British response proved to Germany that its efforts were unlikely to equal the [[Royal Navy]]. In 1900, the British had a 3.7:1 tonnage advantage over Germany; in 1910 the ratio was 2.3:1 and in 1914, 2.1:1. Ferguson argues that, "So decisive was the British victory in the naval arms race that it is hard to regard it as in any meaningful sense a cause of the First World War."{{sfnp|Ferguson|1999|pp=83-85}} This ignores the fact that the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' had narrowed the gap by nearly half, and that the Royal Navy had long intended to be stronger than any two potential opponents; the [[United States Navy]] was in a period of growth, making the German gains very ominous.

In Britain in 1913, there was intense internal debate about new ships due to the growing influence of [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher's]] ideas and increasing financial constraints. In early-mid-1914 Germany adopted a policy of building submarines instead of new dreadnoughts and destroyers, effectively abandoning the race, but kept this new policy secret to delay other powers following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lambert |first=Nicholas A. |title=British Naval Policy, 1913–1914: Financial Limitation and Strategic Revolution |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |volume=67 |issue=3 |date=September 1995 |pages=623–626 |jstor=2124221 |doi=10.1086/245174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans abandoned the naval race before the war broke out.  The extent to which the naval race was one of the chief factors in Britain's decision to join the [[Triple Entente]] remains a key controversy.  Historians such as [[Chris Clark (historian)|Christopher Clark]] believe it was not significant, with Margaret Moran taking the opposite view.

==== Russian interests in Balkans and Ottoman Empire ====
The main Russian goals included strengthening its role as the protector of Eastern Christians in the Balkans (such as the Serbians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jelavich |first=Barbara |title=Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806-1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9kmX-OBDOEC&amp;pg=PA10 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52250-2 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Russia enjoyed a booming economy, growing population, and large armed forces, its strategic position was threatened by an expanding Turkish military trained by German experts using the latest technology. The start of the war renewed attention of old goals: expelling the Turks from Constantinople, extending Russian dominion into eastern Anatolia and Persian Azerbaijan, and annexing Galicia. These conquests would assure Russian predominance in the Black Sea and access to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMeekin |first=Sean |title=The Russian Origins of the First World War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQF099JYW_EC&amp;pg=PA7 |year=2011 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-06320-4 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical and military factors ==

===The 'Short war illusion'===

Traditional narratives of the war suggested that when the war began both sides believed that the war would end quickly.  Rhetorically speaking there was an expectation that the war would be “Over by Christmas” 1914. This is important for the origins of the conflict since it suggests that, given the expectation was that war would be short, the statesmen did not tend to take gravity of military action as seriously as they might have done.

However, modern historiography suggests a more nuanced approach.  There is ample evidence to suggest that statesmen and military leaders thought the war would be lengthy, terrible and have profound political consequences.

While it is true all military leaders planned for a swift victory, many military and civilian leaders recognized that the war may be long and highly destructive.  The principal German and French military leaders, including Moltke and Ludendorff and his French counterpart Joseph Joffre, expected a long war.{{sfnp|Ferguson|1999|p=97}}  The British Secretary of State for War [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] expected a long war: "three years" or longer, he told an amazed colleague.

Moltke hoped that a European war, if it broke out, would be resolved swiftly, but he also conceded that it might drag on for years, wreaking immeasurable ruin.  Asquith wrote of the approach of ‘Armageddon’ and French and Russian generals spoke of a ‘war of extermination’ and the ‘end of civilization’.  Foreign Secretary Grey famously stated just hours before Britain declared war: "The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time”.

Nevertheless, Clark concludes that "In the minds of many statesmen, the hope for a short war and the fear of a long one seemed to have cancelled each other out, holding at bay a fuller appreciation of the risks."{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=562}}

=== Primacy of the offensive and war by timetable ===
{{see also|Cult of the offensive}}
Military commanders of the time, including Moltke, Joffre and Conrad, held that seizing the offensive was extremely important. This theory encouraged all belligerents to devise war plans to strike first to gain the advantage. These war plans all included complex plans for mobilisation of the armed forces, either as a prelude to war or as a deterrent.  In the case of the continental Great Powers the mobilisation plans included arming and transporting millions of men and their equipment, typically by rail and to strict schedules- hence the metaphor "War by Timetable".

These mobilisation plans shortened the window for diplomacy as military planners wanted to begin mobilization as quickly as possible to avoid being caught on the defensive.  They also put pressure on policymakers to begin their own mobilisation once it was discovered that other nations had begun to mobilise.

Some historians assert that mobilization schedules were so rigid that once it was begun, they could not be cancelled without massive disruption of the country and military disorganization and so diplomatic overtures conducted after the mobilizations had begun were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=A.J.P. |authorlink=A. J. P. Taylor |title=War by Time-table: How the First World War Began |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvQkAQAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=Macdonald &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Russia ordered partial mobilisation on 25 July.  The policy was intended to be a mobilisation against Austria-Hungary only. However, due to a lack of pre-war planning for this type of partial mobilisation, the Russians realised by 29 July that partial mobilisation was not militarily possible, and as it would interfere with a general mobilisation, only full mobilisation could prevent the entire operation being botched. The Russians were therefore faced with only two options, to cancel mobilisation during a crisis or to move to full mobilisation, which they did on 30 July.   This full mobilisation meant mobilising along both the Russian border with Austro-Hungary and the border with Germany.

For their part the German war plans, the so-called Schlieffen plan, assumed a two-front war against France and Russia.  They were predicated on massing the bulk of the German army against France, and taking the offensive in the West, while a holding force held East Prussia.  The plans were based on the assumption that France would mobilise significantly quicker than Russia. Hence German forces could be deployed in the West to defeat France before turning to face the slow-moving Russians in the East.

On 28 July, Germany learned through its spy network that Russia had implemented partial mobilisation and its "Period Preparatory to War". The Germans assumed that Russia had, after all, decided upon war and that her mobilisation put Germany in danger. This was doubly so because German war plans, the so-called Schlieffen Plan, relied upon Germany to mobilise speedily enough to defeat France first (by attacking largely through neutral Belgium) before turning to defeat the slower-moving Russians.

Christopher Clarke states: "German efforts at mediation – which suggested that Austria should “Halt in Belgrade” and use the occupation of the Serbian capital to ensure its terms were met – were rendered futile by the speed of Russian preparations, which threatened to force the Germans to take counter–measures before mediation could begin to take effect". .{{sfnp|Clark|2013|p=509}}  Furthermore, Clarke states: "The Germans declared war on Russia before the Russians declared war on Germany. But by the time that happened, the Russian government had been moving troops and equipment to the German front for a week. The Russians were the first great power to issue an order of general mobilisation and the first Russo-German clash took place on German, not on Russian soil, following the Russian invasion of East Prussia. That doesn’t mean that the Russians should be ‘blamed’ for the outbreak of war. Rather it alerts us to the complexity of the events that brought war about and the limitations of any thesis that focuses on the culpability of one actor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n16/christopher-clark/the-first-calamity|title=The First Calamity|first=Christopher|last=Clark|date=29 August 2013|publisher=|pages=3–6|via=London Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
{{Main|Historiography of the Causes of World War I}}
[[File:Europe as it should be map.jpg|thumb|[[Louis P. Bénézet]]'s map of "Europe As It Should Be" (1918), depicting imagined nations based on ethnic and linguistic criteria. Bénézet's book ''The World War and What was Behind It'' (1918) blamed on German aggression combined with perceived threats to the traditional social order from radicals and ethnic nationalists.]]
During the period immediately following the end of hostilities, Anglo-American historians argued that Germany was solely responsible for the start of the war. However, academic work in the English-speaking world in the later 1920s and 1930s blamed participants more equally.

Historian [[Fritz Fischer]] unleashed an intense worldwide debate in the 1960s on Germany's long-term goals. American historian [[Paul Schroeder]] agrees with the critics that Fisher exaggerated and misinterpreted many points. However, Schroeder endorses Fisher's basic conclusion:
: From 1890 on, Germany did pursue world power. This bid arose from deep roots within Germany's economic, political, and social structures. Once the war broke out, world power became Germany's essential goal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, "World War I as Galloping Gertie: A Reply to Joachim Remak," ''Journal of Modern History'' 44#3 (1972), pp. 319-345, at p/ 320 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876415 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Schroeder argues, all that was not the main cause of the war in 1914--Indeed, the search for a single main cause is not a helpful approach to history. Instead, there are multiple causes any one or two of which could have launched the war.  He argues, "The fact that so many plausible explanations for the outbreak of the war have been advanced over the years indicates on the one hand that it was massively overdetermined, and on the other that no effort to analyze the causal factors involved can ever fully succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder p 320&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates over which country "started" the war, and who bears the blame, continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World War One: 10 interpretations of who started WW1 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26048324  |work=BBC News |date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Annika Mombauer]] a new consensus among scholars had emerged by the 1980s, mainly as a result of Fischer's intervention:
:Few historians agreed wholly with his [Fischer's] thesis of a premeditated war to achieve aggressive foreign policy aims, but it was generally accepted that Germany’s share of responsibility was larger than that of the other great powers.&lt;ref&gt;Annika Mombauer, "Guilt or Responsibility? The Hundred-Year Debate on the Origins of World War I." ''Central European History'' 48#4 (2015): 541-564, quote on p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding historians inside Germany, she adds, "There was 'a far-reaching consensus about the special responsibility of the German Reich' in the writings of leading historians, though they differed in how they weighted Germany's role.&lt;ref&gt;Mombauer, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24431">The '''Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program''', more commonly known as '''CARP''', is an agrarian reform law of the Philippines whose legal basis is the Republic Act No. 6657,&lt;ref name=ra6657 /&gt; otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL).&lt;ref name="dar.gov.ph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.gov.ph/ra-6657-what-is-carp-comprehensive-agrarian-reform-program|title=What is CARP RA 6657 - Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program|work=dar.gov.ph|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the redistribution of private and public agricultural lands to help the beneficiaries survive as small independent farmers, regardless of the “tenurial” arrangement. Its goals are to provide landowners equality in terms of income and opportunities, empower land owner beneficiaries to have an equitable land ownership, enhance the agricultural production and productivity, provide employment to more agricultural workers, and put an end to conflicts regarding land ownership.

== Background ==
The agrarian reform is part of the long history of attempts of land reform in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://dirp3.pids.gov.ph/ris/wp/pidswp9113.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The law was outlined by former President [[Corazon C. Aquino]] through Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on June 22, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1987/eo_229_1987.html Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was enacted by the 8th Congress of the Philippines and signed by Aquino on June 10, 1988. In 1998, which was the year that it was scheduled to be completed, the Congress enacted Republic Act No. 8532 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1998/ra_8532_1998.html Republic Act No. 8532]&lt;/ref&gt; to allocate additional funds for the program and extending the automatic appropriation of ill-gotten wealth recovered by the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government|Presidential Commission on Good Governance]] (PCGG) for CARP until the year 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.gov.ph/q-and-a-on-carp/english|title=English - Department of Agrarian Reform|work=dar.gov.ph|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An amendatory law, [http://www.dar.gov.ph/ra-9700-carper-comprehensive-agrarian-reform-program-extension CARPER or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms or the Republic Act. 9700] was passed. It extended the deadline of distributing agricultural lands to the farmers for an additional five years. This law also amends other provisions and regulations formerly stated in the CARP. It was signed into law on August 7, 2009 and was set to be accomplished by the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.gov.ph/ra-9700-carper-comprehensive-agrarian-reform-program-extension|title=CARPER RA 9700 - Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms|work=dar.gov.ph|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key components ==
{{cleanup-section|reason=appears to be pasted from legal document|date=July 2015}}
The implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program relies heavily on the '''Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR)'''. As the lead implementing agency, the DAR has the responsibility in carrying out the principal aspects of the program, which are Land Tenure Improvement (LTI), Program Beneficiary Development (PBD), and the Agrarian Justice Delivery (AJD).

The '''Land Tenure Improvement''' is highly recognized as the most integral aspect of the program. This component seeks to secure the tenurial status of the farmers and farmworkers. The DAR implements this component through Land Acquisition and Distribution (LAD) or Non-land Transfer Schemes.

The '''Land Acquisition and Distribution''' involves the redistribution of private and government-owned land to landless farmers and farm workers. Under Section 6 of RA 9700 ( Section 16 of RA 6657 as amended) regarding Land Acquisition, the DAR identifies lands that are eligible for distribution under the CARP with accordance to the law, acquires the land by delivering a notice containing the offer with its corresponding value to the owner should he choose to accept the payment. Following the acquisition of lands under Section 11 of RA 9700(Section 26 of RA 6657 as amended) the DAR distributes these to the qualified beneficiaries, who then pay for the land through the Land Bank of the Philippines or directly to their former owners.&lt;ref name="lawphil.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9700_2009.html|title=R.A. 9700|work=lawphil.net|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the CARP, a total target of 10.3 million hectares of land was programmed to be distributed over a span of ten years. Out of the total land, 6.5 million hectares of public disposal lands and Integrated Social Forestry areas are to be distributed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) while 3.8 million hectares of private agricultural lands are to be distributed by the DAR. From July 1987 to June 1992, the DAR was able to distribute 1.77 million hectares benefiting .933 million beneficiaries, while the DENR has distributed 1.88 million hectares to .760 million farmers.{{sfn|Leones|Moreno|2012}}

'''Leasehold Operations''' is the alternative non-land transfer scheme that covers all tenanted agricultural lands in retained areas and in yet to be acquired or distributed lands. Under this component, the DAR mediates between the landowners and tenants so that their share tenancy arrangement could be turned into a leasehold agreement, whereby the beneficiaries will pay a fixed fee based on their own historical production records instead of paying a large percentage share of their produce to the landowner.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Navarro, Conrado S., “Institutional Aspects of Policy Implementation and Management of the Philippine Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program” Paper presented at the Policy Dialogue on Agrarian Reform Issues in Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation, Manila, Philippines, May 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Program Beneficiaries Development''' is a support service delivery component of CARP. It aims to aid the agrarian reform beneficiaries by providing them necessary support services to make their lands more productive, and enable them to venture in income generating livelihood projects in accordance to Section 14 of RA 9700(Section 37 of RA 6657 as amended) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.gov.ph/major-final-outputs-mfos/program-beneficiaries-development|title=Technical Advisory Support Services|work=dar.gov.ph|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the support service delivery programs, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council(PARC) ensures that agrarian reform beneficiaries are provided with support services such as land surveys and tilting, construction of infrastructures, marketing and production assistance, credit and training.&lt;ref name="lawphil.net"/&gt;

'''Agrarian Justice Delivery''' provides agrarian legal assistance and oversees the adjudication of cases. Under Section 19 of RA 97600 (Section 50 of RA 6657 as amended), the DAR is hereby vested with the primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).&lt;ref name="dar.gov.ph"/&gt;

The '''Agrarian Legal Assistance''' is under the '''Bureau of Legal Assistance (BALA)'''. The BALA provides legal assistance to the beneficiaries affected by agrarian cases, particularly those whose legal rights as ARB’s are challenged by landowners.

The '''Adjudication of Cases''' involves the adjudication of cases by the '''Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB)'''. The adjudication of cases deals with disputes pertaining to tenancy relations; valuation of lands acquired by DAR under compulsory acquisition mode; rights and obligations of persons, whether natural or juridical, engaged in the management cultivation and use of all agricultural lands; ejectment and dispossession of tenants/leaseholders; review of leasehold rentals; and other similar disputes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Development ==
At the end of the 20th century, the population of the Philippines increased rapidly to 75.32 million in a country of 297,410 square kilometers, with an average family size of six, making the Philippines known for high population density. In addition to this, with a population growth of 2.02 per year, the Philippine population is expected to double in the span of 25 years. 60 percent of the Philippine population is rural, and over 12 million Filipinos make a living directly from agricultural cultivation. Around 9.5 million hectares of land across the Philippines are used to plan various crops. In terms of landlessness, the number of landless agricultural families rose up from 5 million to 11.32 million families. Out of these 11.32 families, 4.6 million make a living from lands they don’t own. 0.70 million are rented, 2 million are laborers, while 1.9 million are farming as tenants.{{sfn|Leones|Moreno|2012}}

===Land reform under Aquino administration (1986–1992)===
During the start of President Corazon Aquino’s term in 1986, the Constitutional Commission approved Section 21 under Article II, which states that “The State shall promote comprehensive rural development and agrarian reform.” This led to the drafting of CARP, which took the Congress a year to make. On June 10, 1988, Republic Act No. 6657, also known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), was passed to promote social justice and industrialization. Although it was still a product of adherence to democratic principles, this law was found to have many flaws. Because of much dissatisfaction with the agrarian reform law, proposals from peasant groups and non-government organizations grew in order to implement an alternative program that was more advantageous to them. However, this did not succeed.

CARP recognizes not only farmers but all landless workers as beneficiaries with the condition that they cultivate the land. The two main departments in charge of this program are Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Aside from the land distribution, it also provides the delivery of support services and security to the farmers.

Under the Aquino administration, a total of 898,420 landless tenants and farmers became recipients of land titles and support services. Even with this, it can be considered unsuccessful because it only accomplished 22.5 percent of land distribution in 6 years. This was due to the fact that Aquino assigned 4 different DAR secretaries. The major setback for CARP was Aquino’s Hacienda Luisita’s Stock Distribution Option, which says that she was the first landlord to evade CARP on a grand scale.

===Land reform under Ramos administration (1992–1998)===
The policies on agrarian reform under the Ramos administration focused on accelerating the direct land transfer and non-land transfer through adopting more rational, fair and inexpensive settlements. It encouraged landowners to invest in rural-based industries that are connected to agriculture. It made an amendment to Section 63 of CARL to increase the fund of this project to 100 billion. Salaries of workers and members of DAR board were increased to motivate them for more successful results as well.

The target land to be given to farmer beneficiaries under this Administration was 3.4 million hectares, 4.7 million or 60 percent of which was successfully distributed. It achieved more than double the output of the Aquino administration. It focused on “less contentious landholdings and acquisition modes,” where they chose to work with autonomous NGOs and peasant organizations. However, controversies were unavoidable as they encountered landlords openly harassing peasants with guns and forcing them out of the lands.

===Land reform under Estrada administration (1998–2001)===
This administration focused on fast tracking land acquisition and distribution. It wanted to reduce uncertainties in land market in rural places to help farmers’ efficiency and private investment to grow. It encouraged joint ventures, corporative, contact farming and other marketing arrangements to protect the status of stakeholders and promotion of agri-industrialization. They also improved the databases of the implementing agencies of DAR and DENR to fully record and update the lands covered. Estrada highlighted that there was a need to conceptualize new approaches in doing things to build a new social agreement where producers, government and private sectors work with a common goal.

The program encountered some problems such as strong landowners' resistance. Tenants also complained on the limited amount of fund allocation provided by the government for the project. It aimed to complete 7.8 million hectares by 2004. Since President Estrada lasted only 2.5 years as president, the total beneficiaries of CARP was only 0.18 million or 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comprehensiveagrarianreform.blogspot.com/|title=Comprehensive Agrarian Reform in the Philippines|author=Ri YuE Yap|work=comprehensiveagrarianreform.blogspot.com|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms (CARPER)==
'''Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms''', known also as '''CALPER''' or '''CARPer''', (Republic Act 9700)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lis.dar.gov.ph/home/document_view/3194&lt;/ref&gt; is the amendatory law that extends again the deadline of distributing agricultural lands to farmers for five years. It also amends other provisions stated in CARP.

In December 2008, the budget for CARP expired and there remained 1.2 million hectares of agricultural land waiting to be acquired and distributed to farmers. CARPER was signed into law on August 7, 2009 by '''[[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]''' and was set to expire on June 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = English - Department of Agrarian Reform|url = http://www.dar.gov.ph/q-and-a-on-carp/English|website = www.dar.gov.ph|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the program of distributing lands to farmer-beneficiaries continued even after June 2014. Section 30 of RA 9700 or CARPER law states that cases on the matter which are still pending “shall be allowed to proceed to its finality and be executed even beyond such date.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Republic Act No. 9700 {{!}} Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|url = http://www.gov.ph/2009/08/07/republic-act-no-9700/|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beneficiaries ===
Beneficiaries of CARPER are landless farmers, including agricultural lessees, tenants, as well as regular, seasonal and other farmworkers. In a certain landholding the qualified beneficiaries who are tenants and regular farmworkers will receive 3 hectares each before distributing the remaining land to the other qualified beneficiaries like seasonal farmworks and other farmworkers (Section 22 of CARL). The '''[[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR)]]''' identifies and screens potential beneficiaries and validates their qualifications. Beneficiaries must be least 15 years old, be a resident of the barangay where the land holding is located, and own no more than 3 hectares of agricultural land.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Q and A: The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program {{!}} Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|url = http://www.gov.ph/2014/06/30/q-and-a-the-comprehensive-agrarian-reform-program/|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CARPER law has bias for organized farmers to be beneficiaries because the Congress believes that the success rate of organized farmers is high and can make their awarded lands productive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Significant provisions ===
* '''Gender-Sensitive Agrarian Reform – Section 1''' of the CARPER law states that "The State shall recognize and enforce, consistent with existing laws, the rights of rural women to own and control land, taking into consideration the substantive equality between men and women as qualified beneficiaries, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof, and to be represented in advisory or appropriate decision-making bodies. These rights shall be independent of their male relatives and of their civil status." Rural women will have a representative in the highest policy making body of DAR – the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC).
* '''Budget – Section 21''' amending Section 63 for CARL state that the budget allocated for the 5-year extension is 150 Billion pesos which will be sourced from three funds: Agrarian Reform Fund, General Appropriations Acts (GAA) and other sources of funding like privatization of government asset, foreign donors, etc. This budget is the largest per year in the history of CARP.
* '''Creation of a Congressional Oversight Committee – Section 26''' of the CARPER law created a joint Congressional Oversight Committee to oversee and monitor the implementation of the act, which will be composed of the Chairpersons of the Committee on Agrarian Reform of both Houses of Congress, three Members of the House of Representatives, and three Members of the Senate of the Philippines, to be designated respectively by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate of the Philippines. The chairpersons of the COCAR are the Chairpersons of the Committees on Agrarian Reform of the House of Representatives and of the Senate of the Philippines. The term of the COCAR will end six months after the expiration of the extended period of five years. The COCAR is provided with twenty-five million pesos (P25,000,000.00) every year.
* '''CARPER as a Continuing Program – Section 30''' of the CARPER law mandates that “any case and/or proceeding involving the implementation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, which may remain pending on June 30, 2014 shall be allowed to proceed to its finality and be executed even beyond such date". Section 30 of CARPER law provides a way to legally continue the implementation of pending CARP cases after the 5-year extension by filling the initiatory process of CARP.
* '''Policies in Converting Agricultural Lands – Section 73''' of the CARPER law: '''"'''Any conversion by any landowner of his/her agricultural land into any non-agricultural use with intent to avoid the application of this Act to his/her landholdings and to dispossess his/her bonafide tenant farmers." Failure to comply will result in an imprisonment of 6 to 12 years and/or a penalty of 200,000 pesos to 1 million pesos. The CARPER law prohibits any conversion of irrigated and irrigable lands and mandates the National Irrigation Administration to identify these. CARPER law also states that non-implementation of the conversion plan will result to automatic coverage of the subject by CARP.

=== Achievements ===

In 2003, 15 years into the program, studies funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), AsDB, FAO, European Union (EU) and the Philippine Government, had shown that poverty incidence among program beneficiaries declined from 47.6 to 45.2 percent, while increasing among their non-participating counterparts from 55.1 to 56.4 percent.{{sfn|Guardian|2003}}

The [[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]] released an update on the accomplishments in the field of agrarian reform as of June 30, 2014.&lt;blockquote&gt;"As of December 31, 2013, the government has acquired and distributed 6.9 million hectares of land, equivalent to 88% of the
total land subject to CARP." Of this area, the Aquino administration has distributed a total of 751,514 hectares, or 45% of the total landholdings to be distributed to the farmer beneficiaries left under this administration. From
this, DAR has distributed 412,782 hectares and DENR has already distributed
338,732 hectares.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2014 – 2016, [[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform]] still needs to acquire 771,795 hectares (187,686 hectares in 2014; 198,631 hectares in 2015; and 385,478 hectares in 2016). The [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines)|Department of Environment and Nation Resources]] still needs to acquire 134,857 hectares — a total of 906,652 hectares.

==Criticism==

===Unsuccessful after 26 years?===

While CARP(er) has had some success in improving food security and reducing poverty overall - through improved farm productivity and increased farmer incomes - the program has not escaped criticism. Major implementation problems include resistance from existing landowners (often objecting to the undervaluation of their properties), legislative gaps and funding shortfalls.{{sfn|Guardian|2003}}

There are also claims that the program has resulted in or worsened violent conflicts between landowners and poor farmers. By June 30, 2014, the official program end date, 664 farmers had been killed in the name of land reform, according to activist group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (Peasant Movement of the Philippines, or KMP).{{sfn|Philippine Star|2014}} 568 of these were victims of extrajudicial killings. In the four years of the Noynoy Aquino administration, 96 farmers were killed as opposed to the 9 that were killed during the Arroyo administration. According to Rafael Mariano, KMP chairman, "Farmers asserting their rights to the land were subjected to human rights abuses while peasant leaders were rendered as criminals, incarcerated and, worse, were massacred".{{sfn|Philippine Star|2014}}

CARP expired when the Congress did not approve Aquino’s proposal to extend it for two more years. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) has processed 494,945 agrarian law implementation cases since the start of the program, which the KMP claims demonstrate the program's failure and negative impact on the lives of tenants and farmers.{{sfn|Philippine Star|2014}}

The '''economy of the United Arab Emirates''' is the second largest in the [[Middle East]] (after [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]]), with a [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of $403.2 billion (AED 1.46 trillion) in 2014. The [[United Arab Emirates|Emirates]] have been successfully diversifying its economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Diversification raises non-oil share of UAE's GDP to 71% |url=http://gulfnews.com/business/economy/diversification-raises-non-oil-share-of-uae-s-gdp-to-71-1.795268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the UAE has the most diversified economy in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]], its economy remains extremely reliant on [[petroleum]] (oil). With the exception of [[Dubai]], most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. [[Petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in [[Abu Dhabi]]. More than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009.&lt;ref name=WorldFactbook&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ae.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stat.wto.org/CountryProfile/WSDBCountryPFView.aspx?Language=E&amp;Country=AE |title=WTO Trade Statistic 2009 |publisher=Stat.wto.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703998 |title=United Arab Emirates profile |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/middleEastCentre/kuwait/documents/Economic-diversification-in-the-GCC-countries.pdf|title=Economic diversification in the GCC countries|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tourism]] is one of the bigger non-oil sources of revenue in the UAE, with some of the world's most luxurious hotels being based in the UAE. A massive construction boom, an expanding manufacturing base, and a thriving services sector are helping the UAE diversify its economy. Nationwide, there is currently $350 billion worth of active [[construction]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&amp;cid=1179091517887&amp;p=1135099400228&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWamLocEnews%2FW-T-LEN-FullNews 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604213130/http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&amp;cid=1179091517887&amp;p=1135099400228&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWamLocEnews%2FW-T-LEN-FullNews |date=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UAE is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[OPEC]].

== Historical background ==
Prior to independence from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and unification in 1971, each emirate was responsible for its own economy. At the time, [[pearl diving]], [[seafaring]] and [[fishing]] were together the mainstay of the economy, until the development of Japanese [[cultured pearl]]s and the discovery of commercial quantities of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp|title=UAE History &amp; Traditions: Pearls &amp; pearling - UAEinteract|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp|archive-date=6 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous UAE President [[Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] is credited with bringing the country forward into the 20th century and using the revenue from oil exports to fund all the necessary development. Likewise, former UAE vice-president [[Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] had a bold vision for the Emirate of Dubai and foresaw the future in not petroleum alone, but also other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gluckman.com/DubaiBiz.html|title=The Hong Kong of the Middle East|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Dubai's diversification centred around trade and the creation of shipping and logistics centres, notably [[Port Rashid]] and the port and Free Zone of [[Jebel Ali Free Zone|Jebel Ali]] as well as [[Dubai International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabiansupplychain.com/article-6889-the-40-year-history-of-uae-logistics-part-one--ports/2/|title=The 40 year history of UAE logistics: Part one - Ports {{!}} ArabianSupplyChain.com|last=Cuthbert|first=Jon|website=www.arabiansupplychain.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a number of major global plays in shipping, transportation and logistics ([[DP World]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Dnata|DNATA]]). The emergence of Dubai's lively real estate market was briefly checked by the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007-8, when Dubai was bailed out by Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/abu-dhabi-helps-dubai-with-bank-bailout-445557.html|title=Abu Dhabi helps Dubai with bank bailout|work=Arabian Business|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recovery from the overheated market led to tighter regulation and oversight and a more realistic market for real estate throughout the UAE with many 'on hold' projects restarting.

UAE has the second-largest economy in the Arab world (after Saudi Arabia),&lt;ref name="Economy2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=UAE's economy growth momentum set to pick up |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?section=editorschoice&amp;xfile=/data/editorschoice/2013/December/editorschoice_December12.xml |publisher=[[Khaleej Times]] |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=5 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104225058/http://khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=%2Fdata%2Feditorschoice%2F2013%2FDecember%2Feditorschoice_December12.xml&amp;section=editorschoice |archivedate=4 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $377 billion (AED1.38 trillion) in 2012.&lt;ref name="GDP2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/biz/inside.asp?xfile=/data/uaebusiness/2013/July/uaebusiness_July19.xml&amp;section=uaebusiness |title=GDP to hit $474.2b in 2018 |publisher=[[Khaleej Times]]|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of the GDP is from oil revenues.&lt;ref name="Economy2013"/&gt; The economy was expected to grow 4–4.5% in 2013, compared to 2.3–3.5% over the previous five years. Since independence in 1971, UAE's economy has grown by nearly 231 times to AED1.45 trillion in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to AED1.2 trillion, a growth of around 28 times from 1981 to 2012.&lt;ref name="Economy2013"/&gt;

The UAE's economy is one of the most open worldwide, and its history of economic history goes back to the times when ships sailed to [[India]], along the [[Swahili coast]], as far south as [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UAE Economy|url=http://www.uae-embassy.org/about-uae/uae-economy|publisher=UAE Embassy in Washington, DC|accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current UAE’s GDP is $386.4 Billion while the individual share is almost 70 thousand dollars.

[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) expected UAE’s economic growth to increase to 4.5% in 2015, compared to 4.3% in 2014. The IMF ascribed UAE’s potentially strong economic growth in [[World Economic Outlook]] Report to the increased contribution of non-petroleum sectors, which registered a growth average of more than 6% in 2014 and 2015. Such contribution includes banking, tourism, commerce and real estate. Increase of Emirati purchasing power and governmental expenditures in infrastructure projects have considerably increased.

Internationally, UAE is ranked among the top 20 for global [[service business]], according to [[A.T. Kearney|AT Kearney]], the top 30 on the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] “most-networked countries” and in the top quarter as a least corrupt country per the [[Transparency International|TI]]'s [[Corruption Index|corruption index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uae-embassy.org/about-uae/uae-economy|title=UAE Economy|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[List of countries by imports|imports]] totaling $273.5 billion in 2012, UAE passed Saudi Arabia as the largest consumer market in the region. Exports totaled $314 billion, which makes UAE the second largest [[List of countries by exports|exporter]] in the region.&lt;ref name="Economy2013"/&gt;

UAE and [[India]] are each other's main trading partners, with the latter having many of its citizens working and living in the former. The trade totals over $75 billion (AED275.25 billion).&lt;ref name="MainTrade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/business/investment/uae-and-india-sign-crucial-investment-protection-pact-1.1266534 |title=UAE and India sign crucial investment protection pact |publisher=[[Gulf News]] |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top five of the Main Partner Countries of the UAE in 2014 are [[Iran]] (3.0%), India (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (1.5%), [[Oman]] (1.4%) and [[Switzerland]] (1.2%). As for the top five of UAE suppliers are [[China]] (7.4%), [[United States]] (6.4%), India (5.8%), [[Germany]] (3.9%) and [[Japan]] (3.5%).

==Diversification==
[[Image:United Arab Emirates Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of UAE's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories|280x280px]]
Although UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE's economy remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. [[Petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in [[Abu Dhabi]]. More than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009.&lt;ref name=WorldFactbook/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Dubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007-2010 and was bailed out by Abu Dhabi's oil wealth. Dubai's current prosperity has been attributed to Abu Dhabi's [[petrodollar]]s.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer254/speaking-water|title=Speaking of Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Dubai owed a total of $142 billion in debt.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2014/03/dubai-drowning-in-debt/|title=Dubai Drowning in Debt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE government has worked towards reducing the economy's dependence on oil exports by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_03_04_2013_p31-553263.xml|title=UAE Industry Builds Capability|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various projects are underway to help achieve this, the most recent being the [[Khalifa Port]], opened in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]] at the end of 2012. The UAE has also won the right to host the World Expo 2020, which is believed to have a positive effect on future growth, although there are some skeptics which mention the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20131125/ml--dubai-world-s-fair-fears/?ir=homepage|title=Dubai world Expo bid stirs worry of second bubble|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decades, the Emirate of [[Dubai]] has started to look for additional sources of revenue. High-class tourism and international finance continue to be developed. In line with this initiative, the [[Dubai International Financial Centre]] was announced, offering 55.5% foreign ownership, no [[withholding tax]], freehold land and office space and a tailor-made [[financial regulation|financial regulatory system]] with laws taken from best practice in other leading financial centres like New York, London, Zürich and Singapore. A new stock market for regional companies and other initiatives were announced in DIFC. Dubai has also developed Internet and Media free zones, offering 100% foreign ownership, no tax office space for the world's leading ICT and media companies, with the latest communications infrastructure to service them. Many of the world's leading companies have now set up branch offices, and even changed headquarters to, there. Recent liberalisation in the property market allowing non citizens to buy freehold land has resulted in a major boom in the construction and real estate sectors, with several signature developments such as the 2 [[Palm Islands]], [[the World (archipelago)]], Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Lake Towers, and a number of other developments, offering villas and high rise apartments and office space. Emirates (part of the Emirates Group) was formed by the Dubai Government in the 1980s and is presently one of the few airlines to witness strong levels of growth. Emirates is also the largest operator of the [[Airbus A380]] aircraft. {{As of|2001}}, budgeted government revenues were about [[United Arab Emirates dirham|AED]] 29.7 billion, and expenditures were about AED 22.9 billion.In addition, to finding new ways of sustaining the national economy, the UAE has also made progress in installing new, sustainable methods of generating electricity. This is evidenced by various solar energy initiatives at [[Masdar City]] and by other renewable energy developments in parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clydeco.com/insight/articles/renewable-energy-across-the-mena-region|title=Renewable energy across the MENA region : Clyde &amp; Co (en)|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/1879752/masdar_city_a_rising_star.html|title=Masdar City: A Rising Star|date=8 April 2013|work=The Ecologist|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the UAE is starting to see the emergence of local manufacturing as new source of economic development, examples of significant government-led investments such as [http://www.strata.ae/website/home Strata] in [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace industry]], under [[Mubadala Development Company|Mubadala]] are successful, while there are also small scale entrepreneurial ventures picking up, such as [[Zarooq motors|Zarooq Motors]] in the [[automotive industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/trio-hope-fastest-snake-in-desert-is-start-of-uae-car-industry|title=Trio hope ‘fastest snake in desert’ is start of UAE car industry {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign trade ==

With reference to foreign trade, UAE's market is one of the world's most dynamic markets worldwide, placed among the 16 largest exporters and 20 largest importers of commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.portal.santandertrade.com/analyse-markets/united-arab-emirates/foreign-trade-in-figures?&amp;actualiser_id_banque=oui&amp;id_banque=0&amp;memoriser_choix=memoriser|title=UAE foreign trade in figures|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top five of the Main Partner Countries of the UAE in 2014 are Iran (3.0%), India (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (1.5%), Oman (1.4%) and Switzerland (1.2%). As for the top five of UAE suppliers are China (7.4%), United States (6.4%), India (5.8%), Germany (3.9%) and Japan (3.5%).

==Human Resources and Employment==
[[Image:Dubai workers angsana burj.jpg|thumb|300px|Construction workers from Asia on top floor of the [[Angsana Hotel &amp; Suites]]]]
[[Emiratisation]] is an initiative by the government of the UAE to employ more UAE Nationals in a meaningful and efficient manner in the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/labour/Emiritisation/10049370.html Gulf News - New emiratisation drive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203052442/http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/labour/Emiritisation/10049370.html |date=2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/04/18/10119108.html Gulf News - Call for cautious Emiratisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316044258/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/04/18/10119108.html |date=2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the program has been in place for more than a decade and results can be seen in the public sector, the private sector is still lagging behind with citizens only representing 0.34% of the private sector workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, S. and A. England (2009). UAE to safeguard jobs of nationals. Financial Times. London&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is general agreement over the importance of Emiratisation for social, economic and political reasons, there is also some contention as to the impact of localization on organizational efficiency. It is yet unknown whether, and the extent to which, employment of nationals generates returns for MNEs operating in the Middle East. Recent research cautions that localization is not always advantageous for firms operating in the region, and its effectiveness depends on a number of contingent factors.&lt;ref&gt;Mellahi, K. (2007). The effect of regulations on HRM: private sector firms in Saudi Arabia. International Journal of Human Resource Management, 18(1): 85-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forstenlechner, I. (2010). "Workforce localization in emerging Gulf economies: the need to fine-tune HRM." Personnel Review 39(1): 135-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 however, a positive impact of UAE citizens in the workplace was identified in a newspaper article citing a yet unpublished study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091203/NATIONAL/712029856/1010 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106042624/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20091203%2FNATIONAL%2F712029856%2F1010 |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this advantage being the use of networks within the evolving power structures.

Overall, however, uptake in the private sector remains low regardless of significant investments in education, which have reached record levels with education now accounting for 22.5% – or $2.6 billion – of the overall budget planned for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uaeinteract.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918022658/http://www.uaeinteract.com/ |date=2010-09-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple governmental initiatives are actively promoting Emiratisation by training anyone from highschool dropouts to graduates in a multitude of skills needed for the - essentially Western - work environment of the UAE, these initiatives include Tawteen UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaetawteen.com|title=UAETAW TEEN|work=UAETAW TEEN|accessdate=3 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422134718/http://www.uaetawteen.com/|archive-date=22 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENDP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endp.ae|title=:: Emirates Nationals Development Programme ::|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Abu Dhabi Tawteen Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tawteencouncil.ae {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628140832/http://www.tawteencouncil.ae/ |date=2011-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis – and other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] nationals – being given preference when it comes to employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn | The National]. Thenational.ae (2013-03-18). Retrieved on 2014-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Unions are generally banned and workers with any labour issues are advised to be in touch with the Ministry of Labour, instead of protesting or refusing to work. Migrant employees often complain of poor workplace safety and wages based on nationality, although this is being slowly addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2008/02/24/idINIndia-32118620080224|title=Indian workers jailed in Dubai over violent protest|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond directly sponsoring educational initiatives, the Emirates Foundation for Philanthropy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emiratesfoundation.ae|title=Welcome to Emirates Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is funding major research initiatives into Emiratisation through competitive research grants, allowing universities such as [[United Arab Emirates University]] or [[Dubai School of Government]] to build and disseminate expertise on the topic.

Academics working on various aspects of Emiratisation include ''Paul Dyer''[12] and ''Natasha Ridge'' from Dubai School of Government, ''Ingo Forstenlechner''[13] from United Arab Emirates University, ''Kasim Randaree'' from the British University of Dubai and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.

== Real estate ==
[[File:The view from the 43rd floor of the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel - panoramio.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Dubai International Financial Centre|Dubai International Financial Center]]]]
The development in the [[real estate industry|real estate]] and infrastructure sectors during the recent year has contributed in making the country a global touristic destination. The contribution of tourism in the Emirati GDP increased from 3% in the mid-1990s to more than 16.5% by the end of 2010. This trend is supported by the huge public investments in touristic projects (47 Billion Dollars per annum) carried mainly to expend airports, increase their capacity, set up new airports and ports.

The real estate sector have a positive impact on development, job opportunities, investments and tourism as estate projects were launched to meet the needs of market and the increasing demand for housing and commercial units especially in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The UAE has 18 tour hotels out of the 155 (150 meters high) that exist around the world. This makes the UAE the third destination with such tours after China and America in 2014. These buildings are among the [[List of tourist attractions in the United Arab Emirates|UAE’s attractions for tourists]].

The leap in real estate sector along and infrastructure development in the UAE during the recent year has contributed in making this country a global touristic destination par excellence. Therefore, the contribution of tourism in the Emirati GDP increased from 3% in the mid-1990s to more than 16.5% by the end of 2010. This trend is supported by the huge public investments in touristic projects (47 Billion Dollars per year) carried mainly to expend airports, increase their capacity, set up new airports and ports.

The UAE has 18 tour hotels out of the 155 (150 meters high) that exist around the world. This makes the UAE the third destination with such tours after China and America in 2014. These buildings are among the UAE’s attraction elements for tourists. Dubai has adopted dazzling ideas in construction and design of these tall tours.

The UAE has about 37% of the region’s petroleum and gas industries, chemical industries, energy and water and garbage projects.

The '''General Law Amendment Act, number 37 of 1963''' (commenced 2 May) allowed a South African police officer to detain without warrant a person suspected of a politically motivated crime for up to 90 days without access to a lawyer. When used in practice, suspects were re-detained for another 90-day period immediately after release.

The Amendment Act also introduced the "Sobukwe Clause" which allowed people already convicted of political offenses to be further detained (initially for twelve months). Named the Sobukwe Clause because it was used to keep PAC leader [[Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe]] (who was originally arrested in 1960 and sentenced to three years) in [[Robben Island]] for an additional six years.

This Act strengthened previous amendments by further defining political crimes under Apartheid. Section 5 of the Act made a capital crime out of "receiving training that could further the objects of communism or advocating abroad economic or social change in South Africa by violent means through the aid of a foreign government or institution where the accused is a resident or former resident of South Africa".

The legislation made provisions for imposing "sentences ranging from a minimum of five years imprisonment to death for anyone leaving the country to learn sabotage techniques, for advocating the forcible overthrow of the government or for urging the forcible intervention in domestic South African affairs by an outside power, including the [[UN]]".

==Further expansion of Act==
The act was amended by the General Law Amendment Act No 80 of 1964 which allowed the Minister of Justice of Apartheid South Africa to extend the "Sobukwe Clause" as desired.

==Repeal==
The act was repealed by the [[Internal Security Act, 1982]], which, however, gave the government similar powers of detention.

The '''Green European Foundation''' is a [[political foundation at European level]] funded by the [[European Parliament]]. It is linked to, but independent of, other European Green actors such as the [[European Green Party]] and the Green Group in the European Parliament.

==Mission==
The Green European Foundation (GEF) was founded in 2008. Modelled on many successful national Green political foundations, the mission of GEF is to encourage European citizens to participate in European political discussions and to ultimately forge a stronger, more participative European democracy. 
The Green European Foundation organises debates, conducts research and publishes various documents concerning [[green politics]]. Though its main office is based in Brussels, it aims to reach out to people across Europe and in 2017 it organised tens of events in  more than 20 European countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gef.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GEF-Annual-report-2017.pdf|title=Annual report 2017|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Three stakeholders are at the heart of the Green European Foundation:

* national Green political foundations around Europe; 
* the [[European Green Party]];
* the [[The Greens–European Free Alliance|Green/EFA Group in the European Parliament]];

These stakeholders are represented in GEF's General Assembly, which meets on a biannual basis and which has the responsibility of electing the foundation's board. As of June 2018, the following national foundations are represented in the General Assembly as full members:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gef.eu/about-gef/people-and-structure/general-assembly/|title=General Assembly|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guayana Esequiba''' ({{IPA-es|ɡwaˈʝana eseˈkiβa}}) is a territory administered by [[Guyana]] and claimed by [[Venezuela]].

The territory was first included in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] and the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]] by [[Spain]], but was later included in [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] by the Dutch and in [[British Guiana]] by the [[United Kingdom]]. Originally, parts of what is now eastern Venezuela were included in the disputed area. The portion today under the administration of Guyana divides the area in six administrative regions ([[Barima-Waini]], [[Cuyuni-Mazaruni]], [[Pomeroon-Supenaam]], [[Potaro-Siparuni]], [[Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo]] and [[Essequibo Islands-West Demerara]]), while Venezuela treats it as a single entity (Guayana Esequiba or "Zona en Reclamación"). This territory of {{convert|159500|km2|abbr=on}} is the subject of a long-running boundary dispute inherited from the colonial powers and complicated by the independence of Guyana in 1966. The status of the territory is subject to the Treaty of Geneva, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana on February 17, 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.&lt;ref name=Geneva&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20561/volume-561-I-8192-English.pdf Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966)] from [[UN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1648 [[Spain]] signed the [[Peace of Münster]] with the [[Dutch Republic]], whereby Spain recognized the Republic's independence and also small Dutch possessions located east of the [[Essequibo River]], which had been founded by the Dutch Republic before it was recognised by Spain. However, few decades after the Peace of Münster, the Dutch began to spread gradually west of the Essequibo River, inside the Spanish [[Guayana Province]]. These new settlements were regularly contested and destroyed by the Spanish authorities.

The French [[Encyclopédie]], published in the second half of the 18th century, noted the border as lying on the Essequibo river.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond D'Alembert, Charles Marie de la Condamine (1757): "Guiane" in ''L'Encyclopédie'', Vol. VII, Page 7:1004 [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/ENC_7-1004.jpg See the original page on Commons] [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.6:1672.encyclopedie0513.9958154 and the Transcription from the University of Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spain created the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]] in 1777, the Essequibo river was restated as the natural border between Spanish territory and the Dutch colony of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]]. Spanish authorities, in a report dated 10 July 1788, put forward an official claim against the Dutch expansion over her territory, and proposed a borderline:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been stated that the south bank of the [[Orinoco]] from the point of Barima, 20 leagues more or less inland, up to the creek of Curucima, is low lying and swampy land and, consequently, reckoning all this tract as useless, very few patches of fertile land being found therein, and hardly any savannahs and pastures, it is disregarded; so taking as chief base the said creek of Curucima, or the point of the chain and ridge in the great arm of the Imataka, an imaginary line will be drawn running to the south-south-east following the slopes of the ridge of the same name which is crossed by the rivers Aguire, Arature and Amacuro, and others, in the distance of 20 leagues, direct to the [[Cuyuni River|Cuyuni]]; from there it will run on to the Masaruni and Essequibo, parallel to the sources of the Berbis and Surinama; this is the directing line of the course which the new Settlements and foundations proposed must follow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, no boundary between the Spanish and Dutch possessions was ever defined.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt; Under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Dutch colonies of [[Demerara]], [[Berbice]] and [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] were transferred to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. In 1831, Britain merged Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo into [[British Guiana]], with the Essequibo River as its west border, although many British settlers lived west of the Essequibo.

In 1822 [[José Rafael Revenga]], Minister Plenipotentiary of [[Gran Colombia]] to Britain, complained to the British government at the direction of [[Simón Bolívar]] about the presence of British settlers in territory claimed by Venezuela: "The colonists of Demerara and Berbice have usurped a large portion of land, which according to recent treaties between Spain and Holland, belongs to our country at the west of Essequibo River. It is absolutely essential that these settlers be put under the jurisdiction and obedience to our laws, or be withdrawn to their former possessions."

In 1824 [[Venezuela]] appointed [[José Manuel Hurtado]] as its new Ambassador to Britain. Hurtado officially presented to the British government Venezuela's claim to the border at the Essequibo River, which was not objected to by Britain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} However, the British government continued to promote colonization of territory west of the Essequibo River in succeeding years.

===Schomburgk Line===
[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|270px|Map of the British aspirations on Venezuela in 1896]]
In 1835, under the aegis of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], the [[Germany|German]]-born explorer and  [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] conducted [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geography|geographical]] exploration of British Guiana. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in 1840 by the British government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the "Schomburgk Line".&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;&lt;ref name="GUYANA-VENEZUELA-BORDER"&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter52.html|title = THE BEGINNING OF THE GUYANA-VENEZUELA BORDER DISPUTE|publisher = guyana.org| accessdate = 2009-05-01 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the "Schomburgk Line" published until 1886, which led to later accusations by [[United States|US]] President [[Grover Cleveland]] that the line had been extended "in some mysterious way".&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;[[Robert Arthur Humphreys|Humphreys, R. A.]] (1967), "Anglo-American Rivalries and the Venezuela Crisis of 1895", Presidential Address to the [[Royal Historical Society]] 10 December 1966, ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', 17: pp 131-164&lt;/ref&gt;

The Line went well beyond the area of British occupation, and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the [[Orinoco]] River.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;King, Willard L. (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzSB1n7dfNQC&amp;pg=PA249 Melville Weston Fuller - Chief Justice of the United States 1888-1910]'', Macmillan. p249&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schomburgk, it did not contain all the area that Britain might legitimately claim. Venezuela disputed Schomburgk's placing of border markers at the Orinoco river, and in 1844 claimed all of Guiana west of the [[Essequibo River]]. Also in 1844, a British proposal to Venezuela to modify the border to give Venezuela full control of the Orinoco river mouth and adjacent territory was ignored. In 1850 both Britain and Venezuela reached an agreement whereby they accepted not to colonize the disputed territory, although where this territory began and ended was not established.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

The dispute went unmentioned until 1876, by which point gold mines inhabited mainly by English-speaking people had been established in the [[Cuyuni River|Cuyuni basin]], which was Venezuelan territory beyond the Schomburgk line but within the area Schomburgk thought Britain could claim.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1876 Venezuela reiterated its claim up to the Essequibo river, to which the British responded with a counterclaim including the entire Cuyuni basin, although this was a paper claim which the British never intended to pursue.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;  On 21 February 1881, Venezuela proposed a frontier line starting from a point one mile to the north of the [[Moruka River]], drawn from there westward to the [[60th meridian west|60th meridian]] and running south along that meridian. This would have granted the [[Barima]] District to Venezuela.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In October 1886 Britain declared the Schomburgk Line to be the provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. In 1894 Venezuela appealed to the [[United States]] to intervene, citing the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as justification. The United States did not want to get involved, only going as far as suggesting the possibility of arbitration.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

===Venezuela Crisis of 1895===
{{main|Venezuelan crisis of 1895}}
[[File:Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Official Map of the [[United States of Venezuela]] by L. Robelin 1890, which shows the Venezuelan historical claim to the region.]]
The longstanding dispute became a diplomatic crisis in 1895. Venezuela hired [[William Lindsay Scruggs]] as its lobbyist in [[Washington, D.C.]] Scruggs took up Venezuela's argument that British action violated the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Scruggs used his influence to get the US government to accept this claim and get involved. President [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the Doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.&lt;ref name=wealth2&gt;[[Fareed Zakaria|Zakaria, Fareed]], ''From Wealth to Power'' (1999). Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01035-8}}. pp145–146&lt;/ref&gt; British prime minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and British ambassador to the US [[Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote|Lord Pauncefote]] both misjudged the importance the American government placed on the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, Paul, "Unmasterly Inactivity? Sir Julian Pauncefote, Lord Salisbury, and the Venezuela Boundary Dispute," ''Diplomacy and Statecraft,'' Mar 2005, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 23-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Nelson M. "Background of Cleveland's Venezuelan Policy," ''American Historical Review,'' Vol. 47, No. 2 (Jan., 1942), pp. 259-277 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1841667 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The key issue in the crisis became Britain's refusal to include the territory east of the Schomburgk Line in the proposed international arbitration. Ultimately Britain backed down and tacitly accepted the US right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. This US intervention forced Britain to accept arbitration of the entire disputed territory.

===Treaty of Washington===
The Treaty of Arbitration between Great Britain and Venezuela was signed in Washington on 2 February 1897. This treaty specifically stipulated the legal framework for the arbitration, and its first article stated that'' "An arbitral Tribunal shall be immediately appointed to determine the boundary line between the United States of Venezuela and the Colony of British Guiana".''

The Treaty provided the legal framework, procedures and conditions for the Tribunal in order to solve the issue and reach to determinate a border. Its third article established that ''"The Tribunal shall investigate and ascertain the extent of the territories belonging to, or that might lawfully be claimed by the United Netherlands or by the Kingdom of Spain respectively at the time of the acquisition by Great Britain of the Colony of British Guiana, and shall determine the boundary line between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela"''. The Treaty also established the rules and principles to be followed by the Tribunal in order to draw the borderline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/GB-VE_970202_Treaty%20of%20Arbitration.pdf Treaty of arbitration between Venezuela and Great Britain, signed at Washington and dated the second day of February, 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arbitration===
Venezuela argued that Spain–whose territory they had acquired–controlled land from the [[Orinoco River]] to the [[Amazon River]] in present day [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Spain, according to Venezuela, only designated its claimed Guiana territory to the Dutch, which did not include much land within the disputed territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, Britain, who had acquired the Dutch territory, stated that the disputed Guiana region was not Spanish because it was so remote and uncontrolled, explaining that the original natives in the land had shared the territory's land with the Dutch instead of the Spanish and were thus under Dutch and British influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The rival claims were presented to a tribunal of five arbitrators: two from Britain, two from the US (representing Venezuela's interest) and one from [[Russia]], who were presumed neutral. Venezuela reiterated its claim to the district immediately west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near its junction with the [[Mazaruni River]], and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the [[Brazil]]ian border. 

On 3 October 1899 the Tribunal [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895#Arbitration|ruled largely in favour of Britain]]. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Humphreys" /&gt; One deviation was that Venezuela received [[Barima Point]] at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the [[Wenamu River]] rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the [[gold]] mines.&lt;ref&gt;King (2007:260)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venezuelan representatives, claiming that Britain had unduly influenced the decision of the Russian member of the tribunal, protested the outcome. Periodic protests, however, were confined to the domestic political arena and international diplomatic forums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/venezuela/forrel-guyana.htm Globalsecurity.org, "Venezuela - Guyana Relations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed disputes==
{{neutral|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Essequiborivermap.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Guyana, showing the [[Essequibo River]] and (shaded dark) the river's drainage basin. Venezuela claims territory up to the western bank of the river. The historical claim by the UK included the river basin well into current-day Venezuela.]]

=== Immediate reactions ===
In 1899, immediately after the arbitration ruling, the US counsel for Venezuela were interviewed jointly, and pointed out their first claims against the ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Great Britain, up to the time of the intervention of the United States, distinctly refused to arbitrate any portion of the territory east of the Schomburgk line, alleging that its title was unassailable. This territory included the Attacuri river and Point Barima, which is of the greatest value strategically and commercially. The award  gives Point Barima, with a strip of land fifty miles long, to Venezuela, which thereby obtains entire control of the River Orinoco. Three thousand square miles in the interior are also awarded to Venezuela. Thus, by a decision in which the British arbitrators concurred, the position taken by Great Britain in 1895 is shown to be unfounded [...] The President of the tribunal in his closing address today had commented upon the unanimity of the present judgment and had referred to it as a proof of the success of the arbitration, but it did not require much intelligence to penetrate behind this superficial statement and to see that the line drawn is a line of compromise and not a line of right. If the British contention was right, the line should have been drawn further west; if it were wrong, the line should have been drawn much further east. There was nothing in the history of the controversy, nor in the legal principle involved, which could adequately explain why the line should be drawn where it had been. So long as arbitration was conducted on such principles, it could not be regarded as a success, at least by those who believe that arbitration should result in the admission of legal rights and not in compromises really diplomatic in character. Venezuela had gained much, but was entitled to much more, and if the arbitrators were unanimous, it must be because their failure to agree would have confirmed Great Britain in the possession of even more territory".''&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=37&amp;dat=18991004&amp;id=tV0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tigDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3846,6830090 "Venezuelan Award: the decision of the Commission regarded as a Compromise"], in ''Saint John Daily Sun'', Canada. October 4, 1899. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Venezuelan government showed almost immediate disapproval with the 1899 Arbitral Award. As early as October 7, 1899 Venezuela voiced her condemnation of the Award, and demanded the renegotiation of her eastern border with British Guiana: that day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister José Andrade made clear that the Arbitral Award was the product of political collusion and it should not be adhered to by Venezuela. After numerous bilateral diplomatic attempts failed to convince Great Britain of her seriousness to nullify the award, Venezuela denounced it before the first assembly of the United Nations, in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Kissler, Betty Jane, ''Venezuela-Guyana boundary dispute :1899-1966'', University of Texas (USA, 1972). pages 166, 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad, ''Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary Decisions'', Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law (Cambridge University, U.K., 2007). p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged conspiracy of judges ===
On October 26, 1899 in a letter to a colleague, [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle|Severo Mallet-Prevost]], the Official Secretary of the US–Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration, stated that the Arbitral Award was the result of pressures brought on the judges by the President of the Tribunal, [[Friedrich Martens]]. By 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death. Mallet-Prevost surmised from the private behavior of the judges that there had a political deal between Russia and Britain,&lt;ref name=Schoenrich&gt;Schoenrich, Otto, "The Venezuela-British Guiana Boundary Dispute", July 1949, ''American Journal of International Law''. Vol. 43, No. 3. p. 523. Washington, DC. (USA).&lt;/ref&gt; and said that the Russian chair of the panel, Friedrich Martens, had visited Britain with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3 to 2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3 to 2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory.&lt;ref name=Schoenrich/&gt; This memorandum provided further evidence for Venezuela's contentions that there had in fact been a political deal between the British judges and the Russian judge at the Arbitral Tribunal, and led to Venezuela's revival of its claim to the disputed territory.&lt;ref&gt;Isidro Morales Paúl, ''Análisis Crítico del Problema Fronterizo "Venezuela-Gran Bretaña"'', in La Reclamación Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Económicas y Sociales. [[Caracas]], 2000, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/VENEZUELA/GUYANA/Venezuela/reanuda/reclamacion/Esequibo/elpepiint/19820616elpepiint_7/Tes/ de Rituerto, Ricardo M. ''Venezuela reanuda su reclamación sobre el Esequibo''], ''El País'', Madrid, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1962 ===
Venezuela formally raised the issue again at an international level before the United Nations in 1962, four years before Guyana won independence from Britain. Venezuela cited the alleged Russia-UK deal noted above as an offence of collusion, as well as several improprieties and vices in the ruling, especially ''[[Ultra Vires]]'', due to the fact that the referees drew the border between British Guiana, Brazil and [[Suriname]], and also decreed freedom of navigation in the [[Amacuro River|Amacuro]] and [[Barima River|Barima]] rivers, exceeding the scope of powers granted by the arbitration treaty, in 1897.

The Venezuelan claim of the nullity of the 1899 ruling has been acknowledged by several foreign scholars and jurists, such as J. Gillis Wetter of [[Sweden]], in his work ''The International Arbitral Process'' (1979), awarded by the [[American Society of International Law]]. By searching on the British official archives, Wetter provided further evidence of the shady deal between Britain and Russia, what made him conclude that the ruling was marred by serious procedural and substantive defects, evidence that it was more a political compromise than a court ruling. [[Uruguay]]an jurist Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga, former President of the [[International Court of Justice]], came to similar conclusions.

===Treaty of Geneva===
{{main|Treaty of Geneva (1966)}}
At a meeting in [[Geneva]] on February 17, 1966, the governments of British Guiana, the United Kingdom and Venezuela signed the "Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana", best known thereafter as the [[Treaty of Geneva (1966)]]. This agreement established the regulatory framework to be followed by the parties in order to resolve the issue. According to the treaty, a Mixed Commission was installed with the purpose of seeking satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the border controversy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://peacemaker.un.org/guyana-venezuela-border66 Treaty of Geneva 1966], Document Retrieval, UN Department of Political Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; but the parties never agreed to implement a solution within this Commission due to different interpretations of the treaty.

*Guyana argued that prior to starting the negotiations over the border issue, Venezuela should prove that the Arbitral Award of 1899 was null and void. Guyana did not accept that the 1899 decision was invalid, and held that its participation on the commission was only to resolve Venezuela's assertions. 
*Rather than that, the Venezuelan counterparts argued that the Commission did not have a juridical nature or purpose but a deal-making one, so it should go ahead to find "a practical and satisfactory solution", as agreed in the treaty. Venezuela also claimed that the nullity of the Arbitral Award of 1899 was implicit, or otherwise the existence of the treaty would be meaningless.

The fifth article of the Treaty of Geneva established the status of the disputed territories. The provisions state that no acts or activities taking place on the disputed territories while the Agreement is in force "shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty". The treaty also has a provision prohibiting both nations from pursuing the issue except through official inter-government channels.

In its note of recognition of the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Annexation of Ankoko Island===
Despite signing the Geneva Agreement in February 1966, aimed at resolving the border controversy, which provided that "no new claim or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty in these territories (in Venezuela and British Guiana) shall be asserted while this agreement is in force, nor shall any claim whatsoever be asserted otherwise than in the Mixed Commission while that Commission is in being", Venezuela, a few months after signing the agreement sent a well-armed group of soldiers along with civilians and encroached upon and occupied territory by Guyana side of the border.  This encroachment occurred, unknowing to Guyana Government, on the half of the island of Ankoko that Guyana claims as its own at the confluence of the boundary rivers, Cuyuni and Wenamu (Wenamo). It took the form of the introduction of military and civilian personnel and the establishment of an airstrip and the erection of other installations and structures, including a post office, school and military and police outposts. The incursion on the territory on Ankoko Island claimed by Guyana as its own by Venezuela was reported to the Guyanese authorities early in October 1966 by a diamond prospector who was in that forested and almost uninhabited area at the time. As a result, a Guyanese team of senior officials, including police officers, visited the vicinity on 12 October 1966 and verified that Venezuelan personnel were allegedly occupying the Guyana claimed side of the island where they had already constructed an airstrip.

===Rupununi Uprising===
In 1969, three years after the independence of Guyana, a group of local ranchers and Amerindians in the town of [[Lethem, Guyana|Lethem]] broke out in open armed rebellion against the Guyanese government, and tried to secede. This event, called the [[Rupununi Uprising]], was controlled by the Guyanese armed forces, which then accused Venezuela of supporting the rebellion. The Venezuelan government denied such allegations, although some of the ranchers involved were given refuge in her territory thereafter. Since they were born in Guayana Esequiba, the ranchers claimed entitlement to the Venezuelan citizenship and the government granted it.

===Port of Spain Protocol===
In 1970, after the expiration of the Mixed Commission established according to the Treaty of Geneva, Presidents [[Rafael Caldera]] and [[Forbes Burnham]] signed the Port of Spain Protocol, which declared a 12-year moratorium on Venezuela's reclamation of Guayana Esequiba, with the purpose of allowing both governments to promote cooperation and understanding while the border claim was in abeyance. Venezuelan maps produced since 1970 show the entire area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the "Zone in Reclamation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Ishmael, Dr. Odeen. "The Trail of Diplomacy - A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President [[Luis Herrera Campins]] decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory. Since then, the contacts between Venezuela and Guyana within the provisions of the Treaty of Geneva are under the recommendations of a [[UN Secretary General]]'s representative, who can be changed from time to time under agreement by both parties.&lt;ref name=Geneva/&gt; Diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative continue, but there have been some clashes. The Norwegian [[Dag Nylander]] appointed in March 2017, is the latest personal representative in these efforts selected by the UN Secretary General [[António Guterres]]. If by December, 2017 the UN understands that there is no "significant progress" in resolving the dispute, Guterres will refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, unless the two countries explicitly request it not to do so.

===Recent disputes===
[[File:Localizador Politico Venezuela.svg|thumb|Map of Venezuela, showing the maritime areas in blue and Guayana Esequiba in gray.]]

In September 2011, Guyana made an application before the United Nations' [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] in order to extend its continental shelf by a further {{convert|150|NM}}. Since the Commission requests that the areas to be considered cannot be subject to any kind of territorial disputes, the Guyanese application disregarded the Venezuelan claim over Guayana Esequiba, by saying that "there are no disputes in the region relevant to this submission of data and information relating to the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond {{convert|200|NM|disp=sqbr}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minfor.gov.gy/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=50|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guyana|title=Press Release in Response to Venezuela's Objection to Guyana's Submission to the CLCS|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela sent an objection to the Commission, rejecting the Guyanese application and warning that Guyana had proposed a limit for its continental shelf including "the territory west of the Essequibo river, which is the subject of a territorial sovereignty dispute under the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and, within this framework, a matter for the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations". Venezuela also said that Guyana consulted its neighbors [[Barbados]], [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] before making the application, but did not do the same with Venezuela. "Such a lack of consultation with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, serious in itself in that it violates the relevant rules, is inexplicable in so far as the coast whose projection is used by the Republic of Guyana in its attempt to extend the limits forms part of the disputed territory over which Venezuela demands and reiterates its claim to sovereignty rights", said the Venezuelan communiqué.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/guy57_11/clcs57_2011_ven_e.pdf|publisher=UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS)|title=Communication received with regard to the submission made by Guyana to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf|date=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guyana has also awarded oil exploration rights in the disputed maritime areas, which has caused clashes with Venezuela. On October 10, 2013, the [[Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela|Venezuelan Navy]] detained an oil exploration vessel conducting seafloor surveys on behalf of the government of Guyana. The ship and its crew were escorted to the Venezuelan [[Margarita Island]] to be prosecuted. The Guyanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the vessel was in Guyanese waters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/news/stories/10/12/govt-protests-after-venezuela-holds-oil-research-boat/|title=Gov’t protests after Venezuela holds oil research boat|newspaper=Stabroek News|date=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its Venezuelan counterpart sent a diplomatic note to Guyana stating that the ship was conducting oil research in Venezuelan waters with no authorization from the country, and demanded an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131011/venezuela-deplores-incursion-of-vessel-under-guyanas-authorization|title=Venezuela deplores incursion of vessel under Guyana's authorization|newspaper=El Universal|date=October 11, 2013|access-date=October 12, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131012101543/http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131011/venezuela-deplores-incursion-of-vessel-under-guyanas-authorization|archive-date=October 12, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel, ''Teknik Perdana'', together with its crew, was released the next week, but its captain was charged with violating the Venezuelan exclusive economic zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24536713#TWEET923493 |title=Venezuela frees seized US-operated ship Teknik Perdana |date=15 October 2013 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=The BBC |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela considers the maritime areas in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] where the vessel was conducting its operations part of its "Atlantic front". In accordance with the border treaty signed between Venezuela and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/TTO-VEN1990SA.PDF|publisher=United Nations|title=Treaty between the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and the Republic of Venezuela on the delimitation of marine and submarine areas|date=18 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela has a long Atlantic front as is shown in its official maps, regardless of its claim over Guayana Esequiba.

Despite diplomatic protests from Venezuela, the government of Guyana awarded the American oil corporation [[Exxon]] a license to drill for oil in the disputed maritime area in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guyana says Exxon to begin offshore drilling, Venezuela irked|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/guyana-exxon-mobil-idUSL1N0W72RE20150305|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the government of Guyana announced that Exxon had indeed found promising results in their first round of drilling on the so-called Stabroek Block, an area offshore the Guayana Esequiba territory with a size of {{convert|26800|km2|abbr=on}}. The company announced that further drillings would take place in the coming months to better evaluate the potential of the oil field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ExxonMobil|title=ExxonMobil Announces Significant Oil Discovery Offshore Guyana|url=http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-announces-significant-oil-discovery-offshore-guyana|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela responded to the declaration with a decree issued on May 27, 2015, including the maritime area in dispute in its national marine protection sphere, thus extending the area that the [[Venezuelan Navy]] controls into the disputed area. This in turn caused the government of Guyana to summon the Venezuelan ambassador for further explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canciller guyanés convocará a embajadora venezolana|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/150608/canciller-guyanes-convocara-a-embajadora-venezolana|newspaper=El Universal|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tensions have further intensified since and Guyana withdrew the operating license of [[Conviasa]], the Venezuelan national airline, stranding a plane and passengers in Georgetown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead Link|date=October 2017|cite news|title=Guyana suspende entrada de vuelos de la aerolínea venezolana Conviasa|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/150607/guyana-suspende-entrada-de-vuelos-de-la-aerolinea-venezolana-conviasa|newspaper=El Universal|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: יד ביד: המרכז לחינוך יהודי ערבי בישראל, [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: يدا بيد: مركز التربية اليهودي العربي في إسرائيل) is a network of integrated, bilingual schools for Jewish and Arab children in Israel. Hand in Hand was co-founded by Israeli Arab educator Amin Khalaf and Israeli American educator Lee Gordon in 1997 with 50 students at two campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iie.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Programs7/Goldberg_Prize/Goldberg_Prize_2007_Press_Release.htm  "IIE AWARDS PRIZE TO FOUNDERS OF BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL SCHOOLS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012200139/http://iie.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Programs7/Goldberg_Prize/Goldberg_Prize_2007_Press_Release.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}, International Institute of Education, Press Release, June 14, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand in Hand's mission is to create a strong and inclusive shared society in Israel through a network of integrated, bilingual schools and active communities. The organization's philosophy is that the actual living experience of its students, teachers, parents and others who participate in its schools and communities can inspire broad support for social inclusion and civic equality in Israel.

Hand in Hand now operates four schools with more than 900 Jewish and Arab students; next year there will be 5 schools with 1100+ students. More than 3,000 parents and other adults, Jews and Arabs alike, currently participate in integrated community activities organized by Hand in Hand.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Over the next 10 years, Hand in Hand aims to create a network of 10 to 15 integrated bilingual schools, supported and enhanced by active communities, altogether involving more than 20,000 Israeli citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} .

==History==
[[image:Galileeschool-exterior.jpg|thumb|Hand in Hand's Galilee School]]
[[image:Kids-threeboys.jpg|thumb|Students from Hand in Hand's Galilee School]]

Hand in Hand was founded in 1997 by two Israeli educators, one Arab and one Jewish. They started the first two schools in 1998, one in the Galilee region near the [[Misgav Regional Council]] and one in Jerusalem. These first two schools grew, and in the summer of 2003, a group of interested parents from the [[Wadi Ara]] region in the [[Arab Triangle]] met to express interest in establishing a third Hand in Hand School in their region.

After delays, which included difficulty winning recognition from the Israeli [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of Education]], the "Bridge over the Wadi" (''Gesher al haWadi'', Hebrew:  גשר על הואדי) school opened on September 1, 2004, with 106 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/bin/en.jsp?enZone=Democracy&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enPage=BlankPage&amp;enDispWhat=object&amp;enDispWho=Articles%5El773 Daniel Ben Tal, "Israeli bilingual school bridges the gap between 'Shalom' and 'Salaam'", Israel 21c, September 5, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The teachers come from Jewish and Arab towns in the area.

Hand in Hand's fourth school opened in September 2007 in the city of [[Beer Sheva]]. This school is now fully independent of Hand in Hand.

On October 21, 2007, Hand in Hand's [[Max Rayne]] school opened in Jerusalem's [[Pat, Jerusalem|Pat]] neighborhood near the Arab village of [[Beit Safafa]]. The new campus was built with $11 million from donors including the [[Jerusalem Foundation]], the Rayne Foundation, and other European donors.

In 2012, a preschool was opened in the urban area of [[Haifa]], with a kindergarten in 2013.

Hand in Hand has also partnered with Project Harmony Israel &lt;ref&gt;http://www.projectharmonyisrael.com&lt;/ref&gt; since 2010 to provide an English immersion summer camp for Hand in Hand students as well as students from around Jerusalem.

==Conflict==
===2014 arson attack in Jerusalem===
In November 2014 the Hand in Hand Max Rayne School was subjected to an arson, suspected of being a hate crime that was racially motivated. The school was also defaced with anti-Arab slogans such as "Death to Arabs" and "[[Meir Kahane|Kahane]] was right!" Shortly thereafter, the "Tag Meir" coexistence organization held a support rally to counter those who threatening Arab-Jewish cooperation and promoting [[racism in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dvir, Noam'Day after arson at school: 'Students forced to understand meaning of hate crime'' (Nov 30, 2014) YNET"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4597791,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamad Marzouk, head of communications for the Hand in Hand school in Kfar Qara, noted that the attack brought out a show of community support for the school. In the minds of many people the arson, he said, "crossed a red line."&lt;ref&gt;"Steinberg, Jessica 'Hundreds march for coexistence after Jewish-Arab school arson: Following attack on Hand in Hand bilingual school in Jerusalem, rally-goers say hatred has crossed red lines' (Dec 5, 2014) The Times of Israel" http://www.timesofisrael.com/hundreds-march-for-coexistence-after-jewish-arab-school-arson/&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli police arrested a number of suspects in connection with this arson attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Police-Arrests-made-in-arson-of-bilingual-Hebrew-Arabic-school-in-Jerusalem-383901 | title=Police: Arrests made in arson of bilingual Hebrew-Arabic school in Jerusalem | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the arrest, the mother of one of the suspects said she would have burned the school as well, if it were not illegal to do so, and she expressed disgust and revulsion that Jews and Arabs studied together at the school.&lt;ref&gt;"Dvir, Noam 'Mother of suspect in arson at bilingual school: I would have done the same; Woman expresses disgust that school teaches both Jews and Arabs, calls suspects 'good kids' with haredi education.'

===Aftermath of attack===
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, along with his wife Nechama, invited the Hand in Hand first graders to his official residence along with their teachers. He told them: "“I am excited to welcome you to the President’s Residence. You are proof that we can live side by side in peace, and we must not let difficult experiences - such as the one you have been through - harm our belief in our ability to coexist.”&lt;ref&gt;"Hasson, Nir 'President Rivlin hosts students of attacked Jewish-Arab school:President welcomes first-graders and teachers from Hand in Hand, tells them, 'You are proof that we can live side by side in peace.'

==International recognition==
In December 2014 the [[White House]] commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne schools and invited two of its students to join U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] as they welcomed over 500 guests to the White House Hanukkah celebration. Each of the branches on the multi-colored wooden menorah represents one of the schools' values: Community, Education, Freedom, Human Dignity, Peace, Equality, Solidarity, and Friendship.&lt;ref&gt;"'Jerusalem school hit by arson creates menorah used at White House Hanukka event' (19 Dec 2014) jerusalem Post" http://www.jpost.com/International/Jerusalem-school-hit-by-arson-attack-creates-menorah-for-White-House-Hanukka-event{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama said these "students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That’s what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It’s what our young people can teach us— that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.”&lt;ref&gt;"Arab-Jewish school's menorah lights up White House Hanukkah party | The Times of Israel" http://www.timesofisrael.com/hand-in-hand-schools-menorah-lights-up-white-house-hanukkah-party/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
[[image:Twoteachers.jpg|thumb|Two Hand in Hand teachers]]
The Hand in Hand philosophy stems from the observation that Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel live separately from one another in virtually all aspects of daily life. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This separation is particularly obvious in the K-12 public education system, which is based on separate schools for Jews and Arabs. Although children may legally attend either type of school, the fact is that only a few Arab children attend Jewish schools (where the primary language of instruction is Hebrew), and essentially no Jewish children attend Arab schools (where the primary language of instruction is Arabic).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The separation of the communities, and the barriers to communication carry through to other aspects of adult life.

In 1998, Hand in Hand began establishing a network of schools with integrated student populations, integrated teaching and supervisory staffs, and a bilingual educational curriculum and methodology. From the beginning, Hand in Hand has been committed to maintaining its schools as part of the Israeli public education system: operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Education, using a core curriculum based on Ministry of Education-approved content, and receiving substantial core funding from the Ministry of Education budget.

To this Ministry of Education core, Hand in Hand has added special elements to implement the bilingual education and social values that are its reason for being:

•	Both Hebrew and Arabic are primary languages of instruction (often with dual teachers in a single classroom);

•	The curriculum includes extra content to acknowledge and respect the traditions, history, values, holidays, and culture of all students (Jewish, Christian and Muslim); and

•	Specialized guidance and mentoring help students, teachers, and parents express empathy and mutual respect in the most difficult of circumstances.

Starting with two kindergarten classes and about 50 children in 1998, Hand in Hand had grown by 2011 to three schools with more than 900 children, covering grades levels K-12. Over the years, these three schools have demonstrated some truly outstanding academic achievements, and they will enroll over 1100 students in the fall of 2013. Also this fall, two new kindergartens (Haifa and Tel Aviv/Jaffa) will open; each one has pre-registration of many more students (both Jews and Arabs) than can be accepted in the space available.

==Shared Communities==
During 2012, Hand in Hand established active integrated communities of adults to support and amplify the impact of its schools. With core funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Hand in Hand launched communities in all five locations where it will have schools this fall. These communities are engaged in a wide variety of activities: from competing in adult sports leagues (where they may have the only integrated team); to participating in adult education programs focused on learning each other’s language, culture and traditions; to engaging in activities that might be directly tied to a school (such as establishing a vegetable garden tended by parents and children). These activities may not seem very important in themselves, but the fact that they are undertaken in the context of a structured, continuing, and integrated community makes them very special in Israel. Hand in Hand believes that these visibly integrated shared communities will not only help its schools succeed, but will also show the broader public that social inclusion does not end with graduation from high school.

==The Future==
{{Advert|section|date=August 2015}}
In the coming years, Hand in Hand plans to expand its two-pronged approach to building support for social inclusion and civic equality in Israeli society:

* The five current schools (including the new preschools in Haifa &amp; Tel Aviv/Jaffa) will grow year-by-year, both in grade level and number of students. And new integrated bilingual schools will be established in appropriate locations. Eventually, 10 to 15 Hand in Hand schools will form a strong network of integrated bilingual schools across Israel; and hopefully that network will include schools established by other NGOs and perhaps directly by governmental authorities.
* Active shared communities will be initiated and sustained in every location where there is a school. In 10 years, these communities, plus the students, parents and teachers directly involved in the schools, should include some 20,000+ individuals who have visibly chosen to live important parts of their daily lives through institutions that embody the values of a shared, inclusive and equal society – values that were the foundation of the State of Israel.

This is an ambitious but achievable plan.  It will require the hard work, steadfast commitment, and good will of thousands of Israeli citizens. It will also require the support of all who care about Israel’s future and who believe that future depends on building a society that includes all citizens on a fair, welcoming and equal basis.

The '''Image of Chile Foundation''', or '''Fundación Imagen de Chile''' in Spanish, is an organization that coordinates work carried out to promote Chile abroad.

== Organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagendechile.cl/quienes-somos/estructura/ Estructura de la Fundación] imagendechile.cl retrieved on July 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;==

The Foundation is a private [[nonprofit organization]] created on 8 May 2009. It is governed by a [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]], which defines its overall policies and courses of action. The board consists of 19 members: the Minister of Foreign Affairs (who presides), the Minister of the Economy, the President of the [[National Council of Culture and the Arts (Chile)|National Council of Culture and the Arts]] ("Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes"), and 16 other members elected by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Although the Foundation is a private organization, its board of directors is formed and presided over by government ministers, applies and complies with state policies, and is funded by public resources.

Its mission is to “promote the country internationally" and it carries out this mission by guiding, advising and supporting public and private organizations and individuals whose initiatives aim to enhance and promote the image and reputation of Chile, in an increasingly competitive international context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagendechile.cl/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Estatutos-web.pdf ESTATUTOS, “FUNDACIÓN IMAGEN DE CHILE”] ESTATUTOS, “FUNDACIÓN IMAGEN DE CHILE” consultado en Julio 1, 2015
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role and main goal ===

The role of the Foundation is to manage the [[Nation branding|nation’s brand]] ("marca país"), organizing the work of the main entities that contribute to the country's image, such as [[Culture of Chile|culture]], [[Sport in Chile|sports]], [[Economy of Chile#Foreign trade|exports]], [[investment]], [[Tourism in Chile|tourism]] and [[international relations]], among others.

It develops alliances with stakeholders in the [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s, in order to create one unified message about Chile and promote the distinctive attributes of Chile's identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagendechile.cl/quienes-somos/presentacion/ Quienes somos (Who are we)] imagendechile.cl retrieved on July 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary goal

The main task of the Foundation is to manage the country’s brand, 
increasing the positive impression Chile makes with other nations. To achieve this, it implements activities designed to strengthen the country’s reputation, highlighting Chile’s distinctive qualities, and speaks on behalf of the public and private sectors to position Chile on the highly competitive global stage. In doing so, the Foundation aims to expand and consolidate opportunities to attract talent, exports, foreign investment, tourism, international relations, social and cultural links, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagendechile.cl/marca-chile/la-estrategia/ Estrategia (Strategy)] imagendechile.cl retrieved on July 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Information Security Department logo.gif|thumb|right|111px|The ISD logo]]
The '''Information Security Department''' ({{lang-he-n|המערך לביטחון מידע}}, ''HaMa'arakh LeVithon Meida'', abbreviated to ''Mahbam'') is a department in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' [[Aman (IDF)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]], responsible for preventing [[classified information]] from being compromised by unauthorized elements. It was formerly known as the Field Security Department.

The Department engages in the study of enemy [[military intelligence]], providing security briefings, securing classified information, and teaching and enforcement activities related to [[information security]]. Most of the security breaches that take place are in the area of [[computing]] (including the [[Internet]]), and the securing of documents. The Department absorbs about 450 new Information Security [[non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] annually. Its members serve in all branches of the IDF.

He was one of four [[Vice Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|vice-presidents]] in the transitional government of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 17 July 2003 to December 2006.

==Background==
Bemba was born in Bokada, [[Nord-Ubangi]].&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt;  His father, [[Jeannot Bemba Saolona]], was a businessman who was successful under [[Zaire|Zairian]] President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], and one of his sisters is married to Mobutu's son [[Nzanga Mobutu|Nzanga]], who was also a candidate in the 2006 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Wagner, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/aug2006/cong-a25.shtml "Run-off ballot in the Congo"], World Socialist Web Site, 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MLC in Équateur==
The MLC movement started in the [[Orientale Province]] of the DRC in 1998 at the beginning of the [[Second Congo War]]. Little by little, the movement moved into the [[Équateur (former province)|Équateur]] province, and established a permanent base in [[Gbadolite]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ajpba.org/pdf/20110629.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This region had been decimated by war and the population was living in great poverty. Équateur was under an embargo: healthcare programs, education, and any kind of social assistance had been abandoned. The population was under constant threat of bombing by government forces, and had stopped producing goods or food.

When the MLC troops arrived in Gbadolite, they secured the area and protected the population. Health centres and hospitals re-opened with the MLC securing safe passage for medicine and other supplies. The MLC worked with NGOs and the UN to reopen schools, restart agriculture, economic activity and exportations of goods. The population was able to sell coffee, corn and soya and build businesses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icc-cpi.int/Transcripts/CR2016_04024.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legal-tools.org/doc/297cf6/pdf/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the Central African Republic==

In 2002, President [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] of the [[Central African Republic]] invited the MLC to come to his country and put down a coup attempt. Human rights activists accused MLC fighters of committing atrocities against civilians in the course of this conflict.

==Vice President==
In 2003 Bemba became vice-president under a peace deal.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==2006 Presidential election==
Bemba was one of 33 candidates who ran in the Congolese [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|presidential election]] on 30 July 2006. His main campaign slogan — "One Hundred Percent Congolese" — was widely perceived as an attack on frontrunner President [[Joseph Kabila]].&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/15/AR2006081500718.html "Vote Count Continues in Congo Election"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 15 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bemba received substantial support in the western, [[Lingala language|Lingala]]-speaking portion of the country, including the capital, [[Kinshasa]].&lt;ref name="Alliances"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55218&amp;SelectRegion=Great_Lakes&amp;SelectCountry=DRC "Frontrunners need alliances for 2nd round of presidential polls"], IRIN, 22 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the vote there was significant tension as to whether  Kabila would win a majority of the vote, avoiding a runoff against Bemba, who was perceived as Kabila's main opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55173&amp;SelectRegion=Great_Lakes "Tension ahead of election results"], IRIN, 18 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, results announced on 20 August gave Kabila 44% of the vote and Bemba 20%,&lt;ref name="Alliances"/&gt; 

On 21 August 2006, while accompanied by 14 ambassadors of CIAT members (International Committee in charge of the Transition), including ambassadors from the United States of America, Britain, France (Bernard Prévost) and Belgium ({{ILL|Johan Swinnen|de|Johan Swinnen (Diplomat)}}), and from MONUC, US diplomat [[William L. Swing]], Bemba survived an assassination attempt by the Presidential Guard bombing his residence in Gombe. The ambassadors were forced to seek refuge in a cellar.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Tensions Kabila-Bemba en 2006 et 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2006-08-23/Les-partisans-de-Kabila-et-Bemba-s-affrontent-dans-Kinshasa-_NP_-2006-08-23-270210|title=Les partisans de Kabila et Bemba s'affrontent dans Kinshasa|date=23 August 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018|via=www.la-croix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kabila and Bemba faced each other in a second round, held on 29 October.

A further attempt on Bemba's life in March 2007 led to an outbreak of fighting near Bemba's residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=136&amp;art_id=nw20070322153441459C201618 "Sustained gunfire reported in Congo's capital"], Associated Press (''IOL''), 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A number of soldiers and civilians were reported killed.

On 26 March, Kabila said that security could not be guaranteed through negotiation and referred to the importance of restoring order. Bemba warned of a potential for dictatorship and forshadowed his retreat into exile, citing security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=nw20070326220308692C333630 "Kabila defends use of force as clashes go on"], AFP (''IOL''), 26 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the month it was reported that Bemba planned to travel to [[Portugal]] for treatment of a broken leg; he had already received treatment for his leg there in previous months.

==Arrest and trial==
[[File:J.P.BembaPoster.JPG|thumb|right|Poster announcing a protest in [[Brussels]] to support Bemba after his arrest.]] In March 2003, Central African president [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] was ousted, and the government that replaced him pressed charges against Patassé and Bemba in September 2004. International arrest warrants were issued, but because the new government was unable to have Bemba arrested, the matter was referred to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). On 22 May 2007, ICC prosecutor [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] decided to open investigations into crimes committed in the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2007/05/22/carepu15980.htm|title=Central African Republic: ICC Opens Investigation (Human Rights Watch, 22-5-2007)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2008, a pre-trial chamber of the ICC found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Bemba bore individual criminal responsibility for [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] committed in the Central African Republic between 25 October 2002 and 15 March 2003, and issued a sealed warrant for his arrest.&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt;  He was charged with five counts of war crimes ([[murder]], [[rape]], [[torture]], [[pillaging]], and outrages upon personal dignity) and three counts of crimes against humanity (murder, rape and torture).&lt;ref name=surrender/&gt;

On 24 May 2008, Bemba was arrested near [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arrested&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/25/content_8248030.htm "Former Congo rebel leader arrested for war crimes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528150320/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/25/content_8248030.htm |date=28 May 2008 }}, Xinhua, 25 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7418932.stm  "Former DR Congo leader arrested"], BBC World News, 24 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was handed over to the ICC on 3 July 2008 and transferred to its detention centre in the Hague.&lt;ref name=surrender&gt;International Criminal Court (3 July 2008).

The MLC denounced the arrest and requested that Parliament do likewise; it also asked that Parliament call on the Belgian government to respect Bemba's immunity as a senator under Congolese law. MLC official {{ILL|Delly Sesanga|fr}} accused ICC prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo of trying "to interfere with the internal businesses of Congo", describing such interference as "unacceptable"; Sesanga also said that, although the prosecution claimed Bemba was a flight risk, there had been no indication of that. More than 2,000 supporters of Bemba protested in Kinshasa on 27 May, demanding that he be freed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=vn20080528055308742C226180 "Uproar in DRC after Bemba is arrested"], ''The Star'' (''IOL''), 28 May 2008, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bemba's defense argued that the legal procedures applied to Bemba's case were irregular, but on 1 July a Belgian court rejected this argument, making it possible to transfer Bemba to the ICC. Meanwhile, MLC official Fyfy Osambia argued that "the matter has been politicised" and that people "close to President Kabila" were responsible for the complaint against Bemba. He said that Bemba should be allowed to go before the ICC without being a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iH3_oKv2qGOw-Z5mSSXcXXdh4SkA "Belgian court clears way for Bemba transfer to war crimes court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707123918/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iH3_oKv2qGOw-Z5mSSXcXXdh4SkA |date=7 July 2009 }}, AFP, 1 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Belgian court ruling, Bemba was transferred to the ICC in [[The Hague]] on 3 July. In a hearing on 4 July, Bemba made his first appearance at the ICC, and the beginning of a hearing dealing with confirmation of the charges against him was set for 4 November.

'''Kenneth Alfred Ham''' (born 20 October 1951) is an Australian-born [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] and [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] living in the United States. He is the president of [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG), a [[creationist apologetics]] organization that operates the [[Creation Museum]] and the [[Ark Encounter]].

Ham advocates [[biblical literalism]], believing that the [[Book of Genesis]] is historical fact and the universe is approximately 6,000 years old,{{refn|group=n|name=Note1|In ''How Do We Know the Bible is True?'' Ham and Hodge wrote: "The biblical age of the earth is determined by adding up the genealogies from Adam ...to Christ. This is about 4000 years...Christ lived about 2000 years ago, so this gives us about 6000 years as the biblical age of the earth." (p. 110). "I hold to that belief because I trust the Bible over the reasoning of man." (p. 109). "Some mainstream scientists have calculated the age of the earth at approximately 4.5 billion years... Rejecting literal days of creation naturally leads to the acceptance of the supposed big bang as the evolutionary method God used to create the universe. Although we can simply add up the ages of the patriarch mentioned in the Genesis 5 and 11 genealogies to arrive at a date after creation for Abraham who lived about 4000 years ago, many reject this as a reasonable way of determining the timing of creation." (p. 110). "Surely God is free to accomplish miracles within the world He created, so this should not be a problem for those who believe what God has revealed through the Scriptures. But neither should creating the universe in six days or causing the entire globe to be flooded..." (p. 113).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ham |first1= Ken |last2= Hodge |first2= Bodie |title= How Do We Know the Bible is True? |year= 2012 |location= Green Forest, AR |publisher= [[Institute for Creation Research|New Leaf]] |isbn= 9780890516614 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=vqh7yUCgEGcC&amp;pg=PA108 108–10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} contrary to multiple individual lines of [[scientific evidence]] which show the [[age of the Earth|Earth]] is about 4.5 billion years old and [[age of the universe|the universe]] is about 13.8 billion years old.&lt;ref name="USGS1997"&gt;{{cite web| date=1997 | title=Age of the Earth| url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html | publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | accessdate=10 January 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051223072700/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html| archivedate= 23 December 2005 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/age.html |title=Age of the Universe |first= |last= |work=astro.ucla.edu |year=2012 |accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ham was born 20 October 1951 in [[Cairns]], Australia.&lt;ref name="Communications1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Communications|first=Emmis|title=Cincinnati Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7u0CAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 |date=October 1998|publisher=Emmis Communications|pages=80– |accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Mervyn, was a Christian educator who served as a school principal in several schools throughout [[Queensland]].&lt;ref name="Ham2008"&gt;Ham, K. &amp; Ham, S.

Ham earned a [[Bachelor of Applied Science]], with an emphasis in [[Environmental Biology]] at [[Queensland Institute of Technology]] and a Diploma in Education from the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stephens |first1=Randall J. |last2=Giberson |first2=Karl |title=The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age |year=2011 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VKyCOhWWHD8C&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} See also listing at [https://books.google.com/books?id=VKyCOhWWHD8C&amp;q=Queensland+Institute#v=snippet&amp;q=Queensland%20Institute&amp;f=false Google Books.]&lt;/ref&gt; While at university, he was influenced by [[John C. Whitcomb]] and [[Henry M. Morris]]'s 1961 book ''[[The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications|The Genesis Flood]]''.&lt;ref name="Ham2008"/&gt; Upon graduation in 1975, Ham began teaching science at a high school in [[Dalby, Queensland]].&lt;ref name=racm9/&gt;

==Career==
{{See also|Answers in Genesis|Creation Museum}}
In 1977, Ham began teaching at a high school in [[Brisbane]] where he met John Mackay, another teacher who believed in young Earth creationism. According to Susan and William Trollinger, Ham was "appalled by the fact that some of his students assumed their textbooks that taught evolutionary science successfully proved the Bible to be untrue," and he said the experience "put a 'fire in my bones' to do something about the influence that evolutionary thinking was having on students and the public as a whole."&lt;ref name=racm9 /&gt; In 1979, he resigned his teaching position and, with his wife, founded Creation Science Supplies and Creation Science Educational Media Services, which provided resources for the teaching of creationism in the public schools of Queensland, a practice allowed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://journeyonline.com.au/features/ken-ham-queenslander-answers/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Hams and Mackay merged the two organizations with [[Carl Wieland]]'s Creation Science Association to form the Creation Science Foundation (CSF).&lt;ref name=vcu&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bromley |first1=David G. |last2=Duke |first2=Merin |last3=Bhatt |first3=Simren |title=Answers in Genesis |work=World Religions and Spirituality Project |publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University |date=27 February 2015 |url=http://www.wrs.vcu.edu/profiles/AnswersInGenesis.htm |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ken Ham.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ham speaking at the Creation Museum in 2014]]

As CSF's work expanded, Ham moved to the United States in January 1987 to engage in speaking tours with another young Earth creationist organization, the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR).&lt;ref name=racm9 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/organizations/#creation |title= Creation/Evolution Organizations: Creationist and Anti-Evolutionist Organizations |publisher= [[TalkOrigins Archive]] |website= talkorigins.org |last= Hopkins |first= Michael |date= 9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "Back to Genesis" lecture series focused on three major themes – that [[evolutionary theory]] had led to cultural decay, that a literal reading of the first eleven chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]] contained the true [[origin of the universe]] and a pattern for society, and that Christians should engage in a culture war against [[atheism]] and [[secular humanism|humanism]].&lt;ref name=racm10&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trollinger |first1=Susan L. |last2=Trollinger Jr. |first2=William Vance |title=Righting America at the Creation Museum |publisher=JHU Press |year=2016 |isbn=9781421419534 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOf-CwAAQBAJ |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his popularity growing in the United States, Ham left ICR in 1994 and, with colleagues Mark Looy and Mike Zovath, founded Creation Science Ministries with the assistance of what is now [[Creation Ministries International]] (Australia).&lt;ref name=racm10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=aighist&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.answersingenesis.org/about/history |title= The History of AiG through mid 2009 |last= Ham |first= Ken |website= answersingenesis.org |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090901150841/http://www.answersingenesis.org/about/history |archivedate= 1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |url= http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1501593.htm |series= [[Lateline]] |title= The great debate |network= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 9 November 2005 |first= Mark |last= Simkin |accessdate= 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Ham's organization changed its name to [[Answers in Genesis]].&lt;ref name=racm10 /&gt;

From the time AiG was founded, Ham planned to open a museum and training center near its headquarters in [[Florence, Kentucky]], telling an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] interviewer in 2007, "Australia's not really the place to build such a facility if you're going to reach the world. Really, America is."&lt;ref name="createdebate"&gt;{{cite news|last = Eigelbach|first = Kevin|title = Creating Debate – Answers in Genesis Opens its Museum Monday as a Challenge to Darwinism|date = 25 May 2007|newspaper = The Kentucky Post|page = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim Landers, "[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2007/s1936088.htm Museum promotes creationism]", AM, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate interview with ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'''s [[Paul Sheehan (journalist)|Paul Sheehan]], Ham explained, "One of the main reasons [AiG] moved [to Florence] was because we are within one hour's flight of 69 percent of America's population."&lt;ref name="Sheehan"&gt;[[Paul Sheehan (journalist)|Paul Sheehan]], "[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/01/16/1105810774805.html Onward the new Christian soldier]", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', [[Sydney, Australia]], 17 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum, located in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} west of the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]], opened 27 May 2007.&lt;ref name=barbs&gt;{{Cite news|last = Kreimer|first = Peggy|title = Creation Museum's Pitch Drawing Headlines, Barbs|newspaper = The Kentucky Post|date = 4 February 2005|page = K1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Ham was disinvited from the [[University of Central Oklahoma]], where he was scheduled to speak, after an LGBTQ student group objected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Hinton | first1=Carla | title=UCO Student Group Rescinds Invitation to Christian Speaker Ken Ham | url=http://newsok.com/uco-student-group-rescinds-invitation-to-christian-speaker-ken-ham/article/5582635 | date=February 8, 2018 | publisher=''[[The Oklahoman]]'' | accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Causey | first1=Adam Kealoha | title=Creationist's Speech Canceled at University in Oklahoma | url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/Creationist-s-speech-canceled-at-university-in-12563015.php | date=February 8, 2018 | publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (from the [[Associated Press]]) | accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Kocher | first1=Greg | title=He Got Creation Museum, Ark Built in Kentucky, but He Can’t Speak on Oklahoma Campus | url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article199339969.html | date=February 9, 2018 | publisher=''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' | accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, UCO reinvited Ham to speak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Hinton | first1=Carla | title=Ken Ham Will Speak on UCO Campus After All | url=http://newsok.com/ken-ham-will-speak-on-uco-campus-after-all/article/5583535 | date=February 15, 2018 | publisher=''[[The Oklahoman]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Creationist’s Speech Back On at University in Oklahoma | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/creationists-speech-back-on-at-university-in-oklahoma/2018/02/15/811158b8-1279-11e8-a68c-e9374188170e_story.html | date=February 15, 2018 | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' (from the [[Associated Press]]) | accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Stunson | first1=Mike | title=Here’s How Kentucky’s Creation Museum Chief Got a New Invite to Off-Limits Campus | url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article200314879.html | date=February 15, 2018 | publisher=''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ham spoke on March 5 as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Willert | first1=Tom | title=UCO Speaker Draws Largely Friendly Crowd | url=http://newsok.com/uco-speaker-draws-largely-friendly-crowd/article/5585846 | date=March 6, 2018 | publisher=''[[The Oklahoman]]'' | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Ross | first1=Bobby | title=After a Rescinded Invitation, Ken Ham Talks About God at an Oklahoma University | url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900012189/after-a-rescinded-invitation-ken-ham-talks-about-god-at-an-oklahoma-university.html | date=March 6, 2018 | publisher=''[[Deseret News]]'' (from [[Religion News Service]]) | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes with CMI and GHC==
At the end of 2005, the AiG Confederation crumbled due to a disagreement between Ham and Carl Wieland over the "differences in philosophy and operation". This disagreement led to Ham effectively retaining the leadership of the UK and American branches whilst Wieland served as managing director of the Australian branch and the smaller offices in Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. This splitting into two groups led to the Australian branch renaming themselves Creation Ministries International (CMI). The AiG stayed with Ham and continued to expand its staff and work closely with the Institute for Creation Research (ICR). Young Earth creationist [[Kurt Wise]] was recruited by Ham as a consultant to help with the concluding phases of the museum project.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers, Ron (2006) The Creationists&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, [[Creation Ministries International#Legal controversy with Answers In Genesis|Creation Ministries International]] (CMI) [[Answers in Genesis#Legal action by Creation Ministries International|filed a lawsuit against Ham and AiG]] in the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] seeking damages and accusing him of deceptive conduct in his dealings with the Australian organization. Members of the group expressed "concern over Mr. Ham's domination of the groups, the amount of money being spent on his fellow executives and a shift away from delivering the creationist message to raising donations."&lt;ref name="Battle"&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728091913/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C20867%2C21843706-2702%2C00.html?from=public_rss |archivedate=28 July 2007 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21843706-2702,00.html?from=public_rss |title=Biblical battle of creation groups |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=4 June 2007 |first=Michael |last=McKenna |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ham was accused of trying to send the Australian ministry into [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/biblical-battle-of-creation-groups/story-e6frg6nf-1111113672622|title=Biblical battle of creation groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the CMI website, this dispute was amicably settled in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://creation.com/dispute-settled |title= Dispute Settled |publisher= [[Creation Ministries International]] |website= creation.com |accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ham appeared in [[Bill Maher]]'s comedy-documentary ''[[Religulous]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.charlotteobserver.com/104/story/226061.html |title= Maher takes on religion, but some interviewees cry foul |newspaper= [[Charlotte Observer]] |date= 1 October 2008 |first= Rebecca |last= Cusey |accessdate= 4 October 2008 | archivedate= 27 September 2013 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927073007/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/10/01/226061/maher-takes-on-religion-but-some.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; AiG criticized the movie for what it called Maher's "dishonesty last year in gaining access to the [[Creation Museum]] and AiG President Ken Ham."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2008/10/02/a-religulous-movie |title= A Religulous Movie: Opens on 500 Screens Friday—Creation Museum mocked |website= answersingenesis.org |publisher= [[Answers in Genesis]] |date= 2 October 2008 |first= Melany |last= Ethridge |accessdate= 4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the board of Great Homeschool Conventions, Inc. (GHC) voted to disinvite Ham and AiG from future conventions. Conference organizer Brennan Dean stated Ham had made "unnecessary, ungodly, and mean-spirited statements that are divisive at best and defamatory at worst". Dean stated further, "We believe Christian scholars should be heard without the fear of [[ostracism]] or [[ad hominem]] attacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/marchweb-only/kenhamhomeschool.html|title=Conference Disinvites Ken Ham|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disinvitation occurred after Ham criticized [[Peter Enns]] of [[The BioLogos Foundation]], who advocated a symbolic, rather than literal, interpretation of the fall of Adam and Eve.  Ham accused Enns of espousing "outright liberal theology that totally undermines the authority of the Word of God".&lt;ref name="BannedfromConvention"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackford |first=Linda B. |date=24 March 2011 |title=Founder of Creation Museum banned from convention |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article44085801.html |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |location=Sacramento, CA |publisher=The McClatchy Company |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Ham debated American [[science educator]] and [[engineer]] [[Bill Nye]] (popularly known as "[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]") on the topic of whether young Earth creationism is a viable model of origins in the contemporary scientific era.&lt;ref name="NBC-20140204"&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle|first=Alan |title=Bill Nye Wins Over the Science Crowd at Evolution Debate|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bill-nye-wins-over-science-crowd-evolution-debate-n22836|work=[[NBC News]] |date=5 February 2014 |accessdate=6 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics expressed concern that the debate lent the appearance of scientific legitimacy to creationism while also stimulating Ham's fundraising.&lt;ref name="legit"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/feb/05/bill-nye-vs-ken-ham-creationism-science-debate |title= Bill Nye v Ken Ham: Should scientists bother to debate creationism?

Ham said that publicity generated by the debate helped stimulate construction of the [[Ark Encounter]] theme park, which had been stalled for lack of funds.&lt;ref name="funds"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/creation-museum-kentucky-noahs-ark-museum-ken-ham |title= Creation Museum's $73m Noah's Ark park to begin construction in Kentucky |department= World news |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 28 February 2014 |accessdate= 13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ark Encounter opened on 7 July 2016, a date (7/7) chosen to correspond with Genesis 7:7, the Bible verse that describes Noah entering the ark.&lt;ref name=opendate&gt;{{cite web |last=Pilcher |first=James |title=Answers in Genesis' Ark Encounter announces opening date |newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=12 November 2015 |url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/arkencounter/2015/11/11/answers-genesis-ark-encounter-opening-date-announcement-coming-thursday/75586608/ |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Nye visited Ark Encounter, and he and Ham had an informal debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nye|first1=Bill |last2=Ham |first2=Ken |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Nye/Ham: The Second Debate Premiere (video - 117:04)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLRhVdNp5M |date=13 March 2017 |work=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationist beliefs==
According to Ham, he was inspired by his father, also a young Earth creationist, to interpret the Book of Genesis as "literal history" and first rejected what he termed "molecules-to-man evolution" during high school.&lt;ref name=Ham2008/&gt;

As a [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] and [[Biblical inerrancy|biblical inerrantist]], Ham believes that the [[Book of Genesis]] is historical fact.  Ham believes the [[age of the Universe]] to be about 6,000 years{{refn|group=n|name=Note1}} and asserts that [[Noah's flood]] occurred about 4,400 years ago in approximately 2348 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Wright |first= David |title= Feedback: Timeline for the Flood |url= http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2012/03/09/feedback-timeline-for-the-flood |publisher= [[Answers in Genesis]] |website= answersingenesis.org |accessdate= 11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Astrophysical measurements and [[radiometric dating]] show that the [[age of the universe]] is about 13.8 billion years and the [[age of the Earth]] is about 4.5 billion years.)&lt;ref name="USGS1997" /&gt;  Arguing that knowledge of [[evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] require [[Cosmic microwave background|observation]] rather than [[inference]], Ham urges asking scientists and science educators, "Were you there?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/05/creationism_and_evolution_in_school_religious_students_can_t_learn_natural.html|title=Were You There?|first=Vanessa|last=Wamsley|date=26 May 2015|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=670 |title= Were You There? |first= Kenneth |last= Ham |website= icr.org |publisher= [[Institute for Creation Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talk.origins]] archive responds that the evidence for evolution "was there," and that knowledge serves to determine what occurred in the past and when. "Were you there?" questions also invalidate creationism as science—an argument with which Ham himself agrees.&lt;ref name="wereyouthere"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA221.html |title= Claim CA221: Were you there? |website= talkorigins.org |publisher= [[TalkOrigins Archive]] |date= 10 May 2004|accessdate= 15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=dGFJXLEWogEC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22were+you+there%22+evolution+responses&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vt8vkBGWYJ&amp;sig=52VrtyWxkgEGPmfBg36VIQyG8G8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimis3JsdTZAhUp7oMKHer9Cfs4ChDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22were%20you%20there%22%20evolution%20responses&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://answersingenesis.org/the-word-of-god/were-you-there/ Answers in Genesis website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, believes Ham's advocacy of Young Earth Creation will "undermine [[science education]] and U.S. [[science literacy]]."&lt;ref name="undermine science"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/climate_desk/2014/04/your_inner_fish_book_and_pbs_documentary_on_tiktaalik_and_neil_shubin.html?wpisrc=burger_bar |title= Your Inner Fish: Book and PBS documentary on Tiktaalik and Neil Shubin |first= Chris |last= Mooney |date= 12 April 2014 |magazine= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate= 13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Andrew O'Hehir of [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] argues that the "liberal intelligentsia" have grossly overstated the influence of Ken Ham and those espousing similar views because, while "religious ecstasy, however nonsensical, is powerful in a way reason and logic are not," advocates like Ham "represent a [[marginalized]] constituency with little power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/america_stupidly_stuck_between_religion_and_science/ |title= America: Stupidly stuck between religion and science |first= Andrew |last= O'Hehir |magazine= [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate= 16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in '''Papua New Guinea''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Male same-sex sexual activity is illegal.

Attitudes towards LGBT people are greatly influenced by Christian churches, as a majority of Papua New Guineans are Christian. Historically, gay men had certain societal roles. They would take on traditional female roles such as cooking and would participate with women in traditional festivals. However, some tribes still practice ritual pedophilic homosexuality such as the [[Etoro people]] and [[Sambia people]].&lt;ref name=gilesreview&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giles |first=James |date=August 2004 |title=Book Reviews Sambia  Sexual  Culture:  Essays  From  the  Field. By Gilbert Herdt. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, 1999, 327 pp., $20.00. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=413–417 |doi=10.1023/b:aseb.0000029074.36846.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, LGBT people tend to more tolerated and accepted in coastal areas than in the [[New Guinea Highlands]].&lt;ref name="png"&gt;[http://www.vladsokhin.com/work/being-gay-in-papua-new-guinea/#1 Being Gay in Papua New Guinea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The words "lesbian", "gay", "bisexual" and "transgender" tend to carry heavy stigma in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;[https://rainbowpng.wordpress.com/2016/10/28/reclaiming-our-rainbow-cultural-identities/ Reclaiming our rainbow cultural identities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the [[Tok Pisin]] word ''palopa'' has been used by transgender Papua New Guineas to refer to a cultural and traditional third gender. Similarly, the [[Sambia people]] recognize a traditional third gender: ''kwolu-aatmwol'' (literally ''male thing transforming into female thing'').&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
[[File:LGBT flag map of Papua New Guinea.svg|thumb|right|LGBT flag map of Papua New Guinea]]
Male same-sex sexual activity is prohibited by Section 210 of the [[Papua New Guinea]] Penal Code. Those caught engaging in [[anal sex]] can get punished with up to fourteen years imprisonment. Other same-sex sexual acts can be punished with up to three years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf State-sponsored Homophobia A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |date=19 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Government informed the [[United Nations]] that it will not decriminalise homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/jan/13/human-rights-watch-report-papua-new-guinea-australia-asylum-seekers Human Rights Watch says Papua New Guinea has failed to protect women and children], The Guardian, 12 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Department of State]], there were no reports of prosecutions in 2012 directed at LGBT persons.&lt;ref name="UNHCR 2012"&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/country,,,,PNG,,517e6df152,0.html "2012 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Papua New Guinea"], United States Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; However, the department reported that LGBT persons in 2012 were "vulnerable to societal stigmatization".&lt;ref name="UNHCR 2012"/&gt;

Former MP Dame [[Carol Kidu]] in 2012 described gay Papua New Guineans as being forced to live lives of secrecy, and called unsuccessfully on the Government to decriminalise homosexuality.&lt;ref name="SBS b" /&gt; Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]] explained that there were "strong feelings" against homosexuality in the country, which was "yet to accept such sexual openness".&lt;ref name="SBS b"&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/video/2277690609/Gay-PNG-citizens-face-discrimination "Gay PNG citizens face discrimination"], Special Broadcasting Service (video), 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living conditions==
LGBT persons have reported facing "discrimination in their daily lives, and often struggle to find jobs".&lt;ref name="SBS 2012"&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1691501/No-end-in-sight-to-PNGs-anti-gay-laws "No end in sight to PNG’s anti-gay laws"], [[Special Broadcasting Service]], 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2018}}

There are a few nightclubs in [[Port Moresby]] that have "gay nights", mainly in [[Hanuabada]].&lt;ref name="png"/&gt;

{{Language politics}}
[[File:French and Flemish Sign in Brussels.jpg|thumb|The politics of language are evident in French-speaking Brussels, which is located in the Flanders region of Belgium, where people typically speak Flemish.  Divisive preference of either language is avoided by using both French and Flemish on nearly all signs in Brussels.]]
'''Language politics''' is the way language and linguistic differences between peoples are dealt with in the political arena.  This could manifest as government recognition, as well as how language is treated in official capacities.  Some examples:

*Legal status of a language as an [[official language]] in a [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]]. This generally means that all official documents affecting a country or region are published in the official language(s), but not in those that are not. Evidence in a court of law may also be expected to be presented in an official language.&lt;ref name=Patten2011&gt;{{cite journal |title= Political Theory and Language Policy |author= Alan Patten |journal= Political Theory |volume=29 |number=5 |date=October 2011 |pages=691–715 |publisher=Princeton|url= http://www.princeton.edu/~apatten/languagepolicy_politicaltheory.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2018 |format=pdf|doi=10.1177/0090591701029005005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In countries where there are more than one main language, there are often political implications in decisions that are seen to promote one group of speakers over another, and this is often referred to as language politics. An example of a country with this type of language politics is [[Belgium]].
*In countries where there is one main language, immigrants seeking full [[citizenship]] may be expected to have a degree of fluency in that language ('language politics' then being a reference to the debate over the appropriateness of this). This has been a feature of [[Australian politics]].
*At various times [[minority language]]s have either been promoted or banned in schools, as politicians have either sought to promote a minority language with a view to strengthening the cultural identity of its speakers, or banning its use (either for teaching, or on occasion an entire ban on its use), with a view to promoting a national identity based on the majority language. An example of recent promotion of a minority language are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Leonese language|Leonese]] by the Leonese City Council, an example of official discouragement of a minority language is [[Breton language|Breton]].
*Language politics also sometimes relates to [[dialect]], where speakers of a particular dialect are perceived as speaking a more culturally 'advanced' or 'correct' form of the language. Politicians may therefore try to use that dialect rather than their own when in the public eye. Alternatively, at times those speaking the dialect perceived as more 'correct' may try to use another dialect when in the public eye to be seen as a 'man/woman of the people'.
*To promote national identity, what are strictly dialects of the same language may be promoted as separate languages to promote a sense of national identity (examples include [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]&amp;nbsp;– the latter two also use different scripts for what is linguistically the same language&amp;nbsp;– [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] for Serbian and [[Latin alphabet|roman script]] for Croatian). Whether or not something is a language can also involve language politics, for instance, [[Political views on the Macedonian language|Macedonian]].
*The use of 'he' and other words implying the masculine in documents has been a political issue relating to [[women's rights]].
*The use of words which are considered by some to have negative implications to describe a group of people e.g. Gypsies (or even more negatively, 'Gypos') instead of [[Romani people|Romani]], or indeed using the term 'Gypsies' to cover [[Irish Traveller|Traveller]] peoples as well as Romanies.
*'[[Political correctness]]' issues often stem from the use of words. For instance, some may object to the person in charge of an organisation being referred to as 'chairman', on the grounds that it implies a man must be in charge.
*Co-existence of competing spelling systems for the same language, associated with different political camps. E.g.
** [[Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]]
** [[Reforms of Russian orthography|Simplification of Russian orthography]]; proposals for such a reform were viewed as subversive in the late years of the Russian Empire and were implemented by the  [[Bolshevik]]s in 1918, after which the "old orthography" became associated with the [[White movement]].
** The two spelling systems for the [[Belarusian language]], one of which is associated with the country's political opposition.
Language is also utilised in political matters to unify, organise and criticise in order to unify a political group.
* The [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]] preserved in [[Transnistria]].

The '''2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting''' took place on June 1, 2009, when the American Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, born Carlos Leon Bledsoe, opened fire with a rifle in a [[drive-by shooting]] on soldiers in front of a United States [[military recruiting office]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. He killed Private William Long and wounded Private Quinton Ezeagwula.

After his arrest, Muhammad acknowledged shooting the men. He told police that he had intended to kill as many Army personnel as possible. He had an [[SKS]] rifle, a [[Mossberg Plinkster|Mossberg International 702]] rifle, two handguns, 562 rounds of ammunition, and military books in his car. Muhammad was charged with [[capital murder]], attempted capital murder, and 10 counts of unlawful discharge of a weapon. Muhammad also reportedly faced 15 counts of engaging in a terrorist act.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://services.trb.com/wreg/abdulSWREG09060316200.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093639/http://services.trb.com/wreg/abdulSWREG09060316200.pdf|archivedate=July 17, 2011|title=Officer's report and search warrant|publisher=State of Arkansas|date=2009|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A convert to Islam, Muhammad had gone to Yemen in 2007 to teach English, staying about 16 months. He was deported from Yemen to the United States, after having overstayed his visa and been detained.

In January 2010, Muhammad wrote to the judge in his case. He claimed that he was sent on the attacks by [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), and pleaded guilty to the charges of capital murder.&lt;ref name=nytterror/&gt; He had not consulted with his lawyers, and no independent confirmation of his claim has been made.&lt;ref name=nytterror/&gt; His father described him as "unable to process reality".&lt;ref name=nytterror&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp|title=Man Claims Terror Ties in Little Rock Shooting|last=Dao|first=James|date=January 21, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152356/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp| archivedate= 25 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/01/arkansas.recruiter.shooting/|author1=Mike Phelan |author2=Mike Mount |author3=Terry Frieden |title=Suspect arrested in Arkansas recruiting center shooting |publisher=CNN |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dao |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/us/17convert.html |title=A Muslim Son, a Murder Trial and Many Questions |location=Arkansas;Yemen |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt060509&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/us/05recruit.html?ref=us

The lead prosecutor for [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], said about Muhammad's attack, "If you strip away what he says, self-serving or not, it's just an awful killing, it's like a lot of other killings we have."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

His shooting attack was the first of two in 2009 at US military facilities. In the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood shooting]] in November, a US Army psychiatrist shot and killed 13 and wounded 29 other soldiers. Although a Senate special report chaired by the Independent Joseph Lieberman declared it "the deadliest terrorist attack within the United States since September 11, 2001",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/Fort_Hood/FortHoodReport.pdf?attempt=2 COUNTERTERRORISM LESSONS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO PREVENT THE FORT HOOD ATTACK: A  SPECIAL REPORT]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gaO4LUN?url=http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/052407Powell.pdf?attempt=2 |date=2012-04-05 }}, BY JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, CHAIRMAN, SUSAN M. COLLINS, RANKING MEMBER&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nidal Malik Hasan]] was charged with murder and was sentenced to death.

The Arkansas prosecutor took the Muhammad case to trial in 2011. The defense lawyers said that the young man suffered "a delusional disorder".&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"/&gt; During the trial, Muhammad changed his plea to guilty and the prosecutor accepted it. On July 25, 2011, Muhammed was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"&gt;[http://www.investigativeproject.org/3060/breaking-newslittle-rock-jihadist-gets-life "Breaking News: Little Rock jihadist gets life"], Investigative Project&lt;/ref&gt;

At trial, the suspect was charged by the state with capital murder and related charges, not terrorism. Some terrorism experts have noted a connection to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives, and religious inspiration. Other experts stated that the suspect had personal problems, making him vulnerable to recruitment into a fanatical ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,524799,00.html Little Rock Shooting Suspect Joins Growing List of Muslim Converts Accused of Targeting U.S. Published June 2, 2009 FoxNews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack===
[[File:Norinco SKS.jpg|thumb|left|An SKS rifle, the type used by Muhammad in the attack]]
Muhammad drove by the Little Rock U.S. Army recruiting center at 9112 North Rodney Parham Road near Reservoir Road in a black 2003 [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] at 10:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 1, 2009.  Private William Andrew "Andy" Long, 23, of [[Conway, Arkansas]], and Private Quinton I. Ezeagwula, 18, of [[Jacksonville, Arkansas]], were standing outside the recruiting center in uniform, smoking cigarettes. The two victims had completed [[basic training]] two weeks prior, and volunteered to work as recruiters, which was not their regular assignment. Muhammad approached them in his vehicle, stopped, and shot them with an SKS rifle.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="todaysthv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysthv.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=85963&amp;catid=2 |title= Army Recruiter Killed In LR Shooting |publisher=KTHV |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="investigativeproject1"&gt;[http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/988.pdf District Court, Little Rock Arkansas. Case documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness, Lance P. Luplow, heard approximately seven loud bangs and then saw a black truck with tinted windows speeding away, with its tailgate down spilling bottles of water onto the street.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/nov/13/muslim-who-shot-solider-arkansas-says-he-wanted-ca/|author=Kristina Goetz |title=Muslim who shot soldier in Arkansas says he wanted to cause more death  |work=The Commercial Appeal |publisher=The [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |date=November 13, 2010 |accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Luplow ran to Long, who had been shot several times and appeared to be dead.  Ezeagwula was crawling to the door, holding a bloodied ear.  Ezeagwula exclaimed: "Tell me this isn't real, tell me this isn't real". Other soldiers came to perform first aid and attempted [[CPR]] on Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gunman Kills Soldier Outside Recruiting Station |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 1, 2009 |first1=James |last1=Dao |first2=Steve |last2=Barnes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/us/02recruit.html |accessdate=February 3, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120110235627/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/us/02recruit.html| archivedate=January 10, 2012&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long was dead upon arrival at a hospital.  Ezeagwula, who was shot in his back, head, and buttocks, was rushed into surgery at Baptist Hospital in [[critical condition]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="todaysthv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="investigativeproject1"/&gt;

Long's father later remarked: "They weren't on the battlefield; but apparently, the battlefield's here."&lt;ref name="foxnews1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,525064,00.html |title=Family of Soldier Killed Outside Recruiting Center Moved to Arkansas for Peace and Quiet|publisher=FOX News |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Purple Heart]] was awarded to those who were shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lauer |first=Claudia |title=Army recruiters shot in Little Rock to receive Purple Heart |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2015/04/16/army-recruiters-shot-in-little-rock-to-receive-purple-heart/25909841/ |newspaper=Military Times |date=16 April 2015 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=10 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted escape===
Muhammad drove away from the scene, hoping to reach [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he intended to switch cars. With police in pursuit, Muhammad got confused in a construction zone and was captured, eight miles from the recruiting center, near the intersection of [[Interstate 30]] and [[Interstate 630]] in Little Rock. He surrendered to Little Rock police officers without incident.&lt;ref name="todaysthv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nwsource1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Demillo |first=Andrew |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010862771_apusrecruitersshot.html |title= Prosecutor cool to plea shift in recruiter killing |publisher=Seattle Times|date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was wearing an ammunition belt when he exited his vehicle. He said:  "It's a war going on against Muslims, and that is why I did it".&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;  He used language "indicating an association with ''jihad''", and claimed that he had explosives, but none were found.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

He was found to be in possession of an [[SKS]] rifle, a [[O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons|Mossberg]] [[Mossberg Plinkster|International 702 rifle]] with scope and [[laser sight]], a [[.22 Short|.22 caliber handgun]], a Lorcin L-380 semi-automatic handgun, 562 rounds of ammunition loaded in [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s, homemade [[suppressor|sound suppressors]], binoculars, a "suspicious" package, and two military books. A police search of his apartment turned up [[Molotov cocktail]]s, homemade sound suppressors, and [[compact disc]]s labeled in Arabic script.&lt;ref name="nwsource1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NYPD Intelligence Issues Update on Jihad at Army Recruiting Station |newspaper=Huntington News|date=June 7, 2009 |first=Jim |last=Kouri|url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/national/090607-kouri-nationalnypd.html |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7732467&amp;page=2 |title=Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, Recruiter Shooting Suspect, Under FBI Investigation |publisher=ABC News  |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not the first attack, and won't be the last.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;|source=—Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad}}

Muhammad later said he intentionally killed the soldiers, and would have killed more people if more had been there.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; He said that he did not regard his action as [[murder]], because American military actions in the Middle East justify the slaying of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=7816566 |title=Judge blocks phone for suspect in soldier shooting |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[ABC News]] |first=John |last=Gambrell |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement officials said Muhammad had researched various targets around the United States, including military bases, government facilities, and synagogues.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;

==The suspect==
The suspect, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, previously known as Carlos Leon Bledsoe, was born on July 9, 1985, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to Melvin Bledsoe, a businessman and owner of Blues City Tours in Memphis, TN and his wife Linda. He has a sister Monica. Raised as a Baptist and considered a "sunny child",&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; he graduated from [[Craigmont High School]] in Memphis in 2003. He attended [[Tennessee State University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], for several semesters.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/us/17convert.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | first=James | last=Dao | title=A Muslim Son, a Murder Trial and Many Questions | date=February 17, 2010| accessdate= 16 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bledsoe converted to [[Islam]] in 2004 at Masjid As-Salam, a Memphis [[mosque]]. He has said "I've loved ''[[jihad]]'' ever since I became Muslim."  He became more devout and prayed regularly at the Islamic Center of Nashville, and wore Arab-style clothing.  By 2007 he was a deeply religious Muslim and had legally changed his name to Muhammad.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;

===Yemen (September 2007 – January 2009)===
In 2007, Muhammad traveled to visit [[Yemen]], where he stayed 16 months. He worked as an English teacher and learned how to speak Arabic.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; While there, in September 2008 he married Reena Abdullah Ahmed Farag, an elementary school teacher from [[South Yemen]].&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;

===Detention===
In his handwritten letters of May to October 2010, Muhammad claimed to have known people in Yemen who "showed him around and helped him get started," but he refused to identify them for what he referred to as "security reasons."&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; He said he was on several occasions asked to conduct attacks on the United States, but had to refuse, as he did not know how to use explosives.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; He said he tried to go to [[Somalia]] for the necessary training, particularly how to make  [[car bomb]]s. He wrote in 2010, "[H]ad I got this training my story would have ended a lot differently than it's going to end now. My drive-by would have been a drive-in, with no one escaping the aftermath."&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;

Muhammad was arrested at a roadside checkpoint in Yemen on November 14, 2008. He had overstayed his visa, did not have the required government travel permits, and was holding a fraudulent [[Somali passport]]. According to his 2010 letters about this period, in his car were books about explosives, literature by [[Anwar Al-Awlaki]] (the late cleric in Yemen linked to [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]), and videos and reading material about "Muslim soldiers in different parts of the world".&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;

Imprisoned for over two months in Yemen, Muhammad said that he was repeatedly interrogated but not subjected to torture.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; He began his plans for ''jihad'' against the U.S. while he was in prison. James E. Hensley Jr., Muhammad's American lawyer after his arrest in the United States, later said that he was radicalized by [[Islamic fundamentalist]]s while in prison.&lt;ref name=nyt060509/&gt;

Under pressure from the United States, Yemen deported Muhammad to the U.S. on January 29, 2008.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; Because his original plan to travel to Somalia for bomb training had been foiled by his arrest in Yemen, Muhammad said [[Al-Qaeda]] in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) helped him create a new plan of attack.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; Investigators have not independently confirmed his claims.

===Return to the U.S. (January 2009–present)===
Muhammad moved in with his parents in Memphis for several months on his return. He moved to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], in April, where his father opened an office of his tour bus business (Twin City Tours) to provide a job as a driver for his son and create a chance for him to bring his wife from Yemen.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/06/ap_recruiter_shootings_060109/ |title=Recruiter murder suspect was being investigated  |publisher=Army Times |date=June 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad was investigated by the [[FBI]]'s [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] when he returned. The Task Force also investigated the suspect's visit to [[Columbus, Ohio]]; authorities had monitored some Somali Americans traveling from there to Somalia to "wage ''jihad''."&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nwsource1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Recruiter Shooting Suspect Had Ties to Extremist Locations Investigators Probing Attack to Determine Whether Shooting Suspect Acted Alone |work=[[ABC News]] |first1=Pierre |last1=Thomas |first2=Richard |last2=Esposito |first3=Jack |last3=Date |date=June 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2010 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7732467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOVxG5_NK3oC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=%22Ezeagwula%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wdXiTPn8IcH58AbI-vXgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ezeagwula%22&amp;f=false |author=Andrew C.

According to Muhammed's seven handwritten letters from May to October 2010, which he sent to ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'' newspaper, he described his planning and activities related to his June 2009 attack. He claimed to have bought several used guns as a way to avoid scrutiny, stockpiled ammunition, practiced target shooting, and bought a [[.22-caliber rifle]] at [[Wal-Mart]] to determine whether he was being watched.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;

Muhammad said in his letters that none of his attacks had gone as planned.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;  His initial plan was to kill rabbis and target Zionist organizations, and to attack army recruiting centers. According to the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], he used [[Google Maps]] to plan attacks on recruiting centers in at least five states (including in New York, Atlanta, Louisville, and Philadelphia). He also intended to target [[Times Square]] in New York City, Jewish institutions (including in Atlanta), a day-care center, a post office, and a Baptist church.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7732467&amp;page=1 |title=Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, Recruiter Shooting Suspect, Under FBI Investigation |publisher=ABC News |date=June 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Muhammad said his ''jihad'' started in Little Rock. He then drove to Nashville and threw a [[Molotov cocktail]] at an orthodox rabbi's house, but the device failed to detonate. He drove to an Army recruiting center in [[Florence, Kentucky]], because it was close to the highway and near the Ohio border. But the center was closed.&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; He then returned to Little Rock, where he shot the soldiers at the recruiting station.

He was [[indict]]ed on one count of capital murder and 15 counts of [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jta&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/06/04/1005622/arkansas-shooter-researched-jewish-sites  |date=June 4, 2009 |title=Arkansas shooter researched Jewish sites |agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yemen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspect in Soldier Attack Was Once Detained in Yemen |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 3, 2009 |first1=James |last1=Dao |first2=David |last2=Johnston |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/04recruit.html?ref=us |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mention in Congressional hearings===
In a March 2011 Congressional hearing addressing the issue of domestic radicalization of Muslims, Muhammad's father spoke of his son's descent into extremism. Bledsoe described his son's religious conversion and travels to Yemen, where he had been "trained and programmed" to kill. Bledsoe said, "Our children are in danger," and that, "It seems to me that Americans are sitting around doing nothing about radical extremists. This is a big elephant in the room."&lt;ref name="King hearings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Domestic Terrorism Hearing Opens With Contrasting Views on Dangers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/us/politics/11king.html?ref=world|accessdate=March 11, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 10, 2011|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|author2=Laurie Goodstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an earlier occasion, Bledsoe had said, "If it can happen to my son, it can happen to anyone's son."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Muhammad was charged by the state of Arkansas with capital murder, attempted capital murder, and 10 counts of unlawful discharge of a weapon.&lt;ref name=nytterror&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp|title=Man Claims Terror Ties in Little Rock Shooting|last=Dao|first=James|date=January 21, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152356/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp| archivedate= 25 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors sought the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;

He was held in the [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]] Detention Center, awaiting a scheduled February 2011 [[jury trial]].&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt; In January 2010, Arkansas Judge Herbert Wright ordered the State's Public Defenders Commission to pay part of the bill for Muhammad's private attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2010/01/ap_recruiters_shot_011110/ |title=Ark. to pay legal bills for accused shooter |publisher=[[Army Times]] |date=January 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, in a two-page, handwritten letter to the judge in his case, Muhammad changed his plea to guilty. He claimed to be a "soldier in [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]" (AQAP), and described the recruiting office shooting as a "Jihadi attack." He said he was part of Abu Basir's Army, a reference to [[Nasir al-Wuhayshi|Naser Abdel-Karim al-Wahishi]], the AQAP leader in Yemen. Muhammad affirmed that his sanity was intact, and that he was acting of his own volition in changing his plea.&lt;ref name=ltr&gt;{{cite news| url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/us/20100210-convert-letter.pdf|work=The New York Times| accessdate= 18 February 2010
|title=To Judge Wright, JR. from Abdul Hakim Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the County Prosecutor Jegley said that he was still intending to go to trial; he would have had to recommend that Muhammed's plea be accepted for the court to do so. He said he was not going to have the defendant determine the course of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew DeMillo, ''[[Seattle Times]],'' 22 Jan 2010, accessed 1 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad wrote at the time, "I wasn't insane or [[Post-traumatic stress syndrome|post-traumatic]], nor was I forced to do this Act. The attack was justified according to Islamic Laws and the Islamic Religion. ''Jihad''—to fight those who wage war on Islam and Muslims."&lt;ref name=nytterror/&gt; Muhammad did not discuss his change in plea with his lawyers ahead of time.

Discussing his claim of affiliation with the Al-Qaeda group in Yemen led by al-Awlaki (killed in September 2011) and al-Wahishi, he wrote in his letters of May to October 2010:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Far as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ... yes, I'm affiliated with them. ... Our goal is to rid the Islamic world of idols and idolaters, [[paganism]] and pagans, infidelity and [[infidel]]s, hypocrisy and hypocrites, [[apostasy]] and apostates, democracy and democrats, and relaunch the [[Caliph|Islamic caliphate]] ... and to establish Islamic law ([[Shari'ah]]).&lt;ref name="knoxnews1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Muhammad's father Melvin Bledsoe said he doubted whether his son had any such ties. Bledsoe described his son as "unable to process reality" and being so "brainwashed" that he wanted to be convicted of terrorism and executed, thus becoming a [[martyr]].&lt;ref name=nytterror/&gt;

==Charges and trial==
The lead prosecutor for [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], believed Muhammad acted alone, as did other law enforcement officials: "If you strip away what he says, self-serving or not, it's just an awful killing, it's like a lot of other killings we have."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; They and his father Melvin Bledsoe said there was no evidence Muhammad was ever in contact with [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

In June 2010, Muhammad was charged with assaulting an inmate with a weapon fashioned out of eyeglasses, after a similar attack on a jail officer in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2010/jun/10/man-charged-recruiter-shooting-accused-jail-stabbi/ |work=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |title=Man charged in recruiter shooting accused of jail stabbing |date=Jun 10, 2010 |publisher=arkansasonline.com| accessdate= 23 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the prosecutor and Muhammad's lawyers wanted to go to trial, which finally started in 2011. His lawyers defended him on the grounds that he suffered "a delusional disorder."&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"/&gt; During the trial, Muhammad changed his plea to guilty. On July 25, 2011, the judge sentenced Muhammed to life in prison.&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"&gt;[http://www.investigativeproject.org/3060/breaking-newslittle-rock-jihadist-gets-life "Breaking News: Little Rock jihadist gets life"], Investigative Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The suspect was noted in early press accounts as among recent Muslim converts planning or carrying out violent attacks that security experts called a disturbing new domestic trend. The attack came less than two weeks after a foiled bomb plot on two synagogues in [[Riverdale, New York]], led by four men with records of incarceration, drug abuse and mental illness.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;  Although the four men were originally identified by some sources as having converted to Islam in prison or shortly after their incarcerations,&lt;ref name=growinglist&gt;

They had no ties to any international terrorist organization.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' noted of Muhammad's alleged ties to Al-Qaeda, "If evidence emerges that his claim is true, it will give the June 1, 2009, shooting in Little Rock new significance at a time when Yemen is being more closely scrutinized as a source of terrorist plots against the United States."&lt;ref name="nytterror"/&gt; No additional evidence at trial has confirmed Muhammed's claims and he was not charged with terrorism.&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"/&gt;

Some terrorism experts thought there was a connection in Muhammed's case to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives and religious inspiration. Neil Livingstone, a terrorism consultant, said that people on the margins of society are "easy marks" for recruiters offering them ideological and fanatical religious justifications for violence, noting "Most of these guys — I think what it comes down to — they're misfits, they believe they've suffered injustice. ... They basically are striking back at society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,524799,00.html "Little Rock Shooting Suspect Joins Growing List of Muslim Converts Accused of Targeting U.S."], Fox News, 2 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Republican Greek League''' or '''EDES''' ({{lang-el|Εθνικός Δημοκρατικός Ελληνικός Σύνδεσμος}} (ΕΔΕΣ), ''Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Syndesmos'') was one of the major [[Greek Resistance|resistance]] groups formed during the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] during [[World War II]].

The largest of the non-communist resistance groups, its military wing, the [[National Groups of Greek Guerrillas]] (Εθνικές Ομάδες Ελλήνων Ανταρτών ''Ethnikes Omades Ellinon Andarton'', ΕΟΕΑ) concentrated its military activities in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]. From 1943 onwards, EDES came into confrontation with the [[communist]]-led [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]], beginning a series of civil conflicts that would lead to the [[Greek Civil War]].

== Foundation and ideology ==
The National Republican Greek League was founded on 9 September 1941 by a former army officer, Colonel [[Napoleon Zervas]], a [[Venizelism|centrist]] who had been expelled from the army after the failed pro-Venizelist [[1935 Greek coup d'état attempt|coup d'état of 1935]], and two of his friends, Leonidas Spais and Ilias Stamatopoulos.&lt;ref name=Fleischer150&gt;Fleischer (1990), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other resistance movements founded during that time, the political orientation of the National Republican Greek League was Republican, with a strong dislike towards the exiled king, [[George II of Greece|George II]], and featured some vague leftist-socialist tendencies. In the aftermath of the four-year right-wing [[4th of August Regime|Metaxas dictatorship]], which was strongly supported by the king, the monarchy was almost universally rejected, while social ideals for "social fairness" became the vogue among the various resistance groups.

The founding charter of EDES explicitly demanded the "establishment in Greece of a Republican regime, of Socialist form", the "revelation [...] of the treason of former King George II and the gang of the 4th of August Dictatorship", calling for a thorough cleansing of the state and Greek social and public life from anyone "who has not proven a National Republican [and] socialist conscience through actions". The charter acknowledged the prominent exiled [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] general [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] as its nominal political head, but due to his exile in France they failed to take his consent beforehand.&lt;ref name=Fleischer150/&gt; For the time being, no reference to armed opposition against the occupying forces was made in the text.&lt;ref name=Fleischer150/&gt;

On the same day, [[Komninos Pyromaglou]], a friend and assistant of Plastiras, left [[Nice]], where Plastiras resided, for Greece. He was authorize by the general to form, on his behalf, a republican organization with socialist content", and prepare to turn both "against the Occupier" and against a return of the monarchy.&lt;ref name=Fleischer154&gt;Fleischer (1990), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrival in Athens on 23 September, Pyromaglou came into contact with Republican circles, and after contacting Zervas took EDES' command. In October, a five-member Executive Committee was founded, with Pyromaglou as Plastiras' representative as General Secretary and Zervas as a simple member.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer (1990), pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

As the organization grew, it succeeded in establishing links with the British Headquarters in [[Cairo]], with a view to receiving funds, weapons and guidance. Under British pressure which at the time strongly supported the Greek monarchy, Zervas was forced to send a statement of loyalty to King George II in March 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer (1990), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a silent breach with the vitriolic anti-monarchist attacks of the past months, and marked EDES's slow slide towards a more pro-monarchist stance.

Like most similar groups, EDES was initially limited to Athens. Having the support of many prominent Venizelist and Republican military figures, EDES came into contact with EAM and tried to establish some form of cooperation. The negotiations failed over the demands of the Communists for a merger of EDES with EAM and their distrust of Zervas' pro-British attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer (1990), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 1942, after intense British pressure and more than a month after the official appearance of the military wing of EAM, the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS), Zervas, accompanied by Pyromaglou and a handful of companions, set out for the [[Valtos Mountains]] in [[Aetolia-Acarnania]], an area with long traditions of [[guerrilla warfare]] stretching back to the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman period]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer (1990), p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; From then and until the end of the Occupation, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] would be the primary area of operations of the EDES ''andartes''.

Supported by British parachute drops, EDES quickly gathered some 100 fighters. The first major operation of EDES was "[[Operation Harling]]", the destruction of the [[Gorgopotamos]] viaduct by a joint force of British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] commandos, and EDES and ELAS forces. While the successful operation, one of the greatest [[sabotage]] acts in occupied Europe, greatly boosted the prestige of the nascent Resistance, it also caused a significant rift between EDES and ELAS: the British loudly proclaimed and lauded Zervas' role in the operation, while ignoring the contribution – numerically far greater – of the leftist ELAS forces.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer (1990), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; While the rift was healed by British mediation, it presaged the problems that would appear in the future.

On the other hand, [[Stylianos Gonatas]], initially a political leader of [[EDES]] in Athens, won the peculiar enmity of the organization because he supported the collaborationist [[Security Battalions]] and encouraged young officers to join their ranks, which led to hostility of the EAM groups towards him.&lt;ref name="Shrader1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrader|first=Charles R.|title=The withered vine: logistics and the communist insurgency in Greece, 1945-1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vu2i13Yq60QC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=16 October 2010|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96544-0|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill1947"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=William Hardy|title=The Greek dilemma: war and aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DL1KAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=In+particular,+General+Gonatas,+who+had+been+the+most+prominent+figure+in+the+Athens+EDES+organization,+won+the+peculiar+enmity+of+EAM+by+advising+young+regular+officers+to+obey+the+summons+of+the+quisling+Government+and+take+service+at&amp;q=In+particular,+General+Gonatas,+who++had+been+the+most+prominent+figure+in+the+Athens+EDES++organization,+won+the+peculiar+enmity+of+EAM+by+advising++young+regular+officers+to+obey+the+summons+of+the+quisling++Government+and+take+service+with+the+Security+Battalions.+#search_anchor|accessdate=16 October 2010|year=1947|publisher=J.B.

== The civil war within the Resistance ==
These internal conflicts caused rivalry between resistance groups and eventually escalated into civil war. In October 1943, [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] launched an attack on EDES. These attacks triggered a civil war that would last until February 1944.  After that, a fragile truce was established, which lasted until December, two months after the Liberation.  Then, while the ELAS of Athens attempted to overthrow the government, other units stormed the EDES positions in [[Epirus]].  The latter was defeated and the remaining forces were evacuated to Corfu.  After the defeat of the ELAS in Athens (January 1945), EDES forces returned to Epirus, where part of them got involved to the expulsion of the [[Cham Albanians]].

'''New Harmony''' is a historic town on the [[Wabash River]] in [[Harmony Township, Posey County, Indiana|Harmony Township]], [[Posey County, Indiana|Posey County]], [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|440051|New Harmony, Indiana|2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Mount Vernon, Indiana|Mount Vernon]], the [[county seat]], and is part of the [[Evansville, IN-KY Metropolitan Statistical Area|Evansville metropolitan area]]. The town's population was 789 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Established by the [[Harmony Society]] in 1814 under the leadership of [[George Rapp]], the town was originally known as Harmony (also called Harmonie, or New Harmony). In its early years the {{convert|20,000|acre|ha|adj=on}} settlement was the home of [[Lutheran]]s who had separated from the official church in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] and immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Pitzer|title=New Harmony Then and Now|date=2012|publisher=Quarry Books|location=601 North Morton Street|isbn=978-0-253-35645-1|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harmonists built a new town in the wilderness, but in 1824 they decided to sell their property and return to [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society, 1814&amp;ndash;1824'' (Indianapolis: [[Indiana Historical Society]], 1975) 1:xi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Owen]], a [[Wales|Welsh]] industrialist and social reformer, purchased the town in 1825 with the intention of creating a new [[utopian community]] and renamed it New Harmony. While the Owenite [[social experiment]] was an economic failure two years after it began, the community made some important contributions to American society.&lt;ref name=Boom&gt;Ray E. Boomhower, "New Harmony: Home to Indiana’s Communal Societies," ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'' 14(4):36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Harmony became known as a center for advances in education and scientific research. Town residents established the first free library, a civic drama club, and a public school system open to men and women. Its prominent citizens included Owen's sons: [[Robert Dale Owen]], an Indiana congressman and social reformer who sponsored legislation to create the [[Smithsonian Institution]]; [[David Dale Owen]], a noted state and federal geologist; William Owen, a New Harmony businessman; and [[Richard Owen (geologist)|Richard Owen]], Indiana state geologist, [[Indiana University]] professor, and first president of [[Purdue University]]. The town also served as the second headquarters of the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]]. Numerous scientists and educators contributed to New Harmony’s intellectual community, including [[William Maclure]], [[Marie Louise Duclos Fretageot]], [[Thomas Say]], [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], [[Joseph Neef]], [[Frances Wright]], and others.

Many of the town's old Harmonist buildings have been restored. These structures, along with others related to the Owenite community, are included in the [[New Harmony Historic District]]. Contemporary additions to the town include the [[Roofless Church]] and [[New Harmony's Atheneum|Atheneum]].&lt;ref name=Boom/&gt; The New Harmony State Memorial is located south of town on [[Indiana State Road 69|State Road 69]] in [[Harmonie State Park]].

==History==
===Harmonist settlement (1814&amp;ndash;1824)===
The town of Harmony was founded by the [[Harmony Society]] in 1814 under the leadership of [[Germans|German]] immigrant [[George Rapp]] (born Johann Georg Rapp). It was the second of three towns built by the [[Pietism|pietist]], [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] religious group, known as Harmonists, Harmonites, or Rappites. The Harmonists settled in the [[Indiana Territory]] after leaving [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], where westward expansion, the area's rising population, jealous neighbors, and the increasing cost of land threatened the Society's desire for isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. R Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society, 1785&amp;ndash;1847'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1965) p. 130&amp;ndash;31, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1814 Anna Mayrisch, John L. Baker, and Ludwick Shirver (Ludwig Schreiber) traveled west in search of a new location for their congregation, one that would have fertile soil and access to a navigable waterway.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; By May 10 the men had found suitable land along the Wabash River in the Indiana Territory and made an initial purchase of approximately {{convert|7,000|acre|km2}}. Rapp wrote on May{{nbsp}}10, "The place is 25 miles from the Ohio mouth of the Wabash, and 12 miles from where the Ohio makes its curve first before the mouth. The town will be located about 1/4 mile from the river above on the channel on a plane as level as the floor of a room, perhaps a good quarter mile from the hill which lies suitable for a vineyard."&lt;ref name=Arndt18&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rapp expressed concern that the town's location lacked a waterworks, the area provided an opportunity for expansion and access to markets through the nearby rivers, causing him to remark, "In short, the place has all the advantages which one could wish, if a steam engine meanwhile supplies what is lacking."&lt;ref name=Arndt18/&gt;

The first Harmonists left [[Pennsylvania]] in June 1814 and traveled by flatboat to their new land in the Indiana Territory. In May 1815 the last of the Harmonists who had remained behind until the sale of their town in Pennsylvania was completed departed for their new town along the Wabash River.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp’s Harmony Society'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Reichert Rapp, George Rapp's adopted son, drew up the town plan for their new village at [[New Harmony, Indiana#Harmonist settlement (1814–1824)|Harmony, Indiana]], which surveyors laid out on August{{nbsp}}8, 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society 1785–1847'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1816, the same year that Indiana became a state, the Harmonists had acquired {{convert|20,000|acre|km2}} of land, built 160 homes and other buildings, and cleared {{convert|2,000|acre|km2}} for their new town.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp’s Harmony Society'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement also began to attract new arrivals, including emigrants from [[Germany]] such as members of Rapp's congregation from [[Wurttemberg]], many of whom expected the Harmonists to pay for their passage to America.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp’s Harmony Society'', p. 182&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new arrivals "were more of a liability than an asset".&lt;ref name=Arndt209&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1819, Rapp commented, "It is astonishing how much trouble the people who have arrived here have made, for they have no morals and do not know what it means to live a moral and well-mannered life, not to speak of true Christianity, of denying the world or yourself."&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:674.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors to Harmony commented on the commercial and industrial work being done in this religious settlement along the Wabash River. "It seemed as though I found myself in the midst of Germany," noted one visitor.&lt;ref name=Arndt744&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:744.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 the town had a steam-operated wool carding and spinning factory, a horse-drawn and human-powered threshing machine, a brewery, distillery, vineyards, and a winery. The property included an orderly town, "laid out in a square", with a church, school, store, dwellings for residents, and streets to create "the most beautiful city of western America, because everything is built in the most perfect symmetry".&lt;ref name=Arndt744/&gt; Other visitors were not as impressed: "hard labor &amp; coarse fare appears to be the lot of all except the family of Rapp, he lives in a large &amp; handsome brick house while the rest inhabit small log cabins. How so numerous a population are kept quietly &amp; tamely in absolute servitude it is hard to conceive—the women I believe do more labor in the field than the men, as large numbers of the latter are engaged in different branches of manufactures."&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:784.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were not paid for their work, the 1820 manufacturer's census reported that 75 men, 12 women, and 30 children were employed,  in the Society's tanneries, saw and grain mills, and woolen and cotton mills. Manufactured goods included cotton, flannel, and wool cloth, yarn, knit goods, tin ware, rope, beer, peach brandy, whiskey, wine, wagons, carts, plows, flour, beef, pork, butter, leather, and leather goods.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 2:131&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harmonist community continued to thrive during the 1820s, but correspondence from March 6, 1824, between Rapp and his adopted son, Frederick, indicates that the Harmonists planned to sell their Indiana property and were already looking for a new location.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp’s Harmony Society'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, a decade after their arrival in Indiana, the Harmonists purchased land along the Ohio River eighteen miles from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and were making arrangements to advertise the sale of their property in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:837, 871&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; The move, although it was made primarily for religious reasons, would provide the Harmonists with easier access to eastern markets and a place where they could live more peacefully with others who shared their German language and culture.&lt;ref name=Arndt209/&gt; On May 24, 1824, a group of Harmonists boarded a steamboat and departed Indiana, bound for [[Pennsylvania]], where they founded the community of [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], the present-day town of [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Ambridge]]. In May 1825 the last Harmonists left Indiana after the sale of their {{convert|20,000|acre|km2}} of property, which included the land and buildings, to [[Robert Owen]] for $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:837, 871.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boom37&gt;Boomhower, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Donald F. Carmony and Josephine M. Elliott. "New Harmony, Indiana: Robert Owen's Seedbed for Utopia," ''Indiana Magazine of History'' 76, no. 3 (September, 1980):165. Carmony and Elliott indicate that Owen paid $125,000 for New Harmony, and cite other sources that state varying amounts.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen hoped to establish a new community on the Indiana frontier, one that would serve as a model community for communal living and social reform.

===Owenite community (1825&amp;ndash;1827)===
[[File:New harmony vision.jpg|thumb|300px|New Harmony as envisioned by Owen&lt;ref&gt;"New Harmony as envisioned by Owen" was originally captioned by [[Stedman Whitwell]], the architect who drew the figure, as "Design for a Community of 2000 Person founded upon a principle Commended by Plato, Lord Bacon and Sir Thomas More" in ''Description of an Architectural Model From a Design by Stedman Whitwell, Exq. For a Community Upon a Principle of United Interests, as Advocated by Robert Owen, Esq.'' (London: Hurst Chance and Co., 1830). Whitwell (1784–1840) lived in New Harmony during 1825. John W. Reps,[http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/whitwell.htm "Whitwell, Description of a Model City"], Cornell University. Retrieved 2012-6-20. In [[Edward Royle]]'s ''Robert Owen and the Commencement of the Millennium,'' (Manchester University Press, 1998), Whitwell's figure is presented in a chapter on Harmony, the name of Owen's community in Hampshire, England, dating from 1841, although the figure was published in 1830 and almost certainly existed as early as 1825.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Robert Owen]] was a social reformer and wealthy industrialist who made his fortune from textile mills in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]]. Owen, his twenty-two-year-old son, William, and his Scottish friend Donald McDonald &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitzer|first1=Donald|title=New Harmony Then and Now|date=2012|publisher=Quarry Books|isbn=978-0-253-35645-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; sailed to the United States in 1824 to purchase a site to implement Owen's vision for "a New Moral World" of happiness, enlightenment, and prosperity through education, science, technology, and communal living. Owen believed his utopian community would create a "superior social, intellectual and physical environment" based on his ideals of social reform.&lt;ref name=Pitzer&gt;Donald E. Pitzer, "The Original Boatload of Knowledge Down the Ohio River." Reprint. ''Ohio Journal of Science'' 89, no. 5 (December 1989):128&amp;ndash;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen was motivated to buy the town in order to prove his theories were viable and to correct the troubles that were affecting his mill-town community [[New Lanark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William|title=The Angel and the Serpent|date=1964|publisher=Vail-Ballou Press, Inc.|location=Binghamton, N.Y.|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ready-built town of Harmony, Indiana, fitted Owen's needs. In January 1825 he signed the agreement to purchase the town, renamed it New Harmony, and invited "any and all" to join him there.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Wilson, ''The Angel and the Serpent: The Story of New Harmony'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1967, 2nd ed.), p. 105, 110, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the town's new arrivals had a sincere interest in making it a success, the experiment also attracted "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town made success unlikely."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; William Owen, who remained in New Harmony while his father returned east to recruit new residents, also expressed concern in his diary entry, dated March{{nbsp}}24, 1825: "I doubt whether those who have been comfortable and content in their old mode of life, will find an increase of enjoyment when they come here. How long it will require to accustom themselves to their new mode of living, I am unable to determine."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Hiatt, ed., "Diary of William Owen: From November 10, 1824, to April 20, 1825" ''[[Indiana Historical Society]] Publications'' 4, no. 1 (1906): 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robert Owen returned to New Harmony in April 1825 he found seven hundred to eight hundred residents and a "chaotic" situation, much in need of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Carmony and Elliott, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1825 the community had adopted the "Constitution of the Preliminary Society," which loosely outlined its expectations and government. Under the preliminary constitution, members would provide their own household goods and invest their capital at interest in an enterprise that would promote independence and social equality. Members would render services to the community in exchange for credit at the town's store, but those who did not want to work could purchase credit at the store with cash payments made in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 117&amp;ndash;118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the town would be governed by a committee of four members chosen by Owen and the community would elect three additional members.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Robert Owen left William in New Harmony while he traveled east to continue promoting his model community and returned to Scotland, where he sold his interests in the New Lanark textile mills and arranged financial support for his wife and two daughters, who chose to remain in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 119&amp;ndash;122.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard, and a daughter, Jane Dale, later settled in New Harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Several of Robert Owen's children were given the middle name Dale in honor of Owen's father-in-law, David Dale.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Owen was away recruiting new residents for New Harmony, a number of factors that led to an early breakup of the [[Socialism|socialist community]] had already begun. Members grumbled about inequity in credits between workers and non-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the town soon became overcrowded, lacked sufficient housing, and was unable to produce enough to become self-sufficient, although they still had "high hopes for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen spent only a few months at New Harmony, where a shortage of skilled craftsmen and laborers along with inadequate and inexperienced supervision and management contributed to its eventual failure.&lt;ref&gt;Carmony and Elliott, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the community's shortcomings, Owen was a passionate promoter of his vision for New Harmony. While visiting Philadelphia, Owen met [[Marie Louise Duclos Fretageot]], a [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzian]] educator, and persuaded her to join him in Indiana. Fretageot encouraged [[William Maclure]], a scientist and fellow educator, to become a part of the venture. (Maclure became Owen’s financial partner.) On January 26, 1826, Fretegeot, Maclure, and a number of their colleagues, including [[Thomas Say]], [[Josef Neef]], [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], and others aboard the keelboat ''Philanthropist'' (also called the "Boatload of Knowledge"), arrived in New Harmony to help Owen establish his new experiment in socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 1826, the town adopted a new constitution, "The New Harmony Community of Equality", whose objective was to achieve happiness based on principles of equal rights and equality of duties. Cooperation, common property, economic benefit, freedom of speech and action, kindness and courtesy, order, preservation of health, acquisition of knowledge, and obedience to the country's laws were included as part of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution laid out the life of a citizen in New Harmony based on age. Children from the age of one to five  were to be cared for and encouraged to exercise; children aged six to nine they were to be lightly employed and given education via observation directed by skilled teachers. Youth from the ages of ten to twelve were to help in the houses and with the gardening. Teenagers from the age of twelve to fifteen were to receive technical training, and from fifteen to twenty their education was to be continued. Young adults from the ages of twenty to thirty were to act as a superintendent in the production and education departments. Adults from the ages of thirty to forty were to govern the homes, and residents aged forty to sixty were to be encouraged to assist with the community's external relations or to travel abroad if they so desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lockwood|first1=George|title=The New Harmony Movement|date=1905|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York|isbn=|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the constitution contained worthy ideals, it did not clearly address how the community would function and was never fully established.&lt;ref&gt;Carmony and Elliott, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individualist anarchist]] [[Josiah Warren]], who was one of the original participants in the New Harmony Society, asserted that the community was doomed to failure due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He commented: "It seemed that the difference of opinion, tastes and purposes increased just in proportion to the demand for conformity. Two years were worn out in this way; at the end of which, I believe that not more than three persons had the least hope of success. Most of the experimenters left in despair of all reforms, and conservatism felt itself confirmed. We had tried every conceivable form of organization and government. We had a world in miniature. --we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result. ...It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ...our 'united interests' were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation... and it was evident that just in proportion to the contact of persons or interests, so are concessions and compromises indispensable." (''Periodical Letter II'' 1856).

Part of New Harmony's failings stemmed from three activities that Owen brought from Scotland to America. First, Owen actively attacked established religion, despite United States' constitutional guarantees of religious freedom and the separations of church and state. Second, Owen remained stubbornly attached to the principles of the rationalist [[Age of Enlightenment]], which drove away many of the Jeffersonian farmers Owen tried to attract. Thirdly, Owen consistently appealed to the upper class for donations, but found that the strategy was not as effective as it had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitzer|first1=Donald|title=New Harmony Then and Now|date=2012|publisher=Quarry Books|isbn=978-0-253-35645-1|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Dale Owen wrote that the members of the failed socialist experiment at New Harmony were "a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in,"&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;Joseph Clayton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nuspAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=x2fIRmQvqi&amp;dq=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;f=false ''Robert Owen: Pioneer of Social Reforms''] (London: A.C. Fifield, 1908)&lt;/ref&gt; and that "a plan which remunerates all alike, will, in the present condition of society, ultimately eliminate from a co-operative association the skilled, efficient and industrious members, leaving an ineffective and sluggish residue, in whose hands the experiment will fail, both socially and pecuniarily."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Robert Owen |date=1874 |title= Threading my way: Twenty-seven years of autobiography |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015026473986;view=1up;seq=276 |location= |publisher=[[Trübner &amp; Co.]] |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he still thought that "co-operation ''is'' a chief agency destined to quiet the clamorous conflicts between capital and labour; but then it must be co-operation gradually introduced, prudently managed, as now in England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Robert Owen |date=1874 |title= Threading my way: Twenty-seven years of autobiography |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015026473986;view=1up;seq=259|location= |publisher=[[Trübner &amp; Co.]] |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1826 splinter groups dissatisfied with the efforts of the larger community broke away from the main group and prompted a reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;Carmony and Elliott, p. 174&amp;ndash;176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Harmony work was divided into six departments, each with its own superintendent. These departments included agriculture, manufacturing, domestic economy, general economy, commerce, and literature, science and education. A governing council included the six superintendents and an elected secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the new organization and constitution, members continued to leave town.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 153&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1827, after several other attempts to reorganize, the utopian experiment had failed.

The larger community, which lasted until 1827, was divided into smaller communities that led further disputes. Individualism replaced socialism in 1828 and New Harmony was dissolved in 1829 due to constant quarrels. The town's parcels of land and property were returned to private use.&lt;ref name="clayton" /&gt; Owen spent $200,000 of his own funds to purchase New Harmony property and pay off the community’s debts. His sons, Robert Dale and William, gave up their shares of the New Lanark mills in exchange for shares in New Harmony. Later, Owen "conveyed the entire New Harmony property to his sons in return for an annuity of $1,500 for the remainder of his life." Owen left New Harmony in June 1827 and focused his interests in the United Kingdom. He died in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 162&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
Although Robert Owen's vision of New Harmony as an advance in social reform was not realized, the town became a scientific center of national significance, especially in the natural sciences, most notably geology.

[[William Maclure]] (1763&amp;ndash;1840), president of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] from 1817 to 1840, came to New Harmony during the winter of 1825&amp;ndash;26.&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt; Maclure brought a group of noted artists, educators, and fellow scientists, including naturalists [[Thomas Say]] and [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], to New Harmony from Philadelphia aboard the ''Philanthropist'' (also known as the "Boatload of Knowledge").&lt;ref&gt;Janet R. Walker, ''Wonder Workers on the Wabash'' (New Harmony, IN: Historic New Harmony, 1999), p. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Say]] (1787&amp;ndash;1834), a friend of Maclure, was an entomologist and conchologist. His definitive studies of shells and insects, numerous contributions to scientific journals, and scientific expeditions to [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Mexico]], and elsewhere made him an internationally known naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Say has been called the father of American descriptive [[entomology]] and American [[conchology]].&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt; Prior to his arrival at New Harmony, he served as librarian for the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, curator at the [[American Philosophical Society]], and professor of natural history at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt; Say died in New Harmony in 1834.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 184"&gt;Wilson, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]] (1778&amp;ndash;1846), a naturalist and artist, came to New Harmony aboard the ''Philanthropist''. His sketches of New Harmony provide a visual record of the town during the Owenite period. As a naturalist, Lesueur is known for his classification of Great Lakes fishes. He returned to his native France in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 15&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Many species were first described by both Say and Leseuer, and many have been named in their honor.

[[David Dale Owen]] (1807&amp;ndash;1860), third son of Robert Owen, finished his formal education as a medical doctor in 1837. However, after returning to New Harmony, David Dale Owen was influenced by the work of Maclure and [[Gerard Troost]], a Dutch geologist, mineralogist, zoologist, and chemist who arrived in New Harmony in 1825 and later became the state geologist of Tennessee from 1831 to 1850.&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt; Owen went on to become a noted geologist. Headquartered at New Harmony, Owen conducted the first official geological survey of Indiana (1837&amp;ndash;39). After his appointment as U.S. Geologist in 1839,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen led federal surveys from 1839 to 1840 and from 1847 to 1851 of the [[Midwestern United States]], which included [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and part of northern [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Walter B.

===Public service and social reform===
[[Robert Dale Owen]], eldest son of Robert Owen, was a social reformer and intellectual of national importance. At New Harmony, he taught school and co-edited and published the ''New Harmony Gazette'' with Frances Wright.&lt;ref name=IHScoll/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker23&gt;Walker, p . 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen later moved to New York.

As a member of the [[U. S. House of Representatives]] from 1843 to 1847, Owen introduced a bill in 1846 that established the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 195&amp;ndash;197.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as chairman of the Smithsonian Building Committee.

[[Frances Wright]] (1795&amp;ndash;1852) came to New Harmony in 1824, where she co-edited and wrote for the ''New Harmony Gazette'' with Robert Dale Owen. In 1825 she established an experimental settlement at Nashoba, Tennessee, that allowed African American slaves to work to gain their freedom, but the community failed. A liberal leader in the "free-thought movement," Wright opposed slavery, advocated woman's suffrage, birth control, and free public education. Wright and Robert Dale Owen moved their newspaper to New York City in 1829 and published it as the ''Free Enquirer''.&lt;ref name=IHScoll/&gt;&lt;ref name=KimberlingWr&gt;Clark Kimberling, [http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/wright.html "Frances Wright"], University of Evansville.

===Education===
The history of education at New Harmony involves several teachers who were already well-established in their fields before they moved to New Harmony, largely through the efforts of William Maclure. These Pestalozzian educators included Marie Duclos Fretageot and Joseph Neef. By the time Maclure arrived in New Harmony he had already established the first Pestalozzian school in America. Fretageot and Neef had been Pestalozzian educators and school administrators at Maclure’s schools in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt;

Under Maclure's direction and using his philosophy of education, New Harmony schools became the first public schools in the United States open to boys and girls. Maclure also established  at New Harmony one of the country's first industrial or trade schools.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had his extensive library and geological collection shipped to New Harmony from Philadelphia. In 1838 Maclure established The Working Men's Institute, a society for "mutual instruction".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 173, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the oldest continuously operating library in Indiana, as well as a small museum. The vault in the library contains many historic manuscripts, letters, and documents pertaining to the history of New Harmony. Under the terms of his will, Maclure also offered $500 to any club or society of laborers in the United States who established a reading and lecture room with a library of at least 100 books. About 160 libraries in Indiana and Illinois took advantage of his bequest.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 188&amp;ndash;189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Duclos Fretageot]] managed Pestalozzian schools that Maclure organized in France and Philadelphia before coming to New Harmony aboard the ''Philanthropist''. In New Harmony she was responsible for the infant's school (for children under age five), supervised several young women she had brought with her from Philadelphia, ran a store, and was Maclure's administrator during his residence in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 18, 19, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Fretageot remained in New Harmony until 1831, returned to France, and later joined Maclure in Mexico, where she died in 1833.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 184"/&gt; Correspondence of Maclure and Fretageot from 1820 to 1833 was extensive and is documented in ''Partnership for Posterity.''&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Mirabella Elliott, ed. ''Partnership for Posterity: The Correspondence of William Maclure and Marie Duclos Fretageot, 1820&amp;ndash;1833'' (Indianapolis, IN: [[Indiana Historical Society]], 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Neef]] ( 1770&amp;ndash;1854) published in 1808 the first work on educational method to be written in English in the United States, ''Sketch of A Plan and Method of Education.''&lt;ref name=KimberlingNeef&gt;Clark Kimberling, [http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/neef.html "Francis Joseph Nicholas Neef"], University of Evansville. Retrieved 2012-6-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Maclure brought Neef, a Pestalozzian educator from Switzerland, to Philadelphia, and placed him in charge of his school for boys. It was the first schooled in the United States to be based on Pestalozzian methods. In 1826 Neef, his wife, and children came to New Harmony to run the schools under Maclure's direction.&lt;ref name=Wilson185&gt;Wilson, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 35&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt; Neef, following Maclure's curriculum, became superintendent of the schools in New Harmony, where as many as 200 students, ranging in age from five to twelve, were enrolled.&lt;ref name=KimberlingNeef/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson185/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On March 23, 1837, an unusual triple marriage took place at New Harmony, when Neef's daughter, Anne Eliza, married Richard Owen, Neef's daughter, Caroline, married David Dale Owen, and Mary Bouton married William Owen.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy]] (1806&amp;ndash;1861), daughter of Robert Owen, arrived in New Harmony in 1833. She married civil engineer Robert Henry Fauntleroy in 1835. He became a business partner of David Dale and Robert Dale Owen. Jane Owen Fauntleroy established a seminary for young women in her family's New Harmony home, where her brother, David Dale Owen, taught science.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Kimberling, et. al.

===Publishing===
[[Cornelius Tiebout]] (c. 1773&amp;ndash;1832) was an artist, printer, and engraver of considerable fame when he joined the New Harmony community in September 1826. Tiebout taught printing and published a bimonthly newspaper, ''Disseminator of Useful Knowledge'', and books using the town's printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 183&amp;ndash;184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Among Tiebout's best-known engravings are ''George Washington'' (1798), ''Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States'' (1800), ''Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States'' (1801), ''Constitution'' (USS Constitution dueling with British frigate Guerriere, War of 1812, engraved 1813). These and others are well represented on the Internet.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in New Harmony in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;ArtFact, [http://www.artfact.com/artist/tiebout-cornelius-v8uem9lkpr "Cornelius Tiebout"].

[[Lucy Say|Lucy Sistare Say]] was an apprentice at Fretageot's Pestalozzian school and a former student of Lesueur in Philadelphia before coming to New Harmony aboard the ''Philanthropist'' to teach needlework and drawing. En route to Indiana, Sistare met Thomas Say and the two were married on January 4, 1827, prior to their arrival at New Harmony. An accomplished artist, Say illustrated and hand-colored 66 of the 68 illustrations in ''American Conchology,'' her husband's multi-volume work on mollusks. Following Thomas Say’s death in 1834, she moved to New York, trained to become an engraver, and worked to complete and publish the final volume of ''American Conchology''. Lucy Say remained interested in the natural sciences after returning to the [[Eastern United States|East]]. In 1841 she became the first female member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=LucySay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Heather Baldus| title =A Broad Stroke: New Harmony’s Artistic Legacy | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =26 | issue =2 | pages=26–27 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Spring 2014| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theater===
William Owen (1802&amp;ndash;1842), Robert Owen's second oldest son, was involved in New Harmony's business and community affairs. He was among the leaders who founded New Harmony's Thespian Society and acted in some of the group's performances.&lt;ref&gt;Carmony and Elliott, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen also helped establish the Posey County Agricultural Society and, in 1834, became director of the State Bank of Indiana, Evansville Branch.

Paul Tillich Park commemorates the renowned twentieth century theologian, [[Paul Johannes Tillich]]. The park was dedicated on 2 June 1963, and Tillich's ashes were interred there in 1965.

Located just across North Main Street from the Roofless Church, the park consists of a stand of evergreens on elevated ground surrounding a walkway. Along the walkway there are several large stones on which are inscribed quotations from Tillich's writings. [[James Rosati]]'s sculpture of Tillich's head rises at the north end of the walkway, backed by a clearing and a large pond.

Those who walk the [http://www.billressl.us/tillichparklabyrinth.pdf Tillich Park Finger Labyrinth], which was created by Reverend Bill Ressl after an inspirational walk through the park, are also invited to ponder the quotations and discern Tillich's systematic theology.

A '''protest permit''' or '''parade permit''' is permission granted by a governmental agency for a demonstration to be held in a particular venue at a particular time. Failing to obtain a permit may lead to charges of parading without a permit. The requirement of a permit is sometimes denounced as an infringement of [[free speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Interaction of State Repression, Protest Form and Protest Sponsor Strength During the Transition from Communism in Minsk, Belarus, 1990-1995|publisher=Mobilization: An International Quarterly|volume=6|number=2|date=Fall 2001|pages=129–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; as permits are denied on spurious grounds or protestors are corralled into [[free speech zone]]s. Permits are sometimes denied on grounds that the protest will create a security risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Permitting protest: parsing the fine geography of dissent in America|author=D Mitchell, LA Staeheli|publisher=International Journal of Urban|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to be evidence that the available venues for protests are shrinking in number; that citizens have experienced increasing difficulty in gaining unrestricted access to them; and that such venues are no longer where most people typically congregate in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Places of Protest: The Public Forum in Principle and Practice|publisher=Mobilization: An International Quarterly|volume=11|number=2|date=June 2006|pages=229–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Washington, DC]], the [[National Park Service Police]], [[U.S. Capitol Police]], and [[Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia]] have an elaborate permitting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Policing protest: the control of mass demonstrations in Western democracies|author=Donatella Della Porta, Herbert Reiter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous people such as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] have been arrested for protesting without a permit.

[[File:Castle Cary services.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rail Alphabet in use at [[Castle Cary railway station]]]]

'''Rail Alphabet''' is a [[typeface]] designed by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]] for [[British Rail]]ways. First used at [[Liverpool Street station]], it was then adopted by the [[Design Research Unit]] (DRU) as part of their comprehensive 1965 rebranding of the company.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert Design Museum - Jock Kinneir + Margaret Calvert]. Retrieved 1 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail Alphabet is similar, but not identical, to a bold weight of [[Helvetica]]. It is not quite as similar to [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] or [[Arial]]. Akzidenz Grotesk had earlier also provided the same designers the broad inspiration for the [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]] typeface used for all road signs in the United Kingdom.

==British Rail==
In 1949 the [[Railway Executive]] decided on standard types of signs to be used at all stations. Lettering was to use the [[Gill Sans]] typeface on a background of the regional colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Railway Station Signs. Standard Lettering  |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001672/19490520/097/0010 |newspaper=Warminster &amp; Westbury journal, and Wilts County Advertiser |location=England |date=20 May 1949 |access-date=13 February 2017 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This style persisted for nearly 15 years.

In the early 1960s, [[British Rail]] trialled new signs at [[Coventry railway station|Coventry station]] that made use of Kinnier and Calvert's recently launched Transport typeface. While Transport has since been an enduring success on road signs, it was designed around the specific needs of the roadside environment - such as visibility at speed and in all weathers. The subsequent creation of Rail Alphabet was intended to provide a style of lettering more specifically suited to the station environment, where it would primarily be viewed indoors by pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;https://thebeautyoftransport.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/on-line-typeface-rail-alphabet-typeface-uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Rail Corporate Identity Manual|DRU's 1965 rebranding of British Railways]] included a new logo (the double arrow), a shortened name [[British Rail]], and the total adoption of Rail Alphabet for all lettering other than printed matter&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual/1_10.1965-04.jpg{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including station signage, trackside signs, fixed notices, signs inside trains and train liveries.

Key elements of the rebranding were still being used during much of the 1980s and Rail Alphabet was also used as part of the livery of [[Sealink]] ships until that company's privatisation in the late 1980s. However, by the end of the 1980s, British Rail's various business units were developing their own [[British Rail brand names|individual brands and identities]] with use of Rail Alphabet declining as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/irs/irshome/papers/ephemera.htm |title=Institute of Railway Studies: Railway Ephemera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typeface remained in near-universal use for signs at railway stations but began to be replaced with alternatives in other areas, such as in [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity's]] 1989 [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark 4 passenger carriages]] which made use of [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]] for much of their interior signage.

==Post British Rail==
The [[privatisation of British Rail]] from 1994 accelerated the decline in use of the typeface on the railway network with most of the privatised [[train operating companies]] who now manage individual stations choosing to use the fonts associated with their own corporate identities for station signs and publicity. More recently, the custom Brunel typeface introduced by [[Railtrack]] for signs at major stations and adapted by Network Rail as [[NR Brunel]] was recommended as a new national standard for station signs by a 2009 report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Transport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/passenger/stations/betterrailstations/pdf/report.pdf |title=Better trail stations |date=November 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122073856/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/passenger/stations/betterrailstations/pdf/report.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been adopted by [[South West Trains]] and [[East Midlands Trains]]. Meanwhile, Helvetica Medium has replaced Rail Alphabet as the industry's preferred typeface for safety notices within passenger trains due to the ready availability of the former and for consistency with [[British Standards]] on general safety signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Related_Documents/ITLGN0001%20Iss%201.pdf |title=Research Programme |publisher=Rail Safety and Standards Board |date=April 2003 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113643/http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Related_Documents/ITLGN0001%20Iss%201.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some train operators continued use of Rail Alphabet long into the privatisation era. [[Arriva Trains Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=3089&amp;libID=3480|title=Making Rail Accessible|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the font until the end of the franchise in 2018, with [[First Great Western]] also making extensive use of Rail Alphabet for signage until the firm's rebranding to Great Western Railway in 2015. [[Merseyrail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ericswyu/408279078/ |title=Liverpool South Parkway on Flickr - Photo Sharing! }}&lt;/ref&gt; continues to use the typeface for station signage. Its use is also still prescribed for trackside warning signs and safety/operating notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Railway_Group_Standards/Control%20Command%20and%20Signalling/Railway%20Group%20Standards/GIRT7033%20Iss%202.pdf |title=Lineside Operational Safety Signs |date=October 2009 |access-date=19 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113804/http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Railway_Group_Standards/Control%20Command%20and%20Signalling/Railway%20Group%20Standards/GIRT7033%20Iss%202.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The [[National Health Service]] in England, Scotland and Wales adopted Rail Alphabet for its signs. It is still the dominant typeface used on signs in older hospitals. It ceased to be used in new builds in the late 1990s. The NHS now uses [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/resources/commsguides/images/Section%204.pdf |title=NHS CFH visual identity guidelines, section 4 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[NHS Scotland]] uses Stone Sans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsscotlandci.scot.nhs.uk/fonts.aspx |title=NHS Scotland: Corporate Identity |access-date=27 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501123301/http://www.nhsscotlandci.scot.nhs.uk/fonts.aspx |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail Alphabet was widely used on signs by the [[British Airports Authority]] and by Danish railway company [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.eyemagazine.com/?p=189 |title=Eye blog » Rue Britanica.Typeface name changes after Eye magazine goes to press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Rail Alphabet==
In 2009, a newly digitised version of the typeface was publicly released. Created by Henrik Kubel of A2/SW/HK in close collaboration with Margaret Calvert, New Rail Alphabet features six weights: off white, white, light, medium, bold and black, with non-aligning numerals, corresponding italics and a set of Eastern European characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newrailalphabet.co.uk/ |title=New Rail Alphabet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Réalités''''' was a French monthly of the post World War II era which commenced publication in February 1946, flourishing during the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'', a period of optimism, recovery and prosperity in France after the austerity of [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation]],&lt;ref&gt;Fourastié, Jean (1979). Les trente glorieuses ; ou, La Révolution invisible de 1946 à 1975. Fayard, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; ceasing in 1978 in France, although the later US edition continued until 1981.&lt;ref name="Updike"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Updike|first1=John|title=Higher Gossip: Essays and Criticism|date=2012|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|isbn=9780241145524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5E0htafoZMC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=arts+magazine+realites&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2fKYP6VRZV&amp;sig=tFiU2jh6Bgkoj8OGyQ0lYDJMOFo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinqoij8qHVAhVI2xoKHWBUAkMQ6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=arts%20magazine%20realites&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its articles ranged across French culture, economy and politics, and featured profusely illustrated stories of interest to tourists, especially those traveling to French colonies.

==Editorial objectives==
The magazine's founders were entrepreneurs Humbert Frerejean (1914-2001) and Didier Rémon (1922–), the editor Alfred Max, and first artistic director Alfred Brandler, replaced in 1950 by [[Albert Edouard Gilou|Albert Gilou]]. They proclaimed an intention to produce a high-class, profusely-illustrated publication which was to be outward-looking, an 'observatory on the world', after the years of Occupation during which information about the rest of the world was restricted. In a mission statement they expressed interest in leading readers to discover "how the other lives, whether a thousand kilomètres away or close by, how they eat, dress, work, love, entertain". ("Comment vit l'autre, à des milleurs de kilomètres ou à proximité, comment il mange, s'habille, travail, aime, s'amuse.").&lt;ref&gt;Marie, Vincent &amp; Lucas, Nicole &amp; Chérel, Ronan, 1973- (2010). Médias et mémoires à l'école de la République : construction, instrumentalisation, pouvoirs. Editions le Manuscrit, Paris p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1946 Didier Rémon created ''Société d'études et de publications économiques'' (SEPE) (Society of studies and business publications), registering ''Réalités'' as a press and publishing group, and which from 1960 becomes part of the [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] group.

From 1947 the magazine included a literary supplement, with theatre plays, novels, or topical documents, and other supplements and special issues devoted to visual arts, fashion, business affairs, children and youth, followed.

==Readership and influence==
Colourful, slick and glossy, roughly A4 in size (slightly larger than 8 ½” x 11”), and costing 150 [[franc]]s per issue (approximately the value of $US25-$US30 in 2015), ''Réalités'' catered to the sophisticated and wealthy reader. In its early years at least, on average, 160,000 copies were distributed each month, mostly by [[Subscription business model|subscription]]. Its content included stories on the economy and politics alongside articles of interest to tourists and on French culture.

The publisher of Réalités, the ''Société d'études et publications économiques, ''received funding from the 'Mission France'&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, John (1976). The origins of the Marshall plan.

Budapest Central European University Press p.133, 357, 359&lt;/ref&gt; From as early as 1956 the magazine was also issued in the UK in an English language edition; additionally, there was an edition for the United States, 'Réalités in America' (c.1949–1974, later relaunched in January 1979 as 'Réalités' but ceasing publication again in 1981)&lt;ref name="Updike" /&gt; and in 1971 a Japanese-language version was launched.

==Photography==
[[File:Chevaux realites-red.jpg|thumb|Double-page spread by Jean-Louis Swiners illustrating the article 'Le cheval de course' ('Racehorse') in February 1959 issue, p. 44-45).]]Photography was given central place in the magazine under art director [[Albert Edouard Gilou|Albert Gilou]]. In 1949, photographs replaced the hand-drawn illustration which had hitherto appeared on each cover of ''Réalités''. Covers were devoted to photos which would generate surprise, intrigue or mystery, but not shock or horror. All sorts of images were employed but the dominant genre, at least through the early years, was [[humanist photography]],&lt;ref&gt;Bibliothèque nationale de France. Galerie de photographie &amp; Beaumont-Maillet, Laure &amp; Denoyelle, Françoise &amp; Versavel, Dominique (2006).

Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that of staffers [[Édouard Boubat]] and [[Jean-Philippe Charbonnier]],&lt;ref&gt;Marie, Vincent &amp; Lucas, Nicole &amp; Chérel, Ronan, 1973- (2010).

Médias et mémoires à l'école de la République : construction, instrumentalisation, pouvoirs. Editions le Manuscrit, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; An emphasis on photography helped promote the reputation of the publication. Among the photographers (of whom, from 1950, [[Édouard Boubat]], [[Jean-Philippe Charbonnier]], Gilles Ehrmann and [[Jean-Louis Swiners]] became salaried employees) were contributors [[Émile Savitry]],  [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[Robert Doisneau]], [[René Burri]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Robert Capa]], [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Irving Penn]]. At first each issue carried sixty pictures in black and white, though the magazine printed colour photographs from 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Jason E., (editor.) &amp; Schwartz, Vanessa R., (editor.) (2015). Getting the picture : the visual culture of the news. London Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt; Then, from the mid sixties, most images were in colour, almost exclusively so from the late sixties. Photo essays often extended over twenty pages.&lt;ref&gt;Mondenard, Anne de &amp; Guerrin, Michel &amp; Maison européenne de la photographie (Paris, France) (2008). ''Réalités : un mensuel français illustré (1946-1978)''. Actes sud ; Paris : Maison européenne de la photographie, Arles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Timby|Timby, Kim]]. (2012). ''La photographie en couleurs dans Réalités et Paris-Match''. PhotoCréation: Agence Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edouard Boubat]] described the experience of working for Réalités: 
: "It was beautiful, and very educational for us, really exciting in that we were not necessarily sent to the "hotspots" of the world, [in fact] sometimes going where nothing was happening, and there's nothing to grab. Then one really understands the reality of a country, of a situation. Escaping the news, or what we call the news, and is often a tragic smokescreen that hides the deeper reality, it's an opportunity.".&lt;ref&gt;Anne de Mondenard, Michel Guerrin. Realities: an illustrated French monthly (1946-1978), p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cessation==
''Réalités'' magazine was most influential between the years 1950 and 1970, employing a journalistic style of long articles associated with pictorial illustration which is now generally replaced by other media. Its last French edition was published in December 1978 with the number 390, and it was then absorbed by [[Le Spectacle du Monde]]. The US edition was however relaunched in January 1979, although it only lasted two years.&lt;ref name="Updike" /&gt;

The '''Sarah Palin [[email hacking| email hack]]''' occurred on September 16, 2008, during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]] campaign when the [[Yahoo!]] personal [[Yahoo! Mail|email account]] of [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] candidate Sarah Palin was subjected to unauthorized access. The [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], David Kernell, had obtained access to Palin's account by looking up biographical details such as her high school and birthdate and using Yahoo!'s account recovery for forgotten passwords. Kernell then posted several pages of Palin's email on [[4chan]]'s /b/ board. Kernell, who at the time of the offense was a 20-year-old college student, was the son of longtime [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Tennessee House of Representatives|state representative]] [[Mike Kernell]] of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].

He was charged in October 2008 in federal court. After he was led into the court in [[leg iron]]s and [[handcuffs]], the judge released him on his own recognizance, pending trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakin |first=Matt |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/oct/08/arrest-made-palin-hacking-case/ |title=UT student David Kernell pleads not guilty in Palin e-mail hacking |publisher=Knoxville News Sentinel |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/security/210602693|author=Michele Masterson|title=Memphis Democrat Rep.

== Incident ==
Shortly after midnight on September 16, 2008,&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; the private [[Yahoo! Mail]] account of [[Sarah Palin]] was cracked by a [[4chan]] user.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; The hacker, known as "Rubico", claimed he had read Palin's personal e-mails because he was looking for something that "would derail her campaign."&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/sep/19/hacker-wanted-to-derail-palin/|title=Hacker wanted to 'derail' Palin|work=The Washington Times|date=September 19, 2008| author=Rowland, Kara|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading through Palin's emails, Rubico wrote, "There was nothing there, nothing incriminating — all I saw was personal stuff, some clerical stuff from when she was governor."&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derail" /&gt; Rubico wrote that he used the Sarah Palin [[Wikipedia]] article to find Palin's birth date (one of the standard [[Knowledge-based authentication|security questions]] used by Yahoo!.&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Post|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09192008/news/politics/dem_pols_son_was_hacker_129793.htm|title=Dem Pol's Son Was 'Hacker': I Spied On Palin' Boast Pops Up On 'Net|author=Carl Campanile|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in "15 seconds."  The hacker posted the account's password on [[/B/|/b/]], an image board on [[4chan]], and [[screenshot]]s from within the account to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2008/09/sarah-palins-em.html |title=Sarah Palin's email gets hacked|publisher=''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''|author=Tom Phillips|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. This man was criticized heavily by the /b/ community, for being a "[[Knight-errant|white knight]]". However, he did not blank out the password in the screenshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1842097,00.html |title=Sarah Palin's E-mail Hacked|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''|author=M. J. Stephey|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multitude of /b/ users then attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, one of whom complained that "seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/09/4chans-half-hac.html |title=4Chan's half-hack of Palin's email goes awry|publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|author=David Sarno|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200839/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/09/4chans-half-hac.html|archivedate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hacker admitted he was worried about being caught, writing "Yes I was behind a proxy, only one, if this sh*t ever got to the FBI I was f**ked, I panicked, I still wanted the stuff out there ... so I posted the [information] ... and then promptly deleted everything, and unplugged my internet and just sat there in a comatose state."&lt;ref name="nypost" /&gt;

The hacker left behind traces of his activity. His IP address was logged at the [[Proxy server|proxy]] he used, CTunnel.com, and he also left his email address &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;rubico10@yahoo.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; when he posted at 4chan. Furthermore, the attacker revealed the original web address used by the proxy&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7631225.stm|title=Student suspect in Palin hacking|publisher=BBC News|date=September 23, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by leaving this information in the screenshot which according to experts can also help the investigation.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; 4chan's /b/ board is not archived, and posts are only retained for a short time. However, with the great interest surrounding the posts of Rubico, many, including wired.com, archived the original posts.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The email address left behind was then connected to David Kernell through various social networking profiles where it was used,&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/24/entertainment/et-webscout24 |title=A hit-and-run at digital speed |author=Sarno, David|date=September 24, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though no official investigation took place at this time.

==Campaign response==

ID &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;gov.palin@yahoo.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, that became her unique address, and no one else could choose it."

== Trial ==
In October 2008, Kernell was brought into court in handcuffs and ankle shackles to plead not guilty to the hacking and was released on bond. The case went to trial eighteen months later, on April 20, 2010. On April 23rd, Sarah Palin testified for 44 minutes. Her daughter, Bristol, testified as well. Following the conclusion of testimony, Sarah said, "I think there need to be consequences for bad behavior."&lt;ref name=Sarah&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/23/AR2010042302477.html Accounts differ as Sarah Palin e-mail hacking case is sent to court in Knoxville], ''[[Washington Post]]'', April 24, 2010.

== Verdict and sentence ==
On April 30, 2010, David Kernell was found guilty on two of four counts: the [[felony]] of  anticipatory obstruction of justice by destruction of records and found for the lower [[misdemeanor]] option of unauthorized access to a computer.  The [[jury]] acquitted him of the charge of wire fraud. It was deadlocked on identity theft charge, so the judge declared a mistrial on that charge.&lt;ref name=trial/&gt; In response, Palin issued a press release comparing the case to [[Watergate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20003921-503544.html |title=Sarah Palin Compares Hacking Case to Watergate|date=April 30, 2010|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate = August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sarah Palin said the family was "thankful that the jury thoroughly and carefully weighed the evidence and issued a just verdict."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2018/02/09/archives-jury-convicts-palin-e-mail-intruder-two-counts-mistrial-declared-id-theft/324928002/ Jury convicts Palin e-mail intruder on two counts; mistrial declared on ID theft], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', Jim Balloch, February 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 Kernell was sentenced to a year and a day of prison, preferably to be served in a halfway house, plus three years of probation, by U.S. District Judge [[Thomas W.

== Personal ==
Kernell won the Tennessee Open Scholastic Chess Championship in 2004, and graduated in 2006 from [[Germantown_High_School_(Tennessee)|Germantown High School]]. After release from BOP custody, he returned to the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]] to finish an economics degree. He first volunteered his programming skills expertise to Tennessee Voices for Children, a child advocacy nonprofit group. Diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) in 2014, Kernell participated in clinical research trials at the [[Cedars-Sinai]] Neurosciences Research Center in Los Angeles to help develop cures and treatments for other victims of MS. After moving to California, he developed facial recognition software that could identify children at risk of abuse.

'''Satwant Singh Agwan''' (1962 – 6 January 1989) was one of the [[Sikh]] bodyguards, who, along with [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]], [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Indira Gandhi]], at her New Delhi residence on 31 October 1984.&lt;ref name=bbconthisday&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/witness/october/31/newsid_3961000/3961851.stm|title=1984: Assassination and revenge|accessdate=15 December 2017|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=31 October 1984|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215211511/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/witness/october/31/newsid_3961000/3961851.stm|archivedate=15 February 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==
The [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]] was motivated as a revenge for the military operation carried out by the Indian government on [[Harmandir Sahib]], in [[Amritsar]], [[India]] which was occupied by the Sikh militants under the extremist [[Bhindranwale]]. The militants were flushed out and Bhindranwale was killed during the operation. The operation also caused damage to the temple premises and casualties on both sides which angered the Sikhs. 

Beant Singh drew a .38 revolver and fired three shots into [[Indira Gandhi]]'s abdomen; as she fell to the ground, Satwant Singh fired all 30 rounds from his Sten automatic weapon into her abdomen (thus, 33 bullets were fired in total, of which 30 bullets hit her). Both assassins subsequently dropped their weapons and surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=William E.|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926929-2,00.html|title=Indira Gandhi: Death in the Garden|publisher=TIME|date=12 November 1984|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QufTc6fAocC&amp;pg=RA1-PA135&amp;lpg=RA1-PA135&amp;dq=Satwant+Singh+indira&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1_zpPzvuT&amp;sig=T4rDS9m28MGpMCfGwgfitfhMry8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZJ36Sf_uNaGgtgOoqoTOAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5|title=Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues With Sikh Militants|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]] was shot to death during interrogation in custody soon after the assassination. Satwant Singh was arrested and later sentenced to death by hanging along with co-conspirator [[Kehar Singh]]. The sentence was carried out on 6 January 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/31/newsid_2464000/2464423.stm|title=Indian prime minister shot dead|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Supreme Court trial, Satwant Singh, a former club wrestler from [[Amritsar]], made the following statement "Let any part of my body, after my [[Shaheed|Shaheedi]] ["martyrdom"], removed and used by anyone who may need. However, if you need my eyes, let the authorities tell my parents. I have no hatred for any Hindu, Muslim, Christian, neither hatred for any religion. After my Shaheedi, let no Sikh throw any rock at any Hindu. I am not in favour of any retaliation or bloodshed over my Shaheedi. If we do create bloodshed, then there is no difference between us and [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. I am Proud of the task that I did! I do ardas [prayer] in front of [[Waheguru]]! If I am blessed with a human life, then give me a death of the Brave when I am hanged. Forget one life, if I could I would give up a thousand lives to kill dushts [thugs] like [[Indira Gandhi]], and laugh as I become Shaheed [a martyr] by hanging…." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panthic.org/articles/2275|title=Shaheed Satwant Singh Ji : (Part 3 of 3)|website=Panthic.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the executions==
The Indian government did not hand over the bodies of the two executed men to their next of kin.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Their bodies were cremated within Tihar prison. Citing concerns about possible violence, and the overall repugnant smell of the remains, the authorities refused to give the ashes to the relatives for use in religious ceremonies.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44914">'''School meal programs in the United States''' provide [[school meals]] free of charge, or at a government-subsidized price, to [[United States|U.S.]] students from low-income families. These free or subsidized meals have the potential to increase household [[food security]], which can improve children's health and expand their educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="bartfeld"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartfeld | first1 = Judith S. | last2 = Ahn | first2 = Hong-Min | year = 2011 | title = The School Breakfast Program Strengthens Household Food Security Among Low-Income Households with Elementary School Children | url = | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 141 | issue = 3| pages = 470–475 | doi=10.3945/jn.110.130823}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of a free school meal program in the United States found that providing free meals to elementary and middle school children in areas characterized by high food insecurity led to increased school discipline among the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Nora E|last2=Ruffini|first2=Krista J|date=2018|title=School Nutrition and Student Discipline: Effects of Schoolwide Free Meals|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24986|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest school meal program in the United States is the [[National School Lunch Act|National School Lunch Program]] (NSLP), which was signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National School Lunch Program (NSLP) {{!}} Food and Nutrition Service|url = http://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/national-school-lunch-program-nslp|website = www.fns.usda.gov|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to prevent [[malnutrition]] and provide a foundation for good nutritional health. The text of the National School Lunch Act, which established the program, called it a "measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children and to encourage domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/NSLA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSLP currently operates in more than 100,000 public schools, nonprofit private schools, and residential care institutions. It provides more than 5 billion low-cost or free lunches per year to eligible students, with the goal of ensuring nutritious meals for children who might not otherwise have access to a proper diet. In 2012, it served more than 31 million children per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/NSLPFactSheet.pdf|title=National School Lunch Program Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=fns.usda.gov|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food insecurity in children ==
Food insecurity includes both inadequate quantity and inadequate quality of food. Children need not just enough calories, but also enough nutrients for proper growth and development,&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = John T. | last2 = Frank | first2 = Deborah A. | year = 2008 | title = Food Security, Poverty, and Human Development in the United States | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1136 | issue = 1| pages = 193–209 | doi=10.1196/annals.1425.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improper or stunted growth can have a variety of medical and developmental implications. Food insecurity and malnutrition can affect children's educational outcomes, family life, and overall health. It has been linked to worse development outcomes for children, such as impaired social and reading skills.&lt;ref name="bartfeld" /&gt;

=== Prevalence ===
[[Hunger in the United States#Children|Food insecurity has risen in recent years]]. Between 2007 and 2008, the rate in the U.S. increased from 11.1 percent to 14.6 percent, the largest annual increase since researchers began tracking the rate in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="bartfeld" /&gt; Among households with children, food insecurity increased from 15.8 percent to 21 percent during that period.

Four million American children "experience prolonged periodic food insufficiency and hunger each year", which amounts to 8 percent of children under the age of 12.&lt;ref name="kleinman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleinman | first1 = Ronald E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Hunger in Children in the United States: Potential Behavioural and Emotional Correlates | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 101 | issue = 1| page = e3 | doi=10.1542/peds.101.1.e3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 21 percent are at risk.

=== Implications ===
Food insecurity affects the health and well-being of children in several ways. It is a major threat to "growth, health, cognitive, and behavioral potential",&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt; and most behavioral, emotional, and academic problems are more prevalent among hungry children than non-hungry children. Food insecurity is linked to lower math scores, trouble getting along with peers, poor health, and more frequent illness.&lt;ref name="dunifon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunifon | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Kowaleski-Jones | first2 = Lori | year = 2003 | title = The Influences of Participation in the National School Lunch Program and Food Insecurity on Child Well‐Being | url = | journal = Social Service Review | volume = 77 | issue = 1| pages = 72–92 | doi=10.1086/345705}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by researchers at the [[Boston University School of Medicine]] found that children aged 6–11 who came from food-insecure homes had lower arithmetic scores, were more likely to have repeated a grade or seen a therapist, and had more difficulty getting along with peers than similar children in food-secure homes.&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt; Hungry children are much more likely to have clinical levels of psychosocial dysfunction,&lt;ref name="kleinman" /&gt; and they show more anxious, irritable, aggressive, and oppositional behaviors than peers whose families are low-income but food-secure.

In addition to academic and behavioral problems, children with inadequate diets are more prone to illnesses. Researchers have found that malnutrition leads to an array of health problems that can become chronic.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = JL | last2 = Pollitt | first2 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Malnutrition, Poverty and Intellectual development | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 274 | issue = 2| pages = 38–43 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0296-38| pmid = 8560214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underfed children may have "extreme weight loss, stunted growth, weakened resistance to infection", and even early death. Such ailments reduce the amount of time students can spend learning at school.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

These cognitive, behavioral, and physical problems are exacerbated in children who, in addition to being undernourished, are from impoverished backgrounds. Scientists now believe that "malnutrition alters intellectual development by interfering with overall health as well as the child's energy level, rate of motor development and rate of growth." Moreover, "low economic status can exacerbate all [of] these factors, placing impoverished children at particular risk for cognitive impairment later in life".&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Education and food both have an effect on the "[[Capability approach|central capabilities]]" described by [[Martha Nussbaum]], an American philosopher. These capabilities, which Nussbaum saw as integral to raising people above the poverty threshold, are: life, bodily health, bodily integrity, sense, imagination and thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, and control over one’s environment (both political and material).&lt;ref name="nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha Craven. 2011. Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition affects bodily health and bodily integrity, and education has broader connections to sense, imagination and thought, practical reason, and control over one’s environment. Without these capabilities, according to Nussbaum, people fall into poverty traps and lack the proper opportunities to rise out of them. Government efforts such as meal programs can prevent people from falling into poverty, as well as lift them out of it.

==History of school meal programs==

=== Pre-World War II ===
[[Image:School Lunch Programs.gif|thumb|A School Lunch Program recipient in 1936.]]
Before the official establishment of the large-scale, government-funded food programs that are prevalent today in the United States, small, non-governmental programs existed. As early as the late 19th century, cities such as [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]] operated independent school lunch programs, with the assistance of volunteers or charities.&lt;ref name="hinrichs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hinrichs | first1 = Peter | year = 2010 | title = The Effects of the National School Lunch Program on Education and Health | url = | journal = Journal of Policy Analysis and Management | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 479–505 | doi=10.1002/pam.20506| pmid = 20722187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1930s, most school lunch programs were volunteer efforts led by teachers and mothers' clubs.&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;Levine, Susan. School Lunch Politics: The Surprising History of America's Favorite Welfare Program. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These programs drew on the expertise of professional [[home economics]]. For the people who began these programs, school lunchrooms were the perfect setting in which to feed poor children and, more importantly, to teach immigrant and middle-class children the principles of nutrition and healthy eating.&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt; Thus, the original intent of school meal programs was not primarily to increase the food security of impoverished children and alleviate educational problems, but rather to instill cultural norms.

During the [[Great Depression]], the numbers of hungry children seeking food overwhelmed lunchrooms.&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt; Thus, local programs began to look to state governments, and then the national government, for resources. The national government began providing funding for school lunches on a small scale as early as 1932. This funding originated from [[New Deal]] agencies such as the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]], the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], and the [[Civil Works Administration]].&lt;ref name="hinrichs" /&gt; The federal government monitored supplies from commercial farmers and purchased surplus commodities (Levine 6). Schools served as an outlet for federal commodity donations.&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt; In 1935, the programs expanded through the [[Works Progress Administration]] and the [[National Youth Administration]], both of which provided labor for school cafeterias.&lt;ref name="hinrichs" /&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[War Food Administration]] (1943–45) helped create school lunch programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the New Deal policies began to dissolve, and farm surpluses decreased. However, there was still a desire to keep school lunch programs in place, so federal cash assistance began to be appropriated on a year-to-year basis, and the National School Lunch Program was developed.

===1946–2000===
The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[National School Lunch Act]] in 1946 after an investigation found that the poor health of men rejected for the World War II draft was associated with poor nutrition in their childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frac.org/federal-foodnutrition-programs/national-school-lunch-program/|title=National School Lunch Program «  Food Research &amp; Action Center|website=frac.org|access-date=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of its first year, the National School Lunch Program had helped 7.1 million children.&lt;ref name="sbp"&gt;"The School Breakfast Program." N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. &lt;http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Breakfast/AboutBFast/SBPFactSheet.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the start, the program linked children’s nutrition to the priorities of agricultural and food interests, and to the agenda of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA).&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt; In these early years, the program provided substantial welfare to commercial farmers as an outlet for surplus commodities, but provided few free meals to poor children and fed a relatively small number of schoolchildren.

In the 1960s, a group of mainstream national women’s organizations began focusing on the shortcomings of the NSLP. The evidence they presented became crucial to Congressional debates on race and poverty. In 1962, Congress amended the NSLP, changing it from a distributor of state-regulated grant aid to a permanently funded meal reimbursement program. In 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] pushed Congress to provide funding for school lunches beyond the reimbursement program, declaring, "The time has come to end hunger in America."

In between, in 1966, Congress passed the [[Child Nutrition Act]], which stated that educational progress was an objective of school meal programs. The bill, signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], created the federally subsidized [[School Breakfast Program]] (SBP), which supplemented the existing lunch program by providing low-cost or free breakfasts to students at public and nonprofit private schools. It also created the [[Summer Food Service Program]] and established National School Lunch Week.

By the end of the 1970s, many advocates saw [[privatization]] as the only way to keep school lunch programs going. [[Fast food]] from private companies began to be served in cafeterias, rather than more nutritious meals.

In 1994, a number of changes were made to the NSLP, primarily to standardize the nutritional quality of school meals. Dietary guidelines were proposed to take effect in 1996, and the USDA launched the Healthy School Meals Initiative to improve nutritional education for school-age children.

By the end of the 20th century, the NSLP was the nation’s second-largest domestic food program, after the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (more commonly known as food stamps).&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In 2004, as the [[childhood obesity]] crisis came into national focus, the USDA urged school districts to establish wellness policies and initiatives tailored to local needs. The USDA regulations were intended to strengthen nutritional education nationwide while giving schools the autonomy to decide what types of foods could be sold in their cafeterias and vending machines.

In 2007, the USDA hired the Institute of Medicine (IOM; now the [[National Academy of Medicine]]) to develop recommendations for "bringing school food up-to-date with current science". Dr. Virginia Stallings, a pediatric [[Gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]] at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] who led the IOM team, concluded, "Since the school meal programs were last updated, we've gained the greater understanding of children's nutritional needs and the dietary factors that contribute to obesity, heart disease, and other chronic health problems."{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2010, the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010|Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act]] made the most sweeping changes in the history of the NSLP, putting vending-machine snacks and ''à la carte'' menu items under federal regulation for the first time. Championed by First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] and directed by the USDA, the law established guidelines requiring more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school meals. The guidelines, which took effect in the 2012–13 school year, also limited sodium, fat, and caloric intake based on students' ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/senate-passes-child-nutrition-act/|title=Senate Passes Child Nutrition Act|last=Martin|first=Andrew|date=2010-08-05|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-01-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the NSLP and other food programs have been used to improve the health of children who are food-insecure or at risk of malnutrition. More recently, however, the NSLP has made a significant shift to fight childhood obesity as well as malnutrition. Unhealthy eating patterns in overweight children—like those in underweight children—are often tied not only to individual choices, but also to social and economic circumstances such as family income and access to fresh foods.&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt; School meal programs provide an avenue by which these socioeconomic circumstances can be targeted to improve children's diets.

Most students benefit from the NSLP, even if they do not receive free lunches, because the program also subsidizes full-price meals in the majority of U.S. schools.&lt;ref name="dunifon" /&gt;

==Organizational structure==

=== National School Lunch Program ===
The [[Food and Nutrition Service]] (FNS), an agency of the USDA, administers the NSLP at the federal level. Within each individual state, the program is administered by a state agency, in most cases the Department of Education. (If state law prevents the state from administering the program, the appropriate FNS regional office may administer it instead.) The state official in charge of the NSLP works with individual school districts to make sure each lunchroom worker receives the necessary information and supplies. Additionally, he or she receives directions from the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]]. School districts that choose to participate in the NSLP follow specific guidelines and receive federal subsidies for each meal they serve.

The NSLP has relationships with several other federal agencies and programs. For example, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, an initiative of the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD), allows schools to use USDA entitlement dollars to buy fresh produce. The NSLP also works closely with the [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Aside from its impact on public organizations, the NSLP also affects corporate vendors and local businesses. The program is designed to help local farmers by purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables, which make their way to schoolchildren. Additionally, many companies are reformulating their foods to meet federal guidelines so that they can sell their products to the government.

===School Breakfast Program===
The SBP began as a pilot program in 1966 and became permanent in 1975.&lt;ref name="sbp" /&gt; It was developed specifically to help impoverished children; the "original legislation stipulated that first consideration for program implementation was to be given to schools located in poor areas or in areas where children had to travel a great distance to school",&lt;ref name="history"&gt;"Program History." School Breakfast Program. N.p., 21 Feb. 2012. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. &lt;http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Breakfast/AboutBFast/ProgHistory.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1971, "Congress directed that priority consideration for the program would include schools in which there was a special need to improve the nutrition and dietary practices of children of working mothers and children from low-income families".&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The SBP works in essentially the same way as the NSLP: Participating schools receive cash subsidies from the USDA for every meal they serve.&lt;ref name="sbp" /&gt; They must meet federal nutrition requirements and offer free or reduced-price breakfasts to children who are eligible. The USDA provides technical training and assistance to help school workers prepare and serve healthy meals, as well as nutrition education to help children understand the links between diet and health.

In 1970, before it was made permanent, the SBP served 500,000 children. In fiscal year 2011, more than 12.1 million children participated each day, 10.1 million of whom received free or reduced-price breakfasts.&lt;ref name="sbp" /&gt;

== Costs and funding ==

Both the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program give cash reimbursements for food served at participating schools. In the 2012–13 school year, the NSLP provided the following reimbursements for "non-severe-need" schools: $2.86 for free lunches, $2.46 for reduced-price lunches, $0.27 for paid lunches, $0.78 for free snacks, $0.39 for reduced-price snacks, and $0.07 for paid snacks.&lt;ref&gt;"The National School Lunch Program." N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. &lt;http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/AboutLunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; (Students eligible for reduced-price meals paid no more than 40 cents per meal.) A school may qualify for higher, "severe need" reimbursements if 40 percent or more of its lunches were served free or at reduced price in the second preceding year.&lt;ref name="sbp" /&gt;

The SBP provided the following reimbursements in 2012–13: $1.55 for free breakfasts, $1.25 for reduced-price breakfasts, and $0.27 for paid breakfasts.

For fiscal year 2011, the cost of the SBP was $3 billion, compared with $10.8 million in 1970. The cost of the NSLP was $11.1 billion in 2011, compared with $70 million in 1947. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wEwJAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=The+cost+of+the+NSLP+was+$11.1+billion+in+2011&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Life Cycle Nutrition|last=Edelstein|first=Professor Retired Nutrition and Dietetics Department Simmons College Sari|date=2014-02-25|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449694319|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budget trends suggest that meal production costs over the last five years have been increasing faster than revenues. A report by the USDA's [[Economic Research Service]] in July 2008 suggested: "Cost pressures may be a barrier to improving school menus in some cases. The nationally representative School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study II found that while the mean reported cost of producing lunch during 2005–06 was below the reimbursement rate, about one in four school districts reported costs above the reimbursement rate."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/err61/12051_err61_1_.pdf|title=The National School Lunch Program: Background, Trends, and Issues|last=Ralston|first=Katherine|last2=Newman|first2=Constance, et al.|date=July 2008|website=|publisher=USDA Economic Research Service|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued, "Further, the mean full cost of producing a lunch was higher than the reimbursement rate."

The study also found that reported costs rose, but full costs fell, from 1992–2005, reﬂecting an increase in the number of school food authorities being charged by school districts for indirect costs in response to the districts' own budget pressures (School Nutrition Association, 2006). Other sources of financial pressure include increases in health care costs for employees (GAO, 2003; Woodward-Lopez et al., 2005) and, more recently, rising food costs (FRAC, 2008).

In 2012, researchers compared the previous year's data with limited current-year data to see whether previously identified problems persisted. They found that in fiscal year 2011, the NSLP served 5.18 billion lunches at a cost of $11.1 billion, an increase of 181 percent from fiscal year 2000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In terms of cost efficiency, one can compare the costs of NSLP-compliant lunches and lunches served in schools that do not participate in the program. Constance Newman's "The Food Costs of Healthier School" (2012) compared those costs during the 2005–06 school year. Newman found that healthy meals were more expensive than meals that did not meet the new nutritional standards. She also found that the "mean reported cost for a reimbursement lunch was $2.36, while the reimbursement rate was $2.51", or 106 percent of the cost. However, revenues for non-reimbursable meals (for example, adult lunches) covered only 71 percent of the cost of those meals.

To address this, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 required gradual increases in reimbursements until 100 percent of costs were covered. In addition, the USDA increased School Food Authority (SFA) reimbursement rates by 6 cents per meal for the 2012–13 school year.

Not all of the cost increases Newman found were due to food prices; nearly half were associated with [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], such as equipment, labor, and training. Additionally, her research, which relied on data from 2005 and 2006, is now outdated, and Newman acknowledged that "another important caveat is that the foods served in schools have changed since 2005".

Recently, there has been a push to privatize school meal programs because of their rising costs. Private food service companies have much greater purchasing power than school districts and are able to save money by providing fewer benefits and lower salaries to their employees.

==Participation and eligibility==
Participation in the NSLP is voluntary. School districts and independent schools that choose to take part receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from the USDA for each meal they serve. In return, they must serve lunches that meet federal nutritional requirements, and they must offer free or reduced-price meals to eligible children. Schools can also be reimbursed for snacks served to children in after-school educational or enrichment programs.

In the late 1990s, NSLP officials determined in a "Study of Direct Certification in the National School Lunch Program" that the program's paper application process was inefficient and potentially excluded eligible school districts (Jackson, Gleason, Hall and Strauss, 2000). As a result, the program switched to a direct certification process, in which schools can use documentation from local or state welfare agencies to demonstrate their eligibility. Despite a lack of cooperation between the NSLP and some welfare agencies, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) found that direct certification significantly increased the number of participants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 2008, Philip Gleason, a senior researcher for [[Mathematica Policy Research]], wrote a paper affirming that direct certification expanded access to the NSLP.
 
However, some researchers have identified an opposite problem: the acceptance into the program of students who are not eligible for it. A three-year study by the FNS (Gleason, 2008) found that 77.5 percent of NSLP applicants were correctly certified. However, 15 percent were certified as eligible when they did not actually qualify, and 7.5 percent were denied benefits despite being eligible. While the amount of erroneous payments during the 2005–06 school year was relatively small as a percentage of the program's total cost, they totaled more than $759 million (Ponza, 2007). Subsequent research by Molly Dahl found that the problem continued, with an estimated overpayment of $1.5 billion in 2011.

David Bass wrote in 2009 that the problem was not simply an innocent one, but involved a calculated effort by school districts to commit fraud. He argued that, because "state governments dole out benefits according to free and reduced-price lunch percentages ... local school districts have a clear incentive to register as many students in the NSLP as possible".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationnext.org/fraud-in-the-lunchroom/|title=Fraud in the Lunchroom?|last=Bass|first=David N.|date=2009-11-12|work=|newspaper=Education Next|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the NSLP has a built-in verification process, only about 3 percent of applications can be reviewed to verify the reported income. Bass found that some school districts that wanted to verify higher percentages of applications were threatened with legal action from the federal government. He also identified one district that found that 70 percent of the applications it reviewed were incorrect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Nutritional guidelines ==
School lunches must meet the applicable recommendations of the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]], which state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, and no more than 10 percent from [[saturated fat]]. School lunches must also provide one-third of the recommended daily allowances of calories, [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[Iron deficiency|iron]], and [[calcium]]. However, decisions about what specific foods to serve and how to prepare them are made by local school officials. The [https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/SNDAIII-Vol1.pdf 2007 School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study III], based on research by the USDA during the 2004–05 school year, found that students in more than 90 percent of schools surveyed had the opportunity to select lunches that met dietary standards for fat and saturated fat.

School meal programs are increasingly using more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Efforts such as the Local School Wellness Policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/local-school-wellness-policy|title=Local School Wellness Policy {{!}} Food and Nutrition Service|website=www.fns.usda.gov|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; required by the 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act have gotten parents, students, and school communities involved in efforts to promote healthy eating and increased physical activity on school campuses.

In 2009, the National Academy of Medicine released ''School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children'', which reviewed and recommended updates to the NSLP and SBP nutrition standards and meal requirements. It also set standards for menu planning that focus on [[food group]]s, calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and that incorporate the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences. 2009. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12751 ''School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children'']. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unhealthy meals and malnutrition===
Unhealthy school lunches contribute to malnutrition in both the short term and the long term. In many cases, unhealthy adult eating patterns can be traced back to unhealthy school lunches, because children learn eating habits from social settings such as school. A 2010 study of 1,003 middle-school students in [[Michigan]] found that those who ate school lunches were significantly more likely to be obese than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703%2810%2900888-4/abstract Health status and behavior among middle-school children in a midwest community: What are the underpinnings of childhood obesity?] Eagle et al. (Dec. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoting healthy eating in schools may reduce adolescent obesity by as much as 25 percent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} One such effort is the Berkeley Food System, which uses vegetable gardens to promote education on healthy eating. Janet Brown, who started the project, explained that students were more likely to eat healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables when they were better introduced to them.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Gary, and Brian Halweil. 2000. Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess. World Watch 13(4):24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Economic Research Service of the USDA issued a report titled "The National School Lunch Program: Backgrounds, Trends, and Issues", which reaffirmed that one of the main goals of the NSLP, as identified by Congress, is to "promote the health and well-being of the Nation’s children".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the report, new challenges to this goal have emerged with increased scrutiny of high-fat commodities donated by the USDA, such as meat, cheese, and milk. The authors argue that providing high-fat USDA food subsidies contributes to childhood obesity. While NSLP participants have higher intakes of calcium and fiber—nutrients often underconsumed by children—they also have higher fat intakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, study results comparing weight gain among NSLP participants and nonparticipants are inconclusive.

A 2011 article in the ''[[Journal of Econometrics]],'' "The impact of the National School Lunch Program on child health: A nonparametric bounds analysis", affirmed the nutritional advantages of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act but found that "children in households reporting the receipt of free or reduced-price school meals through the National School Lunch Program are more likely to have negative health outcomes than observationally similar nonparticipants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gundersen|first=Craig|last2=Kreider|first2=Brent|last3=Pepper|first3=John|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=The impact of the National School Lunch Program on child health: A nonparametric bounds analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407611001205|journal=Journal of Econometrics|series=|volume=166|issue=1|pages=79–91|doi=10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.06.007|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors asserted that specific groups were not receiving the expected nutritional benefits from the NSLP, and put forth two possible explanations: First, children receiving free or reduced-price meals are likely to differ from their peers in ways that are not reflected in the data. Second, the households of the children most affected by reduced-price lunches may be misreporting participation in the program.

==== Competitive foods ====
The USDA report in 2008 identified the emergence of "competitive foods" as an obstacle to the NSLP's nutritional goals. Competitive foods—which may include items purchased off campus, à la carte items purchased on campus, products from vending machines, food purchased for school fundraising, food available at school parties, and treats given to students by teachers—are not included in the NSLP reimbursement plan and so are not required to meet USDA standards. Generally speaking, competitive foods are lower in key nutrients and higher in fat than NSLP-reimbursable meals. The availability of such foods in schools often undermines the nutritional goals of the NSLP.

The study recommended that nutritional standards be applied to all food served or sold in schools. In addition, it noted that the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) recommended in 2005 that the USDA's authority to regulate "foods of minimal nutritional value" be extended to a wider class of foods.

===Obesity===
Research has shown that 36 percent of participants in reduced-price lunch programs are food-insecure and 19 percent are obese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Studies comparing NSLP participants and nonparticipants have been inconclusive on whether weight gain rates differ between the two groups. The 2008 Economic Research Service study found "similar calorie intakes for participants and nonparticipants but higher fat and sodium intakes for participants".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most obvious challenge to efforts to address such problems is that even if more nutritious foods are provided, there is no guarantee that students will eat them. Additionally, the NSLP does not take into account the physiological differences among participants: Some children are smaller than others, some are more athletic, and some have metabolisms that require more calories than the NSLP allows.

Three ideas have been proposed to address obesity in schools: 
* Expose students only to fruits and vegetables as snacks. A 2009 ''[[Journal of Nutrition]]'' study, "Restricting Snacks in U.S. Elementary Schools Is Associated with Higher Frequency of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption", found that "children in schools with restricted snack availability had significantly higher frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption than children in schools without restricted snack availability", and suggested that a restrictive snack policy should be part of a multifaceted approach to improve children's diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Wendy|last2=Jones|first2=Sonya J.|last3=Frongillo|first3=Edward A.|date=2009-01-01|title=Restricting Snacks in U.S. Elementary Schools Is Associated with Higher Frequency of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/139/1/142|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|language=en|volume=139|issue=1|pages=142–144|doi=10.3945/jn.108.099531|issn=0022-3166|pmid=19056643}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Educate all students about nutrition. A 2007 ''[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]'' article, "APPLE project: 2-y findings of a community-based obesity prevention program in primary school-age children", stated, "A relatively simple approach, providing activity coordinators and basic nutrition education in schools, significantly reduces the rate of excessive weight gain in children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Rachael W.|last2=McAuley|first2=Kirsten A.|last3=Barbezat|first3=Wyn|last4=Strong|first4=Amber|last5=Williams|first5=Sheila M.|last6=Mann|first6=Jim I.|date=2007-09-01|title=APPLE Project: 2-y findings of a community-based obesity prevention program in primary school–age children|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/86/3/735|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|language=en|volume=86|issue=3|pages=735–742|issn=0002-9165|pmid=17823440}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Encourage healthier meal selection without restricting choices. Researchers at [[Cornell University]] have suggested techniques based on [[behavioral economics]], such as placing white milk in front of chocolate milk in coolers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Laura Elizabeth|last2=Just|first2=David R.|last3=Wansink|first3=Brian C.|last4=Wallace|first4=Christine H.|last5=Chua|first5=Hanswalter P.|date=2011-04-01|title=Healthy Convenience: Nudging Students to Make Healthier Choices in the Lunchroom|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/25/1_Supplement/781.25|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=25|issue=1 Supplement|pages=781.25–781.25|issn=0892-6638|doi=10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.781.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving and highlighting fruit displays,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wansink|first=Brian|last2=Just|first2=David|last3=Smith|first3=Laura|title=Move the Fruit: Putting Fruit in New Bowls and New Places Doubles Lunchroom Sales|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1499404611001072|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=43|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2011.03.013|page=S1|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using appealing names for vegetables to improve palatability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wansink|first=Brian|last2=Just|first2=David R.|last3=Payne|first3=Collin R.|last4=Klinger|first4=Matthew Z.|title=Attractive names sustain increased vegetable intake in schools|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091743512003222|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=55|issue=4|pages=330–332|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.07.012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Educational attainment===

Studies have shown a positive correlation between school meal programs and increased food security. Among low-income children, the marginal food insecurity rate of those with access to the School Breakfast Program is lower than that of those children without access to the program.&lt;ref name="bartfeld" /&gt;

This increase in food security has not been shown to have significant long-term health benefits, but it does have a positive impact on education. Subsidized lunches appear to encourage children to attend school, and to free up food at home for other family members to consume. Public-policy researchers at [[Georgetown University]] found in 2010 that "increasing NSLP exposure by ten percentage points results in an average increase in education of .365 years" for girls, and "increases average education by nearly a year" for boys.&lt;ref name="hinrichs" /&gt; The researchers found that participation in grades seven through twelve "has a stronger effect on educational attainment than participating in the earlier grades does, whereas there is some evidence suggesting that participation in earlier grades is more important for the health outcomes".&lt;ref name="hinrichs" /&gt;

===Student reactions===

An article in ''[[The Wilson Quarterly]]'' in 2011 described the impact of the NSLP in the Maplewood–Richmond Heights School District in the [[St. Louis]] suburbs, where participation in the program is increasing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/spring-2011-the-city-bounces-back-four-portraits/the-school-lunch-wars/|title=The School Lunch Wars|last=Hinman|first=Kristen|date=Spring 2011|work=The Wilson Quarterly|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Henke, the superintendent of the school district, said: "I was struck by the positive vibe around the revamped program. A teacher said he'd lost seven pounds by eating in the high school cafeteria every school day for the previous three months. A senior girl who had embraced the changes from the beginning observed that even she was surprised when football players started eating salads. The elementary school's cook of 14 years told me her job is now harder, but it’s rewarding." The article continued: "It takes a tough-minded school leader to assert that nutrient-rich food is the right choice for kids—and that it's an appropriate use of government dollars. Kids will complain initially but will come around. And a number of collateral benefits follow when students eat well. Anecdotal reports from schools with healthful and flavorful food indicate that teachers have started eating with students, attendance rates are higher, and fewer students fall asleep in class or commit vandalism and violence at school."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another article examined the program's effects within the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]. The district's food service director, David Binkle, said: "From what I see and what I hear now that students are getting used to [the new menus] and they have tasted it, they like it. Any time you make a change, and the major change like this, that's an evolution that we have to go through. There's going to be people now saying the meal is too healthy for the kids and it's stuff they don't know. The reality of this is the rest of the country is about to see what we've gone through [when they adopt the new meal pattern regulations]. We did this on purpose so that we could really get out ahead of this and start to work through it and adjust. I think the rest of the country is going to see a lot of the same impact [that we've seen this year]." Binkle added, "What I keep hearing from the principals is that as we keep tweaking and teaching and encouraging the kids, more and more kids are participating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodservicedirector.com/ideas-innovation/health-wellness/articles/school-lunch-makeover?page=0,0&amp;quicktabs_most_viewed_tabby=0|title=School lunch makeover|last=|first=|date=2012-03-12|work=|newspaper=FoodService Director|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research overwhelmingly shows an upward trend in NSLP participation. However, the ''Wilson Quarterly'' article described a challenge: "Since 2004, the USDA has administered the HealthierUS School Challenge, awarding distinction but no money, to schools that voluntarily improve the healthfulness of their meals. By last fall, only a paltry 841 of the 101,000 schools in the NSLP (less than one percent) had received awards. That leaves a lot of schools that are still promoting Tater Tot Day and reheating frozen pizzas."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) is a voluntary certification initiative recognizing schools that have created healthier environments by promoting nutrition and physical activity. Schools that apply may be awarded HUSSC certification and monetary incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hussc_incentives.pdf|title=HealthierUS School Challenge - Monetary Incentives|last=|first=|date=2010-04-01|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 11, 2014, there were 6,706 schools certified, which is 6 percent of the schools participating in the NSLP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10949">A '''Segal–Cover score''' is an attempt to measure the "perceived qualifications and [[ideology]]" of nominees to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The scores are created by analyzing pre-confirmation newspaper [[editorial]]s regarding the nominations from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Each nominee receives two scores that range from 0 to 1:
* '''Qualifications:''' 0 means unqualified and 1 means extremely qualified
* '''Ideology:''' 0 means [[Conservatism in the United States|most conservative]], and 1 means [[Modern liberalism in the United States|most liberal]].

The Segal–Cover scoring was introduced by Jeffrey Segal and Albert Cover (both of [[Stony Brook University]]) in their 1989 article "Ideological Values and the Votes of U.S. Supreme Court Justices".&lt;ref name="SegalCover1989"&gt;{{cite journal

Segal and Cover found that the scores are strongly correlated with the subsequent votes of the justices. Because the scores are based on perceptions before the nominee takes a seat on the Court, they also provide "reliable measures of the ideological values of Supreme Court justices that are independent of the votes they later cast."&lt;ref name="SegalCover1989" /&gt;

[[File:L-hyde-southern-cross-image-4.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A nuclear test obliterates a Pacific island]]
&lt;!-- No infobox, please --&gt;
'''''Southern Cross''''' is the sole [[wordless novel]] by Canadian artist [[Laurence Hyde (artist)|Laurence Hyde]] (1914–1987).{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=213}} Published in [[1951 in literature|1951]], its 118 [[wood engraving|wood-engraved]] images narrate the impact of [[nuclear weapons testing|atomic testing]] on Pacific islanders. Hyde made the book to express his anger at the US military's [[Operation Crossroads|nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll]].

The wordless novel genre had flourished primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, but by the 1940s even the most prolific practitioners had abandoned it. Hyde was familiar with some such works by [[Lynd Ward]], [[Otto Nückel]], and the form's pioneer [[Frans Masereel]]. The high-contrast artwork of ''Southern Cross'' features dynamic curving lines uncommon in wood engraving and combines abstract imagery with realistic detail. It has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the [[Canadian comics|Canadian graphic novel]], though it had no direct influence.

__TOC__

==Synopsis==

The story tells of the American military evacuating villagers from a Pacific island before testing nuclear weapons.  A drunken soldier attempts to rape a fisherman's wife during the evacuation, and the fisherman kills him. To avoid capture, the couple run to the forests with their child and hide.  The child witnesses the death of the parents and destruction of their environment from the ensuing atomic tests.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|pp=214–215}}

==Background==

[[File:Laurence Eveyln Hyde (1945).jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a man in glasses resting his head on his hand and smiling at the camera|Laurence Hyde in 1945]]

Born in [[Kingston upon Thames]]{{sfn|Hyde|Beronä|2007}} in England in 1914, Laurence Hyde moved with his family to Canada in 1926.  They settled in Toronto in 1928, where Hyde studied art{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=31}} at [[Central Technical School]].{{sfn|Hyde|Beronä|2007}}  His strongest artistic influences included the painter [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and the printmakers [[Eric Gill]], [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Lynd Ward]]; he corresponded with Kent and Ward.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=213}}

From the 1930s Hyde did commercial pen-and-ink and [[scratchboard]] illustrations, ran a business providing advertising illustrations, and made [[wood engraving]]s and [[linocut]]s for books.  He attempted but gave up on two series of prints, titled ''Discovery'' and ''Macbeth''.  Hyde worked in [[Ottawa]] for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] from 1942 until his 1972 retirement.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=213}}

The [[wordless novel]] had been popular in the 1920s and 1930s, but had become rare by the 1940s.  Such books tended to be melodramatic works about social injustice.{{sfn|Rogers|2008b}}  Hyde was familiar with some of Ward's books and the German [[Otto Nückel]]'s ''[[Destiny (wordless novel)|Destiny]]'' (1926).  The only work he knew of the Flemish artist [[Frans Masereel]], the form's first and most prolific practitioner, was ''[[Passionate Journey]]'' (1919), which he had read in a 1949 American edition.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=195}}  Like his forebears in the genre, Hyde had a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] agenda that he expressed in his art.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=103}}  When ''Southern Cross'' appeared, the genre had been out of the public eye for so long that Hyde included a historical essay to orient the reader.{{sfn|A.V. Club staff|2007}}  Hyde had asked Ward to proofread this history, but the book was published without Ward's corrections—errors remained, such as Masereel's forename given as "Hans", and a listing of only four of Ward's six wordless novels.{{sfn|Hyde|Beronä|2007}}

==Creation and publication==

{{Quote
|text   = Words are capable of expressing very complicated and very subtle notions&amp;nbsp;... But for directness and universal interpretation, pictures, under certain conditions, are unrivalled. It really depends on what you want to say.{{sfn|Beauman|2007}}
|sign   = [[Laurence Hyde (artist)|Laurence Hyde]]
|source = Afterword to ''Southern Cross''}}

[[File:Operation Crossroads Baker Edit.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a mushroom cloud explosion in a tropical setting|The [[Operation Crossroads|nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll]] in 1946 motivated Hyde to make the book.]]

Hyde made ''Southern Cross'' to express his anger at American [[Operation Crossroads|nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll]] in 1946 following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings in Japan]].{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=214}}  He worked on it from 1948 to 1951.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=214}}  Each image is {{convert|4|x|3|in|cm}},{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=215}} centred at the top third of the page and with broad margins.{{sfn|Hinton|2008}}  The one exception is of the bomb detonating, a {{convert|7|x|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} full-page image that [[bleed (printing)|bleeds]] off the page.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=215}}  Hyde carved dynamic curving lines uncommon in wood engraving.  Blacks overwhelms the figures they surround, and abstract images contrast with realistic detail in the flora and fauna.{{sfn|Rogers|2008b}}

''Southern Cross'' was published in a limited edition by [[Ward Ritchie Press]] in 1951{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=214}} on [[Washi|Japanese paper]]{{sfn|National Gallery of Canada staff}} with the images on the [[recto and verso|recto]] and the verso left blank.  Rockwell Kent provided the introduction.{{sfn|Pantaleo|2008}}  Hyde dedicated the book to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross Societies]] and the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cohen|1y=1977|1p=195|2a1=Beronä|2y=2008|2p=216}}  He was not present at the book's pressing and thus was not able to correct some blocks that he had not carved deeply enough to produce satisfactory prints.{{sfn|Hyde|Beronä|2007}}

The book was republished twice in 2007:  [[Drawn and Quarterly]] released a deluxe facsimile edition with additional essays by Hyde and an introduction by wordless novel historian David Beronä,{{sfn|Pantaleo|2008}} and [[George Walker (printmaker)|George Walker]] included ''Southern Cross'' in his anthology of wordless novels ''Graphic Witness''.{{sfn|Hinton|2008}}

==Reception and legacy==

[[File:Frans Masereel - 25 Images of a Man's Passion - final four plates.jpg|thumb|alt=Four high-contrast black-and-white images in sequence.  In the first, a man, facing left with his right arm aloft, marches with a crowd towards a group of gun-wielding figures.  In the second, uniformed figures are taking the man away amongst a crowd.  In the third, the man is seen from behind at the bottom, with a group seated behind a bench in the distance near the top in an apparent courtroom.  A crucifix hangs prominently above the bench, bathed in light in the darkened room.  In the fourth, the man has his back to a wall, hands bound behind him, with another figure lying apparently dead at his feet.  He faces right, apparently awaiting his execution by gunfire.|[[Frans Masereel]]'s ''[[Passionate Journey]]'' (1919) and other [[wordless novel]]s influenced Hyde.]]

{{Quote
|text   = Man&amp;nbsp;... can tie himself up in words to the point of persuading himself that dropping atom bombs on people he's never seen is a kind of shrewd move in an exciting chess game.  He needs something simpler, like pictures, to remind him of what dropping bombs on innocent people is really like.{{sfn|Frye|2002|p=314}}
|sign   = [[Northrop Frye]]
|source = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] review, 1952}}

In a talk with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] in 1952, literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] praised Hyde's visual skills, but said, "There's no point in getting the book for your library unless you like the engravings themselves as separate works of art."{{sfn|Frye|2002|p=314}}  He found the book a quick read in contrast to the time it took to make it, and called its "continuity" a weak point.  He considered the visualization of the bomb's destruction of living things the strongest justification for the work.{{sfn|Frye|2002|p=314}}

Comics critic Sean Rogers praised the work, particularly the pacing and action sequences, but felt it had less impact than such earlier works as Masereel's ''[[Passionate Journey]]'' (1919) or  Ward's ''[[Vertigo (wordless novel)|Vertigo]]'' (1937).  Rogers found the anti-nuclear message less effective than that of later comics such as [[Keiji Nakazawa]]'s ''[[Barefoot Gen]]'' or [[Gary Panter]]'s ''[[Jimbo (comics)|Jimbo]]''.{{sfn|Rogers|2008b}}  Comics scholar [[Roger Sabin]] found the book unconvincing, "a well-meaning but facile piece of [[agitprop|agit-prop]]".{{sfn|Sabin|2007}}  Reviewer Erik Hinton praised the artwork while calling the story "the progeny of historical lip-service and the hot-button anxiety of the destructivity of modern warfare", and considered Ward and others of Hyde's predecessors more proficient at the medium.{{sfn|Hinton|2008}}

''Southern Cross'' has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the [[graphic novel]] in Canada, though it had no direct influence on [[Canadian comics]]—it was marketed to book connoisseurs, a world far removed from that of consumers of cheap entertainment that comics served in the 1950s.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=103}}  Copies of ''Southern Cross'' joined the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]]{{sfn|Spurgeon|2010}} in 1952{{sfn|National Gallery of Canada staff}} and the [[Burnaby Art Gallery]] in 1987.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2010}}  The book received an {{not a typo|honorable}} mention for Best Book at the 2008 [[Doug Wright Award|Doug Wright Awards for Canadian Cartooning]], accepted by Hyde's son, Anthony.{{sfn|Rogers|2008a}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1610">The '''Submerged Lands Act of 1953''' (codified at {{usc|43|1301}} et seq.) is a US federal law that recognized the title of the [[U.S. state|states]] to submerged navigable lands within their boundaries at the time they entered the Union. They include navigable waterways, such as [[river]]s, as well as marine waters within the state's boundaries, generally three [[geographical mile]]s (almost exactly {{convert|3|nmi|km|disp=or}}) from the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wildlifelaw.unm.edu/fedbook/sublands.html Description of the Submerged Lands Act]; Federal Wildlife Laws Handbook (University of New Mexico)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 was immediately followed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act on August 7, 1953. Under the latter, the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for the administration of mineral exploration and development of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Secretary of the Interior is empowered to grant leases to the highest qualified responsible bidder and to formulate regulations as necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. OCSLA provides guidelines for implementing an [[Outer Continental Shelf]] oil and gas exploration and development program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boem.gov/Oil-and-Gas-Energy-Program/Leasing/Outer-Continental-Shelf/Lands-Act-History/OCSLA-HIstory.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of governments have treated [[Freemasonry]] as a potential source of opposition due to its secret nature and international connections.  After the founding of modern speculative Masonry in England in 1717, several Protestant states restricted Masonic lodges: the Netherlands banned the lodge in 1735; Sweden and Geneva, in 1738; Zurich, in 1740; and Berne, in 1745. Catholic Spain, Portugal, France and Italy attempted to suppress Freemasonry after 1738. Bavaria followed in 1784; Austria, in 1795; Baden, in 1813; Russia, in 1822.&lt;ref name="ncewhalen"&gt;Whalen, W.J., "Freemasonry" [https://web.archive.org/web/20111022194829/http://www.trosch.org/bks/freemasonry.html ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1967)] article hosted at ''https://web.archive.org/web/20111022194829/http://www.trosch.org/bks/freemasonry.html''.

Freemasonry was persecuted in all the communist countries,&lt;ref name="BatMoF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="communist"/&gt; but the organization has survived in Cuba, allegedly providing safe haven for dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosslyntemplars.org.uk/CubanMasons.htm Cuba's muzzled mavericks find haven among Masons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231131019/http://www.rosslyntemplars.org.uk/CubanMasons.htm |date=2006-12-31 }}, by Gary Marx, published April 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Americas==
After the 1826 disappearance of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]], who was allegedly kidnapped by Freemasons&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Jasper;''The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society'', pp. 180-181 (Arcade Publishing 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; after publishing an exposé and then apparently killed,&lt;ref&gt;Finney, Charles Grandison; [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp33154 ''The Character, Claims, and Practical Workings of Freemasonry''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Morgan affair resulted in increased suspicion of Freemasonry and the formation of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]].  [[William A. Palmer]] of Vermont and [[Joseph Ritner]] of Pennsylvania were both elected governor of their respective states on anti-Masonic platforms.

[[John Quincy Adams]], President of the United States during the Morgan affair, later declared, objecting to the oath of secrecy, in particular to keeping undefined secrets, and to the penalties for breaking the oath, "Masonry ought forever to be abolished.  It is wrong - essentially wrong - a seed of evil which can never produce any good."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, John Quincy [https://books.google.com/books?id=pf6gu_ayrYkC&amp;dq Letters on the Masonic Institution], p. 68-71, 1847
Press of T.R. Marvin&lt;/ref&gt;

Though few states passed laws directed at Freemasonry by name, laws regulating and restricting it were passed and many cases dealing with Freemasonry were seen in the courts.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Mackey, Albert Gallatin and H. L. Haywood [Encyclopedia of Freemasonry Part 3 https://books.google.com/books?id=Shs3fYPy7V0C&amp;dq], p. 1286, Kessinger Publishing 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  Antimasonic legislation was passed in Vermont in 1833, including a provision by which the giving and willing taking of an unnecessary oath was made a crime. (Pub. Stat., sec. 5917),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15354b.htm Vermont] Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911, Accessed June 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of New York enacted a Benevolent Orders Law to regulate such organizations.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==Asia==
In 1938, a Japanese representative to the [[Ulrich Fleischhauer|''Welt-Dienst'' / ''World-Service'']] congress hosted by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]] stated, on behalf of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], that "[[Judeo-Masonry]] is forcing the Chinese to turn [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]] into a spearhead for an attack on Japan, and thereby forcing Japan to defend herself against this threat. Japan is at war not with China but with [[Freemasonry]] ([[Tiandihui]]), represented by General [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the successor of his master, the Freemason [[Sun Yat-sen]]."&lt;ref name="BatMoF"/&gt;

==Europe==

Freemasonry was outlawed in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Communist]] era and suppressed throughout [[Central Europe]] (Hungary and Czechoslovakia).&lt;ref name="communist"&gt;Whalen, W.J., "Freemasonry" [http://www.trosch.org/bks/freemasonry.html ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1967)] article hosted at ''trosch.org''. Retrieved 2011-10-19. "Soviet Russia outlawed Masonry in 1922. Freemasonry does not exist today in the Soviet Union, China, or other Communist states. Postwar revivals of Freemasonry in Czechoslovakia and Hungary were suppressed in 1950."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

[[Benito Mussolini]] decreed in 1924 that every member of his [[Fascist Party]] who was a Mason must abandon either one or the other organization, and in 1925, he dissolved Freemasonry in Italy, claiming that it was a political organization.  One of the most prominent Fascists, General Cappello, who had also been Deputy Grand Master of the Grande Oriente, Italy's leading [[Grand Lodge]], gave up his membership in the Fascist Party rather than in Masonry. He was later arrested on false charges and sentenced to 30 years in jail.&lt;ref name="TTISTF"&gt;'The Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction', Alphonse Cerza, published by the Masonic Service Association, September 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===

In 1919, [[Béla Kun]]&lt;ref name="masonicinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/famousanti.htm|title="Famous" Anti-Masons|first=Edward L.|last=King|website=www.masonicinfo.com|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in Hungary and Masonic properties were taken into public ownership. After the fall of the dictatorship of the proletariat the leaders of counter-revolution as [[Miklós Horthy]] blamed the Hungarian freemasons for their First World War defeat and for the revolution. Masonry was outlawed by a decree in 1920. This marked the start of raids by army officers on Masonic lodges&lt;ref name="L. Nagy Zsuzsa"&gt;L. Nagy Zsuzsa: Szabadkőművesség a XX. században, Budapest, 1977, Kossuth Könyvkiadó; L. Nagy Zsuzsa: Szabadkőművesség, Budapest, 1988, Akadémiai kiadó&lt;/ref&gt; along with theft, and sometimes destruction, of Masonic libraries, records, archives, paraphernalia, and works of art. Several Masonic buildings were seized and used for anti-Masonic exhibitions. The masonic documents were archived, preserved and may still used for research.

In post war Hungary, lodges were re-established, but after five years&lt;ref name="L. Nagy Zsuzsa"/&gt; the government described them as "meeting places of the enemies of the people's democratic republic, of capitalistic elements, and of the adherents of Western imperialism". They were banned again in 1950.&lt;ref name="BatMoF" /&gt;

===Nazi Germany and occupied Europe===

{{See also|The Holocaust|Freemasonry|Liberté chérie (Freemasonry)}}

The Nazis claimed that high-degree Masons were willing members of the Jewish conspiracy and that Freemasonry was one of the causes of Germany's defeat in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Art DeHoyos and S. Brent Morris|title=Freemasonry in Context: History, Ritual, Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXq4lJeX_DUC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2004|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote that Freemasonry has succumbed to the Jews and has become an excellent instrument to fight for their aims and to use their strings to pull the upper strata of society into their designs. He continued, "The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of self-preservation begun by Freemasonry" is then transmitted to the masses of society by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Mein Kampf'', pages 315 and 320.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 [[Hermann Göring]], the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] President and one of the key figures in the process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' ("[[synchronising|synchronization]]"), stated "in National Socialist Germany, there is no place for Freemasonry".&lt;ref name="mercury" /&gt;

The [[Enabling Act]] (''Ermächtigungsgesetz'' in [[German language|German]]) was passed by Germany's parliament (the Reichstag) on March 23, 1933. Using the Act, on January 8, 1934, the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Ministry of the Interior]] ordered the disbandment of Freemasonry, and confiscation of the property of all Lodges; stating that those who had been members of Lodges when Hitler came to power, in January 1933, were prohibited from holding office in the [[Nazi party]] or its [[paramilitary]] arms, and were ineligible for appointment in public service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsozialismus.de/index.php?

On August 8, 1935, as [[Führer]] and [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]], Adolf Hitler announced in the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi]] Party newspaper, ''[[Voelkischer Beobachter]]'', the final dissolution of all Masonic Lodges in Germany. The article accused a conspiracy of the Fraternity and World Jewry of seeking to create a [[New World Order (conspiracy)|World Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bro. E Howe, ''Freemasonry in Germany'', Quatuor Coronati Lodge, No 2076 (UGLE), 1984 Yearbook.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Joseph Goebbels inaugurated an "Anti-Masonic Exposition" to display objects seized by the state.&lt;ref name="mercury"&gt;[http://mill-valley.freemasonry.biz/amermerc.htm The American Mercury Newspaper, 1941] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813052953/http://mill-valley.freemasonry.biz/amermerc.htm |date=2012-08-13 }} accessed 21 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ministry of Defence forbade officers from becoming Freemasons, with officers who remained as Masons being sidelined.&lt;ref name="BatMoF"/&gt;

During the war, Freemasonry was banned by edict in all countries that were either allied with the Nazis or under Nazi control, including [[Norway]] and [[France]].  Anti-Masonic exhibitions were held in many occupied countries. [[Friedrich Paulus|Field-Marshal Friedrich Paulus]] was denounced as a "High-grade Freemason" when he surrendered to the Soviet Union in 1943.&lt;ref name="Denslow"&gt;Denslow, Freemasonry in the Eastern Hemisphere, at page 111, citing a letter from Otto Arnemann in 1947, cited as [http://www.bessel.org/naziartl.htm#N_22_ Note 22] in ''Bigotry and the Murder of Freemasonry'' by Paul M. Bessel&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the anti-Masonic [[propaganda]] film ''[[Forces occultes]]'' was produced in [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]], accusing the Freemasons of conspiring with Jews and Anglo-American nations to encourage France into a war with Germany.

The preserved records of the [[RSHA]]—i.e., ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' or the Office of the High Command of Security Service, which pursued the racial objectives of the SS through the Race and Resettlement Office—document the persecution of Freemasons.&lt;ref name="mill-valley.freemasonry.biz"/&gt; The number of Freemasons from Nazi occupied countries who were killed is not accurately known, but it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were murdered under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="holocaust"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodapp |first=Christopher |date=2013 |title=Freemasonry for Dummies, 2.

===Papal States===

{{See also|Papal ban of Freemasonry}}

In 1736 the [[Florentine Inquisition]] investigated a Masonic Lodge in [[Florence]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref name="crudelibcy1"&gt;From the biography of [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/crudeli_t/crudeli_t.html Tommaso Crudeli] on the
website of the Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lodge was condemned in June 1737 by the Chief Inquisitor in Rome. The lodge had originally been founded by English Masons, but accepted Italian members.

In 1738, Pope [[Clement XII]] issued ''[[In eminenti apostolatus]]'', the first Papal prohibition on Freemasonry.

A more contemporary call for suppression is found in the encyclical ''[[Humanum genus]]'' of 1884, which calls Masonry a dangerous sect and demands that all bishops be vigilant on its abuses.

===Spain===
It is claimed that the dictator [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] ordered the abolition of Freemasonry in Spain.&lt;ref name="primo"&gt;
"In 1925, Spain's first dictator of this generation, General Primo de Rivera, ordered the abolition of Freemasonry in his country." [http://www.grandlodgescotland.com/glos/Literature/Articles/Annihilation-of-Freemasonry.htm The Anhilation of Freemasonry] by Sven G. Lunden by [[The American Mercury]] Newspaper, 1941.  Hosted by the Grand Lodge of Antient Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1928, one of the two Grand Lodges in Spain was closed and approximately two-hundred (200) masons, most notably the Grand Master of the Grand Orient, were imprisoned for allegedly plotting against the government.&lt;ref name="freemasonrytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/29/p10.php |title=Freemasonry and the Spanish Civil War: Part I, the Path to War |first=Matthew |last=Scanlan |accessdate=19 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828085718/http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/29/p10.php |archivedate=28 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the military coup of 1936, many Freemasons trapped in areas under Nationalist control were arrested and summarily killed in the [[White Terror (Spain)]], along with members of left wing parties and trade unionists. It was reported that Masons were tortured, [[garrote]]d, shot, and murdered by organized death squads in every town in Spain. At this time one of the most rabid opponents of Freemasonry, Father [[Juan Tusquets Terrats]], began to work for the Nationalists with the task of exposing masons. One of his close associates was Franco’s personal chaplain, and over the next two years, these two men assembled a huge index of 80,000 suspected masons, even though there were little more than 5,000 masons in Spain. The results were horrific. Among other countless crimes, the lodge building in Cordoba was burnt, the [[Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]] was confiscated and transformed into the headquarters of the Falange, and another was shelled by artillery. In Salamanca thirty (30) members of one lodge were shot, including a priest. Similar atrocities occurred across the country: fifteen (15) masons were shot in Logrono, seventeen (17) in Ceuta, thirty-three (33) in Algeciras, and thirty (30) in Valladolid, among them the Civil Governor. Few towns escaped the carnage as Freemasons in Lugo, Zamora, Cadiz and Granada were brutally rounded up and shot, and in Seville, the entire membership of several lodges were butchered. The slightest suspicion of being a mason was often enough to earn a place in a firing squad, and the blood-letting was so fierce that, reportedly, some masons were even hurled into working engines of steam trains. By 16 December 1937, according to the annual masonic assembly held in Madrid, all masons that had not escaped from the areas under nationalist control had been murdered.&lt;ref name="freemasonrytoday.com"/&gt;

After the victory of dictator General [[Francisco Franco]], Freemasonry was officially outlawed in Spain on 2 March 1940. Being a mason was automatically punishable by a minimum jail term of 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/franco.html|title=Freemasonry banned in Spain by General Franco|website=www.freemasons-freemasonry.com|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masons of the 18º and above were deemed guilty of ‘Aggravated Circumstances’, and usually faced the death penalty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/30/p09.php|title="Freemasonry and the Spanish Civil War: Part II", by Matthew Scanlan retrieved 19 August 2009|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711034852/http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/30/p09.php|archivedate=11 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Francoists, the Republican Regime which Franco overthrew had a strong Masonic presence.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} In reality Spanish Masons were present in all sectors of politics and the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVx2rFJIyQQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=spain+during+wwII#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |first=Wayne H. |last=Bowen |title=Spain during World War II |publisher= University of Missouri press |year=2006 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least four (4) of the Generals who supported Franco's rebellion were Masons, although many lodges contained fervent but generally conservative Republicans. Freemasonry was formally outlawed in the Law for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism.&lt;ref name="Ruiz, Julius p. 25"&gt;Ruiz, Julius, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sNk61qkjop0C&amp;dq Franco's justice: repression in Madrid after the Spanish Civil War], p. 25 Oxford Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; After Franco's decree outlawing masonry, Franco's supporters were given two months to resign from any lodge they might be a member. Many masons chose to go into exile instead, including prominent monarchists who had whole-heartedly supported the Nationalist rebellion in 1936. The common components in Spanish Masonry seems to have been upper or middle class conservative liberalism and strong anti-clericism.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, Penguin, 1965 p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism was not abrogated until 1963.&lt;ref name="Ruiz, Julius p. 25"/&gt; References to a "Judeo-Masonic plot" are a standard component of Francoist speeches and propaganda and reveal the intense and paranoid obsession of the dictator with masonry. Franco produced at least 49 pseudonymous anti-masonic magazine articles and an anti-masonic book during his lifetime. According to Franco:
:"The whole secret of the campaigns unleashed against Spain can be explained in two words: masonry and communism... we have to extirpate these two evils from our land."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

It was the [[Unlawful Societies Act]] of 1799 that saw the first statute "for the more effectual suppression of societies established for seditious and treasonable purposes"; once enacted it affected all societies whose members were required to take an oath not authorised by law, shall be deemed "unlawful combinations." It was as a result of the intervention of the Grand Master of the Antients, The 4th Duke of Atholl, and the Acting Grand Master of the Moderns, the earl of Moira that a special exempting clause was inserted into this legislation in favour of societies "held under the Denomination of Lodges of Freemasons" provided that they had been "usually held before the Act" and their names, places and times of meeting and the names of the members were annually registered with the local Clerk to the Justices of the Peace. This continued on until 1967 when this Act was repealed by a section of the Criminal Justice Act which meant that the annual returns of all the Lodges to the authorities ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott15.html Pietre Stones] The Unlawful Societies Act of 1799, Dr Andrew Prescott, retrieved 13th July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, several members of the British Government have attempted to pass laws requiring Freemasons who join the police or judiciary&lt;ref name="Newjudgesmustdeclaremasonicmembership"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/politics/57381.stm "New judges must declare masonic membership"], BBC, March 5, 1998, retrieved Feb 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to declare their membership publicly to the government amid accusations of Freemasons performing acts of mutual advancement and favour-swapping. This movement was initially led by [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], [[Home Secretary]] from 1997 until 2001.&lt;ref name="Newjudgesmustdeclaremasonicmembership" /&gt; In 1999, the [[Welsh Assembly]] became the only body in the United Kingdom to place a legal requirement on membership declaration for Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Freemasonpolicyreviewdue"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1699189.stm "Freemason policy review due "], BBC, Dec 8, 2001, retrieved Feb 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, existing members of the police and judiciary in England are asked to voluntarily admit to being Freemasons.&lt;ref name="HouseofCommonsresponce"&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050721/text/50721w69.htm#50721w69.html_sbhd0 "House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 21 Jul 2005 (pt 69) "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215024717/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050721/text/50721w69.htm#50721w69.html_sbhd0 |date=15 February 2012 }}, UK House of Commons, July 21, 2005, retrieved Oct 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, all first time successful judiciary candidates "must declare their freemasonry status" before appointment.&lt;ref name="HouseofCommonsresponce" /&gt; Conversely, new members of the police are not required to declare their status.&lt;ref name="HouseofCommonsresponce" /&gt;

After the condemnation of Freemasonry by [[Pope Clement XII|Clement&amp;nbsp;XII]] in 1738, Sultan [[Mahmud I]] followed suit outlawing the organization and since that time Freemasonry was equated with [[atheism]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the broader Islamic world.&lt;ref name=FitIW&gt;Layiktez, Cecil "[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/layiktez1.html Freemasonry in the Islamic World]", Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition in the Islamic world has been reinforced by the [[anticlerical]] and atheistic slant of the [[Grand Orient of France]].&lt;ref name=FitIW /&gt;

On July 15, 1978, the Islamic Jurisdictional College—one of the most influential entities that interpret [[Sharia]], or Islamic law—issued an opinion that deemed Freemasonry to be "dangerous" and "clandestine".&lt;ref name=FitIW /&gt;

After [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], while under the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate]], Iraq used to have several lodges. This all changed with the [[14 July Revolution]] in 1958, however, with the abolition of the [[Hashemite]] [[Monarchy]] and Iraq's declaration as a republic. The licences permitting lodges to meet were rescinded, and later, laws were introduced banning any further meetings. This position was later reinforced under [[Saddam Hussein]] the death penalty was "prescribed" for those who "promote or acclaim [[Zionist]] principles, including Freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organizations".&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Swiss peasant war of 1653''' was a [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe|popular revolt]] in the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at the time of the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien Régime]]. A devaluation of Bernese money caused a [[tax revolt]] that spread from the [[Entlebuch]] valley in the [[Canton of Lucerne]] to the [[Emmental]] valley in the [[Canton of Bern]] and then to the cantons of [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] and [[Basel]] and also to the [[Aargau]].

The population of the countryside demanded fiscal relief from their ruling authorities, the city councils of these cantons' capitals. When their demands were dismissed by the cities, the peasants organized themselves and threatened to blockade the cities. After initial compromises mediated by other cantons had failed, the peasants united under the treaty of [[Huttwil]], forming the "League of Huttwil". Their movement became more radical, going beyond the initially purely fiscal demands. The Huttwil League considered itself a political entity equal to and independent from the city authorities, and it assumed full military and political sovereignty in its territories.

The peasants laid siege on [[Bern]] and [[Lucerne]], whereupon the cities negotiated a peace agreement with the peasant leader [[Niklaus Leuenberger]], the so-called peace on the Murifeld. The peasant armies retreated. The ''[[Tagsatzung]]'', the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, then sent an army from Zürich to definitely end the rebellion, and after the [[Battle of Wohlenschwil]], the Huttwil League was forcibly annulled in the peace of [[Mellingen]]. The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken by the end of June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared null and void by the city council of Bern. Many exponents of the insurrection were captured, tortured, and finally received heavy sentences. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered in Bern on September 6, 1653.{{ref_label|fn_1|a|a}}

Although the military victory of the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].&lt;ref name="suter_habil"&gt;Suter (1997) is the main source used.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The Old Swiss Confederacy in the 17th century was a federation of thirteen largely independent [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. The federation comprised rural cantons as well as city states that had expanded their territories into the countryside by political and military means at the cost of the previously ruling [[liege lord]]s. The cities just took over the preexisting administrative structures. In these city cantons, the city councils ruled the countryside; they held the [[judicial right]]s and also appointed the district [[sheriff]]s (''[[Vogt|Landvögte]]'').&lt;ref name="imhof"&gt;See generally Im Hof 1974/2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural and urban cantons had the same standing in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The [[diet (assembly)|diet]] and central council of the federation, the ''[[Tagsatzung]]'', held no real power and served more as an instrument of coordination. The [[Reformation in Switzerland|reformation]] in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss cantons including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while [[Zürich]], Bern, Basel, [[Schaffhausen]], and also the city of [[St. Gallen]] had become Protestant. The ''Tagsatzung'' was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong factions of the Catholic and Protestant sides.&lt;ref name="tagsatzung"&gt;Würgler 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Territories that had been conquered since the early 15th century were governed as [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]s by the cantons. [[Vogt|Reeve]]s for these territories were assigned by the ''Tagsatzung'' for a period of two years; the posts changed bi-annually between the cantons.&lt;ref name="condominiums"&gt;Holenstein (HDS 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Aargau had been annexed in 1415. The western part belonged to Bern, while the eastern part comprised the two condominiums of the former [[County of Baden]] in the north and the ''[[Freie Ämter]]'' ("Free Districts"){{ref_label|fn_2|b|b}} in the south. The Free Districts had been forcibly recatholized after the [[Reformation in Switzerland]], and the Catholic cantons, especially Lucerne, [[Zug]], and [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] considered these districts part of their sphere of influence and the reeves typically came from these cantons.&lt;ref name="freiamt"&gt;Wohler (HDS 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thurgau]], which had been annexed in 1460, was also a condominium of the Confederacy.

== Causes of the conflict ==

[[Image:BernerSchanzen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The new city fortifications of Bern, the so-called ''[[:de:Schanzen (Bern)|Schanzen]]'', were built from 1622 to 1634.]]
At its root, the peasant war of 1653 was caused by the rapidly changing economic circumstances after the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.&lt;ref name="hds"&gt;Suter (HDS 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time the war had since the 1620s caused significant expenses for the cities, e.g. for building better defenses such as new [[bastion]]s. A significant source of income for the cantons ran dry: their financial means exhausted by the war, France and Spain no longer paid the ''Pensions'', the agreed sums in return for the cantons providing them with [[Swiss mercenary|mercenary]] regiments.&lt;ref name="holenstein_33"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; The city authorities tried to compensate for this and to cover their expenses on the one hand by increasing the taxes or inventing new ones and on the other hand by minting less valuable copper coins  called ''Batzen'' that had the same [[face value]] as the previously minted silver money. The population began hoarding the silver coins, and the cheap copper money that remained in circulation continually lost in [[purchasing power]].{{ref_label|fn_3|c|c}} Zürich, Basel, and the central Swiss cantons therefore began already in 1623 to mint more valuable coins again. Bern and also Solothurn and [[Fribourg]] set a compulsory fixed exchange rate between copper and silver money instead, but this measure did not break the ''de facto'' devaluation. At the end of the war, the population thus faced both a postwar [[depression (economics)|depression]] and a high inflation, combined with high taxes.&lt;ref name="holenstein_33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suter_habil_363ff"&gt;Suter 1997,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;363ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suter_2004_146"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; This financial crisis led to a series of tax revolts in several cantons of the Confederacy, for instance 1629–36 in Lucerne, 1641 in Bern, or 1645/46 in Zürich. The uprising in 1653 continued this series, but would take the conflict to an unprecedented level.&lt;ref name="suter_2004_146"/&gt;

Since the 15th century, the political power in the city cantons had become more and more concentrated in the hands of a few urban families, who increasingly saw their public offices as hereditary positions and who developed aristocratic and absolutist attitudes. Slowly, an urban [[oligarchy]] of magistrates had formed. This concentration of power in the city cantons in a small urban élite caused a veritable "participatory crisis" (Suter). The rural population increasingly was subject to decrees issued without their consent that restricted their rights of old and also their social and cultural freedom.&lt;ref name="suter_habil_382_390"&gt;Suter 1997,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;382,&amp;nbsp;390.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holenstein_34f"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreak of the rebellion ==

[[Image:Muenzmandat Bern 1652.png|thumb|right|250px|This edict of the city authorities of Bern declared the devaluation of the ''Batzen''. The document is dated November 22, 1652 (old style), which corresponds to December 2, 1652 (new style).]]
At the beginning of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper ''Batzen'' by 50% to adjust its face value to its [[intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. Not many people could thus take advantage of this exchange offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese ''Batzen'' were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable.&lt;ref name="holenstein_34f"/&gt; [[Insider trading|Insider deals]] of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population.&lt;ref name="suter_2004_147"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="messmer"&gt;Messmer 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by [[Hans Emmenegger]] from [[Schüpfheim]] and [[Christian Schybi]] from [[Escholzmatt]], sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to even hear them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (''[[Landsgemeinde]]'') of the population of the valley at [[Heiligkreuz]], in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the [[freedom of assembly]].&lt;ref name="holenstein_2004_35ff"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;35ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly, which took place after the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] on February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.&lt;ref name="suter_habil_122f"&gt;Suter 1997,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;122f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuessi_21"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities of Lucerne were not willing to grant the population's demands, but neither did they manage to subdue this insurrection.&lt;ref name="holenstein_37"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stalu"&gt;State Archive of Lucerne: ''Bauernkrieg 1653''&lt;/ref&gt; The large majority of the rural districts of the [[canton of Lucerne]] sided with the peasants of the Entlebuch valley in an alliance concluded  at [[Wolhusen]] on February 26, 1653. At the beginning of March, the people of the neighbouring Bernese Emmental valley joined their cause, addressing similar demands at the Bernese authorities. Both cantons called upon the other uninvolved members of the Old Swiss Confederacy to mediate in the conflict, but at the same time, the ''[[Tagsatzung]]'', the diet of the cantons' governments, also began to prepare for a military resolution. Troops from [[Schaffhausen]] and Basel were sent towards the Aargau, but this immediately solicited an armed resistance amongst the population such that the troops had to withdraw.&lt;ref name="stuessi_39f"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;39f.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 1653, the mediating Catholic central Swiss cantons proposed in Lucerne a resolution that fulfilled most of the peasants' demands, especially the fiscal ones.&lt;ref name="stuessi_28"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bern, a similar compromise was proposed by a Protestant delegation from Zürich under the direction of the mayor of Zürich, [[Johann Heinrich Waser]], on April 4, 1653.&lt;ref name="stuessi_37"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bernese Emmental and most of the districts of the canton of Lucerne accepted these resolutions and their representatives swore new [[oath of fealty|oaths of fealty]]. But the people in the Entlebuch valley did not accept the authorities' terms, as these—besides offering some tax reliefs—criminalized the insurrection and called for the punishment of the leaders. At a meeting at [[Signau]] on April 10, 1653, the delegates from the Entlebuch convinced their neighbours in the Emmental: the assembly decided not to honor the new oaths its representatives had sworn in Bern.&lt;ref name="stuessi_39"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holenstein_38f"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;38f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of the Huttwil League ==

[[Image:Niklaus Leuenberger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contemporary engraving of Niklaus Leuenberger, the most prominent peasant leader of 1653. Schönholz is a hamlet on the territory of the village of Rüderswil.]]
The negotiations between the city authorities and the peasants were not continued. While the authorities debated at the ''Tagsatzung'' how to deal with the insurrection, the peasants worked to gain support for their cause amongst the rural population of other regions and lobbied for a formal alliance. A peasant delegation sent to Zürich was turned back promptly: the city authorities, who had put down local unrests in their territory already in 1645 and again in 1646, had already recognized the danger of the agitation.&lt;ref name="stuessi_43"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 1653, representatives of the people of the countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at [[Sumiswald]] and concluded an alliance to help each other to achieve their goals. A week later, they met again at [[Huttwil]], where they renewed that alliance and elected [[Niklaus Leuenberger]] from [[Rüderswil]] in the Emmental as their leader.&lt;ref name="stuessi_44"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1653, the peasants met again at a ''Landsgemeinde'' at Huttwil and formalized their alliance as the "League of Huttwil" by signing a written contract in the style of the old ''[[Bundesbrief]]e'' of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The treaty clearly established the league as a separate political entity that considered itself equal to and independent from the cities. The tax revolt had become an independence movement, based ideologically on the traditional Swiss founding legends, especially on the legend of [[William Tell]]. Legally, the peasants justified their assemblies and their union by the rights of old and in particular the ''[[Stanser Verkommnis]]'' of 1481, one of the important coalition treaties of the Old Swiss Confederacy.&lt;ref name="holenstein_39ff_49"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;39ff,&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The peasants by then had assumed full sovereignty over the territory they controlled. They refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the city authorities and also had the military control over the area.  The Huttwil League openly declared its intention to expand until it encompassed the rural population in the whole Confederacy.&lt;ref name="holenstein_40"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the rural population supported the  rebellion; the dissenting minority was silenced by threats of violence and sometimes violence indeed.&lt;ref name="stuessi_45"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; Communications between the cities were interrupted, official envoys were shaken down and ships on the rivers were captured. The peasants even sent a letter to the French ambassador at Solothurn assuring the French king [[Louis XIV]] of their good intentions.&lt;ref name="stuessi_44"/&gt;

The confessional conflicts that dominated the relations between the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance bridged the confessional divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism.&lt;ref name="holenstein_47"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities remained in all their manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern had turned to Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was so deep that none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.&lt;ref name="suter"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;151.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military confrontation ==

[[Image:Map Swiss Peasant War of 1653 Operations.svg|right|250px|thumb|Military operations in the Swiss peasant war.]]
Both sides began to prepare openly for an armed conflict. The cities faced the problem that their armies were militias, recruited from the rural population of their subject territories, but that precisely this rural population had turned against them. Bern began raising troops in the [[Vaud]] and the [[Bernese Oberland]], two regions unaffected by the uprising. The authorities of Bern and Lucerne were supported by the other cantons at the ''Tagsatzung''.&lt;ref name="stuessi_46"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; In a dispatch from Zürich, the uprising was termed for the first time a "revolution".{{ref_label|fn_4|d|d}}

On May 18, 1653, the peasants delivered ultimatums to Bern and Lucerne and raised 16,000 troops.&lt;ref name = "Bonjour"&gt;Bonjour, Edgar, '' et al.  A Short History of Switzerland '' (Oxford, 1952) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; When the city of Bern replied with a protest note, the peasants marched to Bern under the leadership of Leuenberger, arriving on May 22, 1653. A second army led by Emmenegger laid siege to Lucerne. The city authorities were unprepared for an armed conflict and immediately engaged in negotiations. Within days, peace agreements were concluded. In the peace on the Murifeld (''Murifeldfrieden'', named after the field just outside Bern where the peasant army's camp lay) signed by Leuenberger and the mayor of Bern, [[Niklaus Dachselhofer]], the city council of Bern promised on May 28, 1653, to fulfill the peasants' fiscal demands in return for the dissolution of the Huttwil League. In view of this development, the city of Lucerne and the besieging peasants agreed on a truce. Leuenberger's army lifted the siege of Bern and retreated, but the people refused to follow their leaders and objected to dissolving the Huttwil League.&lt;ref name="stuessi_49_56"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 1653, following an earlier resolution of the ''Tagsatzung'' and earlier Bernese demands, Zürich assembled an army with recruits from its own territories, from the [[Thurgau]], and from [[Schaffhausen]] under the command of [[Conrad Werdmüller]] with the task to break any armed resistance once and for all times. Some 8,000 men with 800 horses and 18 cannons&lt;ref name="stuessi_57"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wahlen_69"&gt;Wahlen 1952,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;/ref&gt; marched towards the Aargau. Already three days later, Werdmüller's army controlled the important crossing of the river [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] at [[Mellingen]]. In the hills around the nearby villages [[Wohlenschwil]] and [[Othmarsingen]] a peasant army of some 24,000 men&lt;ref name="wahlen_104"&gt;Wahlen 1952,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt; assembled, led by Leuenberger and Schybi. A peasant delegation tried to negotiate with Werdmüller, showing him the peace treaty concluded on the Murifeld. Werdmüller, who had been until then unaware of this treaty that had been signed only days before, refused to acknowledge the validity of the contract and demanded the unconditional surrender of the peasants.&lt;ref name="stuessi_59"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wahlen_72"&gt;Wahlen 1952,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus rebutted, the peasants attacked Werdmüller's troops on June 3, 1653, but being poorly equipped and lacking any artillery, they were defeated decisively in the [[Battle of Wohlenschwil]]. The peasants were forced to agree to the peace of Mellingen, which annulled the Huttwil League. The peasant troops returned home and an amnesty was declared, except for the leaders of the movement.

Bernese troops under the command of [[Sigmund von Erlach (1614–1699)|Sigmund von Erlach]] then advanced from Bern to the Aargau to meet the forces of Zürich. Under this double pressure, the peasants' resistance collapsed. Von Erlach's troops numbered about 6,000 men and 19 cannons.&lt;ref name="stuessi_62"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was a veritable [[punitive expedition]]: the troops plundered the villages along their way and even razed the defenses of the small town of [[Wiedlisbach]], which lost its [[town privileges]] and was declared a village again. On June 7, 1653, the Bernese army met with a troop of about 2,000 men of Leuenberger's army who were on their way back from Wohlenschwil. The peasants retreated to [[Herzogenbuchsee]], where they were defeated by von Erlach's troops; the little town went up in flames in the course of the battle.&lt;ref name="stuessi_66f"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;66f.&lt;/ref&gt; Niklaus Leuenberger fled and went hiding, but he was betrayed by a neighbour and was apprehended by the Bernese district sheriff [[Samuel Tribolet]] on June 9, 1653.&lt;ref name="wahlen_105"&gt;Wahlen 1952,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Entlebuch valley, where the revolt had begun, resisted a little longer. Peasant troops under the command of Schybi tried in vain on June 5, 1653, to gain the bridge at [[Gisikon]], held by a joint army of the city of Lucerne and the central Swiss cantons commanded by [[Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]]. In the following weeks, Zwyer's troops slowly advanced through the valley, until they controlled it completely by June 20, 1653. Schybi was captured a few days later and incarcerated at [[Sursee]].&lt;ref name="stuessi_69"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

[[Image:Executions Basel 1653 colored.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Seven of the "ringleaders" of the peasant war were executed at Basel on July 24, 1653. Six were decapitated; one was hanged (shown in the background right).]]
The city authorities proceeded to punish severely the leaders of the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of the peace of Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked down hard on the rural population. The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations.&lt;ref name="holenstein_51"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; The peace of the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League.&lt;ref name="suter_154f"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;154f.&lt;/ref&gt; The rural population was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or to hard labour on galleys, or exiled.&lt;ref name="holenstein_51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suter_162"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;162.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Schybi was executed at [[Sursee]] on July 9, 1653.&lt;ref name="wahlen_105"/&gt; Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the [[gallows]] together with one of the four copies of the ''Bundesbrief'' of the Huttwil League.&lt;ref name="stuessi_374"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;374.&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 death sentences were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in [[court-martial|courts-martial]] by von Erlach's army,&lt;ref name="stuessi_68"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to eight and seven death sentences in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.&lt;ref name="landolt"&gt;Landolt 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the authorities had won a total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only with the help of troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different.&lt;ref name="suter_148_151f"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;148,&amp;nbsp;151f.&lt;/ref&gt; The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it.&lt;ref name="stuessi_73"&gt;Stüssi-Lauterburg 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt; While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased in the second half of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="suter_153"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter even concludes that the peasant war of 1653 thwarted a further advancement of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] trends in Switzerland and prevented a development similar to that which occurred in France following the [[Fronde]]. The authorities of the Swiss cantons had to act much more carefully and were forced to respect their rural subjects.&lt;ref name="suter_150ff"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;150ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bernese for instance instructed their district sheriffs to employ a far less pompous and less authoritarian attitude to minimize the conflict potential.&lt;ref name="stuessi_73"/&gt; The city council even opened legal procedures against a few of its district sheriffs against whom there were many complaints from the rural population, accusing them of corruption, incompetence, and unjustified enrichment.&lt;ref name="holenstein_33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suter_habil_404"&gt;Suter 1997,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hostettler"&gt;Hostettler 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The district sheriff of [[Trachselwald]], the same Samuel Tribolet who had captured Niklaus Leuenberger, was dismissed, tried, and exiled in early 1654.{{ref_label|fn_5|e|e}} [[Abraham Stanyan]], who had been ambassador of England in Bern from 1705 to 1713, published in 1714 an extensive treatise entitled ''An account of Switzerland'', in which he described the authorities' rule as particularly mild, mentioning explicitly the low taxation in comparison to other European states and giving as the reason for the comparatively soft-gloved government the fear of rebellions.&lt;ref name="suter_152"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanyan"&gt;Stanyan 1714.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==

[[Image:Weapons Swiss peasant war 1653.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Some of the weapons used by the peasants.]]
In the decades following the peasant war the city authorities tried to suppress the memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical [[club (weapon)|club]]s with nails on the hitting end (called ''(Bauern-) Knüttel''), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the ''Bundesbriefe'' of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to the places where the leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs.&lt;ref name="suter_154f"/&gt; Bern was particularly active in trying to censor the memories of the event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders.&lt;ref name="wirz"&gt;Wirz ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; Historic texts written during the [[Ancien Régime of Switzerland]] generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited.&lt;ref name="zhl_1"&gt;Wirz 1653.&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive,&lt;ref name="suter_155"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;155.&lt;/ref&gt; and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.&lt;ref name="zhl"&gt;University library of Lucerne: ''[http://www.sondersammlungen.zhbluzern.ch/bk_start.htm Handschriften, Drucke und Bilder zum Bauernkrieg 1653]''; in German.

[[Image:Schybi auf der Folter.png|thumb|right|250px|''Schybi auf der Folter'' by Martin Disteli, 1840. The drawing shows the peasant leader Christian Schybi (or Schibi) tortured at [[Sursee]]; an allegory on the crucified Christ.&lt;ref name="holenstein"&gt;Holenstein 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In the 19th century, the official view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien Régime]] had been weakened severely during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], when the Confederacy had been a French satellite state. The episode of the [[Helvetic Republic]], short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The [[restauration (Switzerland)|restauration]] of the Ancien Régime after the end of the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until [[Switzerland as a federal state|Switzerland became a federal state]] in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an [[allegory]] on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by [[Martin Disteli]] from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.&lt;ref name="suter_155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suter_habil_55f"&gt;Suter 1997,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;55f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holenstein_53"&gt;JHolenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official view remained ambivalent at best, though. A scene devoted to the peasant war of 1653 in a theatre production for the Swiss [[sexacentennial]] celebrations in 1891, for instance, was cut on the demands of the organizers.&lt;ref name="suter_156"&gt;Suter 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;156.&lt;/ref&gt; The first statues to honor the peasants of 1653 and their leaders were erected in 1903 on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the peasant war.&lt;ref name="roemer_2_12"&gt;Römer 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; A monument honoring Schybi and Emmenegger was unveiled at Escholzmatt on July 26, 1903,&lt;ref name="messmer"/&gt; at Rüderswil, a statue in honor of Leuenberger{{ref_label|fn_6|f|f}} was erected the same year,&lt;ref name="suter_habil_53"&gt;Suter 1997,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Liestal]] an obelisk honoring the peasant victims of the war was inaugurated on September 25, 1904.&lt;ref name="roemer_2_13f"&gt;Römer 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;13f.&lt;/ref&gt; More statues and plaques were installed in various other places at the tricentennial of the war in 1953, for instance a relief showing Schybi in a chapel at [[Sursee]], where the peasant leader had been incarcerated.&lt;ref name="messmer"/&gt;

Ideological instrumentalizations of the peasant war occurred even in the 20th century. Hans Mühlestein, a Swiss [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian, interpreted the events of 1653 in the 1940s and 1950s as an early [[bourgeois]] revolution of a progressive bourgeoisie, fitting the Marxist concept of "[[class struggle]]"; a view considered untenable by many later historians.&lt;ref name="suter_155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="muehle"&gt;Mühlestein 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians generally agree that the peasant war was an important event in Swiss history, and also in comparison to other [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe|popular revolts in late medieval Europe]]. Such revolts were rather common at the time and often were motivated by excessive taxation. The peasant war of 1653 stands out as a culminative end point in Switzerland for three reasons:
#The revolt spread quickly to cover several cantons, whereas previous uprisings in the Confederacy had invariably been local affairs.
#The peasants were well organized and for the only time mobilized veritable armies against their rulers, which hadn't happened before. The peasant leaders had clearly learned from previous unsuccessful smaller revolts they had been involved in.
#The peasants' goals for the first time went beyond a pure restoration of rights of old and tax relief: the Huttwil League radically denied the authorities' hitherto unquestioned entitlement to rule.&lt;ref name="suter_habil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holenstein_52f"&gt;Holenstein 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the city of Bern celebrated the 650th anniversary of its adherence to the Old Swiss Confederacy with many events, including a dedicated exposition at the Historical Museum that ran for several months and the publication of the history schoolbook ''Berns mutige Zeit''.&lt;ref name="bernsmutigezeit"&gt;Schwinges, R.C.; Gutscher-Schmid, C. (eds.): ''Berns mutige Zeit'', Stämpfli-Verlag, Bern 2003. {{ISBN|3-7272-1272-1}}. In German.&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous 350-year anniversary of the peasant war was reflected in the city only in a few newspaper articles, but it was widely celebrated in the coutryside&lt;ref name="muster"&gt;Muster.&lt;/ref&gt; with speeches, colloquia, and an ambitious and very successful open-air theatre production at [[Eggiwil]] in the [[Emmental]].&lt;ref name="hostettler2"&gt;Hostettler (2003–2)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taxation in premodern China''' varied greatly over time. Overall, the most important source of state revenue was the tax on agriculture, or land tax. During some dynasties, the government also imposed state monopolies which became important sources of revenue for the government. The [[Salt in Chinese History|monopoly on salt]] was especially lucrative and stable. Commercial taxes were generally quite low, except in times of war. Other means of state revenues consisted of inflation, forced labor (the corvee), and expropriation of rich merchants and landowners. Below is a chart of the sources of state revenue in Imperial China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20660">'''Third Cinema''' ({{lang-es|Tercer Cine}}) is a [[Latin American film movement]] that started in the 1960s–70s which decries [[neocolonialism]], the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, and the [[Hollywood]] model of cinema as mere entertainment to make money.  The term was coined in the [[manifesto]] ''Hacia un tercer cine'' (''Toward a Third Cinema''), written in the late 1960s by [[Argentina|Argentine]] filmmakers [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]], members of the ''[[Grupo Cine Liberación]]'' and published in 1969 in the cinema [[Magazine|journal]] ''[[Tricontinental]]'' by the [[OSPAAAL]] (Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Getino. "Some notes on the concept of a 'Third Cinema'", in Martin, Michael T. ''New Latin American Cinema'' vol. 1. Wayne State University Press, Detroit 1997.] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Definition==
Solanas and Getino's manifesto considers 'First Cinema' to be the Hollywood production model that idealizes [[bourgeois]] values to a passive audience through escapist spectacle and individual characters. 'Second Cinema' is the European [[art film]], which rejects Hollywood conventions but is centred on the individual expression of the [[auteur]] director. Third Cinema is meant to be non-commercialized, challenging Hollywood's model. Third Cinema rejects the view of cinema as a vehicle for personal expression, seeing the director instead as part of a collective; it appeals to the masses by presenting the truth and inspiring revolutionary activism. Solanas and Getino argue that traditional exhibition models also need to be avoided: the films should be screened clandestinely, both in order to avoid [[censorship]] and commercial networks, but also so that the viewer must take a risk to see them.&lt;ref&gt;David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, ''Film History: An Introduction'', 2nd edtn. (McGraw-Hill, 2003), 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still some difficulties to clearly define what is considered "First Cinema" versus "Third Cinema". For example, [[Bollywood]], one of the largest centres of film production in the world, can be viewed as resistance against "First Cinema" due to political, cultural and aesthetic differences, but at the same time it can also be said that Bollywood is a popular commercialized industry&lt;ref&gt;Tyrell, Heather. 2012. "Bollywood versus Hollywood: Battle of the Dream Factories". In The Globalization Reader, edited by Frank Lechner and John Boli. Fourth Edition ed., 372-378. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manifestos ==
There are four manifestos accredited to beginning the genre of Third Cinema: [[Glauber Rocha]]’s “Aesthetic of Hunger” (1965), [[Julio García Espinosa]]’s “For an Imperfect Cinema” (1969), “Problems of Form and Content in Revolutionary Cinema” (1976) by [[Jorge Sanjinés]], and finally “Toward a Third Cinema” (1969) by [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rethinking Third Cinema|last = Stam|first = Robert|publisher = Routledge|year = 2003|isbn =|editor-last = Gunerante|editor-first = Anthony R.|location = London|pages = 31–48|chapter = Beyond Third Cinema: The Aesthetics of Hybridity|editor-last2 = Dissanayake|editor-first2 = Wimal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although all four define the broad and far reaching genre, Solanas and Getino’s “Toward a Third Cinema” is well known for its political stance and outline of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rethinking Third Cinema|last = Guneratne|first = Anthony R.|publisher = Routledge|year = 2003|isbn =|editor-last = Guneratne|editor-first = Anthony R.|location = London|pages = 1–28|chapter = Introduction: Rethinking Third Cinema|editor-last2 = Dissanayake|editor-first2 = Wimal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Toward a Third Cinema" ===
Explaining the neo-colonialist dilemma and the need for “a cinema of subversion” or “a revolutionary cinema”, “Toward a Third Cinema” begins by explaining the dilemma that the anti-imperialist film-maker is left with a paradoxical need to survive within as well as subvert “the System”.&lt;blockquote&gt;“Third cinema is, in our opinion, the cinema that recognizes in that struggle the most gigantic cultural, scientific, and artistic manifestation of our time, the great possibility of constructing a liberated personality with each people as the starting point – in a word, the decolonization of culture.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getino|first=Octavio|last2=Solanas|first2=Fernando|date=1969|title=Hacia un Tercer Cine (Toward a Third Cinema)|url=https://ufsinfronteradotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/tercer-cine-getino-solonas-19691.pdf|journal=Tricontinental|pages=107–132|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Solanas and Getino define the problem with 'the System' (the political and cultural authorities in place) as being one that reduces film to a commodity that exists to fill the needs of the film industry that creates them—mainly in the United States. This “spectator cinema” continues a lack of awareness within the masses of a difference between class interests or “that of the rulers and that of the nation”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To the authors, films of 'the System' do not function to change or move the culture forward; they function to maintain it.

==== Availability of technology ====
[[File:Vallejo, peron, solanas, getino.jpg|thumb|466x466px|(from left) filmmakers [[Gerardo Vallejo (filmmaker)|Gerardo Vallejo]] and Fernando Solanas, former president of Argentina, [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]], and filmmaker Octavio Getino in 1971. ]]
With the advancement of technology in film in the late 1960s (simplification of cameras and tape recorders, rapid film that can be shot in normal light, automatic light meters, improved audio/visual synchronization), Solanas and Getino argue that an alternative cinema is finally possible. The authors cite the [[Cinema of Cuba|Imperfect Cinema]] movement in Cuba, [[Cinegiornali liberi]] in Italy, [[Zengakuren]] documentaries in Japan as proof that it is already happening.

Urging the need to further politicize and experiment with the format of film—mainly the documentary—Solanas and Getino illustrate the somewhat obscure and non-universal steps that must be taken to make “revolutionary cinema”:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Real alternatives differing from those offered by the System are only possible if one of two requirements is fulfilled: making films that the System cannot assimilate and which are foreign to its needs, or making films that directly and explicitly set out to fight the System.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== The "guerilla-film-unit" ====
Paradoxically, Solanas and Getino continue to state that it is not enough to simply rebel against 'the System'. The manifesto uses [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and the [[French New Wave]] throughout as a formidable example of a group which failed to properly to subvert 'the System'. Referring to it as “second cinema” or “author's cinema”, the problem begins with the genre's attempt to exist parallel, be distributed by, and funded by 'the System'. Solanas and Getino quote Godard's self-description as being 'trapped inside the fortress'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and refer to the metaphor throughout the manifesto.

Because of this paradox of subversion but need for distinctions between commodified rebellion and “the cinema of revolution”, Solanas and Getino recognize that film-makers must function like a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] unit, one that “cannot grow strong without military structures and command concepts.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors also recognize that the difficulties encountered by those attempting to make revolutionary cinema will stem mainly from its need to work as a synchronized unit. Claiming that the only solution to these difficulties is common awareness of the basics of interpersonal relationships, Solanas and Getino go further to state that “The myth of the irreplaceable technicians must be exploded.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The guerilla-film unit requires that all members have general knowledge of the equipment being used and caution that any failure in a production will be ten-fold that of a first cinema production. This condition—based on the fact that monetary support will be slim and come mainly from the group itself—also requires that members of the guerilla-film unit be wary and maintain an amount of silence not custom to conventional film-making.&lt;blockquote&gt;“The success of the work depends [on]…permanent wariness, a condition that is difficult to achieve in a situation in which apparently nothing is happening and the film-maker has been accustomed to telling all…because the bourgeoisie has trained him precisely on such a basis of prestige and promotion.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Distribution and Showing ====
The manifesto concludes with an explanation for how to best distribute third cinema films. Using their own experience with ''[[The Hour of the Furnaces|La Hora de los Hornos (The Hour of the Furnaces)]]'', Solanas and Getino share that the most intellectually profitable showings were followed by group discussions. The following elements (Solanas and Getino even refer to them as [[Mise-en-scène|mise en scène]]) that “reinforce the themes of the films, the climate of the showing, the ‘disinhibiting’ of the participants, and the dialogue”:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Art pieces such as recorded music, poetry, sculpture, paintings, and posters
* A [[program director]] to chair the debate and present the film
* Refreshments such as wine or [[Mate (beverage)|yerba mate]]
When distributed correctly, third cinema films will result in the audience members becoming what Solanas and Getino refer to as “man-actor-accomplices”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as they become crucial to the film achieving its goal to transform society. It is only when the “man-actor-accomplice” responds to the film that third cinema becomes effective.&lt;blockquote&gt;“Freeing a forbidden truth means setting free the possibility of indignation and subversion. Our truth, that of the new man who builds himself by getting rid of all the defects that still weigh him down, is a bomb of inexhaustible power and, at the same time, the only real possibility of life.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
'''Third Cinema''' manifestos and theories evolved in the 1960s and 1970s as a response to the social, political, and economic realities in Latin American countries which were experiencing oppression from perceived Neo-colonial policies. In their manifesto, Solana and Getino describe Third Cinema as a cinematic movement and a dramatic alternative to First Cinema, which was produced in Hollywood, for the purpose of entertaining its audiences; and from Second Cinema that increased the author’s liberty of expression. Fundamentally different, Third Cinema films sought to inspire revolution against class, racial and gender inequalities. Spectators were called upon to reflect on social injustices and the process by which their realities occurred, and to take action to transform their conditions. Even though Third Cinema films arose during revolutionary eras in Latin America and other countries, this filmmaking is still influential today. This style of filmmaking includes a radical form of production, distribution and exhibition that seeks to expose the living conditions of people at the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Teshome Habte. "''Third Cinema in the Third World'': ''The Dynamics of Style and Ideology''. Order No. 8001422 University of California, Los Angeles, 1979. Ann Arbor: ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Purpose and Goals of Third Cinema'''
Third Cinema seeks to expose the process by which oppression occurs; and to criticize those responsible for social inequality in a country or community.
Some of the goals of Third Cinema are:
* Raise political consciousness in the viewer/spectator
* Expose historical, social, political and/or economic policies that have led to exploitive conditions for the nation
* Engage spectators in reflection which will inspire them to take revolutionary action and improve their conditions
* Create films that express the experiences of the masses of a particular region
* Produce and distribute films that are uncensored by oppressive entities

'''Production'''
Due to their political nature, Third Cinema films were often censored and therefore, the production and distribution of these films were innovative. Films used documentary clips, news reels, photographs, video clips, interviews and/or statistics and in some cases, non-professional actors. These production elements are combined in an inventive manner to create a message that is specific to its local audience. The staff in production share all aspects of the production process by working collectively. In Third Cinema, for example, a Director can be the Cameraman, the Photographer or the Writer at different phases of the production.  Since Third Cinema films were highly politicized, they often lacked the funding and support needed for production or distribution and instead sought funding outside government agencies or traditional financing opportunities available to commercial films. Other unique aspects of Third Cinema film production is the use of their local natural landscape for film shootings often in parts of the country not previously seen. This unique feature was augmented by highlighting the local history and culture of its nation.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Kim. http://thirdcinema.blueskylimit.com, Web. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in Third Cinema ==
Third Cinema’s critique and resistance of Hollywood’s imperialist “spectator” cinema also opened for differing representations of women in film. While feminist film movements in the United States in the 1970s critiqued the [[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]] and [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] sexism within the First-World, the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of [[heterosexism]] with racism and imperialism seemed to get little attention from mainstream film journals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Third Cinema|last=Shohat|first=Ella|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Guneratne|editor-first=Anthony R.|location=London|pages=51–78|chapter=Post-Third-Worldist culture|editor-last2=Dissanayake|editor-first2=Wimal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the reluctance of First-World feminists to acknowledge the importance of nationalism and geographic identity within differing struggles of women, the films made by the women of Third Cinema were usually seen as “burdened” from the Western feminist perspective by these identities.&lt;blockquote&gt;“Notions of nation and race, along with community-based work, are implicitly dismissed as both too “specific” to qualify for the theoretical realm of “feminist theory” and as too “inclusive” in their concern for nation and race that they presumably “lose sight” of feminism.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Along with the advancement and availability of technology, and the revolutionary tactics proposed by Third Cinema, [[Third-Worldism|third-worldist]] feminist film-makers began to tell their own stories. Because the genre proposed a non-homogeneous approach to cinema (one which allowed variation from region to region and intersection between fiction and documentary), differing stories of “womanhood” and women’s position within revolutions could be told. Lebanese film director [[Heiny Srour]] commented in one interview:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Those of us from the Third World have to reject the ideas of film narration based on the 19th century bourgeois novel with its commitment to harmony. Our societies have been too lacerated and fractured by colonial powers to fit into those neat scenarios.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyeonpalestine.be/2014/portfolio/laila-and-the-wolves-ismael/|title=Laila and the Wolves + Ismael - Eye On Palestine|website=Eye On Palestine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Notable films include [[Sarah Maldoror]]’s ''[[Sambizanga (film)|Sambizanga]]'' (Mozambique, 1972) which takes place in Angola where a woman awakens to “revolutionary consciousness” to the struggle of the ruling party the MPLA.  In [[Heiny Srour]]’s documentary ''[[Saat al Tahrir (The Hour of Liberation)]]'' (Oman, 1973) followed women fighters during the revolution in [[Oman]]. Srour’s 1984 film ''Leila wal dhiab'' (''[[Leila and the Wolves]]'') (Lebanon) followed the role of women in the Palestine Liberation Movement. [[Helena Solberg Ladd]]’s ''[[Nicaragua Up From the Ashes]]'' (U.S. 1982) documents the role of women in the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Sandinista]] revolution. [[Sara Gómez|Sara Gomez]]’s ''[[De cierta manera (One Way or Another)]]'' epitomizes Third Cinema’s involvement in the intersection of fiction and documentary as it gives a feminist critique of the Cuban revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14943">The '''Tiananmen Mothers''' is a group of [[Chinese democracy movement|Chinese democracy activists]] promoting a change in the government's position over the suppression of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. It is led by [[Ding Zilin]], a retired university professor whose teenage son was shot and killed by government troops during the protests. The group – comprising the parents, friends and relatives of victims of the massacre – formed in September 1989 when Ding, along with her husband Jiang Peikun, met another mother, Zhang Xianling, whose 19-year-old son was also killed on June 4, 1989.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;Tai (2004), pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as campaigning, the group also disseminates information about the events to the public, including through the internet.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Currently, the group consists of relatives of 125 individuals killed during the protests.&lt;ref&gt;Carrabine, Cox, Lee, South &amp; Plummer (2009), pp. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; For her efforts, Ding has been hailed as an "advocate for the dead".&lt;ref name=s&gt;Stichele &amp; Penner (2005), pp. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A large group of Beijing-based student activists (along with nearby people) were shot on the orders of Deng Xiaoping, then a chief military commander of People's Liberation Army. This happened during the summer of 1989, centered around sunset in the evening on June 4. Beijing medical doctors from the very beginning recall critically injured patients being carried into hospitals of nearly all specialties, throughout the night continuing into noon.&lt;ref&gt;Wordpress.org (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Ding Zilin.jpg|thumb|right|Ding Zilin, founder and leader of the Tiananmen Mothers]]
Prior to June 1989, Ding Zilin was a Philosophy professor at the [[People's University]] and a member of the [[Communist Party of China]]. On June 3, 1989, her 17-year-old son [[Jiang Jielian]] was killed on his way to [[Tiananmen Square]]. Ding launched a one-woman campaign to establish what had happened to her son and those who were killed that night.&lt;ref name=g2&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The government had put her under surveillance and Ding experienced harassment as she met with other victims families.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; Describing the organisation, Ding announced that the group were "a common group of citizens brought together by a shared fate and suffering".&lt;ref name=g2/&gt;

"I cannot turn a blind eye to the pain of those who suffer my same fate. As a group, they have been forgotten and forsaken by society. I made the firm decision to continue in my mission of locating and helping June Fourth families, until the government itself actively takes up this project and there is no longer any need for our efforts."&lt;ref name=g4&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the expansion of the group, many Chinese intellectuals had kept away from the movement, as they did with the [[Democracy Wall#In China|Democracy Wall movement]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=g3&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 70&lt;/ref&gt; One exception was [[Wu Zuguang]], who advocated a reversal of the governments position at a meeting of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] in 1997, and he did not suffer any repercussions for his comments because of his age.&lt;ref name=g3/&gt; Other members of the group included prominent student Jiang Qisheng, a graduate of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics who became head of the Beijing Student Autonomous Federation which acted in conjunction with other universities and formed part of a delegation that met with Premier [[Li Peng]] to try and resolve the Tiananmen protests peacefully.&lt;ref name="g5"&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He was jailed for 18 months and upon his release in February 1991, was denied regular employment.&lt;ref name="g5"/&gt;

Further promoting their campaign, members of the Tiananmen Mothers sought to gain the attention of the international media. In a May 1991 interview with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], Ding and Zhang Xianling condemned the actions of the Chinese government and in particular Premier Li Peng who claimed that the crackdown was necessary in order to maintain social stability.&lt;ref name=g4/&gt; She also called on people of conscience not to forget those who had lost their lives. Three years later in 1994, and on the fifth anniversary of the crackdown, Ding published ''The Factual Account of a Search for the June 4 Victims'' listing 96 individuals who had been killed. By the tenth anniversary on June 4, 1999, she had reported 155 deaths and 65 who were injured but noted that these were "only the tip of the iceberg... but at least it is visible."&lt;ref name=g4/&gt;

Ding's regular public campaigning, including public petitions and lawsuits against the government, saw her expelled from the party in May 1992, and both Ding and her husband, also a professor at the university, were forced into retirement in 1993.&lt;ref name=g3/&gt; The Tiananmen Mothers movement has also inspired other families of [[political prisoner]]s to campaign for their release.&lt;ref name=g4/&gt; Since then, a few dozen families meet together regularly on every anniversary of the crackdown, despite government intimidation.&lt;ref name=g4/&gt; Ding and other members have occasionally been detained by authorities as a result of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Defenders (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==

===Demands===
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] currently views the protests as a "counterrevolutionary uprising".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiananmen Mothers group, which was conducted without official approval, put forward a five-point demand to the Chinese government in relation to the protest:&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

*The right to mourn peacefully in public;
*The right to accept humanitarian aid from organizations and individuals inside and outside China;
*No more persecution of victims, including those injured in the shootings and the families of the dead;
*The release of all people still in prison for their role in the 1989 protests; and
*A full, public investigation into the crackdown

The group also wants the Chinese government to name the dead, compensate families and punish those responsible.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;BBC News (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The government made a payout of 70,000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] for the first time in 2006 to one of the victims families. The move was welcomed by Zilin, though she said it was unlikely to indicate a change in the government's position.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public appeals===
The Tiananmen Mothers have made many public appeals, challenging the government. They protested to the [[National People's Congress]], the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the judiciary and the population. The group has also opened up contacts with [[UN Human Rights Council]] and foreign media, issuing a video demanding the government reassess Tiananmen.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom (2007),  pp. 113&lt;/ref&gt; On the tenth anniversary, despite memories of the event fading due to strong [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|government censorship]], Jiang Qisheng, who had since been released, drafted a letter along with fifteen others appealing for quiet commemoration by lighting candles in cities across China.&lt;ref name=g5&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He played a major role in organising the event, posting flyers on lampposts calling on the population to "light a myriad of candles to collectively commemorate the brave spirits of June Fourth" and as a result, several petitions to hold protest were submitted, but were rejected by government authorities.&lt;ref name=g6&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang was arrested on shortly before the anniversary; in court on November 1, 1999, he defended himself, maintaining he was exercising [[freedom of speech]] and recalling a previous reversal of the government's term "counterrevolutionary" after the [[Gang of Four]] and [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name=g6/&gt; He urged the government not to imprison people for expressing their views, "Simply by writing and talking, do I commit such a crime against heaven that I must be put to death?" and his lawyer, Mao Shaoping argued that the group's activities did not amount to "subversion of state power".&lt;ref name=g6/&gt; Jiang was charged and released from prison on May 19, 2003.

Despite Jiang's arrest, Ding remained undeterred. On June 4, 1999, the group presented a petition signed by 108 relatives to the [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]], asking for a legal ruling on the deaths of the protestors. The petition contained evidence they had collected including testimonies and names of the dead and injured.&lt;ref name=g7&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; They asserted that they were exercising their political rights, and not engaging in any illegal activities.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; The movement still continues, receiving warnings not to commemorate and undergoing increased surveillance around June 3–4 every year.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; An increasing number of dissidents and former intellectuals from the party, including [[Hu Yaobang]]s former secretary and [[Huang Qi]] have joined the group, and have been expelled from the establishment as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman (2005), pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation has released a version of the same every year since the protests. In 2006, the Tiananmen Mothers called for "a process of truth and reconciliation" over what the government did in Tiananmen Square.&lt;ref&gt;Epoch Times (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, they urged the government to "break the [[taboo]]" surrounding the incident.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The Tiananmen Mothers website is blocked by internet censors in China.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Sun (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts say pressure by groups like the Tiananmen Mothers may eventually lead to some acknowledgment of the deaths during the crackdown, such as a plaque placed on the square, but most agree that will not come soon.

===Arrests===
Ding Zilin, Zhang Xianling, who lost her 19-year-old son, and Huang Jinping, who lost her 30-year-old husband were detained in March 2004. Authorities first denied the arrests, but later said they had been detained for engaging in what were described as illegal activities sponsored by overseas forces. They were released later in the week but remained under close surveillance in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[[TIME]], (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The women have been under what advocates describe as [[house arrest]]. All their calls are monitored and they are told not to talk to other activists, with foreign [[Mass media|media]], and with [[human rights]] organizations.

===Newspaper advert controversy===
On June 4, 2007, the ''[[Chengdu Evening News]]'' ran a one-page line commemorating the Tiananmen Mothers, stating, "Saluting the strong mothers of June 4th victims." Officials at the newspaper refused to answer questions regarding the advert. It was later suggested that the person who ran the advert was unaware of the significance of ''6/4'', instead being told it was related to a mining disaster that took place.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Three editors were later fired from the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:saifivillage.JPG|thumb|right|The main square of [[Saifi Village]] in [[Beirut Central District|Centre Ville]], [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]]]
In [[urban planning]] and [[urban design|design]], an '''urban village''' is an urban development typically characterized by [[medium-density housing]], [[mixed use]] zoning,  good [[public transit]] and an emphasis on [[pedestrianization]] and [[public space]].

Urban villages are seen to provide an alternative to recent patterns of urban development in many cities, especially decentralization and [[urban sprawl]]. They are generally purported to:
* Reduce [[Automobile dependency|car reliance]] and promote cycling, walking and transit use
* Provide a high level of self-containment (people working, recreating and living in the same area)
* Help facilitate strong community institutions and interaction

The concept of urban villages was formally born in Britain in the late 1980s with the establishment of the [[Urban Villages Group]] (UVG).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Aldous (1992) ''Urban villages : a concept for creating mixed-use urban developments on a sustainable scale'', London: Urban Villages Group, pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; Following pressure from the UVG, the concept was prioritized in British national planning policy between 1997 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment (DOE) (1997) ''PPG1: General Policies and Proposals'', London: DOE&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban villages also come in the form of suburbs of metropolitan areas that are politically designated as villages.

==Application==
Urban village ideals have been applied to new [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] and [[brownfield land|brownfield]] developments and [[urban renewal]] projects. The concept has been widely adopted in many countries and used by both government development agencies as well as private enterprise as a guiding concept for many projects.

==Influences and impetus==
The ideas of the urban commentator [[Jane Jacobs]] are widely regarded as having had the largest influence on the urban village concept.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gratz (2003), 'Authentic urbanism and the Jane Jacobs legacy' in ''Urban villages and the making of communities'', London: Spon Press, pp. 17-23&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs rejected the [[modernist]] views that dominated urban planning and architecture in the 1950s-60s and constructed an alternative philosophy that values traditional neighborhoods and the role of the inner city.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Jacobs (1961) ''The death and life of American cities'', New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents believe that urban villages provide a viable alternative to the social ills that characterize modernism in cities, such as freeways and high-rise estates.

Another strong impetus for urban villages has been growing disenchantment with the [[urban sprawl]] that has characterized the development of many cities since [[World War II]]. Urban villages are seen to create self-contained communities that reduce the need to travel large distances and reduce the subsequent reliance on the automobile. The decline of noxious industry and the emergence of the [[service economy]] allows the mixing of employment and residential activities without detriment to residents. This is in contrast to the single-use [[zoning]] that helped fuel urban sprawl during the industrial and manufacturing eras. Through more consolidated development, urban villages can reduce the intrusion of urban growth on the countryside. These environmental consequences of urban sprawl have come to dominate discussion promoting urban villages in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Biddulph, Bridgett Franklin &amp; Malcolm Tait (2003) 'From concept to completion: A critical analysis of the urban village', ''Town and Regional Planning'', 74:2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urban villages are widely seen to provide a solution to the demise of community that is often associated with modernism and sprawl. The concept uses the social and physical [[urban morphology|morphology]] of the traditional rural [[village]] as an inspiration for creating better functioning communities. The urban village movement has been influenced by [[Ebenezer Howard]]’s [[Garden Cities of To-morrow|Garden City]] ideals which also emphasize [[environmental determinism]] in relation to community. Urban design techniques such as public space and pedestrianization are employed to facilitate the development of community by encouraging human interaction. This philosophy shares many attributes with the [[new urbanism]] school of thought.

==Criticisms==
Many urban village developments, both Government and privately initiated, have been seen to depart from the original ideals of the concept. Private developments often use the ‘urban village’ label as an advertising pitch or to win Government support for their project.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Biddulph, Bridgett Franklin &amp; Malcolm Tait (2003) 'From concept to completion: A critical analysis of the urban village', ''Town and Regional Planning'', 74:2&lt;/ref&gt; Many developments, although intended to create a true urban village form, have not achieved their objectives. Some planners question whether a genuine urban village has actually been built.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Franklin and Malcolm Tait (2003), 'Constructing an image: The urban village concept in the UK', ''Planning Theory'', 1:3&lt;/ref&gt; 

The objectives of urban villages are often criticized as unrealistic because they ignore broader social and economic realities. The ability to create self-contained villages is questionable as employment and activity patterns continue to become more complex. The viability of creating a variety of employment and activity within an area with a small population base can also be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Tait (2003), 'Urban Villages as self-sufficient, integrated communities: a case study in London's Docklands', ''Urban Design International'', 8&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the demise of the neighborhood community is a function of “conscious economic and social choice” rather than a product of urban form.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Barton (2000), 'Do Neighbourhoods Matter?', ''Sustainable Communities: The Potential for Eco-Neighbourhoods'', London: Earthscan&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitations of the urban village concept to achieve sustainability in urban areas have also been studied in developing countries, which further emphasizes the institutional barriers against such an application in the case of the developing countries. This issue becomes more critical when we accept that the institutional landscape in rural environments is more complex than urban areas and that incompatible institutional structure of the developing countries would add to the idealistic nature of the urban village concept.&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Bahrainy and Mehdi Azizkhani (2012), 'Institutional Barriers to the Application of Urban Village as A Tool for Achieving Urban Sustainability in Developing Countries-the Case of Asheghabaad, Isfahan, Iran', ''Armanshahr Journal'', 5(8), 43:57&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some urban commentators believe that urban villages are not a new concept and are simply a re-formulation of ideas that have been prevalent in urban planning for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Franklin and Malcolm Tait (2003), 'Constructing an image: The urban village concept in the UK', ''Planning Theory'', 1:3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yukon First Nation Party''' is a territorial [[First Nations]] political party in [[Yukon]], Canada.

It was registered three days before the [[Yukon general election, 2011|2011 general election]] was called, by Gerald Dickson Sr., a member of the [[Kluane First Nation]]. Dickson created the party with the encouragement of several First Nation elders, who felt that their issues were not being heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stasyszyn|first=Roxanne|title=Yukon's First Nations Party|url=http://www.yukon-news.com/news/24761/|publisher=Yukon News|accessdate=September 19, 2011|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stasyszyn|first=Roxanne|title=Yukon Party snubs First Nation leaders|url=http://www.yukon-news.com/news/24816/|publisher=Yukon News|accessdate=September 19, 2011|date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party believes in sustaining the traditional laws of respect, honour, love, compassion, and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sander-Green|first=Nadine|title=Yukon First Nations Party established|url=http://www.whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/yukon-first-nations-party-established/|publisher=Whitehorse Star|accessdate=September 19, 2011|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
