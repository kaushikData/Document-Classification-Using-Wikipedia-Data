==Scope==
The precise effect of a banker's lien varies according to the laws of a particular jurisdiction.  Under English common law it applies to all property coming into the possession of the bank in the usual course of banking business,&lt;ref&gt;''Brandao v Barnett'' (1846) 12 Cl 7 F 787&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the important exception that it does not apply to property which is deposited with the bank for safe custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Leese v Martin'' (1873) LR 17 Eq 224 at 235.  The bank holds such property as [[bailment|bailee]], and may be entitled to exercise a separate lien as such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most common law liens normally only give the lienee a passive right to retain the property, unusually, the banker's lien permits the bank the sell the relevant property.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberg v International Banking Corporation'' (1923) 14 Ll LR 344 at 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The lien does not generally extend to intangible rights, including credit balances on accounts.  However those credit balances may be subject to the [[banker's right to combine accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;

The banker's lien may be modified or abrogated by agreement.&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

[[File:Bible of Christian III 1550.jpg|thumb|upright = 1.67 | Title page of Christian III's Bible, from 1550]]

Since the first spread of Christianity in [[Norway]], numerous translations of the [[Bible]] have been published. Translations have appeared in several of the official languages that Norway has had throughout its history, including editions in [[Old Norse]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and both current standard forms [[Nynorsk]] and [[Bokmål]].

== Old Norwegian "Stjórn" ==
At the end of the 13th century, some parts of the Old Testament were translated into [[Old Norse]]. This rendering of the text became known as "[[Stjórn]]", meaning "Government," because it was most likely done at the [[court]] of King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]]. It serves as more of a [[paraphrase]] of the Bible than as a strict translation.

The text was published in Norway by [[C. R. Unger]] in 1862, and the edition influenced later translations of the Bible into Norwegian. Only two manuscripts of the text are known today, neither in Old Norse, but rather having been themselves translated into the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Rian, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Danish editions 1524-1873 ==
[[File:Lotterbibel.jpg|thumb|The New Testament of 1524.]]
In 1524, the exiled King [[Christian II]] of [[Denmark-Norway]] ordered the publication of the first Danish-language translation of the New Testament. It was given a full title which can be translated as "This is the New Testament in Danish directly from the Latin version," and is often referred to today as ''the New Testament of King Christian II.'' The inspiration to publish this translation came from the king's visit to [[Wittenberg]], Germany, a focal point of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The translation work was done by Christiern Winter, Hans Mikkelsen, and Henrik Smith, while [[Melchior Lotter]] financed the printing. The translation was based on [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]'s Latin Bible translation of 1516 for the [[Gospels]] and [[Acts of the Apostles]], and on Martin Luther's German New Testament for the rest.

After publication, the book was subject to harsh criticism.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} Its Danish was not very fluent, and there was an attack in the preface on King [[Frederick I of Denmark and Norway|Frederick I]] (who had previously deposed King Christian II). There was also a petition against the [[Catholic Church]] in Denmark, which led to the eventual banning of this translation in Denmark. Only about 40 copies are known to exist today.

''[[Christiern Pedersen]]'s New Testament'' was a complete translation into Danish, published in [[Antwerp]] in 1529. Pedersen used the [[Vulgate]] as a starting point, but was also inspired by [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s [[German language|German]] translation of the New Testament. Pedersen was a [[counter-reformation|reformist Catholic]] who considered it important for the translation to be in the [[vernacular]]; the language used was quite free and accessible, close to everyday vernacular. A revised edition was published in 1531.

=== Christian III's Bible and versions based on this ===
[[File:BiblenCh ubt.jpeg| thumb | Christian III's Bible posted at [[Acts]] Chapter 2 and 3]]
''Christian III's Bible'' was the first full Danish-language Bible translation, published in 1550. It was commissioned by King [[Christian III of Denmark and Norway|Christian III]]. A commission of [[theology|theologians]] compiled this first 1550 edition, largely based on Luther's complete [[German-language]] translation of the Bible published five years earlier in 1545. It was also influenced by: Luther's [[Low German]] translation of 1534; the Swedish Bible translation named after [[Gustav Vasa]]; Pedersen's translations of the New Testament (1529), [[Psalms]] (1531) and [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1535); and on two complete, unpublished translations of the Bible, one by Pedersen, and one by [[Hans Tausen]] from 1543. A combined emphasis on fluency of the language employed and a translation close to the original texts yielded a result which is considered very good.&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Rian p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible was illustrated, and also contained some cross-references. The price of the book was 5 [[Norwegian rigsdaler|daler]], equivalent in price to a good bull or thirty barrels of [[rye]]. About 3000 copies were printed, of which 96 came to Norway{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}. The language used in this translation exhibited [[German language|German]] influence, but because this book significantly improved access to the Biblical literature for everyday Danes and Norwegians, editions based on this became the dominant Bibles in Denmark and Norway for much of the Reformation era, earning the edition the common name, "The Reformation Bible."

A new edition of the New Testament was published in 1558. This was largely a reprinting of the 1550 edition, but also included Martin Luther's preface to the different texts and expanded the notes.

''The Bible of Frederick II'' was published by King [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] in 1589. It was a slightly revised version of the 1550 edition, which contained the revised New Testament translation that was released in 1558, and added Luther's prefaces to the Old Testament, just as they had been added to the New Testament. Luther's chapter summaries and a small Bible dictionary were also included. This edition showed less German language influence than its predecessor, and contained many corrections of translation and typography.

''Christian IV's Bible'', related to King [[Christian IV]], was published in 1633. It was a revision of the 1589 translation featuring simpler language, done by Hans Poulsen Resen. (See below)

''Frederik III's House and Travel-Bible'' was published in 1670 in a smaller, more convenient format than previous editions. It was based primarily on Luther's 1545 translation, as well as on the Danish translations from 1589 and 1633. The translation was popular, and appeared in several editions, the last in 1802.

=== Resen's Bible and versions based on this ===
[[File:Hans Poulsen Resen.jpg|thumb|Hans Poulsen Resen]]
[[File:Resen svaning 1647 3.jpg|thumb|Resen-Svaningske Bible from 1647]]
A new family of translations, which came to assume a very important position in the Danish-Norwegian biblical tradition, is named after professor of theology [[Hans Poulsen Resen]]. Initially, he only meant to revise the translation from 1589, but he eventually went on to translate the Bible wholesale from the original texts. His first translation was published in 1607 and was very accurate, but it was written in an unnatural and difficult language, as he followed the original texts with painstaking accuracy (for example, Resen put Danish words needed for comprehension in parentheses if they were not present in the original text.) This edition was the first Danish-Norwegian translation to include the traditional subdivision into verses. It also contained a lot of explanations of words and interpretations in the margins; altogether, this led to a messy typography.

Resen was mostly interested in the basic text, and the language of the translation has been referred to as "Hebrew-Danish" or "Greek-Danish".&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Rian, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The translation received praise in its day for its accuracy, but has been criticized in retrospect for its lack of Danish fluency. Danish translator Tomas Skat Rørdam said of Resen "of all Denmark's renowned men, there has never been anyone who has written such a barbarically ''struggled Danish'' as he [did]"&lt;ref&gt;quote reproduced in Dagfinn Rian p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Svane 2.jpg|thumb|left | Hans Svane]]
''[[The Resen-Svaningske Bible]]'' was published in 1647 and is a revision of Resen's Bible from 1607. The revision was made by [[Hans Swan]], and has been named after both translators. This translation became the official Church Bible of the Danish-Norwegian church.

''The Resen-Svaningske Bible in the revised edition'' was published in 1740. This version was used as the basis for later printings, and was the dominant translation in Norway until the purely Norwegian translations were made. The Norwegian Bible Society published revised versions of it in 1820 and 1830 and one version of it was edited and published by [[Olaus Nielsen]] in 1853.

=== Norwegian Bible Society Bibles in Danish ===
The [[Norwegian Bible Society]] was founded in 1816 and saw as its main task the publication of Bibles for the Norwegian market, focusing primarily on revisions of the Danish versions already in existence. In 1820 it released its first volume, a revised edition of the New Testament. This became known as "the revision of 1819," and it was noteworthy for marking in brackets all of the text that was probably not derived from original sources. It also diverges from the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' on some points, a choice that was rare at the time. This tradition was continued in an edition published in 1830, where even greater parts of the text were enclosed in brackets, but eventually fell out of favor; in the New Testament edition published in 1848, all traces of textual criticism were removed.

The [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], which at that time also had operations in Norway, published two Bible versions for Norwegian distribution in 1829 and 1834. These differed from the other contemporary Danish and Norwegian Bibles in omitting the Apocrypha. For a long time the British and Foreign Bible Society sold more Bibles in Norway than the Norwegian Bible Society.

''The Norwegian Bible of the Norwegian Bible Society'' was published in 1854, and was the first version of the Bible to be produced in Norway. The New Testament was based on a version of "the Resen-Svaningske", published in 1830, while the Old Testament is based on a Danish version of the "Resen-Svaningske" from 1740. The British and Foreign Bible Society had published an edition similar to the Norwegian Bible Society one. Despite its name, it was in the Danish language, and was very popular in Denmark until a new Danish revision was made in 1871.

''The revision of Skaar'' was a New Testament version published in 1873. The work was revised by the priest [[John Nilssøn Skaar]]. This version is known for a strongly Norwegianized language, taking it in a more idiomatic direction and focusing on the importance of the meaning of the original rather than the words themselves.

=== Other versions ===
''The Picture-Bible of the Norwegian People, Containing the Canonical Books of the Holy Scripture '' was published privately in [[Oslo|Christiania]] in 1840. This Bible was illustrated with 100 photographs, and was mainly based on the Reformation Bible (Christian III's Bible).

== Norwegian editions 1873-2011 ==
The first part of the Bible to be published in Norwegian was [[deuterocanonical books|Apocrypha]]. These books "fell out" of [[Biblical canon|canon]] during the [[Reformation]], but are still held high by most Protestant churches. (In the [[Catholic Church]] the books are considered fully [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]].) The Norwegian language translation of the Apocrypha appeared in 1873, and was a test translation, a revision of a translation from the 1850s that was never published. A new revision was released by the Society in 1887. In 1891 a translation was published of the Old Testament with the Apocrypha, the first official Norwegian-language version of these books from the Bible Society. A revision was then published in 1940, before the next translation was in 1988. In 1994 the Bible Society published a new edition with both the apocryphal and the canonical writings in Norwegian.

=== Landsmål/Nynorsk ===
[[File:Elias Blix.jpg|thumb|Elias Blix - a pioneer in the Bible work in New Norwegian (Nynorsk).]]
The first Norwegian biblical text in [[Nynorsk]] was [[Ivar Aasen]]'s translation of the story of the prodigal son, in 1859. By the 1880s, a group of translators had started work on ''The New Testament in the National Idiom''. These first translators were not associated with the linguistically conservative Bible Society, but rather with publishing house [[Det Norske Samlaget|the Norwegian Samlaget]], which published the first editions of the Bible in a Norwegian written language. Their work was aided by state funding. Beyond the 1880s, they released several books of writings from the New Testament. The first of these was the book of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], published in 1882. By 1889 the whole New Testament had been made ready for release. Everything was translated from [[Greek language|Greek]], and it was titled ''The New Testament. Translated from the Greek text in Norwegian vernacular and Published by the Prime Cost of the Norwegian Samlaget''. This was the first Norwegian translation of the New Testament in any form of Norwegian, and it did not come out before in 1904. Pioneers in this work were minister and professor [[Elias Blix]], text scientist [[John Belsheim]] and school man [[Matias Skard]]. In addition, [[Ivar Aasen]], [[Frederick William Bugge|FWK Bugge]] and [[C.R. Unger]] formed an advisory committee that aided the project. The translation was based on the [[Textus Receptus]]. The language of the translation was characterized by the Danish syntax, with Norwegianization increasingly applied to words rather than sentence structure. The language was also influenced by Old Norse and the Old Norse [[Stjórn]] Bible.

The Landsmål/Nynorsk dialect of Norwegian became legally equivalent to [[Riksmål]] in 1892. The Bible Society published its own audit of the New Testament in the 1899, mainly audited by Elias Blix. He then went on to work on translating the Psalms into Nynorsk, which he did until he died in 1902. The work was then taken over by [[Peter Hognestad]]. Hognestad translated also [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] in its entirety to the Norwegian, in addition to many smaller pieces of text.

In 1904, an edition of Psalms was published, titled ''Psalms. Translated from Hebrew''. Psalms 1-51 was translated by Blix and psalms 52-150 by Hognestad. The following year there was an edition that contained both the Psalms and the New Testament, before ''the Illustrated New Testament'' was published in 1908.

[[Alexander Seippel]], who had initiated work on the first complete translation of the Bible into Norwegian, began to translate the Old Testament. Seippel used a vibrant and popular language, and said that the language would be "above all down-to-earth... I would never write a sentence unless I knew that a Norwegian farmer could say it." (Rough translation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibel.no/Hovedmeny/Bibel2011/Artikler/ForedragFadervar.aspx?p=1|title=&amp; Lecture on Lord's Prayer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Seippel's work progressed, the biblical books were published in booklet form, first by the Samlaget, then from 1915 onward by Bible Society. The Pentateuch was published from 1905 to 1912, followed by the other biblical books. Seippel has a reputation as a very good translator; Aage Holter says that "Alexander Seippel took Norwegian Bible translation to the greatest heights ever achieved"&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Rian, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Fyre Car Bible]]'', as the first complete Bible translation in Nynorsk was often called, was published in 1921. It was published by Student Language Associations (Studentmållaget), clubs that promote the use of Nynorsk. Several translators contributed, with Seippel and Hognestad doing most of the translation work, and [[Gustav Indrebø]] responsible for legal writing.

Seippel continued efforts to translate Biblical writings into Norwegian. This was necessary, as several writings in the Bible of 1921 were not translated from original sources, but from the other Nordic languages. More individual books of the Bible were published using Seippel's translations, and these were in turn used during the work on the 1978 translation.

The ''Indrebø translation'' was published in 1938, the first full Norwegian-Language Bible published by the Norwegian Bible Society. The translation is often abbreviated ''NO38''. It was largely a revision of the 1921 Fyre Car Bible, but with much of Seippel's idiomatic language toned down in order to harmonize better with the Bible Society's own Norwegian translation published in 1930. The translation has been nicknamed "[[Indrebø Bible]]" or "Indrebø translation" because of two brothers who both played a central role in the work, [[Ragnvald Indrebø]], who later became a [[Bishop]] in [[Bjorgvin Diocese]], and Gustav Indrebø, a [[Professor]] of Norwegian.

===Bokmål===
[[File:Bibel001.jpg|thumb|Title Speaking Bible Society edition of 1891.]]
In 1891 the first full translation of the Old Testament to Bokmål was made directly from the basic languages. This included translation of the Apocrypha, which once published with the Old Testament formed the Bible Society's first official version of these texts. The work of translation was done by [[Wilhelm Andreas Wexels]] and [[Jens Matthias Pram Kaurin]]. Wexels had previously been behind a British-organized revision published in 1834. These two translators initially estimated that the work would take five years; the project ended up lasting for around fifty. They delivered a draft of the individual books to an audit committee, which then in turn considered the translation. The committee consisted mostly of teachers from the Faculty of Theology, led by [[Carl Paul Caspari]]. He contributed to the chapter summaries before each chapter. As the different parts were approved, they came out in the booklets. In 1869 the Old Testament was published as a sample translation. The final version came in 1891, with "the issue" in 1888.

The translation was met with skepticism, both from those who felt that it was bad language in the translation, such as Bishop [[Anton Christian Bang]], and from the Faculty of Theology, which were critical of the choice of base texts for the translation.

A second translation of The New Testament was worked on in parallel with this work. This was already in 1870 given to a professor of New Testament studies, [[Jacob Frederick Dietrichson]], who died in 1879. He submitted a proposal, and his successor, [[Frederick William Bugge]], was in 1886 given the task of completing this translation. Bugge, a champion of the Norwegian language, had to both look over the work of Dietrichson and translate the rest. While Dietrichson had kept strictly to the Textus Receptus, Bugge selected older and better text testifying to his skill as a translator. When Bugge was made bishop of [[Diocese of Oslo|Oslo]] in 1893, his translation work was then handed over to [[Sigurd Odland]], who like Dietrichson remained closer to the Textus Receptus. The last ten years of work was carried out by an audit committee consisting of the theological professors Anton Christian Bang, Sigurd Odland, and Elias Blix, as well as linguist [[Johan Storm]].

Thus 1904 saw the publishing of the first official New Testament to have been translated into Bokmål from the basic text. The translation is close to Textus Receptus and there are attempts to render a word in the basic text with the same Norwegian word every time it occurs. In spite of this somewhat strange translation principle, the translation comes across as relatively fluent in the Norwegian language.

The Bible Society's 1930-translation (NO30) was a copy of the full Bible, revising the New Testament translation from 1904 and revising even more strongly the Old Testament translation from 1891. In this edition, the language was further Norwegianized, giving the two Testaments a more unified Norwegian expression. The audit process was led by Bang and Odland, with help from [[Alexander Seippel]], who had worked hard to translate the Bible into Norwegian. The translation follows the orthographic norms of 1917, and stood as the common standard for over 40 years. Despite this opinion by 1939 [[Eivind Berggrav]], bishop of the [[Diocese of Oslo]], felt that the language was not good enough and that it should work with a new translation.
[[File:Bibel002.jpg| thumb | A page from the Bible Society edition of 1891. The picture shows the start of [[Jeremiah]], with chapter summaries.]]

There have also been translations of the Bible in Bokmål published by people other than the Bible Society. The motivation for, and the results of, these versions have varied; several important ones include:

The "GTMMM", or S. Michl, [[Sigmund Mowinckel]] and N. Messel scholarly edition of the Old Testament in five volumes came out from 1929 to 1963. The name "GTMMM" was given by its authors. This is a scholarly edition with text-critical notes and comments, often with textual criticisms not found in the "people issues". This edition follows an idiomatic translation principle, and was important in the work of the 1978 translation.

[[John Brown Sounds]], Professor of New Testament studies, published ''The New Testament in a new translation''. The text has never been used by many, including during the work on the 1978 translation.

From the Catholic communities in Norway, there have been three translations of the New Testament in Norwegian. In 1902 the New Testament was translated from the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] by the priest and later bishop [[Olaf Offer Dahl]]. This translation was then revised and came in a new edition of 1938. The full name of this translation was ''The New Testament canonical books sold after the Vulgate and provided with explanation''. This translation included explanations of the ways its Vulgate-based text differed from other Greek-based New Testament texts.

''Gunnes' New Tesatment'' was in 1968 published by the priest [[Erik Gunnes]]. Gunnes had translated the entire New Testament itself, and the translation was approved for use in the Catholic Church. The translation came out in paperback edition in 1969. Gunnes was more academic and conservative in wording than youth translation that had come out earlier. Gunnes' translation was "carefully studied the work of GB 1978-1985"&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Rian, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''Acta-translation'' of the New Tesatment was published in 1973, with the goal of publish the New Testament in modern Norwegian. The movement in support of this translation included people with links to [[Lunde publishing]] and to [[Gideon]]'s efforts to distribute Bibles in hotels. Individuals who supported this translation often later supported the ''Norwegian Bible'' translation.

[[File:Nvbibel.jpg|thumb|New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.]]
The ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures'' is the Norwegian-language translation used by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]'. The whole Bible was published in Norwegian in 1996, after an edition of the New Testament was published in 1992. The translation into English was made from the original languages by anonymous translators. Translations into other languages are based largely on the English-language version. One way in which the translation differs from other translations is that God's name is rendered ''Jehovah'' in both the Old and New Testaments.

''The Bible, God's Word'', also known as the "Norwegian [[King James Version|King James]]" was published by Bible Publishing House in 1997. The same publishing company had previously released a translation of the New Testament in 1995, a translation that was included in this release. This translation is different from other Norwegian translation by adding the so-called Textus Receptus as a basis for the translation.

[[Jacob Jervell]] published a translation of the four [[Gospels]] in the series World Scriptures in 2002, on behalf of [[The Norwegian book clubs]]. This edition has been known for the debate that arose around Jervell's use of the word [[Gehenna]] instead of [[Hell]].

In 2003, [http://www.bpsmilford.org/ Bearing Precious Seed] of Milford, Ohio published a Norwegian Bible translated by Morten Gjemlestad directly from the English text of the Authorized (King James) Version. 10,000 copies were printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://holybiblefoundation.org/bibles2/|title=Holy Bible Foundation {{!}} Bibles|website=holybiblefoundation.org|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bibelroy.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/vare-norske-bibler-testet/|title=Våre norske Bibler testet|date=2013-01-13|website=Mine bibelstudier|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Both forms of Norwegian===
The ''Youth translation of the New Testament'' was founded by [[Eivind Berggrav]], who was the bishop of Oslo in 1937, which at the time made him also the chairman of the Bible Society. He believed that the language in translations from the 1930 and '38 were out of touch with the language of Norway's youth, so he initiated a project to create a youth translation. Berggrav suggested that efforts should be made in two stages, first a rapid linguistic revision of the previous translation, and then a new, complete translation from the original languages. [[World War II|War]] delayed the start of this work, but by 1949 the project was well underway. A trial version of the [[Gospel of Mark]] was published in 1951. The youth version of the entire New Testament in Bokmål was published in 1959, the same year Berggrav died, and the version in Nynorsk was published in 1961. Both translations received much praise for good language, and this work, much of the backdrop for the translation, published in 1978. The language's syntax had been deliberately made more Norwegian, contrasting the new youth edition with the Danish language Bibles that had set the tone before this point. More guidance from the Norwegian language was used in this translation than in previous translations.

This translation appeared in 1975 as an illustrated edition under the name ''Good News. The New Testament for people today.'' This edition placed an emphasis on readability, and printed, among other things, with larger letters than previous editions. The illustrations of [[Annie Vallotton]] were used in several similar Bible editions in several languages. This was a popular translation used in schools, and came out in several editions. It was reprinted in 2005 using the 2005 translation of the New Testament.

[[File:Norwegian Bible.jpg|thumb|Detail from the cover of an edition of the 1978 translation]]
[[NO78|''Bible Society 1978 translation'' (''NO78'')]] was rooted primarily in the need for youth translation. This translation was a complete revision of previous translations, and was the second part of Berggravs plan. The Bible Society decided to start work in 1954, and by 1956 had formulated the basic principles of the new Bible translation. The next translation was meant to be written in a vibrant and modern language. The translation should this time be [[idiom]]atic, putting a greater emphasis on preserving the meaning of the basic text, instead of merely translating word-for-word. After various parts of the Bible were translated, test versions were published. ''Selections from the Old Testament'' (1966) was published in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, [[Psalms]] was published in Bokmål 1967, and ''Thus saith the Lord. The twelve prophets'' (1973) was published in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. These issues were with introduction and notes in the text. Several trial versions of the New Testament were also published before the entire New Testament was published officially in both Bokmål and Nynorsk in 1975, and the whole Bible likewise in 1978. Before the final release in 1978, there were consultations among ministers, theologians and linguists, and some changes were made to test editions. The final approval was made by the Bible Society's central board, which consisted of, among others, all the bishops in The [[Norwegian Church]] and representatives of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Norway]].

The translation was very well received; Swedish bishop [[Bo Giertz]] asserted that it was the best Bible translation.&lt;ref&gt;''The big family bible'', p. XVII&lt;/ref&gt; This edition had a great influence on Bible translation in the other Nordic countries, and was important when [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] got new Bible translations, in 2000 and 1992 respectively. The 1978 translation was also one of the first in the world to use gender-inclusive language in places, for example, where the original text had used masculine language like "brother" despite referring to both sexes that translation used "brothers and sisters."

In 1985, there was another revised edition of this translation that is referred to as 1978/85-utgaven.

The newest translation, ''Bible 2011'', called ''Bibelen 2011 bokmål'' in Norway, was released on 19 October 2011. The first part of this translation, ''NT05'', was published in 2005 when the Bible Society released its new translation of the New Testament. This translation uses a more [[literary]] language rather than focusing on translating each word. Also, it uses more common terms, such as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] was called a "[[virgin]]" in the 1978 version, but in the newest translation she is referred to instead as a "young" woman. The version was the 2012 top selling book in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bible-becomes-unlikely-top-seller-in-secular-norway/|title=Bible becomes unlikely top-seller in secular Norway|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyer was the fifth son of Chinnaiyar and Chinnammal, born in the agricultural village of Punnalaikkadduvan, 12 kilometres north of [[Jaffna]] city. His family consisted of learned and teachers. Iyer had his primary education (up to 8th standard) in a [[Saiva]] school started by  Kathirgama iyer in the courtyard of Siththi Vinayagar Temple and was a Teacher at the same school later on.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

This school was taken over by the Govt. and is in the opposite side of Aayakkadavai Sithivinayagar Temple. He ranked first in Tamil grammar, literature, history, religion and mathematics. The private tuition he received at home from his uncle, Kathirgama Iyer, enabled him to achieve the first rank in school. After the death of Ponnambala Pillai, Ganesha Iyer was a student under [[Chunnakam]] [[Kumaraswamy Pulavar]] for some time. He learned Tamil Grammar and [[Sanskrit]] from the Pulavar. Ganesha Iyer grew up a scholar by referring his doubts to Kumarasamy Pulavar and getting clarifications from him.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Family life==
Iyer married Annalakshmi – the only daughter of his maternal uncle. Annalakshmi had good knowledge in Sanskrit and Tamil. The couple did not have any children. After the death of his wife, Ganesha Iyer bought a land and dug a [[Water well|well]] in memoriam to his wife, which he named "Annalakshmi Koopam" and donated it to the ''Maruthady Vinayagar'' temple at [[Varuthalaivilan]]. 

==Grammatical and literary activities==
Iyer had a matured proficiency in grammar. He wrote explanatory notes to the ancient Tamil literature called [[Tolkāppiyam]] that is considered as the maxim for Tamil grammar. This work took him to the crest of popularity. For several years he went in search of the [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s of Tholkapiyam, collected them and took notes from them. Whenever he found any error, he corrected them, published the corrections in newspapers and got the approval of other scholars. After finalising everything he published a book, edited and published by Eezhakesari Naa of Ponniah. The following books were published ''Ezhuththathikaram'' (1937), ''Sollathikaram'' (1938), ''Porulathikaram'', 1st and 2nd parts (1943/1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqYMTdBws40C&amp;pg=PA755&amp;lpg=PA755&amp;dq=kanesaiyar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zw0K9-ZZnF&amp;sig=JBYKtQI7cfoV8XqYW7lt4klIEnk&amp;hl=ta&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2MJXUv2aDsO4rgfL6YC4Cg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kanesaiyar&amp;f=false |title=Current Trends in Linguistics: Index |author=Thomas Albert Sebeok |page=755 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erode.tnopac.gov.in/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl?q=au |title=Erode District Central Library Catalog › Results of Search for 'kw,wrdl: au' |website=Erode.tnopac.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Teacher==
He served as a teacher in several schools in Jaffna. He was a certified teacher to teach in government schools. He was the Principal of Praseena Paatasala at Chunnakam established by Muhandiram [[T. Sathasiva Iyer]] from the year 1921 till 1932. During this period he created a lineage of eminent [[Pandit]]hars in Eelam. After leaving this school, he held private classes in [[Varuthalaivilan]]. He taught grammar to teachers and others who came from various parts of the [[Jaffna Peninsula]]. Every evening he conducted a class under the [[banyan]] tree in the vicinity of Maruthady Vinayagar temple at [[Varuthalaivilan]].

==Final years==
Iyer spent the last ten years of his life at [[Varuthalaivilan]]. He died on 3 November 1958.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

{{Linguistics}}

'''Case grammar''' is a system of [[linguistic analysis]], focusing on the link between the [[Valency (linguistics)|valence]], or number of subjects, objects, etc., of a [[verb]] and the grammatical context it requires. The system was created by the American linguist [[Charles J. Fillmore]] in (1968), in the context of [[Transformational Grammar]]. This theory analyzes the surface syntactic structure of sentences by studying the combination of [[deep case]]s (i.e. semantic roles) -- Agent, Object, Benefactor, Location or Instrument—which are required by a specific [[verb]].  For instance, the verb "give" in English requires an Agent (A) and Object (O), and a Beneficiary (B); e.g. "Jones (A) gave money (O) to the school (B).

According to Fillmore, each verb selects a certain number of deep cases which form its '''case frame'''. Thus, a case frame describes important aspects of semantic [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], of verbs, adjectives and nouns. Case frames are subject to certain constraints, such as that a deep case can occur only once per sentence. Some of the cases are obligatory and others are optional. Obligatory cases may not be deleted, at the risk of producing ungrammatical sentences. For example, ''Mary gave the apples'' is ungrammatical in this sense.

A fundamental hypothesis of case grammar is that [[grammatical function]]s, such as [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] or [[Object (grammar)|object]], are determined by the deep, semantic valence of the verb, which finds its syntactic correlate in such grammatical categories as Subject and Object, and in grammatical cases such as Nominative, Accusative, etc. Fillmore (1968) puts forwards the following hierarchy for a universal subject selection rule:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Agent &lt; Instrumental &lt; Objective&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That means that if the case frame of a verb contains an agent, this one is realized as the subject of an active sentence; otherwise, the deep case following the agent in the hierarchy (i.e. Instrumental) is promoted to subject.

The influence of case grammar on contemporary linguistics has been significant, to the extent that numerous linguistic theories incorporate deep roles in one or other form, such as the so-called [[Thematic structure]] in [[Government and Binding|Government and Binding theory]]. It has also inspired the development of [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|frame]]-based [[knowledge representation|representations]] in [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rpoku.sourceforge.net |title=Rpoku, HSPL human speakable programming language }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and the 1980s, Charles Fillmore developed his original theory onto what was called [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|Frame Semantics]].  Walter A. Cook, SJ, a linguistics professor at [[Georgetown University]], was one of the foremost case grammar theoreticians following Fillmore's original work.  Cook devoted most of his scholarly research from the early 1970s until the 1990s to further developing case grammar as a tool for linguistic analysis, language teaching methodology, and other applications, and was the author of several major texts and many articles in case grammar.  Cook directed several doctoral dissertations (see e.g., Moskey 1978) applying case grammar to various areas of theoretical and applied linguistics research.

In [[broadcast programming]], '''counterprogramming''' is the practice of offering [[television program]]s to attract an [[audience]] from another [[television station]] airing a major event. It is also referred when programmers offer something different from the rival’s program as an alternative, to increase the audience size.&lt;ref name=Uribe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uribe|first=Rodrigo|author2=Buzeta, Cristian |author3=Hurtado, Daniel |title=Looking for the audiences: The effect of using partial counterprogramming and a friendlier style of news presentation|journal=Innovar|date=2011|volume=21|issue=42|pages=151–159|url=http://www.revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/innovar/article/viewFile/35463/35846|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
The main events counterprogrammed in the United States are the [[Super Bowl]], the [[Academy Award|Oscars]], and the [[Olympic Games]].

===Super Bowl===
{{main|Super Bowl counterprogramming}}
The [[Super Bowl]], being among the most watched [[sports television]] events in the United States, became a notable target of counterprogramming during the 1990s due to its [[List of Super Bowl halftime shows|previous halftime shows]]; which critics felt were dated and not representative of modern [[popular culture|pop culture]].&lt;ref name=espn-uwp&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Doug|title=When Up With People dominated halftime|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/17649/when-up-with-people-dominated-halftime|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Super Bowl XXVI]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] aired a live, football-themed episode of ''[[In Living Color]]'' against halftime; the special drew 22 million viewers; [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] estimated that CBS lost 10 ratings points during halftime as a result of the special.&lt;ref name=trib-goalofspectacle&gt;{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the special alarmed the [[National Football League]], who took steps to increase interest and viewership of the halftime show by inviting major [[pop music]]ians to perform, beginning with [[Michael Jackson]] at [[Super Bowl XXVII]]. This pattern continued until 2005, when an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]'s halftime show where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[breast]]s, led to a string of halftime shows with a single, headlining [[classic rock]] act (such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]) in an effort to prevent a repeat of the "wardrobe malfunction" (since [[Super Bowl XLV]], the NFL has returned to inviting pop artists to play halftime).&lt;ref name=trib-goalofspectacle/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-jacksonredefine&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=How Jackson Redefined the Super Bowl|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/sports/football/30sandomir.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=1 February 2013|date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Michael Jackson's performance helping to increase interest in subsequent halftime shows, Fox's success inspired imitators, and influenced other specials such as [[Animal Planet]]'s annual ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'' (featuring dogs playing in a model football stadium), and the ''[[Legends Cup (LFL)|Lingerie Bowl]]'', a series of [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts of all-female football games played in [[lingerie]]{{emdash}}proving popular enough to be spun off into its own [[Legends Football League|Lingerie Football League]].&lt;ref name="namechange"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-lingerie-football-league-20130111,0,2469689.story|title=Lingerie Football League changes name; players to wear uniforms|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=11 January 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Houston|last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under an unsaid [[gentlemen's agreement]], all four major networks (including CBS, Fox, and NBC, who also alternate airing the Super Bowl on a yearly cycle; [[ESPN]] is under the same ownership as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) will typically not schedule any new programming (nor air counterprogramming) on the night of the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=trib-goalofspectacle/&gt; Fox provided an exception in 2010 when it aired two new episodes of ''[['Til Death]]'' against [[Super Bowl XLIV]]; however, the network had been in the process of [[burning off]] the low-rated sitcom in unusual timeslots so [[Sony Pictures Television|its distributor]] would have [[100 episodes|enough episodes]] to [[Television syndication|syndicate]] it.&lt;ref name=variety-killtildeath&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox finally finds a way to kill "‘Til Death"|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/fox-finally-finds-a-way-to-kill-til-death-16613/|work=Variety|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zap2it-tildeathratings&gt;{{cite web|title=TV ratings: Super Bowl on pace for a record audience|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/02/tv-ratings-super-bowl-on-pace-for-a-record-audience.html|work=Zap2It|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NFL Network]] also suspends programming in favor of ''Super Bowl Game Center'', a static screen with the game's radio broadcast and a live scoreboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/2/4/16971130/nfl-network-super-bowl-eagles-patriots-audio|title=NFL Network is just airing audio of the game with a scoreboard of the Super Bowl|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academy Awards===

In 2007, the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]]' [[Auto Club 500]] at [[Auto Club Speedway]] in [[Fontana, California]] was held on the same day as the Academy Awards, although it was held during the early afternoon with a 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. PT (4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET) start.&lt;ref name=espn-starspayattention&gt;{{cite web|title=Stars won't pay attention to race during Oscars|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?seriesId=2&amp;columnist=blount_terry&amp;id=2777144|work=ESPN|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2008 Auto Club 500]] was plagued by rain delays and unintentionally aired against a portion of the ceremony; its start time was pushed back to around 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. PT (6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET), while the race itself was halted again at around 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. PT (9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET). In 2009, the race was intentionally scheduled with a 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. PT start, which would overlap into the telecast of the [[81st Academy Awards]]. [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' senior vice president of programming and research Bill Wanger supported the idea, believing that NASCAR races "[could] hold their own against any competition", as the two events had contrasting demographics of mostly male and mostly female viewers.&lt;ref name=yahoo-outofchances&gt;{{cite web|title=Running out of chances in California|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/running-chances-california-120600504--nascar.html|work=Yahoo!

For a number of years, the championship game of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA men's basketball tournament]] aired on the day of the Academy Awards ceremony, leading into the primetime.  The 1976 NCAA Final Four, broadcast on [[NBC]], ended with the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] defeating the [[Michigan Wolverines]], 86-68; the game ended just as the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing Oscar]] was about to the announced.  That year's Academy Awards ceremony acknowledged its competition when the final score of the game was announced before [[Verna Fields]] was announced as the winner of the award.  By the time [[CBS]] had taken over broadcasting the NCAA Final Four, the Academy Awards ceremony had by now taken place the week before the Final Four, and has since moved well away into mid or late February due to ABC's want to have the awards take place during the February [[sweeps]] period, along with the general consolidation of the film awards season into a shorter period.

The [[2012 NBA All-Star Game]] was played opposite the [[84th Academy Awards]]. The presentation drew an estimated 39.3 million viewers, a 4% increase over the [[83rd Academy Awards|previous year]]. Conversely, viewership for the All Star Game on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] measured at 7.1 million, a 22% decline from [[2011 NBA All-Star Game|last year's]] 9.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2012/02/28/Media/NBA-ASG.aspx NBA All-Star Game's 7.1 Million Viewers Down 22% From Telecast In '11]
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
NBC, the long-time broadcaster of the [[Macy's]] [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] [[fireworks]] in [[New York City]], has historically aired an encore presentation of the special at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/PT, immediately following its live broadcast. The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]]'s own concert and fireworks special on CBS aired live at the same time as the NBC encore. While NBC claimed that this was for budgetary reasons, Boston Pops executive producer [[David G. Mugar]] believed that NBC had done so to intentionally pull viewers away from the Boston Pops. After ratings fell by 1 million viewers for 2012, CBS ended its national broadcasts of the event in 2013; the concert was still aired in full, as before, by its Boston station [[WBZ-TV]].&lt;ref name=bg-popsnonational&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Martine|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Eric|title=July 4 fireworks gala loses its national pop|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/15/national-spot-for-boston-pops-fireworks-show-not-airing-nationally-this-year/IVDJVRnru6Acdd5Hxl8gUP/story.html|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national broadcast was revived on CBS for 2016, with the nationally televised portion of the broadcast expanded to two hours,&lt;ref name="bh-cbsfireworks16"&gt;{{cite web|title=With CBS on board again, Keith Lockhart is ready to take over prime time|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/2016/07/with_cbs_on_board_again_keith_lockhart_is_ready_to_take_over_prime_time|website=Boston Herald|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to [[Bloomberg Television]] in 2017 due to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'s new sponsorship of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2017/03/vance_bloomberg_new_forces_for_fourth_of_july_concert|title=Vance, Bloomberg new forces for Fourth of July concert|website=Boston Herald|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/culture/events/2017/07/03/how-to-watch-stream-or-listen-to-the-2017-boston-pops-fireworks-spectacular|title=How to watch, stream, or listen to the 2017 Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular|date=2017-07-03|work=Boston.com|access-date=2017-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration as president of the United States]], [[Comedy Central]] broadcast an all-day marathon of the [[South Park (season 20)|20th season]] of ''[[South Park]]'', which featured an ongoing storyline where [[Mr. Garrison]] is elected president in a parody of Trump and his campaign.&lt;ref name="vf-cctrolling"&gt;{{cite web|title=How TV Networks Are Accidentally—and Purposefully—Trolling Trump on Inauguration Day|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/donald-trump-inauguration-day-what-to-watch|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], which were broadcast by NBC, other networks generally placed their main lineups of scripted programming on hiatus, although ABC still aired ''[[The Bachelor (U.S. TV series)|The Bachelor]]'' and ''[[Shark Tank]]'', CBS still aired ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', and [[The CW]] still scheduled new episodes of selected scripted series. ABC and CBS also scheduled spin-offs of [[reality competition]] franchises to specifically compete against the Olympics, including ''[[The Bachelor Winter Games]]'' (which featured alumni of ''The Bachelor'' participating in winter sports events), and ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' (which also aired its season finale against the [[2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/how-broadcasters-are-counterprogramming-against-18-days-of-winter-olympics-coverage/|title=How Broadcasters Are Counterprogramming Against 18 Days of Winter Olympics Coverage|work=Adweek|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Independent Television Commission]] can punish broadcasters who deliberately counterprogram another broadcaster for the intent of damaging the other broadcaster's ratings. In 2000, the coincidental scheduling of the [[Judith Keppel|first million-pound winner]] on ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' opposite the [[series finale|final episode]] of ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' drew accusations of counterprogramming; the ITC, after investigating the matter, exonerated ''Millionaire'' and its broadcaster of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Millionaire? cleared of ratings 'fix' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1118212.stm | date=15 January 2001 |accessdate=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College football ==
The move is harder in the sport, especially with ESPN games competing against CBS games.  Because of a CBS contract with the [[Southeastern Conference]] that gives the conference exclusivity [[SEC on CBS|at the 3:30 p.m. ET slot]], and ESPN's games being regional (parts of the country may receive games from different conferences), and even a Fox game with one of their three conferences, college football schedules are intentionally made flexible in order to allow networks to choose the best game when possible. The SEC opened their exclusivity up slightly in the 2014 for ESPN with the launch of their [[SEC Network]] with the conference, which now allows that ESPN to air up to two SEC games (one on the main SEC Network feed, with a lower-tier matchup carried by the SEC Network's alternate feed), though CBS retains first choice for their preferred game.

'''Dumi''' is a [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] language spoken in the area around the Tap and Rava rivers and their confluence in northern [[Khotang district]], [[Nepal]]. It is spoken in the villages such as [[Magpa|Makpa]], Kharbari, [[Baksila]], [[Sapteswor|Sapteshwor]], and [[Kharmi]] (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

Dialects are Kharbari, Lamdija, and Makpa, with Makpa being the most divergent dialect (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

It is one of the rarest and least spoken languages in the world, with only 8 counted speakers of it in a 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-rarest-languages.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6420">In [[geometric measure theory]], '''Falconer's conjecture''', named after [[Kenneth Falconer (mathematician)|Kenneth Falconer]], is an unsolved problem concerning the sets of [[Euclidean distance]]s between points in compact ''d''-dimensional spaces. Intuitively, it states that a set of points that is large in its [[Hausdorff dimension]] must determine a [[distance set|set of distances]] that is large in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]. More precisely, if ''S'' is a compact set of points in ''d''-dimensional Euclidean space whose Hausdorff dimension is strictly greater than ''d''/2, then the conjecture states that the set of distances between pairs of points in ''S'' must have nonzero [[Lebesgue measure]].

==Formulation and motivation==
{{harvtxt|Falconer|1985}} proved that Borel sets with Hausdorff dimension greater than (''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2 have distance sets with nonzero measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = On the Hausdorff dimensions of distance sets
 | volume = 32
 | year = 1985}}. See in particular the remarks following Corollary 2.3. Although this paper is widely cited as its origin, the Falconer conjecture itself does not appear in it.&lt;/ref&gt; He motivated this result as a multidimensional generalization of the [[Steinhaus theorem]], a previous result of [[Hugo Steinhaus]] proving that every set of [[real number]]s with nonzero measure must have a [[difference set]] that contains an interval of the form &lt;math&gt; (-\epsilon,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 1
 | year = 1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be seen as a continuous analogue of the [[Erdős distinct distances problem]], which states that large finite sets of points must have large numbers of distinct distances.

==Partial results==
{{harvtxt|Erdog̃an|2005}} proved that compact sets of points whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{d}{2} + \tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; have distance sets with nonzero measure; for large values of ''d'' this approximates the threshold on Hausdorff dimension given by the Falconer conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 23

For points in the [[Euclidean plane]], a variant of Falconer's conjecture states that a [[compact set]] whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than or equal to one must have a distance set of Hausdorff dimension one. Falconer himself showed that this is true for compact sets with Hausdorff dimension at least 3/2, and subsequent results lowered this bound to 4/3.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Related conjectures==
Proving a bound strictly greater than 1/2 for the dimension of the distance set in the case of compact planar sets with Hausdorff dimension at least one would be equivalent to resolving several other unsolved conjectures. These include a conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] on the existence of [[Borel set|Borel]] [[subring]]s of the [[real number]]s with fractional Hausdorff dimension, and a variant of the [[Kakeya set]] problem on the Hausdorff dimension of sets such that, for every possible direction, there is a line segment whose intersection with the set has high Hausdorff dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Ferhad Shakely''' (born 1951) is a prominent [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] writer, poet and researcher. He is one of the founders of modern Kurdish poetry in the post-Goran period. He was born in 1951 in the province of [[Kirkuk]] in [[Iraq]]. He began publishing poetry in 1968.  In the early 1970s he studied in the [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] department of the [[Baghdad University]]. He joined the Kurdish national movement under the leadership of Mustafa Barzany in 1974 and went to [[Syria]] in 1975. He lived in [[Germany]] from Autumn 1977 to Summer 1978. Finally he settled in [[Sweden]] in the same year.  In 1981, after studying for one year at the [[University of Stockholm]], he went to [[Uppsala University]] where he studied Iranian languages. He is now teaching in the same university. He published a [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-Kurdish Journal between 1985 and 1989 called ''Svensk-Kurdisk Journal''. Moreover, he published a literary Kurdish magazine, Mamosta-y Kurd (31 issues) between 1985 and 1996. In 1992, he published Kurdish nationalism in Mam and Zin of [[Ahmad Khani]], a literary history that was translated into Swedish, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Many of his poems have been translated into [[Persian language|Persian]], Arabic, [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], Swedish, [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Danish language|Danish]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4045">[[File:Playing_roulette,_Las_Vegas,_Nevada_(74663).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Roulette]] is a game of chance, no strategy can give players advantages, the outcome is determined by pure chance]]
A '''game of chance''' is a [[game]] whose outcome is strongly influenced by some [[randomness|randomizing]] device, and upon which contestants may choose to [[Gambling|wager]] money or anything of monetary value.  Common devices used include [[dice]], [[spinning top]]s, [[playing card]]s, [[roulette]] wheels, or numbered balls drawn from a container. A game of chance may have some [[skill]] element to it, however, chance generally plays a greater role in determining the outcome than skill. A [[game of skill]], on the other hand, also may have elements of chance, but with skill playing a greater role in determining the outcome.

Any game of chance that involves anything of monetary value is [[gambling]].

Gambling is known in nearly all human societies, even though many have passed laws restricting it.  Early people used the [[knucklebones]] of [[sheep]] as dice.  Some people develop a [[ludomania|psychological addiction to gambling]], and will risk even food and shelter to continue.

Some games of chance may also involve a certain degree of skill. This is especially true where the player or players have decisions to make based upon previous or incomplete knowledge, such as [[blackjack]]. In other games like roulette and ''punto banco'' [[Baccarat (card game)|(baccarat)]] the player may only choose the amount of bet and the thing he/she wants to bet on; the rest is up to chance, therefore these games are still considered games of chance with small amount of skills required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casinoobserver.com/baccarat-strategy.htm |title=Baccarat Strategy Guide |publisher=CasinoObserver.com |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between 'chance' and 'skill' is relevant because in some countries chance games are illegal or at least [[Gaming law|regulated]], but skill games are not.&lt;ref name="nyti_Opin"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Poker, an American Pastime and a Game of Skill| last = McManus | first = James| work = nytimes.com| date = 24 August 2012| accessdate = 2018-06-25| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/opinion/poker-an-american-pastime-and-a-game-of-skill.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyti_Winf"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Win for DraftKings and FanDuel Opens Door for Sports Betting in New York| author = Drape, Joe| work = nytimes.com| date = 4 August 2016| accessdate = 2018-06-25| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/sports/new-york-fantasy-sports-law-opens-door-for-more-gambling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Addiction ==
People who engage in games of chance and gambling can develop a strong dependence on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setthings.com/en/gambling-and-chance/|title=Gambling and chance|publisher=SetThings|language=en|access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called psychopathology (addiction) of "pathological gambling". According to psychoanalyst [[Edmund Bergler]], there are six characteristics of pathological gamblers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopital-marmottan.fr/articles/jeupatho.php|title=The Psychology of Gambling (1957)|author=Edmund Bergler}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# He must play regularly: the issue here is to know from when the subject performs "too much."
# The game takes precedence over all other interests.
# There is optimism in the player that is not initiated by repeated experiences of failure.
# The player never stops until he wins.
# Despite the precautions that he originally promised  he ends up taking too many risks.
# There is in him a subjective experience of "thrill" (a shivering sensation, excitement, tension, both painful and pleasant) during the phases of play.

'''Hebrew [[punctuation]]''' is similar to that of [[English language|English]] and other [[Western world|Western]] languages, [[Modern Hebrew]] having imported additional punctuation marks from these languages in order to avoid the ambiguities sometimes occasioned by the relative paucity of such symbols in [[Biblical Hebrew]].

==Punctuation==

===Quotation marks===

[[File:OldHebrewQuotationStyle from1923 translation of RobinsonCrusoe.png|alt=Old style Hebrew quotation marks, from a 1923 translation of Robinson Crusoe|thumb|412px|Old style Hebrew quotation marks, from a 1923 translation of [[Robinson Crusoe]]]]
With most printed Hebrew texts from the early 1970s and before, opening quotation marks are low (as in [[German language|German]]), and closing ones are high, often going above the letters themselves (as opposed to the [[gershayim]], which is level with the top of letters).  An example of this system is {{Script/Hebrew|1=&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;„&lt;/span&gt;ישראל&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;}}.

However, this distinction in Hebrew between opening and closing quotation marks has completely disappeared, and today, quotations are punctuated as they are in English (such as {{Script/Hebrew|1=&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;ישראל&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;}}), with both quotation marks high. This is due to the advent of the [[Hebrew keyboard|Hebrew keyboard layout]], which lacks the opening quotation mark ⟨&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;„&lt;/span&gt;⟩, as well as to the lack in Hebrew of "[[quotation mark#Curved quotes and Unicode|smart quotes]]" as found in [[Microsoft Word]] for many other languages.

In addition, the quotation mark is often used for the similar looking but different ''[[gershayim]]'' mark ⟨&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;{{Script/Hebrew|״}}&lt;/span&gt;⟩, as that too is absent from the [[Hebrew keyboard]].

| ''{{transl|he|merkhaʾot}}'' — {{Script/Hebrew|מֵרְכָאוֹת}} (plural of ''{{transl|he|merkha}}'' — {{Script/Hebrew|מֵרְכָא}}); a similar punctuation mark unique to Hebrew is called [[gershayim]] — {{Script/Hebrew|גרשיים}}
|}

===Period, question mark, exclamation mark, comma===
Periods (full stops), question marks, exclamation marks, and commas are used as in English.

A Hebrew period in a traditional '''''[[serif]]''''' face usually looks like a tiny tilted square (a [[geometric shapes|diamond]]; [[File:U25CA.gif|20px]]). This is also true for the dot part of the [[question mark]], and [[exclamation mark]].

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which is also written from right to left, the question mark ⟨{{lang|ar|؟}}⟩ is mirrored right-to-left from the English question mark.  (Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward question mark due to font or text directionality issues.) [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is also written right-to-left, but uses a question mark that appears on the page in the same orientation as the English ⟨?⟩.&lt;ref&gt;Truss, Lynne.  ''Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves'', 2003.  p. 143.  {{ISBN|1-59240-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colon and ''{{lang|he-Latn|sof pasuq}}''===
Stemming from Biblical Hebrew, a ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[sof pasuq]]}}'' ⟨ {{Script/Hebrew|׃}} ⟩ is the equivalent of a period, and is used in some writings such as prayer books. Since a ''{{lang|he-Latn|sof pasuq}}'' is absent from the [[Hebrew keyboard|Hebrew keyboard layout]], and looks very similar to the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]] ⟨:⟩, a colon is often substituted for it.

===Vertical bar and ''paseq''===
Also coming from Biblical Hebrew, a ''[[paseq]]''   ⟨{{Hebrew|׀}}⟩   is used as a word separator. Also not on a standard [[Hebrew keyboard]], a [[vertical bar]] ⟨|⟩ is often used instead. The vertical bar, a standard key on any keyboard, is used in English for such applications as mathematics and computing.

===Hyphen and ''maqaf''===
{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; width: 30em; margin-left: 1em;"
|+ Example
! scope="col" | Hebrew ''{{lang|he-Latn|maqaf}}''
! scope="col" | Standard English hyphen
|- style="font-size: 325%; line-height: 1em; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"
| {{Script/Hebrew|עַל־יְדֵי}}
| {{Script/Hebrew|עַל-יְדֵי}}
|-
| colspan="2" style="text-align: center;" | Notice how the maqaf aligns with the top horizontal strokes whereas the standard English hyphen is in the middle of the letters.
|}
The ''{{lang|he-Latn|maqaf}}'' ⟨{{Script/Hebrew|מַקָּף}}) ⟨{{Script/Hebrew|־}}⟩ is the Hebrew [[hyphen]] ⟨-⟩, and has virtually the same purpose for connecting two words as in English. It is different from the hyphen in its positioning (a hyphen is in the middle in terms of height, the ''{{lang|he-Latn|maqaf}}'' is at the top) and it has a biblical origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GHG|16}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike many other [[Modern Hebrew]] punctuation symbols, which have simply been imported from European languages.

The ''{{lang|he-Latn|maqaf}}'' is well-used in Hebrew typography; most books and newspapers use it and have the hyphens higher than one would find in English.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In online writing, however, it is rarely used because it was absent from the [[Hebrew keyboard]] layout on [[Microsoft Windows]] until [[Windows 8]]. As a result, a standard English hyphen ⟨-⟩ is most often used in online writings. This situation can be compared to that of users writing in Latin alphabets using the easily available [[hyphen-minus]] ⟨-⟩ over [[hyphen]] ⟨‐⟩, [[minus sign|minus]] ⟨−⟩, [[dash#en dash|en dash]] ⟨–⟩, and [[dash#Em dash|em dash]] ⟨—⟩.

It is possible to insert ''{{lang|he-Latn|maqaf}}'' using keyboard combinations: e.g. [[Option key]] + [[Backslash]] on [[MacOS]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://apps.carleton.edu/its/flt/assets/MacHebrLayout.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brackets/parentheses===
Brackets or parentheses, ⟨(⟩ and ⟨)⟩ are the same in Hebrew as in English. Since Hebrew is written from right to left, ⟨)⟩ becomes an opening bracket, and ⟨(⟩ a closing bracket, the opposite from English, which is written left to right.

===Israeli currency sign===
{{Details|shekel sign}}
{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; width: auto; margin-left: 1em;"
|+ Example
! scope="col" | With sheqel sign
! scope="col" | With abbreviation
|- style="font-size: 250%; line-height: 1em; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"
| {{Script/Hebrew|₪12,000}}
| {{Script/Hebrew|12,000ש״ח}}
|}
The [[shekel sign|sheqel sign]] ({{Script/Hebrew|₪}}) is the currency sign for the Israeli currency (the [[Israeli new shekel]]), in the way [[dollar sign|$]], [[pound sign|£]], and [[euro sign|€]] exist for other currencies. The sheqel sign, like the dollar sign ⟨$⟩, is usually placed to the left of the number (so ''{{Script/Hebrew|₪12,000}}'', rather than ''{{Script/Hebrew|12,000₪}}''), but since Hebrew is written from right to left, the symbol is actually written after the number. It is either not [[space (punctuation)|separated]] from the preceding number, or is separated only by a [[thin space]].

Unlike the dollar sign, the new sheqel sign is not used that often when handwriting monetary amounts, and is generally replaced by the abbreviation {{Script/Hebrew|ש״ח}} (standing for ''{{lang|he-Latn|sheqel ẖadash}}'', lit. "new sheqel").

===Apostrophe and quotation marks===
{{Details|Geresh|Gershayim}}
{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; width: 20em; margin-left: 1em;"
|+ Example
! scope="col" | [[Geresh]]
! scope="col" | [[Apostrophe]] used as a geresh
|- style="font-size: 325%; line-height: 1em; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"
| {{Script/Hebrew|צ׳ארלס}}
| {{Script/Hebrew|1=צ&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;ארלס}}
|-
! scope="col" | [[Gershayim]]
! scope="col" | [[Quotation mark]]s used as gershayim
|- style="font-size: 325%; line-height: 1em; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"
| {{Script/Hebrew|צה״ל}}
| {{Script/Hebrew|1=צה&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;ל}}
|-
| colspan="2" style="text-align: center;" | Notice how the geresh and gershayim align with the top horizontal strokes whereas the standard English characters are above the letters.
|}

The ''[[geresh]]'' ⟨{{Script/Hebrew|׳}}⟩, is the Hebrew equivalent of a period in abbreviations (e.g. abbrev.), in addition to being attached to Hebrew letters to indicate sounds like [[hard and soft G|soft ''g'']] {{IPAblink|dʒ}} and [[ch (digraph)|''ch'']] {{IPAblink|tʃ}} in foreign names such as Charles ({{Script/Hebrew|[[:he:צ'ארלס|צ׳ארלס]]}})&lt;!-- Note: hewiki article uses an apostrophe, not a geresh --&gt; and Jake ({{Script/Hebrew|ג׳ייק}}). The ''[[gershayim]]'' ⟨{{Script/Hebrew|״}}⟩, is a Hebrew symbol indicating that a sequence of characters is an acronym, and is placed ''before'' the last character of the word. Owing to a [[Hebrew keyboard]]'s having neither a ''geresh'' nor ''gershayim'', they are usually replaced online with, respectively, the  visually similar apostrophe ⟨&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;⟩ and quotation mark ⟨&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:large"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;⟩. The quotation mark and apostrophe are higher than the ''geresh'' and ''gershayim'': where the latter are placed level with the top of Hebrew letters, the apostrophe and quotation marks are above them.

Some Hebrew-specific [[font]]s (fonts designed primarily for Hebrew letters), such as [[David (font)|David]], [[Narkisim]] and [[FrankRuehl]], do not feature the apostrophe and quotation marks as such but use the ''geresh'' and ''gershayim'' to substitute for them.

===Mathematics===
Mathematical expressions are written in Israel using the same symbols as in English, including [[Arabic numerals|Western numerals]], which are written left to right. The only variant that exists is an [[alternative plus sign]], which is a plus sign which looks like an inverted [[capital letter|capital]] T. [[Unicode]] has this symbol at position U+FB29 "Hebrew letter alternative plus sign" (﬩).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decodeunicode.org/U+FB29 Unicode U+FB29 reference page]&lt;/ref&gt; However, most books for adults use the international symbol "+".

| &lt;center&gt;Reversed nun - [[Z]]-shape&lt;/center&gt;
 |}
[[Reversed Nun|Reversed ''nun'']] (also called inverted ''nun'', ''nun hafukha'', or ''nun menuzzeret'') is a rare character found in two Biblical Hebrew texts.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt; Although in Judaic literature it is known as ''nun hafukha'' ("reversed ''[[nun (letter)|nun]]''"), it does not function as any sort of letter in the text.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt; It is not part of a word, and it is not read aloud in any way. It is simply a mark that is written, and is therefore a punctuation mark, not a letter. Also, it is surrounded by space.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;

While it depends on the particular manuscript or printed edition, it is found in nine places: twice in the [[Book of Numbers]] (prior to and after Numbers 10:34-36), and seven times in [[Psalm]] 107.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt; It is uncertain today what it was intended to signify.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;

In many manuscripts, it does not even resemble a transformed ''nun'' at all, and when it does, it sometimes appears reversed (as mentioned above), sometimes inverted, and sometimes turned through 180°.&lt;ref name="IOS"&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2714.pdf Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set: International Organization for Standardization]&lt;/ref&gt; Other times it appears to look like the letter Z.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;

These signs (points, ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[niqqud|neqqudot]]}}'') indicate voweling or some other aspects of the pronunciation of a letter or word. While in Modern Hebrew they are not generally used outside poetry and children's books, a vowel point or other diacritic is occasionally added to resolve ambiguity.

One of these ''{{lang|he-Latn|neqqudot}}'', the ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[rafe]]}}'', is no longer used in Hebrew, even though it is routinely used in Yiddish spelling (as defined by [[YIVO]]).

The cantillation marks ({{lang-he|טעמים}} ''{{transl|he|teʿamim}}'') have a very specialized use.  They are only found in printed Hebrew texts of [[Tanakh]] to be used as a guide for chanting the text, either from the printed text or, in the case of the public reading of the [[Torah]], to be memorized along with vowel marks as the [[Sefer Torah]] includes only the letters of the text without cantillation or vowel marks. Outside the [[Tanakh]], the cantillation marks are not used in modern spoken or written Hebrew at all. The cantillation marks provide a structure to sentences of Tanakh similar to that provided by punctuation marks.

'''International Mother Language Day''' ('''IMLD''') is a worldwide annual observance held on 21 February to promote [[awareness]] of [[Linguistic diversity|linguistic]] and [[cultural diversity]] and promote [[multilingualism]]. First announced by [[UNESCO]] on 17 November 1999, it was formally recognized by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in a resolution establishing 2008 as the [[International Year of Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/61/266 |title=Links to documents |website=Un.org |date=2002-09-09 |accessdate=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingles"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ingles.

International Mother Language Day has been observed annually since 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/motherlanguageday/|title=International Mother Language Day|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote peace and multilingualism around the world and to protect all [[First language|mother languages]]. It is observed on February 21 to recognize the [[Bengali language movement|1952 Bengali Language Movement]] in [[Bangladesh]].

The day was proclaimed by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in November 1999 (30C/62). In its resolution A/RES/61/266, the United Nations General Assembly called on its member states "to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by people of the world" on 16 May 2009.&lt;ref name="Resolution adopted by the General Assembly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|url=http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Conferences/Documents/A.RES.61.266.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the resolution, the General Assembly proclaimed 2008 as the International Year of Languages to promote unity in diversity and international understanding through multilingualism and [[multiculturalism]].&lt;!--Social justice is an underlying principle for peaceful and prosperous coexistence within and among nations. We uphold the principles of social justice when we promote gender equality or the rights of indigenous peoples and migrants. We advance social justice when we remove barriers that people face because of gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, culture or disability.--&gt; The resolution was suggested by Rafiqul Islam, a Bengali living in [[Vancouver]], Canada. He wrote a letter to [[Kofi Annan]] on 9 January 1998 asking him to take a step for saving the world's languages from extinction by declaring an International Mother Language Day. Rafiq proposed the date as 21 February to commemorate the 1952 killings in Dhaka during the Language Movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Jerrold Jacob Katz''' (14 July 1932{{spaced ndash}}7 February 2002) was an American philosopher and linguist.

==Biography==
After receiving a PhD in philosophy from [[Princeton University]] in 1960, Katz became a Research Associate in Linguistics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1961. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy there in 1963, and became Professor in 1969. From 1975 until his death, he was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics at the [[City University of New York]].

Within linguistics, Katz is best known for his theory of [[semantics]] in [[generative grammar]] ([[generative semantics]]). Katz was a staunch defender of [[Rationalism]] (although not in a Cartesian/Fregean sense) and the metaphysical import of "essences".  He argued extensively against the dominance of [[empiricism]]. Katz also argued, [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|against]] [[W. V. O. Quine]], that the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]] could be founded on syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20114738 Linsky, J. ''Analytical/Synthetic and Semantic Theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2023770 Quine, W. V. O.: ''On a Suggestion of Katz'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psiquadrat.de/downloads/katz74.pdf Katz, J: ''Where Things Stand Now with the Analytical/Synthetic Distinction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jiiddu''' (also known as '''Jiddu''' or '''Af-Jiiddu''') is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken by the Jiiddu sub-clan of the [[Rahanweyn]], a [[Somalis|Somali]] clan inhabiting southern [[Somalia]]. It is part of the family's [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch, and has an estimated 50,000 speakers mainly residing in the [[Lower Shabeelle]], [[Bay, Somalia|Bay]] and [[Middle Jubba]] regions and the sultan of jiddo is called warsame alio &lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically classified as part of the Digil group of languages, Jiiddu has a different phonology and sentence structure from [[Somali language|Somali]]. However, it more closely resembles Somali than [[Baiso language|Baiso]]. It also possibly shares commonalities with the [[Hadiyya language|Hadiyya]], [[Gedeo language|Gedeo]], [[Alaba-K’abeena language|Alaba-Kabeena]], [[Konso language|Konso]] and [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]] languages spoken in southern [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Ethnjid"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jii Ethnologue - Jiiddu language]&lt;/ref&gt;

The language belongs to the [[Arikem languages|Arikém language]] family from the Tupi stock. It is the only surviving language in the family after the other two members, [[Kabixiana language|Kabixiâna]] and [[Arikem language|Arikém]], became extinct.&lt;ref name="Landin1984"&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.583.4814&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Landin, David J. “An Outline of the Syntactic Structure of Karitiâna Sentences”]. MA Thesis. University College London, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==

Although the first Western contacts with the Karitiana people are believed to have begun in the 17th century, the first recorded contact dates to 1907 when a survey conducted by Cândio Rondon indicated that they were already working for Bolivian [[Amazon rubber boom|rubber tappers]]. Systematic contact between the Karitiana people and Caucasians, nevertheless began in the 1950s with the intervention of ISA and [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Roman Catholic Salesian missionaries]]. As a result of the missionaries' visit, a list of words and phrases were compiled, allowing Professor [[Aryon Rodrigues]] who was working at the [[University of Campinas]] at the time, to classify the language as a member of the Arikém Family by comparing the language to existing materials on the Arikém language.

===Pronouns===
Only [[epicene]] pronouns exist in Karitiana. This means that no distinction is made between male vs. female (as "he" or "she" in English).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Careb |year=2011 |title=Gender, pronouns and thought: The ligature between epicene pronouns and a more neutral gender perception |journal=Gender and Language |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=133–152 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''know-it-all''' or '''know-all''' is a person who constantly presents their input as though they were professionally trained, schooled or have firsthand insight into subjects when it is evident this is not the case. A know-it-all will quickly reject opinions, suggestions, thoughts and commentary from others as incorrect, nonsensical and disruptive.&lt;ref name=Pincus&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing difficult people: a survival guide for handling any employee|author=Marilyn Pincus|edition=2nd|publisher=Adams Media|year=2004|isbn=9781593371869|chapter=The Know-It-All|pages=75–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word ''Besserwisser'' is also used in some languages, literally meaning "better knower".

'''Kurbetcha''' (or '''Gurbetcha''') is a [[creole language]] with what appears to be predominantly [[Romani language|Romani]] vocabulary and [[Cypriot Turkish]] grammar, spoken by the ''Kurbet'' ([[Romani people|Roma]]) of [[Cyprus]]. The Kurbet have traditionally also spoken [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The majority settled in the [[Northern Cyprus|north]] after [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974]], but many of those have returned to the south (i.e. the areas under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus) in recent years.

Kurbetcha has been very little studied. Children are not learning the language; it has been supplanted by Turkish in the north and Greek in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14664208.2011.629113|last1=Hadjioannou|first1=Xenia|last2=Tsiplakou|first2=Stavroula|last3=Kappler|first3=Matthias|year=2011|title=Language policy and language planning in Cyprus|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=12|issue=4|pages=503–569|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''LanguageWare''' is a [[natural language processing]] (NLP) technology developed by [[IBM]], which allows applications to process natural language text. It comprises a set of Java libraries which provide a range of [[natural language processing|NLP]] functions: language identification, text segmentation/tokenization, normalization, entity and relationship extraction, and semantic analysis and disambiguation. The analysis engine uses [[Finite State Machine]] approach at multiple levels, which aids its performance characteristics, while maintaining a reasonably small footprint.

The behaviour of the system is driven by a set of configurable lexico-semantic resources which describe the characteristics and domain of the processed language. A default set of resources comes as part of LanguageWare and these describe the native language characteristics, such as morphology, and the basic vocabulary for the language. Supplemental resources have been created which capture additional vocabularies, terminologies, rules and grammars, which may be generic to the language or specific to one or more domains.

A set of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based customization tooling, LanguageWare Resource Workbench, is available on IBM's alphaWorks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech|title=alphaWorks Community|date=20 October 2009|publisher=alphaworks.ibm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; site, and allows domain knowledge to be compiled into these resources and thereby incorporated into the analysis process.

LanguageWare can be deployed as a set of [[UIMA]]-compliant annotators, Eclipse plug-ins or [[Web Services]].

'''Lapine''' is a [[fictional language]] created by author [[Richard Adams]] for his 1972 novel ''[[Watership Down]]'', where it is spoken by [[List of fictional rabbits|rabbit characters]]. The language was again used in Adams' 1996 sequel, ''[[Tales from Watership Down]]'', and has appeared in both the [[Watership Down (film)|film]] and [[Watership Down (TV series)|television adaptations]]. The fragments of language presented by Adams consist of a few dozen distinct words, and are chiefly used for the naming of [[rabbit]]s, their mythological characters, and objects in their world. The name "Lapine" comes from the French word for rabbit, ''lapin'', and can also be used to describe rabbit society.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;&lt;ref name=rogers/&gt;

==History==
The words of the Lapine language were developed by Adams piecemeal and organically as required by the circumstances of the plot. In a [[Reddit]] [[AMA (Reddit)|"Ask Me Anything" interview]], Adams noted that "I just constructed Lapine as I went - when the rabbits needed a word for something so did I." Reflecting on his inspirations for the words, Adams stated that "some of them are [[onomatopoeic]] like ''hrududu'' (which is a car), but overall they simply came from my [[subconscious]]".&lt;ref name=adams2014/&gt; Adams commented that the motivation for the sound of Lapine was that it should sound "wuffy, fluffy" as in the word "Efrafa".&lt;ref name=adams2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=rogers/&gt; Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Keren Levy described the Lapine language as "somehow easy to accept as [a language] we have always known. It is the language of the countryside, of its copses and beeches and of the weather."&lt;ref name=levy/&gt;

The sound of Lapine has been ascribed to influence from [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]]&lt;ref name=rogers/&gt; and [[Arabic language]]s.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt; Author [[Stephen Cain (poet)|Stephen Cain]] bolsters the Arabic connection by noting in particular that "Adams had occasion to study [Arabic] during his military service in the [[Middle East]]."&lt;ref name=cain/&gt; The Lapine language has also been frequently compared to [[Sindarin]] (the language of the Elves in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Middle-earth]]'' series) in terms of its effect on setting in the novels.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; Following the success of ''Watership Down'', Richard Adams would go on to invent another constructed language for his [[Beklan Empire|Beklan]] novels, ''[[Shardik]]'' (1974) and ''[[Maia (novel)|Maia]]'' (1984).

==Linguistic analyses==
Some fans of the book, including authors and academics, have written about the words and phrases extant in the corpus of ''Watership Down'' and have analyzed the language and its variations on a linguistic level.

Within the books, the rabbits' use of Lapine is presented to readers as [[Standard English]] with the inclusion of a number of specialized Lapine lexical terms.&lt;ref name=corder/&gt; Albert Valdman notes that inter-rabbit Lapine is alternately [[Formality level|formal]] and [[Colloquial language|colloquial]] "marked by hesitations, interruptions, interjections, incomplete sentences, and false starts".&lt;ref name=valdman/&gt; [[Pit Corder]] breaks this down further, finding that the Lapine spoken by the rabbits consists of 64% [[simple sentence]]s, 14% [[compound sentence]]s (with 30% [[paratactic]] and 70% marked [[Conjunction (grammar)#Coordinating conjunctions|coordination]]), and 22% [[complex sentence]]s.&lt;ref name=corder/&gt; The mean Lapine sentence length is 6.3 words.&lt;ref name=corder/&gt;

Adams includes a glossary of all Lapine words in the book at the end. Notable traits include the plural marker ''-il'' (which replaces a final vowel if it is present in the singular: ''hrududu'', "automobile", pl. ''hrududil''), and the fact that cardinal numbers only go up to four, with any number above that being called ''hrair,'' "many", although the runt Hrairoo's name is translated into English as "Fiver" instead. The use of Lapine words is often (although not exclusively) used to indicate concepts unique to rabbits, such as ''silflay'' (aboveground grazing) or ''tharn'' ([[Domestic_rabbit#Tonic_immobility|tonic immobility]]).

When speaking to other animals, the rabbits adopt a [[lingua franca]] known as "Hedgerow," however in both examples given in the book (i.e. the mouse&lt;ref name=valdman/&gt; and [[Kehaar]] the gull&lt;ref name=corder/&gt;) the conversation reverts to Lapine once initial contact has been established. More specifically, the rabbits adopt [[Formality level|formal]] Lapine&lt;ref name=valdman/&gt; and the other animals employ a Lapine [[Foreigner talk theory|Foreigner Talk]] that Corder describes as "a reduced code or incipient [[pidgin]]".&lt;ref name=corder/&gt;&lt;ref name=valdman/&gt; He further notes that the general rules of "Foreigner Talk" are well-established in societies even among natives who have never communicated with a foreigner. Corder attributes the learning of the rules of "Foreigner Talk" to its use within native-speaker-oriented literature and other media as a proxy for [[interlanguage]].

Because Lapine is presented in the novels as Standard English, Lapine Foreigner Talk is essentially English Foreigner Talk with a Lapine gloss and thus provides an example of linguistic [[enculturation]] for children who read the books. Breaking down the [[syntax]] of Lapine Foreigner Talk to compare with that of standard Lapine, Corder finds that they are roughly the same with the only notable difference being an inversion of the proportion of paratactic to marked coordination in compound sentences. Specifically, Corder reports Lapine Foreigner Talk to consist of 73% simple sentences, 15% compound sentences (70% paratactic and 30% marked coordination), and 12% complex sentences (with 60% [[Complement (linguistics)|complemented]] by the four verbs "think", "know", "say", and "tell").&lt;ref name=corder/&gt; Valdman further notes differences between the Lapine Foreigner Talk used to facilitate discussion as with Kehaar the gull, and that used to signal the depreciated status of the unnamed mouse (a less powerful animal in the rabbit world).&lt;ref name=valdman/&gt;

==Usage outside the novel==
The use of Lapine outside of the fictional world of the novels has been explored by Thomas E. Murray, who notes that the Lapine word "silflay" (meaning "To go above ground to feed. Literally, to feed outside."&lt;ref name=adams2005-2/&gt;) has entered the English lexicon as more than a mere [[nonce word]]. In a survey Murray found that the term was in use (meaning "the act of rabbits eating above-ground") primarily in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest and North Central United States]]. He also noted differing levels of use according to [[socioeconomic status]] with usage highest among [[Middle class|middle]] and [[lower middle class]] speakers.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; Murray suggests that the geographical spread of the term may in part be limited by interactions with rabbits, highlighting the comment of a [[New York City]]-based survey participant who knew the word but never used it due to the lack of rabbits in the city. Murray also claims that the Lapine word "Crixa" (meaning "The center of Efrafa, at the crossing point of two bridle paths"&lt;ref name=adams2005-2/&gt;) has also gained usage outside the novel: it is used by students to refer to the residential dormitories within [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;

==Linguistic development==
Other authors, such as Patrick Jemmer (who corresponded briefly with Adams regarding the Lapine language), have made large-scale 'recreations' of various possible historical stages of the language. Jemmer's work documents the evolution of numerous inter-related languages (the process of development and analysis is called 'aleolinguistics').&lt;ref name=jemmer14/&gt; It contains comprehensive syntax for each linguistic stage (or 'aleostate'), and vocabularies involving approximately 2000 lexemes. Sample scripts and comparative texts are available.&lt;ref name=jemmer17/&gt;

'''Leungli''' or '''Si Leungli''' is a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[folklore]] from [[West Java]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gramedia.com/buku_detail.asp?id=ELfJ5841&amp;jenis=&amp;kat=5 Si Leungli]&lt;/ref&gt; The folklore tells the story of a beautiful friendship between a poor girl and her magical pet [[goldfish]] named "Leungli", who helped and cheered her whenever her older sisters abused her.

The theme and moral of the legend are similar to those of the European folktale "[[Cinderella]]".

==Summary==
Once upon a time, seven orphan sisters lived together in a village; the youngest sibling was the only stepdaughter from previous marriage of their late parents. The youngest one was opposite in character and personality to her sisters. She was a diligent, kind, honest and humble girl who did all the housework, such as laundry, cooking and cleaning. Her older sisters were lazy, rude, mean, glamorous, proud and envious girls who were always ordering their youngest sister around.

One day, the youngest sister loses some of her older sisters' clothes while doing the daily laundry on the river. The older sisters scolded her severely and told her not to come home until she has found the missing clothing. The youngest one tried desperately to find the lost clothes in the river but was not successful. In her sadness she cried on the river bank. Suddenly a beautiful [[goldfish]] with shining [[gold]]en scales appeared in front of her, jumping from the water and trying to cheer her up. The goldfish is magical and can talk to humans so introduced itself to her as "Leungli". Leungli finds out why the girl is crying and offers to help her to find the lost clothes. The girl is delighted when finally Leungli locates the missing clothes along the river. From then on Leungli becomes the girl's faithful friend,  listening to her problems, comforting and cheering her. Every time she needed Leungli's company she would bring rice she had saved from her daily meal on a banana leaf plate to share.  She would call by dipping the tip of her hair into the river and singing the [[Pantun Sunda|pantun]] and shortly after the magical goldfish would appear.

As the friendship between the girl and Leungli grows the older sisters notice a change in their younger sister's behaviour. She seems to have become stronger, more confident and happier, despite the abuse they continue to inflict. One day they curiously follow their youngest sister to the river and finally learn of Leungli's existence. The evil older sisters are envious and plot to catch Leungli.  They copy the call used by their youngest sister and trick the magical goldfish, catching it in their net.
Later that day the kind youngest sister tries to call Leungli at the river but Leungli does not come. She returned home saddened by the sudden loss of her friend. When she entered the kitchen she was shocked to find scales and fish bones on a plate which were clearly the remnant of Leungli. Her mean older sisters had cooked Leungli for their lunch. She cried heavily and buried Leungli's remains in her backyard.

Magically from the grave of Leungli grew a golden tree with golden leaves and precious stones as the fruits. When anyone takes the golden leaves or the jewel fruits they turn to dust and disappear, except for the kind younger sister. She is the only one that can take the bounty of the magical tree. The story of magical tree spread widely within the kingdom and finally reached the palace. One day a handsome prince visited the village to see the famous magical golden tree, he finally learned about the story behind the tree and meets the youngest sibling. The prince admired the beauty and kindness of the youngest sister and they fell in love, got married, moved to the palace and lived happily ever after.

==Moral of the story==
Leungli is a popular Sundanese children folklore. This tale is a traditional [[pedagogical]] means to teach children to be kind to their siblings and other living beings including animals (in this case goldfish). The parents often recite this tale as a bedtime story and expect the children to take the role model of the kind and diligent youngest sister. The story also uphold the traditional moral theme, the good shall be rewarded and the evil shall be punished. The [[karmic]] theme and [[fable]] story that teach about benevolence and kindness is somewhat similar with Buddhism [[Jataka tales]], it probably the trace of Sundanese traditional reverence to nature and also Hindu-Buddhist influences.

The '''''michaelaton''''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|νόμισμα μιχαηλᾶτον}}}}, "coin of Michael"), in [[Latin]] '''''michaelatus''''', was the colloquial name given to the gold [[Byzantine]] coins (''[[nomisma]]ta'') struck by any emperor called Michael. 

In a more technical sense, it refers to the gold ''[[histamenon|histamena]]'' issued by Emperor [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] (r. 1034–1041) and, in sources of the late 11th and the 12th centuries, for those of Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] (r. 1071–1078), whose gold coinage was the last to retain a reasonably high amount of gold (16 carats) before the massive debasement that followed under his successors. It was in widespread use in [[Medieval Italy|Italy]], especially the south, because it was virtually equal to the popular [[Sicily|Sicilian]] ''[[tarì]]''.

[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|Adherence to the [[Nicene Creed]] is a common test of orthodoxy in Christianity.|alt=]]

'''Orthodoxy''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὀρθοδοξία ''orthodoxía'' "right opinion")&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|orthodoxy|accessdate= 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is adherence to correct or accepted [[creed]]s, especially in religion.&lt;ref&gt;orthodox. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/orthodox Dictionary definition] (accessed: March 03, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Christianity|Christian]] sense the term means "conforming to the Christian faith as represented in the creeds of the [[early Church]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Taking Caesar Out of Jesus: Uncovering the Lost Relevance of Jesus |author= Robert M. Wills |page= 246 |publisher= Xlibris Corporation |year= 2013 |isbn= 1-4931-0810-7}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[first seven ecumenical councils]] were held between the years of 325 and 787 with the aim of formalizing accepted doctrines.

In some English speaking countries, Jews who adhere to all the traditions and commandments as legislated in the [[Talmud]] are often called [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], although the term "orthodox" historically first described Christian beliefs.

==Religions==
===Buddhism===
{{Main article|Theravada}}
The historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was known to denounce mere attachment to scriptures or [[dogmatic]] principles, as it was mentioned in the [[Kalama Sutta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html|title=Kalama Sutta: To the Kalamas|website=[[Access to Insight]] |publisher= Barre Center for Buddhist Studies|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]] follows strict adherence to the [[Pāli Canon]] (tripitaka) and the commentaries such as the [[Visuddhimagga]]. Hence, the Theravada school came to be considered the most orthodox of all Buddhist schools{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, as it is known to be highly conservative especially within the discipline and practice of the [[Vinaya]].

===Christianity===
[[File:ICXC_NIKA.svg|thumb|right|The Greek Cross, flanked by the Greek letters "ICXC NIKA" which means "JESUS CHRIST CONQUERS".]]
In classical Christian usage, the term ''orthodox'' refers to the set of doctrines which were believed by the [[early Christians]]. A series of [[ecumenical council]]s were held over a period of several centuries to try to formalize these doctrines. The most significant of these early decisions was that between the [[Homoousian]] doctrine of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] and [[Eustathius of Antioch|Eustathius]] (which became [[Trinity|Trinitarianism]]) and the [[Heteroousian]] doctrine of [[Arius]] and [[Eusebius of Nicomedia|Eusebius]] (called [[Arianism]]). The Homoousian doctrine, which defined Jesus as both God and man with the canons of the 431 [[Council of Ephesus]], won out in the Church and was referred to as ''orthodoxy'' in most Christian contexts, since this was the viewpoint of previous Christian Church Fathers and was reaffirmed at these councils. (The minority of [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian Christians]] object to this terminology).

Following the 1054 [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], both the [[Western Christianity|Western]] Church and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] Church continued to consider themselves uniquely ''orthodox'' and [[catholic]]. [[Augustine]] wrote in On True Religion: “Religion is to be sought . . . only among those who are called Catholic or orthodox Christians, that is, guardians of truth and followers of right.” &lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|last1=Dulles S.J.|first1=Avery|editor1-last=Reno|editor1-first=R.R.|year=2012|title=The Orthodox Imperative: Selected Essays of Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J.|publisher=First Things Press|pages=224|edition=Kindle|url=https://www.amazon.com/Orthodox-Imperative-Selected-Essays-Cardinal-ebook/dp/B008R551PO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the Western Church gradually identified with the "Catholic" label, and people of Western Europe gradually associated the "Orthodox" label with the Eastern Church (in some languages the "Catholic" label is not necessarily identified with the Western Church). This was in note of the fact that both Catholic and Orthodox were in use as ecclesiastical adjectives as early as the 2nd and 4th centuries respectively. 

Much earlier, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] had split from [[Chalcedonian Christianity]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (AD 451), because of several [[christological]] differences.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|p=}} Since then, Oriental Orthodox Churches are maintaining the ''orthodox'' designation as a symbol of their theological traditions.{{sfn|Krikorian|2010|p=}}

===Hinduism===
{{Main article|Orthodox Hinduism}}
{{See also|Āstika and nāstika}}
Orthodox Hinduism commonly refers to the religious teachings and practices of [[Sanātanī]], one of the traditionalist branches of [[Hinduism]].

===Islam===
{{Main article|Sunni Islam}}
[[Sunni Islam]] is sometimes referred to as "orthodox Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Richard Thackrah|title=Dictionary of Terrorism|date=5 Sep 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16595-6|page=252|edition=2, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Nasir|editor1-first=Jamal J.|title=The Status of Women Under Islamic Law and Modern Islamic Legislation|date=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004172739|page=11|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George W.

John Burton. Published by Edinburgh University Press. 1996. p. 201. Cite: "Sunni: Of or pertaining ''sunna'', especially the ''Sunna'' of the Prophet. Used in conscious opposition to Shi'a, Shi'í. There being no ecclesia or centralized magisterium, the translation 'orthodox' is inappropriate. To the Muslim 'unorthodox' implies heretical, ''mubtadi'', from ''bid'a'', the contrary of ''sunna'', and so 'innovation'."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main article|Orthodox Judaism}}
Orthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of [[Judaism]], which seek to fully maintain the received Jewish beliefs and observances and which coalesced in opposition to the various challenges of [[modernity]] and [[secularization]]. [[Theology|Theologically]], it is chiefly defined by regarding the [[Torah]], both [[Written Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah|Oral]], as literally [[Revelation|revealed]] by God on [[biblical Mount Sinai]] and faithfully transmitted ever since. The movement advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law, or ''[[Halakha]]'', which is to be interpreted only according to received methods due to its divine character. Orthodoxy considers ''Halakha'' as eternal and beyond historical influence, being applied differently to changing circumstances but basically unchangeable in itself.

Orthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between [[Ultra-Orthodox]] or "[[Haredi]]", which is more conservative and reclusive, and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent streams. They are almost uniformly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism and rejecting all competing non-Orthodox interpretations as illegitimate. While adhering to traditional beliefs, the movement is a modern phenomenon.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It arose{{which|date=May 2018}} as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewish community since the 18th Century and was much shaped by a conscious struggle against rival alternatives.

===Kemeticism===
{{Main article|Kemetic Orthodoxy}}
Kemetic Orthodoxy is a [[Kemeticism|Kemetic]] denomination, which is a reform reconstruction of [[Egyptian polytheism]] for modern followers. It claims to derive a spiritual lineage from the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Kemetic Orthodoxy?: Introduction |url=http://www.kemet.org/about |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rodnovery===
{{Main article|Slavic Native Faith}}
There are organizations of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery) which characterize the religion as Orthodoxy (Russian: ''Pravoslavie''), and by other terms.

==Related concepts in religion==
Orthodoxy is opposed to ''[[heterodoxy]]'' ("other teaching") or ''[[heresy]]''. People who [[Deviationism|deviate]] from orthodoxy by professing a [[doctrine]] considered to be false are called heretics, while those who, perhaps without professing heretical beliefs, break from the perceived main body of believers are called [[schism (religion)|schismatics]]. The term employed sometimes depends on the aspect most in view: if one is addressing corporate unity, the emphasis may be on schism; if one is addressing doctrinal coherence, the emphasis may be on heresy. A deviation lighter than heresy is commonly called error, in the sense of not being grave enough to cause total estrangement, while yet seriously affecting communion. Sometimes error is also used to cover both full heresies and minor errors.

The concept of orthodoxy is prevalent in many forms of organized [[monotheism]]. However, orthodox belief is not usually overly emphasized in [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] or [[Animism|animist]] religions, in which there is often little or no concept of [[dogma]], and varied interpretations of doctrine and [[theology]] are tolerated and sometimes even encouraged within certain contexts. [[Syncretism]], for example, plays a much wider role in non-monotheistic (and particularly, non-scriptural) religion. The prevailing governing norm within polytheism is often [[orthopraxy]] ("right practice") rather than the "right belief" of orthodoxy.

==Non-religious contexts==
Outside the context of religion, the term "orthodoxy" is often used to refer to any commonly held belief or set of beliefs in some field, in particular when these tenets, possibly referred to as "[[dogma]]s", are being challenged. In this sense, the term has a mildly [[pejorative]] connotation.

Among various "orthodoxies" in distinctive fields, the most commonly used terms are: 
* Political orthodoxy
* Social orthodoxy
* Economic orthodoxy 
* Scientific orthodoxy 
* Artistic orthodoxy

The terms "orthodox" and "orthodoxy" are also used more broadly to refer to things other than ideas and beliefs. A new and unusual way of solving a problem could be referred to as "unorthodox", while a common and 'normal' way of solving a problem would be referred to as "orthodox".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4381">In [[professional wrestling]], a '''push''' is an attempt by the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] to make a wrestler win more matches and become more popular or more reviled with the fans depending on whether they are a heroic character ("[[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]") or a villain ("[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]"). It is not uncommon for a push to be accompanied by a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] or a change in the wrestler's [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]. Pushing is usually done for new wrestlers. This is essentially the opposite of a [[Burial (professional wrestling)|burial]] (or depush), which in contrast to the high profile of a push is typically done with little or no fanfare. Sometimes the fans generate the push for a wrestler themselves when their approval for the wrestler's work generates a positive reaction from them that is not anticipated.

A push can also be attributed to a political shift in the promotion's offices. [[Cowboy Bill Watts]], whose promotions always consisted of an [[African-American]] main event heroic character, began pushing [[Ron Simmons]], a midcarder, to main event status and eventually to the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] upon being put in charge of [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AOTLLXwEBXkC&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=%22Bill+Watts%22+WCW+%22black+wrestlers%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dEFcHNd6yT&amp;sig=fhF_3zT_-q0oePln6tCa-tu8Zmc&amp;hl=ja&amp;ei=r40lS5XCH5aXkQXY2-GnAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Books Excerpt: The Cowboy and the Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; In WWE, following the fallout from the Signature Pharmacy Scandal, smaller and less muscular wrestlers such as [[CM Punk]] and [[Jeff Hardy]] began to get pushed and [[Vince McMahon]] confirmed the [[paradigm shift]] by mentioning that today's fans are drawn by charisma and not size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlescoop.com/2009/09/30/vince-mcmahon-speaks-on-todays-wwe-superstars-cm-punk-and-warlord/ Vince McMahon Speaks on Today’s WWE Superstars, CM Punk and Warlord ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a wrestler that bookers are high on and are pushed to excess and/or against the wishes of the fans, resulting into a negative reception. Some examples include:
* In the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] territory, a legendary promoter, [[Nick Gulas]], began to push his son George to a main event spot despite having little in-ring experience and no athletic background. The fans quickly turned on him and the promotion, but Nick Gulas continued to push him despite the negative backlash and financial losses. In the end, Nick's insistence on keeping his son at the top of the card led to a hostile split of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/wrestling/49.html Kentucky Fried Rasslin'] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120912033542/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/wrestling/49.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the defunct WCW promotion, a group of new and younger wrestlers known as [[The Natural Born Thrillers]] enjoyed a long and steady push and winning titles despite getting no crowd response and repeatedly going over established talent.
* In WWE, when the company was being built around fan favorite [[John Cena]], who had begun to shed his edgy, freestyle [[Hip-hop|rapping]] anti-establishment persona which was popular in favor of a more motivational "against all odds" one, was met with a negative reaction by the fans to the point where he became one of the most booed wrestlers in the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/cena.html SLAM! Sports: John Cena Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman Reigns]] is currently going through this with a vast majority booing him and cheering [[Triple H]] and [[Seth Rollins]] during their feuds, despite the latter two being booked as villains.
{{see also|Persona and reception of Roman Reigns}}

Pushing and burying wrestlers can be seen as a [[Work (professional wrestling)|worked]] version of the [[promotion and relegation]] system in team sports outside North America.

[[Image:Parker Quink Bottle.jpg|thumb|Parker Quink Bottle with SOLV-X notation]]
'''Quink''' (a [[portmanteau word]] from 'quick' and 'ink') is a [[fountain pen ink]] developed by the [[Parker Pen Company]]. It was introduced in 1931 and has remained in production ever since.

==Background==
In 1928, under the direction of Kenneth Parker, the Parker Pen Company set out to develop a new and improved fountain pen ink. Inferior inks had long been the main cause of clogged fountain pens, yet popular ink formulations had remained unchanged in decades. Research for the project was initially outsourced to Miner Laboratories of Chicago. In August 1930 one of the lead chemists, Galen Sayler, was hired directly and put to work in a small laboratory at company headquarters in [[Janesville, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, David Shepherd, Dan Zazove. "Parker Vacumatic". Surrenden Pens Ltd., Brighton, UK, 2008, pp. 246-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Quink was heavily advertised, and an immediate success. According to Kenneth Parker's personal journal, Quink production began on March 17, 1931, and $89,000 worth had been shipped by October 22 -- more than twice the company's expectations and an excellent return on the $68,000 spent on its development.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, David Shepherd, Dan Zazove. "Parker Vacumatic". Surrenden Pens Ltd., Brighton, UK, 2008, pp. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt; Quink was introduced as a general-purpose ink, safe for use in all fountain pens. It remains in production to the present day, with minor changes in formulation. 

=== Francisco Quisumbing ===
A popular misconception is that the ink was invented by a Filipino, Francisco Quisumbing, and takes its name from 'Quisumbing Ink'. Although this apocryphal tale appears on numerous websites, no [[WP:RS|reliable source]] is ever cited. The accounts uniformly identify the supposed inventor as 
[[Francisco Quisumbing]], a Filipino botanist who studied in both the [[Philippines]] and the US, gaining a PhD in Plant Taxonomy, Systematics and Morphology  from the University of Chicago in 1923. What biographical information that can be found is incomplete and unreliable. There is no indication that such a person ever worked for Parker. 

There was in fact a company called Quisumbing Ink Products in the Philippines, unconnected to Parker, founded by a chemical engineer named Francisco A. Quisumbing. The milestones of Quisumbing's documented career are close enough to those recounted in the apocryphal accounts noted above that it is probable that all refer, with sharply differing degrees of accuracy, to the same man. The real Francisco A. Quisumbing was born in 1893 and received his B. Agr. in 1914 and his M. S. in 1918, both from the University of the Philippines. He was a Fellow of the University of the Philippines at Columbia University in New York from 1918 to 1921, receiving his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1921. He returned to the Philippines to teach as Professor of Industrial Chemistry at the University of the Philippines from 1922 to 1934. In 1923, he started the Quisumbing Ink Products company, and in 1934, founded the Quisumbing School of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;"Who's Who in the Philippines". Volume 1, 1937, pp. 128-9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a book published in 1960, Quisumbing inks then enjoyed an exclusive contract to supply all branches of the Philippine government.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Versoza. "Forensic Chemistry of Ink in Documentary Investigation". 1960, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;


Note that Quink was later manufactured in the Philippines under license from Parker, and the bottles were labelled accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Features==
[[Image:Quink Blot.jpg|thumb|left|Quink Blot on damp paper]]
The success of Quink lay in its useful features: it had the desired quality of ink flow, it resisted water and moulding, it was non-corrosive, and it was claimed to be quick-drying. From the beginning it was advertised as containing a secret additive which purportedly dissolved sediment and reduced clogging. In 1942 this additive was given the trademarked name "Solv-X".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A. Veley. "American Writing Instrument Trademarks 1870-1953". Walsworth, 2017, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; 

Quink was developed and introduced when the 
[[Duofold]] was Parker's flagship line,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Parker Duofold
  |author=David Nishimura
  |url=http://www.vintagepens.com/Parker_Duofold.shtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Duofold's successor, the [[Parker Vacumatic|Vacumatic]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Parker Vacumatic
  |author=David Nishimura
  |url=http://www.vintagepens.com/Parker_Vacumatics.shtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was already under development and was in full production by 1933. Vacumatics held their ink supply directly within their celluloid barrels, so Quink was formulated accordingly.

Quink is not to be confused with two iterations of a special ink formulated exclusively for use in the [[Parker 51]]. This ink was highly alkaline and while water-based, also included a substantial amount of isopropyl alcohol. It was released in 1941 as "51" ink, along with the Parker 51 pen; in 1947 it was made somewhat less corrosive, and renamed "Superchrome". Parker was careful to print prominent warnings on caps, labels, and boxes that the ink could only be used in the 51 (and, later, its economy version, the 21), and would damage any other pen.

Prior to the full public introduction of the Parker 51 in 1941, selected market testing of the new pen was carried out, starting in 1939. Since the 51 and its special ink had been designed together as a complete system, the new ink was given limited release in tandem with the market tests under the name "Double Quink". By all evidence, Double Quink was not advertised to the general public, and the name was dropped once the 51 went on general sale. Actual surviving examples of Double Quink bottles would appear to be vanishingly rare: not a single photo appears in the Shepherds' authoritative and officially-sponsored Parker 51 monograph, despite the researchers' access to Parker's own archives as well as collections worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;David and Mark Shepherd.

According to fountain pen enthusiasts, Parker Quink is generally considered to be "safe fountain pen ink";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Few Thoughts On Fountain Pen Inks |url=http://www.pendemonium.com/ink_facts.htm |work=Pendemonium |publisher=Pendemonium |accessdate=9 June 2012 |author=Pendemonium |year=1995–2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621233051/http://www.pendemonium.com/ink_facts.htm |archivedate=June 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this means that it should not stain or clog fountain pens very easily.

The use of fountain pens gradually decreased during the second half of the 20th century. Many collectors and enthusiasts continue to use the Parker 51 pen in the 21st century, with a limited edition of the model (available in two colors, "Vista Blue" and black) released by Parker in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker|url=http://www.parker51.com/gpage1.html2.html|work=The Parker "51" Website|publisher=Ernesto M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10885">'''Relevance''' is the concept of one topic being [[Premise|connected]] to another topic in a way that makes it useful   to consider the second topic when considering the first. The concept of relevance is studied in many different fields, including cognitive sciences, logic, and [[library and information science]]. Most fundamentally, however, it is studied in [[epistemology]] (the theory of knowledge). Different theories of knowledge have different implications for what is considered relevant and these fundamental views have implications for all other fields as well.

==Definition==
"Something (A) is relevant to a task (T) if it increases the likelihood of accomplishing the goal (G), which is implied by T." (Hjørland &amp; Sejer Christensen,2002).&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. &amp; Sejer Christensen, F. (2002). Work tasks and socio-cognitive relevance: a specific example. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 53(11), 960-965.&lt;/ref&gt;

A thing might be relevant, a document or a piece of information may be relevant. The basic understanding of relevance does not depend on whether we speak of "things" or "information". For example, the Gandhian principles are of great relevance in today's world.

== Epistemology ==
If you believe that [[schizophrenia]] is caused by bad communication between mother and child, then family interaction studies become relevant. If, on the other hand, you subscribe to a genetic theory of relevance then the study of genes becomes relevant. If you subscribe to the epistemology of empiricism, then only intersubjectively controlled observations are relevant. If, on the other hand, you subscribe to [[feminist epistemology]], then the sex of the observer becomes relevant.

Epistemology is not just one domain among others. Epistemological views are always at play in any domain. Those views determine or influence what is regarded relevant.

==Relevance logic==
[[File:Relevance.jpg|thumb|Graphic of relevance in [[digital ecosystem]]s]]

In formal reasoning, relevance has proved an important but elusive concept. It is important because the solution of any problem requires the prior identification of the relevant elements from which a solution can be constructed. It is elusive, because the meaning of relevance appears to be difficult or impossible to capture within conventional [[logical system]]s. The obvious suggestion that q is relevant to p if q is implied by p breaks down because under standard definitions of [[material conditional|material implication]], a false proposition implies all other propositions. However though 'iron is a metal' may be implied by 'cats lay eggs' it doesn't seem to be relevant to it the way in which 'cats are mammals' and 'mammals give birth to living young' are relevant to each other. If one states "I love ice cream," and another person responds "I have a friend named Brad Cook," then these statements are not relevant. However, if one states "I love ice cream," and another person responds "I have a friend named Brad Cook who also likes ice cream," this statement now becomes relevant because it relates to the first person's idea.

More recently a number of theorists{{who|date=December 2011}} have sought to account for relevance in terms of "[[possible world]] logics" in [[intensional logic]]. Roughly, the idea is that [[logical truth|necessary truth]]s are true in all possible worlds, [[contradiction]]s (logical falsehoods) are true in no possible worlds, and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] propositions can be ordered in terms of the number of possible worlds in which they are true. Relevance is argued to depend upon the "remoteness relationship" between an actual world in which relevance is being evaluated and the set of possible worlds within which it is true.

== Application ==

=== Politics ===
During the 1960s, ''relevance'' became a fashionable [[buzzword]], meaning roughly 'relevance to social concerns', such as [[racial equality]], [[poverty]], [[social justice]], [[famine|world hunger]], world [[economic development]], and so on. The implication was that some subjects, e.g., the study of [[medieval poetry]] and the practice of [[corporate law]], were not worthwhile because they did not address pressing [[social issues]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Economics ===

The [[economist]] [[John Maynard Keynes]] saw the importance of defining relevance to the problem of calculating risk in economic decision-making. He suggested that the relevance of a piece of evidence, such as a true proposition, should be defined in terms of the changes it produces of estimations of the probability of future events. Specifically, Keynes proposed that new evidence &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; is irrelevant to a proposition &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, given old evidence &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt;, if and only if &lt;math&gt; \frac{x}{pq}&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;= \frac{x}{q}  &lt;/math&gt;, otherwise, the proposition is relevant.

There are technical problems with this definition, for example, the relevance of a piece of evidence can be sensitive to the order in which other pieces of evidence are received.

=== Cognitive science and pragmatics ===
{{further|Relevance theory}}

In 1986, [[Dan Sperber]] and Deirdre Wilson drew attention to the central importance of relevance decisions in reasoning and communication. They proposed an account of the process of inferring relevant information from any given utterance. To do this work, they used what they called the "Principle of Relevance": namely, the position that ''any utterance addressed to someone automatically conveys the presumption of its own optimal relevance''. The central idea of Sperber and Wilson's theory is that all utterances are encountered in some context, and the correct interpretation of a particular utterance is the one that allows most new implications to be made in that context on the basis of the least amount of information necessary to convey it. For Sperber and Wilson, relevance is conceived as relative or subjective, as it depends upon the state of knowledge of a hearer when they encounter an utterance.

Sperber and Wilson stress that this theory is not intended to account for every intuitive application of the English word "relevance". Relevance, as a technical term, is restricted to relationships between utterances and interpretations, and so the theory cannot account for intuitions such as the one that relevance relationships obtain in problems involving physical objects. If a plumber needs to fix a leaky faucet, for example, some objects and tools are relevant (i.e. a wrench) and others are not (i.e. a waffle iron). And, moreover, the latter seems to be irrelevant in a manner which does not depend upon the plumber's knowledge, or the utterances used to describe the problem.

A theory of relevance that seems to be more readily applicable to such instances of physical problem solving has been suggested by Gorayska and Lindsay in a series of articles published during the 1990s. The key feature of their theory is the idea that relevance is goal-dependent. An item (e.g., an utterance or object) is relevant to a goal if and only if it can be an essential element of some plan capable of achieving the desired goal. This theory embraces both propositional reasoning and the problem-solving activities of people such as plumbers, and defines relevance in such a way that what is relevant is determined by the real world (because what plans will work is a matter of empirical fact) rather than the state of knowledge or belief of a particular problem solver.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Relevance (law)}}
The meaning of "relevance" in U.S. law is reflected in Rule 401 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]. That rule defines relevance as "having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determinations of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." In other words, if a fact were to have no bearing on the truth or falsity of a conclusion, it would be legally irrelevant.

=== Library and information science ===
{{Main|Relevance (information retrieval)}}
{{Recommender systems}}
This field has considered when documents (or document representations) retrieved from databases are relevant or non-relevant. Given a conception of relevance, two measures have been applied: [[Precision and recall]]:

Recall = a : (a + c) X 100%, where
a = number of retrieved, relevant documents,
c = number of non-retrieved, relevant documents (sometimes termed "silence").
Recall is thus an expression of how exhaustive a search for documents is.

Precision = a : (a + b) X 100%, where 
a = number of retrieved, relevant documents,
b = number of retrieved, non-relevant documents (often termed "noise").

Precision is thus a measure of the amount of noise in document-retrieval.

Relevance itself has in the literature often been based on what is termed "the system's view" and "the user's view". Hjørland (2010) criticize these two views and defends a "subject knowledge view of relevance".

'''Richard Carew''' (17 July 1555 – 6 November 1620) was a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[translator]] and [[antiquary]]. He is best known for his [[English county histories|county history]], ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602).

==Life==
Carew belonged to a prominent gentry family, and was the eldest son of [[Thomas Carew (MP for Saltash)|Thomas Carew]]: he was born on 17 July 1555 at [[Antony, Cornwall|East Antony]], Cornwall. He was educated at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he was a contemporary of Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and [[William Camden]], and then at the [[Middle Temple]]. He made a translation of the first five [[canto]]s of [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' (1594), which was more correct than that of [[Edward Fairfax]]. He also translated [[Juan Huarte de San Juan|Juan de la Huarte]]'s ''Examen de Ingenios'', basing his translation on [[Camillo Camilli (d. 1615)|Camillo Camilli]]'s Italian version.{{sfn|Courtney|1887}} (This book is the first systematic attempt to relate physiology with psychology, though based on the medicine of Galen. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}})

Carew was a member of the [[College of Antiquaries|Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries]], and is particularly known for his ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602), the second [[English county histories|English county history]] to appear in print. Later editions were published in 1723, 1769 and 1811, and [[Davies Gilbert]] published an index in his ''Cornwall'', vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;381–92. He also published an ''[[Epistle concerning the Excellencies of the English Tongue]]'' (1605).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Carew served as [[High Sheriff of Cornwall]] (1583 and 1586), and as MP for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] in 1584. He was married to Juliana Arundell, the eldest daughter of [[John Arundell (of Trerice, died 1580)|Sir John Arundell of Trerice]]; their son [[Sir Richard Carew, 1st Baronet|Richard Carew]] was created a baronet in 1641 (see [[Carew baronets]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard CAREW|url=http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RichardCarew.htm|publisher=Tudor Place|accessdate=1 July 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|self published website; and Jorge H. Castelli is not an expert|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carew died on 6 November 1620 and was buried in Antony church on 7 November.{{sfn|Carew|Halliday|1969|pp=68-69}}

'''Saṃsāra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|m|ˈ|s|ɑr|ə}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "wandering" or "world", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change.{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It also refers to the concept of rebirth and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence", a fundamental assumption of all [[Indian religions]], in short, it is the cycle of death and rebirth.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"/&gt; ''Saṃsāra'' is sometimes referred to with terms or phrases such as transmigration, karmic cycle, [[reincarnation]], and "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence".{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;

The concept of ''Saṃsāra'' has roots in the [[Vedas|Vedic literature]], but the theory is not discussed there. It appears in developed form, but without mechanistic details, in the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=amboyer/&gt;{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}} The full exposition of the ''Saṃsāra'' doctrine is found in [[Sramana|Sramanic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], as well as various schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] after about the mid-1st millennium BCE.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p17"/&gt; The ''Saṃsāra'' doctrine is tied to the [[Karma]] theory of Indian religions, and the liberation from ''Saṃsāra'' has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions, as well as their internal disagreements.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126-128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272-273}} The liberation from ''Saṃsāra'' is called [[Moksha]], [[Nirvana]], Mukti or Kaivalya.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;{{Sfn|Michael Myers|2013|p=36}}{{Sfn|Harold Coward|2008|p=103}}

==Etymology and terminology==
''Saṃsāra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: संसार) means "wandering",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{Sfn| Lochtefeld|2002|p=589}} as well as "world" wherein the term connotes "cyclic change".{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}} ''Saṃsāra'' is a fundamental concept in all [[Indian religions]], is linked to the [[karma]] theory, and refers to the belief that all living beings cyclically go through births and rebirths. The term is related to phrases such as "the cycle of successive existence", "transmigration", "karmic cycle", "the wheel of life", and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence".{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M.

According to Monier-Williams, ''Saṃsāra'' is rooted in the term ''Saṃsṛ'' (संसृ), which means "to go round, revolve, pass through a succession of states, to go towards or obtain, moving in a circuit".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1040|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=1040–1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conceptual form from this root appears in ancient texts as ''Saṃsaraṇa'', which means "going around through a succession of states, birth, rebirth of living beings and the world", without obstruction.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt; The term shortens to ''Saṃsāra'', referring to the same concept, as a "passage through successive states of mundane existence", a transmigration, metempsychosis, a circuit of living where one repeats previous states, from one body to another, a worldly life of constant change, that is rebirth, growth, decay and redeath.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p268"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0|pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is then contrasted with the concept of [[moksha]], also known as ''mukti'', ''nirvana'', ''nibbana'' or ''kaivalya'', which refers to liberation from this cycle of aimless wandering.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirley Firth |title=Dying, Death and Bereavement in a British Hindu Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYNXC-HK1u0C |year=1997|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-6831-976-7|pages=106, 29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;

The concept of Samsara developed in the [[Vedas|Vedic]] times, and is traceable in the [[Samhita]] layers such as in sections 1.164, 4.55, 6.70 and 10.14 of the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name="amboyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=valleepoussin24&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis de La Vallée-Poussin | authorlink=Louis de La Vallée-Poussin|title=The way to Nirvana: six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ito8AAAAIAAJ|year=1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p11"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=11–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the idea is mentioned in the [[Samhita]] layers of the Vedas, there is lack of clear exposition there, and the idea fully develops in the early [[Upanishads]].{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2010|p=344, 356-357}} Damien Keown states that the notion of "cyclic birth and death" appears around 800 BCE.{{Sfn|Damien Keown|2004|p=248}} The word ''Saṃsāra'' appears, along with [[Moksha]], in several [[Principal Upanishads]] such as in verse 1.3.7 of the [[Katha Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कठोपनिषदत्/प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली Katha Upanishad प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; verse 6.16 of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषत्/षष्ठः_अध्यायः Shvetashvatara Upanishad षष्ठः अध्यायः] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; verses 1.4 and 6.34 of the [[Maitri Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/मैत्रायण्युपनिषत् Maitri Upanishad] Wikisource, Quote: ३ चित्तमेव हि '''संसारम्''' तत्प्रयत्नेन शोधयेत्&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GA Jacob (1963), [https://archive.org/stream/UpanishadVakyaKosha-AConcordanceOfThePrincipalUpanishadsAndBhagavad/UpanishadVakyaKoshaSktEng#page/n953/mode/2up A concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita], Motilal Banarsidass, pages 947-948&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Samsara'' is related to ''Saṃsṛti'', the latter referring to the "course of mundane existence, transmigration, flow, circuit or stream".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;

==Definition and rationale==
The word literally means "wandering through, flowing on", states Stephen J. Laumakis, in the sense of "aimless and directionless wandering".{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=97}} The concept of ''Saṃsāra'' is closely associated with the belief that the person continues to be born and reborn in various realms and forms.&lt;ref name="GoaEtCoward2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/hinduism/|title=Hinduism|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2015-07-31|archivedate=2014-02-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227223922/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/hinduism/|deadurl=no|date=2014-08-21|first1=David J.|last1=Goa|first2=Harold G.|last2=Coward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hastings|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=Louis Herbert Gray|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ |year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for god [[Yama]] to judge and reward people with varying degrees of virtue or vices, in "either or" and disproportionate manner.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P.

==History==
The historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated [[reincarnation]] are obscure but the idea appears in texts of both India and ancient Greece during the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C.

Laumakis|2008|p=90}} It is in the early Upanishads where these ideas are more fully developed, but there too the discussion does not provide specific mechanistic details.{{sfn|Stephen J.

Some scholars state that the ''Samsara'' doctrine may have originated from the [[Sramana]] traditions and was then adopted by the Brahmanical traditions (Hinduism).&lt;ref name=floodaithp86&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 86, '''Quote''': “The origin and doctrine of Karma and Samsara are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahmanical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions. Yet, on the other hand, although there is no clear doctrine of transmigration in the vedic hymns, there is the idea of redeath, that a person having died in this world, might die yet again in the next.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S. Jaini 2001 “Collected Paper on Buddhist Studies” Motilal Banarsidass,  {{ISBN|81-208-1776-1}}, page 51, '''Quote''': "Yajnavalkya’s reluctance to discuss the doctrine of karma in public (...) can perhaps be explained by the assumption that it was, like that of the transmigration of soul, of non-brahmanical origin. In view of the fact that this doctrine is emblazoned on almost every page of sramana scriptures, it is highly probable that it was derived from them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govind Chandra Pande, (1994) Life and Thought of Sankaracarya, Motilal Banarsidass {{ISBN|81-208-1104-6}}, page 135, '''Quote''': (...) They [[Sramanas]] could have been connected with the Harappan Civilization which is itself enigmatic. It seems that some Upanishad thinkers like Yajnavalkya were acquainted with this kind [sramanic] thinking (...) and tried to incorporate these ideas of Karma, Samsara and Moksa into the traditional Vedic thought.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for who influenced whom in the ancient times, is slim and speculative, and the odds are the historic development of the Samsara theories likely happened in parallel with mutual influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0 |pages=xvii–xviii }}; '''Quote''': "There was such constant interaction between Vedism and Buddhism in the early period that it is fruitless to attempt to sort out the earlier source of many doctrines, they lived in one another's pockets, like Picasso and Braque (who were, in later years, unable to say which of them had painted certain paintings from their earlier, shared period)."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punarmrityu: redeath ===
While ''Saṃsāra'' is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation of living beings, the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once. This led first to the concepts of ''Punarmṛtyu'' ("redeath") and ''Punaravṛtti'' ("return").&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p268"/&gt;{{Sfn|Buitenen|1957|pp=34-35}}{{Sfn|Mircea Eliade|1987|pp=56-57}} These early theories asserted that the nature of human existence involves two realities, one unchanging absolute [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) which is somehow connected to the ultimate unchanging immortal reality and bliss called [[Brahman]],{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|p=18}}{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84-85}} and that the rest is the always-changing subject (body) in a phenomenal world ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]).{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=18-19, 24-25}}{{Sfn|Harold Coward|2012|pp=29-31}}{{Sfn|John Geeverghese Arapura|1986|pp=85-88}} Redeath, in the Vedic theosophical speculations, reflected the end of "blissful years spent in ''svarga'' or heaven", and it was followed by rebirth back in the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name="EllwoodAlles2007p406"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert S.

Rebirth as a human being, states John Bowker, was then presented as a "rare opportunity to break the sequence of rebirth, thus attaining Moksha, release".{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84-85}} Each Indian spiritual tradition developed its own assumptions and paths (''marga'' or ''yoga'') for this spiritual release,{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84-85}} with some developing the ideas of ''[[Jivanmukti]]'' (liberation and freedom in this life),&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

The dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert the individual human soul and Brahman (Vishnu, Krishna) are two different realities, loving devotion to Vishnu is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of Vishnu which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

=={{IAST| Saṃsāra}} in Jainism==
{{main article|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Saṃsāra.jpg|thumb|Symbolic depiction of Saṃsāra at Shri Mahaveerji temple of Jainism.]]
In [[Jainism]], the ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma doctrine are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on karma and ''Saṃsāra'' from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217-236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; ''Saṃsāra'' in Jainism represents the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226-228}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 14–16, 102–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (''jiva'') is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions, but not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state, some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain [[moksha]] (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-''Saṃsāra'' cycle, and does not subscribe to [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] style [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or [[Madhyamaka|Advaya]] style nondualism of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"/&gt;

The Jaina theosophy, like ancient [[Ajivika]], but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=228}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S. Jaini|title=Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPggiM7y1aYC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1691-6|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"/&gt;

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-656-7|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harveyp182&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Harvey |title=Religions in Focus: New Approaches to Tradition and Contemporary Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrTsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-93690-8|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from ''Saṃsāra''.&lt;ref name=harveyp182/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul's {{IAST|Saṃsāra}}.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen&gt;[[Lambert Schmithausen]] (1991), Buddhism and Nature, Studia Philologica Buddhica, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, Tokyo Japan, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece (1999), Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1990), Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition, in ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4612-4458-5}}, pages 168-177;&lt;br&gt;L Alsdorf (1962), Beiträge zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung in Indien, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, F.

Samsara is considered impermanent in Buddhism, just like other Indian religions. Karma drives this impermanent Samsara in Buddhist thought, states Paul Williams, and "short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma; This endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is ''Saṃsāra''".{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}} The [[Four Noble Truths]], accepted by all Buddhist traditions, are aimed at ending this Samsara-related re-becoming (rebirth) and associated cycles of suffering.{{sfn|Paul Williams|Anthony Tribe|Alexander Wynne|2012|pp=30–42}}{{sfn|Robert Buswell Jr. |Donald Lopez Jr. |2013|pp=304-305}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M.

Like Jainism, Buddhism developed its own Samsara theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath.&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title= Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=62–63 }}; '''Quote:''' "Buddhist doctrine holds that until they realize nirvana, beings are bound to undergo rebirth and redeath due to their having acted out of ignorance and desire, thereby producing the seeds of karma".&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1992|pp=xi-xii, 5-16}} In early Buddhist traditions, ''Saṃsāra'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''niraya''), hungry ghosts (''pretas''), animals (''tiryak''), humans (''manushya''), and gods (''devas'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (''asuras'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms" respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;

The Saṃsāra concept, in Buddhism, envisions that these six realms are interconnected, and everyone cycles life after life, and death is just a state for an afterlife, through these realms, because of a combination of ignorance, desires and purposeful [[karma]], or ethical and unethical actions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt; Nirvana is typically described as the freedom from rebirth and the only alternative to suffering of ''Samsara'', in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Collins2010p38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl B.

Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi |title=Sikhism and Christianity: A Comparative Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8KMCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-1-349-23049-5 |pages= 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title= Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, there are important differences between the ''Saṅsāra'' concept in Sikhism from the ''Saṃsāra'' concept in many traditions within Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The difference is that Sikhism firmly believes in the grace of God as the means to salvation, and its precepts encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (salvation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. S. Singha |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C |year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1 |pages=68, 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhism, like the three ancient Indian traditions, believes that body is perishable, there is a cycle of rebirth, and that there is suffering with each cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E. Fenech |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7YwNAwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-100411-7|pages=231, 607}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features of Sikhism, along with its belief in Saṃsāra and the grace of God, is similar to some bhakti-oriented sub-traditions within Hinduism such as those found in [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Thrower |title= Religion: The Classical Theories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luQnAAAAYAAJ|year=1999|publisher= Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-0-87840-751-4 |pages=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Rather, it cherishes social engagement and householder's life combined with devotion to the One God as Guru, to be the path of liberation from ''Saṅsāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

== Early life==

Shamik Ghosh was born in Kolkata, West Bengal India to University Professor father Alok Kumar Ghosh and mother Dipika Ghosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghosh|first1=Shamik|title=Elvis O Amolasundari|publisher=Sopan|isbn=9789382433750}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved from Jessore of present day Bangladesh during the Partition of India. Shamik spent his early childhood in a mixed locality surrounded by slums and befriended slum children. He studied in one of the best schools of Kolkata, [[South Point High School (India)|South Point High School]] and as such was exposed to people from varied sections of the society from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview|url=http://www.galpopath.com/2017/10/blog-post_41.html|website=Galpopath.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shamik did his undergraduate studies in Physics from Calcutta University. He was involved in politics in his university days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh|first1=Shamik|title=Jani Chhai Likhi. Tobu Likhi. Besh Kori Likhi|journal=Kotha Sopan|date=September 2017|issue=Sharadiya 1422|pages=132-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His debut short story Ghola was published in prestigious Bengali Literary Magazine ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'' at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghosh|first1=Shamik|title=Elvis O Amolasundari|publisher=Sopan|isbn=9789382433750}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

After graduation, Shamik joined a Private Sector Bank in Kolkata. After a small stint he moved and joined another PSU Bank and was posted in Ahmedabad and then went to Mumbai in the Corporate Strategy and Communication Department of the same Bank. As a Corporate Communication professional he had access to the upper reaches of Mumbai and yet, the trains he traveled on, journeyed through some of the poorest urban areas of India. He decided to take up writing once again. His second short story, a decade after the first, got published in a Bengali daily.In 2014, Shamik left his job and returned to Kolkata to concentrate on writing and film-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gateway Litfest|url=http://gatewaylitfest.com/shamk-ghosh/|website=Gateway Litfest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style==
The writing of Shamik Ghosh is characterized by short sentences, vividly visual description and continuous changes of time and space. Some argue that he delves into postmodern fiction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarkar|first1=Sarbajit|title=Truffaut er Lekha Bangla Golpo|url=https://abahamanfourthissue.blogspot.in/2018/03/blog-post_60.html|website=Abahaman|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He himself says that he doesn't believe in the normal interpretation of reality and wants to bend reality to reveal unseen elements of our own hidden self. He speaks about loners in the society, each unique with a distinct marginality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elvis O Amolasundari|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32194871|website=https://www.goodreads.com/|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''speech disfluency''', also spelled '''speech dysfluency''', is any of various breaks, irregularities (within the [[English language]], similar speech dysfluency occurs in different forms in other languages), or [[vocables|non-lexical vocables]] that occurs within the flow of otherwise fluent speech. These include ''false starts'', i.e. words and sentences that are cut off mid-utterance; phrases that are restarted or repeated and repeated syllables; [[Filler (linguistics)|''fillers'']], i.e. grunts or non-lexical utterances such as "[[Speech_disfluency#%22Huh%22_%E2%80%94_the_universal_syllable|huh]]", "uh", "erm", "um", "well", "so", "like", and "[[Speech_disfluency#%22Hmm%22|hmm]]"; and ''repaired'' utterances, i.e. instances of speakers correcting their own slips of the tongue or mispronunciations (before anyone else gets a chance to).  "[[Speech_disfluency#%22Huh%22_%E2%80%94_the_universal_syllable|Huh]]" is claimed to be a [[Psychological nativism|universal syllable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dingemanse|first1=Mark|last2=Torreira|first2=Francisco|last3=Enfield|first3=N.

== Fillers ==
{{main|Filler (linguistics)}}
[[Filler (linguistics)|Fillers]] are parts of speech which are not generally recognized as purposeful or containing formal meaning, usually expressed as pauses such as ''uh'', ''like'' and ''er'', but also extending to [[conversation analysis#Repair|repairs]] ("He was wearing a black&amp;mdash;uh, I mean a blue, a blue shirt"), and articulation problems such as [[stuttering]].  Use is normally frowned upon in [[mass media]] such as [[news]] reports or [[film]]s, but they occur regularly in everyday conversation, sometimes representing upwards of 20% of "words" in conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox Tree|first1=J. E.|title=The effects of false starts and repetitions on the processing of subsequent words in spontaneous speech|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=1995|volume=34|issue=6|pages=709–738|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0749596X85710327/1-s2.0-S0749596X85710327-main.pdf?_tid=993fd862-4f34-11e4-8902-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1412804985_f1c8628d2fcd1970a2d9fd3e1e736008|doi=10.1006/jmla.1995.1032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fillers can also be used as a pause for thought ("I arrived at, um&amp;mdash;3 o'clock").

== Language-dependence ==

Research in computational linguistics has revealed a correlation between native language and patterns of disfluencies in spontaneously uttered speech.&lt;ref name="Lamel Adda-Deckes 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamel| first1=L.|last2=Adda-Deckes|first2=M.| last3=Gauvain| first3=J.L.| last4=Adda|first4=G.|title=Spoken language processing in a multilingual context| volume=4| year=1996|pages=2203–2206| doi=10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607242| journal=Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing. ICSLP ''96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this research, there are other subjective accounts reported by individuals. According to one commentator,{{who|date=January 2014}} [[United States of America|Americans]] use pauses such as "um" or "em," the [[United Kingdom|British]] say "uh" or "eh", the [[France|French]] use "euh", the [[German language|Germans]] say "äh" (pronounced eh or er), the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] use "eh", [[Japanese language|Japanese]] use "ā", "anō" or "ēto", and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers say "ehhh" (also used in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), "como" (normally meaning 'like'), and, in Latin America but not Spain, "este" (normally meaning 'this'). Besides "er" and "uh", the Portuguese use "hã" or "é". In [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], "那个(nà gè)" and "这个(zhè ge)" are used, meaning "that" or "this", respectively. In [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], speakers vocalize an "ovaj", "onaj" or "to jest" ('this', 'that' and 'that is'.)  Arabic speakers say "يعني", the pronunciation of which is close to "yaa'ni", {{IPA-ar|jæʕni|}} or {{IPA|[jaʕni]}}, (literally, "he means", there being no grammatically gender-neutral third person) and in Turkish, they say "şey" in addition to "yani" (without the {{IPAblink|ʕ}} found in Arabic) and "ııı".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} A more complete list can be found on the [[Filler (linguistics)|fillers]] article.

== Research ==

Recent [[linguistics|linguistic]] research has suggested that non-pathological disfluencies may contain a variety of meaning; the frequency of "uh" and "um" in English is often reflective of a speaker's alertness or emotional state. Some have hypothesized that the time of an "uh" or "um" is used for the planning of future words; other researchers have suggested that they are actually to be understood as full-fledged [[function words]] rather than accidents, indicating a delay of variable time in which the speaker wishes to pause without voluntarily yielding control of the dialogue. There is some debate as to whether to consider them a form of noise or as a meaning-filled part of [[language]].

Speech disfluencies have also become important in recent years with the advent of [[speech-to-text]] programs and other attempts at enabling [[computer]]s to make sense of human speech.

=="Hmm"==
'''Hmm''' is an exclamation (an emphatic [[interjection]]) typically used to express reflection, [[uncertainty]],  [[thoughtful]] absorption, or hesitation.&lt;ref&gt;Online Dictionary Definitions of "hmm"
*[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hmm]
*[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/morning Cambridge Dictionary]
*[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hmm]
*[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hmm]&lt;/ref&gt; Hmm is technically categorized as an [[interjection]], like um, [[Speech_disfluency#%22Huh%22_%E2%80%94_the_universal_syllable|huh]], [[Interjection|ouch]], erm, and wow. The first h-sound is a mimic for breathing in, and the second m-sound, since the mouth is closed, is representing that the person is not currently sure what to say ("erm" and "um" are used similarly). The pause filler indicates that the person is temporarily speechless, but still engaged in thought. The variety of tones, pitches, and lengths used add nuances in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livescience.com/20861-origin-hmm-thinking.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twemoji2 1f914.svg|thumb|A "hmm" [[emoji]]]]

===Etymology===
The expression is used in many different languages, however the origin of 'hmm' is difficult to find, mainly because 'the word is so natural that it may have arisen at any time' as highlighted by [[linguist]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] and an expert on word origins, [[Anatoly Liberman]]. It is possible the [[Neanderthals]] might have used 'hmm'. [[Nicholas Christenfeld]], a [[psychologist]] at the [[University of California]], San Diego, and an expert on filled pauses, attests hmm is popular largely since it's such a neutral sound and that "it's easier to say than anything else". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.livescience.com/20861-origin-hmm-thinking.html&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attestations of 'hmm' are from [[Shakespeare]], 'I cried hum... But markt him not a word' (1598 [[Shakespeare]] Henry IV, Pt. 1 iii. i. 154). It may be a [[vocable]] that grew out of [[lexicalized]] throat-clearing.&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of "hmm"
*[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hmm]
*[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/429332/the-origin-of-hmm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as a filler word===
'Hmm' is a "filler" word, such as '[[:wikt:um|um]]' and '[[:wikt:er|er]]'. Use of 'hmm' for "filled pauses" has been considered by many as a stupidity and showing a lack of skill or competence, however many linguists attest this judgement is unjustified. Typically, 'hmm' is uttered when the person is being especially conscious about whom they are talking with, and as a result are thinking deeply about what to say. Moreover the use of 'hmm' is often interactional and cognitive. The interactional function is to do with politeness. Professor Michael Handford, a professor of applied linguistics and English language at [[Cardiff University]] gave the example of if one invited somebody to a party, and they said no without a filled pause, they will appear rude probably. However, if the person replied, ‘hmm, sorry, no’ it makes it much more polite.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/um-like-filler-words-discourse-markers-why-use-er-you-know-a7665721.html&lt;/ref&gt;They play a really important politeness function since it appears the person is giving the offer some thought, rather than abruptly declining the offer.

===Thoughtful absorption===
The use of 'hmm' is typically used during ''thoughtful absorption'', which is when one is engrossed&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absorption&lt;/ref&gt; in their flow of ideas and associations, that lead to a reality-oriented conclusion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marić |first=Jovan |date=2005 |title=Klinicka psihijatrija |url=http://www.datastatus.rs/proizvod/8040/klinicka-psihijatrija-11-izdanje |location=Belgrade |publisher=Naša knjiga |page=22 |isbn=9788690155910 |author-link=Jovan Maric}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The utterance of 'hmm' is key for surrounding person/s to understand that the person is currently involved in thoughtful observation; if the person thinks silently, those surrounding may not be sure that the person is currently thinking. The use of 'um' and 'er' are also used during thoughtful absorption, however, typically the extent of the absorption of thought is limited when 'um' and 'er' are uttered since they usually spoken mid-sentence&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/english-filler-words/&lt;/ref&gt;, and for shorter periods of time than 'hmm'. For this reason thoughtful absorption is typically associated with the utterance of 'hmm'.&lt;ref&gt;Online Contrasting Dictionary Definitions of "hmm", 'um', and 'er'

=="Huh" {{mdash}} the universal syllable==
Research has shown that the word/syllable "huh" is perhaps the most recognized syllable throughout the world, including variations of "mama" and "papa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/arts/that-syllable-everyone-recognizes.html?smid=pl-share |first1=Jennifer |last1=Schuessler |date=November 9, 2013 |title=The Syllable that Everyone Understands |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an [[interrogative]].

Its pronunciation is based on the [[Beijing dialect]], its vocabulary on the [[Mandarin dialects]], and its grammar is based on [[written vernacular Chinese]].

Like other varieties of Chinese, Standard Chinese is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]] with [[topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]] organization and [[subject–verb–object]] word order. It has more initial consonants but fewer vowels, final consonants and tones than southern varieties. Standard Chinese is an [[analytic language]], though with many [[compound word]]s.

There are two standardised forms of the language, namely '''Putonghua''' in Mainland China and '''Guoyu''' in Taiwan. Aside from a number of differences in pronunciation and vocabulary, Putonghua is written using [[simplified Chinese characters]] (plus [[Hanyu Pinyin]] [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] for teaching), and Guoyu is written using [[traditional Chinese characters]] (plus [[Bopomofo|Zhuyin]] for teaching). Many characters are identical between the two systems.

== Names ==
In Chinese, the standard variety is known as:{{sfnp|Mair|2013|p=737}}

* ''Hànyǔ'' ({{zh|s=汉语|t=漢語|l=language of the [[Han Chinese|Han tribe]]|labels=no}}) in the [[United States]] and elsewhere in the [[Chinese diaspora]].

Standard Chinese is also commonly referred to by generic names for "Chinese", notably {{zh|c=中文|p=Zhōngwén|l=Middle [i.e. Chinese] writing|labels=no}} and {{zh|s=中国话|t=中國話|p=Zhōngguóhuà|l=Middle Kingdom [i.e. China] speech|labels=no}} (compare {{zh|s=英文|p=Yīngwén|l=English writing|labels=no}} for English, and {{zh|c=英国|p=Yīngguó|l=English country [i.e. England]|labels=no}}). In total, there have been known over 20 various names for the language.{{sfnp|Mair|1991|pp=11}}

===Putonghua and Guoyu===

The term ''Guoyu'' had previously been used by non-Han rulers of China to refer to their languages, but in 1909 the Qing education ministry officially applied it to [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Mandarin]], a [[lingua franca]] based on [[Mandarin Chinese|northern Chinese varieties]], proclaiming it as the new "national language".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=133–134}}

The name ''Putonghua'' also has a long, albeit unofficial, history. It was used as early as 1906 in writings by [[Zhu Wenxiong]] to differentiate a modern, standard Chinese from [[classical Chinese]] and other [[varieties of Chinese]].

For some [[linguist]]s of the early 20th century, the ''Putonghua'', or "common tongue/speech", was conceptually different from the ''Guoyu'', or "national language". The former was a national prestige variety, while the latter was the ''legal'' standard.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}

Based on common understandings of the time, the two were, in fact, different. ''Guoyu'' was understood as formal vernacular Chinese, which is close to [[classical Chinese]]. By contrast, ''Putonghua'' was called "the common speech of the modern man", which is the spoken language adopted as a national [[lingua franca]] by conventional usage.

The use of the term ''Putonghua'' by left-leaning intellectuals such as [[Qu Qiubai]] and [[Lu Xun]] influenced the People's Republic of China government to adopt that term to describe Mandarin in 1956. Prior to this, the government used both terms interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, Zhongrui. (2008) "[http://www.china-language.gov.cn/63/2008_3_10/1_63_3387_0_1205124588468.html 国语、普通话、华语] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426051531/http://www.china-language.gov.cn/63/2008_3_10/1_63_3387_0_1205124588468.html |date=26 April 2009 }} (Guoyu, Putonghua, Huayu)". ''China Language'' National Language Committee, People's Republic of China&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taiwan]], ''Guoyu'' (national language) continues to be the official term for Standard Chinese. The term ''Guoyu'' however, is less used in the PRC, because declaring a [[Beijing dialect]]-based standard to be the national language would be deemed unfair to speakers of [[Varieties of Chinese|other varieties]] and to the [[Chinese ethnic minorities|ethnic minorities]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The term ''Putonghua'' (common speech), on the contrary, implies nothing more than the notion of a [[lingua franca]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

During the government of a pro-[[Taiwan independence]] coalition (2000–2008), Taiwan officials promoted a different reading of ''Guoyu'' as all of the "national languages", meaning [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Formosan languages|Formosan]] as well as Standard Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=What Has Changed?: Taiwan Before and After the Change in Ruling Parties |first=Dafydd |last=Fell |first2=Henning |last2=Klöter |first3=Bi-yu |last3=Chang |publisher=Harrassowitz |location=Wiesbaden |year=2006 |page=213 |isbn=9783447053792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huayu===
''Huayu'', or "language of the [[Zhonghua minzu|Chinese nation]]", originally simply meant "[[Chinese language]]", and was used in overseas communities to contrast Chinese with foreign languages. Over time, the desire to standardise the variety of Chinese spoken in these communities led to the adoption of the name "Huayu" to refer to Mandarin.

This name also avoids choosing a side between the alternative names of ''Putonghua'' and ''Guoyu'', which came to have political significance after their usages diverged along political lines between the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] and the [[Republic of China|ROC]]. It also incorporates the notion that Mandarin is usually not the national or common language of the areas in which [[overseas Chinese]] live.

===Hanyu===
''Hanyu'', or "language of the [[Han Chinese|Han people]]", is another umbrella term used for Chinese. However, it has confusingly two different meanings:{{sfnp|Mair|2013|p=737}}
* Standard Chinese;
* all the [[Sinitic languages]] spoken by the so-called Han peoples.

This term, as well as ''Hànzú'' ({{zh|s=汉族|t=漢族|l=Han nation|labels=no}}), is a relatively modern concept; it came into being with the rise of Chinese nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Mair|2013|p=738–744}} A related concept is ''Hànzì'' ({{zh|s=汉字|t=漢字|l=[[Han characters]]|labels=no}}).{{sfnp|Mair|2013|p=743–744}}

===Mandarin===
The term "Mandarin" is a translation of ''Guānhuà'' ({{zh|s=官话|t=官話|labels=no}}, literally "official's speech"),{{sfnp|Mair|2013|p=737}} which referred to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|lingua franca of the late Chinese empire]].{{sfnp|Mair|1991|pp=11–12}} The Chinese term is obsolete as a name for the standard language, but is used by linguists to refer to the major group of [[Mandarin dialects]] spoken natively across most of northern and southwestern China.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}

In English, "Mandarin" may refer to the standard language, the dialect group as a whole, or to historic forms such as the late Imperial lingua franca.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}} The name "Modern Standard Mandarin" is sometimes used by linguists who wish to distinguish the current state of the shared language from other northern and historic dialects.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}{{sfnp|Mair|2013|p=737}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Modern Standard Chinese}}
{{quotation|The Chinese have different languages in different provinces, to such an extent that they cannot understand each other.... [They] also have another language which is like a universal and common language; this is the official language of the mandarins and of the court; it is among them like Latin among ourselves.... Two of our fathers [Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci] have been learning this mandarin language...|[[Alessandro Valignano]]||''Historia del Principio y Progresso de la Compañia de Jesus en las Indias Orientales (1542–1564)''&lt;ref&gt;Translation quoted in {{harvtxt|Coblin|2000}}, p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] has long had considerable dialectal variation, hence [[prestige dialect]]s have always existed, and [[linguae francae]] have always been needed. [[Confucius]], for example, used ''yǎyán'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|雅言}}|l=elegant speech|labels=no}}) rather than colloquial regional dialects; text during the [[Han dynasty]] also referred to ''tōngyǔ'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|通|语}}|l=common language|labels=no}}). [[Rime book]]s, which were written since the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], may also have reflected one or more systems of standard [[pronunciation]] during those times. However, all of these standard dialects were probably unknown outside the educated elite; even among the elite, pronunciations may have been very different, as the unifying factor of all Chinese dialects, [[Classical Chinese]], was a written standard, not a spoken one.

=== Late empire ===
{{main|Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)}}
[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|right|''Zhongguo Guanhua'' (中国官话/中國官話), or ''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'' ("Middle Kingdom's Common Speech"), used on the [[book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of an early Chinese grammar published by [[Étienne Fourmont]] (with [[Arcadio Huang]]) in 1742&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Liberlibri SARL |url=http://www.liberlibri.com/coulet_fourmont.htm |title=FOURMONT, Etienne.

The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) and the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) began to use the term ''guānhuà'' (官话/官話), or "official speech", to refer to the speech used at the [[noble court|courts]]. The term "Mandarin" is borrowed directly from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The Portuguese word ''mandarim'', derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[mantri]]n'' "counselor or minister", was first used to refer to the Chinese bureaucratic officials.
The Portuguese then translated ''guānhuà'' as "the language of the mandarins" or "the mandarin language".{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}

In the 17th century, the Empire had set up [[Orthoepy]] Academies (正音书院/正音書院 ''Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn'') in an attempt to make pronunciation conform to the standard. But these attempts had little success, since as late as the 19th century the emperor had difficulty understanding some of his own ministers in court, who did not always try to follow any standard pronunciation.

Before the 19th century, the standard was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]], but later the [[Beijing dialect]] became increasingly influential, despite the mix of officials and commoners speaking various dialects in the capital, [[Beijing]].{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=549–550}} By some accounts, as late as the early 20th century, the position of [[Nanjing]] Mandarin was considered to be higher than that of Beijing by some and the [[postal romanization]] standards set in 1906 included spellings with elements of Nanjing pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lrichardscompreh00rich ''L. Richard's comprehensive geography of the Chinese empire and dependencies'' translated into English, revised and enlarged by M. Kennelly, S.J.] Shanghai: T'usewei Press, 1908. p. iv. (Translation of Louis Richard, ''Géographie de l'empire de Chine'', Shanghai, 1905.)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by 1909, the dying [[Qing dynasty]] had established the Beijing dialect as ''guóyǔ'' (国语/國語), or the "national language".

As the [[island of Taiwan]] had fallen under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] per the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], the term {{nihongo||國語|kokugo|"national language"|lead=yes}} referred to the Japanese language until the  [[Taiwan Retrocession Day|handover to the ROC]] in 1945.

=== Modern China ===
After the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] was established in 1912, there was more success in promoting a common national language. A [[Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation]] was convened with delegates from the entire country.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=16–17}} A ''Dictionary of National Pronunciation'' (国音字典/國音字典) was published in 1919, defining a [[Old National Pronunciation|hybrid pronunciation]] that did not match any existing speech.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=134}}{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=18}} Meanwhile, despite the lack of a workable standardized pronunciation, colloquial literature in [[written vernacular Chinese]] continued to develop apace.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=10}}

Gradually, the members of the National Language Commission came to settle upon the Beijing dialect, which became the major source of standard national pronunciation due to its prestigious status. In 1932, the commission published the ''Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use'' (国音常用字汇/國音常用字彙), with little fanfare or official announcement. This dictionary was similar to the previous published one except that it normalized the pronunciations for all characters into the pronunciation of the Beijing dialect. Elements from other dialects continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions rather than the rule.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=15}}

After the [[Chinese Civil War]], the People's Republic of China continued the effort, and in 1955, officially renamed ''guóyǔ'' as ''pǔtōnghuà'' (普通话/普通話), or "common speech". By contrast, the name ''guóyǔ'' continued to be used by the Republic of China which, after its 1949 loss in the Chinese Civil War, was left with a territory consisting only of [[Taiwan]] and some smaller islands. Since then, the standards used in the PRC and Taiwan have diverged somewhat, especially in newer [[vocabulary]] terms, and a little in pronunciation.{{sfnp|Bradley|1992|pp=313–314}}

In 1956, the standard language of the People's Republic of China was officially defined as: "''Pǔtōnghuà'' is the standard form of Modern Chinese with the Beijing phonological system as its norm of pronunciation, and Northern dialects as its base dialect, and looking to exemplary modern works in ''báihuà'' 'vernacular literary language' for its grammatical norms."{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=24}}&lt;ref name="langlaw"&gt;{{cite web

  |quote=For purposes of this Law, the standard spoken and written Chinese language means Putonghua (a common speech with pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect) and the standardized Chinese characters. }} Original text in Chinese: "{{lang|zh|普通话就是现代汉民族共同语，是全国各民族通用的语言。普通话以北京语音为标准音，以北方话为基础方言，以典范的现代白话文著作语法规范}}"&lt;/ref&gt;
By the official definition, Standard Chinese uses:
* ''The [[phonology]] or sound system of [[Beijing]].'' A distinction should be made between the sound system of a variety and the actual pronunciation of words in it. The pronunciations of words chosen for the standardized language do not necessarily reproduce all of those of the Beijing dialect. The pronunciation of words is a standardization choice and occasional standardization differences (not accents) do exist, between Putonghua and Guoyu, for example.
* ''The [[vocabulary]] of [[Mandarin dialects]] in general''. This means that all [[slang]] and other elements deemed "regionalisms" are excluded. On the one hand, the vocabulary of all Chinese varieties, especially in more technical fields like [[science]], [[law]], and [[government]], are very similar. (This is similar to the profusion of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] words in European languages.) This means that much of the vocabulary of Standard Chinese is shared with all varieties of Chinese. On the other hand, much of the [[colloquialism|colloquial]] vocabulary of the Beijing dialect is not included in Standard Chinese, and may not be understood by people outside Beijing.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=37–38}}
* ''The [[grammar]] and idiom of exemplary modern [[Chinese literature]]'', such as the work of [[Lu Xun]], collectively known as "[[written vernacular Chinese|vernacular]]" (''baihua''). Modern written vernacular Chinese is in turn based loosely upon a mixture of northern (predominant), southern, and [[Classical Chinese|classical]] grammar and usage. This gives formal Standard Chinese structure a slightly different feel from that of street Beijing dialect.

In the early 1950s, this standard language was understood by 41% of the population of the country, including 54% of speakers of Mandarin dialects, but only 11% of people in the rest of the country.  By 1984, the proportion understanding the standard language nationally had risen to 90% and the proportion understanding the standard language among the speakers of Mandarin dialects had risen to 91%.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=27–28}}  A survey conducted by the China's Education Ministry in 2007 indicated that 53.06% of the population were able to effectively communicate orally in Standard Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/education/201946.htm| title=More than half of Chinese can speak Mandarin| publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]| date=7 March 2007| access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current role ==
[[File:Map of sinitic languages cropped-en.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of eastern [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], showing the historic distribution of all the varieties of Mandarin Chinese in light brown. Standard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin.]]
From an official point of view, Standard Chinese serves the purpose of a [[lingua franca]]—a way for speakers of the several mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese, as well as the [[List of Chinese nationalities|Chinese minorities]], to communicate with each other. The very name ''Putonghua,'' or "common speech," reinforces this idea. In practice, however, due to Standard Chinese being a "public" lingua franca, other Chinese varieties and even non-Sinitic languages, have shown signs of losing ground to the standard.

[[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|China's Education Ministry]] published research on September, 2014, that only 70% percent of people of the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] had good understanding and speaking skill of Putonghua despite the Chinese government promoting Putonghua on [[TV]], radio and public services like buses to develop Putonghua as PRC official language to ease communication between all people of the PRC, because many ethnic groups had their own dialects, so it was problem to understand each other. To develop the Putonghua as the official common language of the PRC is difficult sometimes because some ethnic groups that are using other dialects don't like using the Putonghua because they think they are losing their own native dialect and cultural identity, for example, when in the summer of 2010 appeared some reports of increasing the using of the Putonghua on a local TV broadcasting in Cantonese dialect in the province of [[Guangdong]], then thousands of Cantonese-speaking citizens were protesting on the demonstration against the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Luo |first=Chris |date=2014-09-23 |title=One-third of Chinese do not speak Putonghua, says Education Ministry |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1598040/3-10-chinese-citizens-do-not-speak-putonghua-says-education |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |location=Hong Kong |access-date=2017-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both China and Taiwan, the use of Mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of Mandarin. As a result, Mandarin is now spoken fluently, though often with some regional or personal variation from the standard in terms of pronunciation or lexicon, by most people in mainland China and Taiwan. 
In 2014, the Ministry of Education estimated that about 70% of the population of China spoke Standard Mandarin to some degree, but only one tenth of those could speak it "fluently and articulately".&lt;ref name="SCMP Putonghua"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = 17th National Putonghua Week | language = Chinese | publisher = Ministry of Education | date = 15 September 2014 | url = http://www.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s8316/201409/174957.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is a 20% difference in penetration between eastern and western parts of China and a 50% difference between urban and rural areas. In addition, there are still 400 million Chinese who are only able to listen and understand Mandarin and not able to speak it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2015-09/20/c_128248449.htm |script-title=zh:中国仍有约4亿人不能用普通话进行交流-新华网 |website=[[Xinhua News]] |access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in China's 13th Five Year Plan, the general goal is to raise the penetration rate to over 80% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2017-04/02/content_5183051.htm |script-title=zh:教育部、国家语委：力争“十三五”期间使所有教师的普通话水平达标_滚动新闻_中国政府网 |author=Bai Wansong ({{lang|zh|白宛松}}) |website=www.gov.cn|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both mainland China and Taiwan use Standard Chinese in the official context and the governments are keen to promote its use as a national [[lingua franca]]. The PRC in particular has enacted a law (the ''National Common Language and Writing Law'') which states that the government must "promote" Standard Mandarin. There is no explicit official intent to have Standard Chinese replace the regional varieties, but local governments have enacted regulations (such as the ''[[Guangdong National Language Regulations]]'') which "implement" the national law by way of coercive measures to control the public use of regional spoken varieties and [[Traditional Chinese|traditional characters in writing]]. In practice, some elderly or rural Chinese-language speakers do not speak Standard Chinese fluently, if at all, though most are able to understand it. But urban residents and the younger generations, who received their education with Standard Mandarin as the primary medium of education, are almost all fluent in a version of Standard Chinese, some to the extent of being unable to speak their local dialect.

{{see|Promotion of Putonghua}}
In the predominantly [[Han Chinese|Han]] areas in mainland China, while the use of Standard Chinese is encouraged as the common working language, the PRC has been somewhat sensitive to the status of minority languages and, outside the education context, has generally not discouraged their social use. Standard Chinese is commonly used for practical reasons, as, in many parts of southern China, the linguistic diversity is so large that neighboring city dwellers may have difficulties communicating with each other without a ''lingua franca''.

In Taiwan, the relationship between Standard Chinese and other varieties, particularly [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], has been more politically heated. During the [[martial law]] period under the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) between 1949 and 1987, the KMT government revived the [[Mandarin Promotion Council]] and discouraged or, in some cases, forbade the use of Hokkien and other non-standard varieties. This produced a political backlash in the 1990s. Under the administration of [[Chen Shui-Bian]], other Taiwanese varieties were taught in schools. The former President, Chen Shui-Bian, often spoke in Hokkien during speeches, while after the late 1990s, former President [[Lee Teng-hui]], also speaks Hokkien openly.

In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which are now [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of the People's Republic of China, [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] is the primary language spoken by the majority of the population and used by government and in their respective legislatures. After [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Hong Kong's handover from the United Kingdom]] and [[transfer of sovereignty over Macau|Macau's handover from Portugal]], their governments use Putonghua to communicate with the [[Central People's Government]] of the PRC. There have been widespread efforts to promote usage of Putonghua in Hong Kong since the handover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.news.gov.hk/isd/ebulletin/en/category/atschool/060325/html/060325en02002.htm |title= Putonghua promotion stepped up |first= |last= |author= Standing Committee on Language Education &amp; Research |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=25 March 2006 |work= |publisher=Hong Kong Government |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |accessdate= 12 February 2011|quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with specific efforts to train police&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/692/0110_e.htm |title= Online training to boost Chinese skills |first= |last= |author= Hong Kong Police |authorlink= |coauthors= |work= |publisher=Hong Kong Government |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |accessdate= 12 February 2011|quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr98-99/english/panels/ed/papers/ed1904_4.htm |title= Panel on Education working reports |first= |last= |author= Hong Kong LegCo |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=19 April 1999 |work= |publisher=Hong Kong Government |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |accessdate= 12 February 2011|quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, the government has heavily promoted a "[[Speak Mandarin Campaign]]" since the late 1970s, with the use of other [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] in [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media being prohibited and their use in any context officially discouraged until recently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-hokkien-drama-aimed-at-seniors-to-be-launched-on-sep-9/3091668.html New Hokkien drama aimed at seniors to be launched on Sep 9], [[Channel News Asia]], 1 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to some resentment amongst the older generations, as Singapore's migrant Chinese community is made up almost entirely of people of south Chinese descent. [[Lee Kuan Yew]], the initiator of the campaign, admitted that to most Chinese Singaporeans, Mandarin was a "stepmother tongue" rather than a true mother language. Nevertheless, he saw the need for a unified language among the Chinese community not biased in favor of any existing group.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Kuan Yew, ''From Third World to First: The Singapore Story: 1965–2000'', HarperCollins, 2000. {{ISBN|0-06-019776-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarin is now spreading overseas beyond [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] as well. In [[Chinese Americans in New York City|New York City]], the use of Cantonese that dominated the [[Manhattan Chinatown]] for decades is being rapidly swept aside by Mandarin, the [[lingua franca]] of most of the latest [[Chinese immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html|title=In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin|date=21 October 2009|accessdate=18 July 2011 | work=The New York Times | first=Kirk | last=Semple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard Chinese and the educational system ===
[[File:Yangzhou-Highschool-Speak-Putonghua-3388.jpg|thumb|A poster outside a high school in [[Yangzhou]] urges people to "speak ''Putonghua'', welcome guests from all parts" and "use civilised language".]]
In both the PRC and Taiwan, Standard Chinese is taught by immersion starting in elementary school. After the second grade, the entire educational system is in Standard Chinese, except for local language classes that have been taught for a few hours each week in Taiwan starting in the mid-1990s.

In December 2004, the first survey of language use in the [[People's Republic of China]] revealed that only 53% of its population, about 700 million people, could communicate in Standard Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Greater numbers speak Mandarin | date = December 26, 2004 | newspaper=China Daily | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/26/content_403419.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 53% is defined as a passing grade above 3-B (a score above 60%) of the Evaluation Exam.

With the fast development of the country and the massive internal [[migration in China]], the standard [[Putonghua Proficiency Test]] has quickly become popular. Many university graduates in mainland China take this exam before looking for a job. Employers often require varying proficiency in Standard Chinese from applicants depending on the nature of the positions. Applicants of some positions, e.g. telephone operators, may be required to obtain a certificate. People raised in Beijing are sometimes considered inherently 1-A (A score of at least 97%) and exempted from this requirement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} As for the rest, the score of 1-A is rare. According to the official definition of proficiency levels, people who get 1-B (A score of at least 92%) are considered qualified to work as television correspondents or in broadcasting stations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} 2-A (A score of at least 87%) can work as Chinese Literature Course teachers in public schools.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Other levels include: 2-B (A score of at least 80%), 3-A (A score of at least 70%) and 3-B (A score of at least 60%). In China, a proficiency of level 3-B usually cannot be achieved unless special training is received. Even though many Chinese do not speak with standard pronunciation, spoken Standard Chinese is widely understood to some degree.

The China National Language And Character Working Committee was founded in 1985. One of its important responsibilities is to promote Standard Chinese proficiency for Chinese native speakers.

The {{IPA|[ɹ̩]}} final, which occurs only after dental sibilant and retroflex initials, is a syllabic [[approximant consonant|approximant]], prolonging the initial.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=142}}{{sfnp|Lee|Zee|2003|p=111}}

[[File:Pinyin Tone Chart.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|Relative pitch contours of the four full tones]]
The [[rhotacized vowel]] {{IPA|[ɚ]}} forms a complete syllable.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=143–144}}
A reduced form of this syllable occurs as a sub-syllabic suffix, spelled ''-r'' in pinyin and often with a [[diminutive]] connotation.  The suffix modifies the coda of the base syllable in a rhotacizing process called ''[[erhua]]''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=144–145}}

Each full syllable is pronounced with a phonemically distinctive pitch contour.  There are four tonal categories, marked in pinyin with iconic diacritic symbols, as in the words ''mā'' (妈/媽 "mother"), ''má'' (麻 "hemp"), ''mǎ'' (马/馬 "horse") and ''mà'' (骂/罵 "curse").{{sfnp|Duanmu|2007|p=225}}  The tonal categories also have secondary characteristics.  For example, the third tone is long and [[murmured voice|murmured]], whereas the fourth tone is relatively short.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=147}}{{sfnp|Duanmu|2007|p=236}}  Statistically, vowels and tones are of similar importance in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | surname1 = Surendran | given1 = Dinoj | surname2 = Levow | given2 = Gina-Anne | chapter-url = http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~dinoj/research/fltonemandarin.pdf | chapter = The functional load of tone in Mandarin is as high as that of vowels | pages = 99–102 | title = Proceedings of the International Conference on Speech Prosody 2004 | editor1-given = Bernard | editor1-surname = Bel | editor2-given = Isabelle | editor2-surname = Marlien | publisher = SProSIG | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-2-9518233-1-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also weak syllables, including grammatical particles such as the interrogative ''ma'' (吗/嗎) and certain syllables in polysyllabic words.  These syllables are short, with their pitch determined by the preceding syllable.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=148}}

=== Regional accents ===
It is common for Standard Chinese to be spoken with the speaker's regional accent, depending on factors such as age, level of education, and the need and frequency to speak in official or formal situations.  This appears to be changing, though, in large [[urban area]]s, as social changes, migrations, and [[urbanization]] take place.

Due to evolution and standardization, Mandarin, although based on the [[Beijing dialect]], is no longer synonymous with it. Part of this was due to the standardization to reflect a greater vocabulary scheme and a more archaic and "proper-sounding" pronunciation and vocabulary.

Distinctive features of the Beijing dialect are more extensive use of ''erhua'' in vocabulary items that are left unadorned in descriptions of the standard such as the ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]]'', as well as more neutral tones.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=39–40}} An example of standard versus Beijing dialect would be the standard ''mén'' (door) and Beijing ''ménr''.

[[Taiwanese Mandarin|Most Standard Chinese as spoken on Taiwan]] differs mostly in the tones of some words as well as some vocabulary. Minimal use of the neutral tone and ''erhua'', and technical vocabulary constitute the greatest divergences between the two forms.

The stereotypical "southern Chinese" accent does not distinguish between [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] and [[alveolar consonant]]s, pronouncing pinyin ''zh'' [tʂ], ''ch'' [tʂʰ], and ''sh'' [ʂ] in the same way as ''z'' [ts], ''c'' [tsʰ], and ''s'' [s] respectively.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=140}} Southern-accented Standard Chinese may also interchange ''l'' and ''n'', final ''n'' and ''ng'', and vowels ''i'' and ''ü'' [y]. Attitudes towards southern accents, particularly the Cantonese accent, range from disdain to admiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China Off Center: Mapping the Margins of the Middle Kingdom|editor1-first=Susan Debra|editor1-last=Blum|editor2-first=Lionel M|editor2-last=Jensen|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2002|pages=160–161|first=Susan D.|last=Blum|chapter=Ethnic and Linguistic Diversity in Kunming|isbn=978-0-8248-2577-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
{{main|Chinese grammar}}

Chinese is a strongly [[analytic language]], having almost no [[inflectional morpheme]]s, and relying on word order and [[grammatical particle|particle]]s to express relationships between the parts of a sentence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=159}}
Nouns are not marked for [[grammatical case|case]] and rarely marked for [[grammatical number|number]].{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|pp=11–12}}
Verbs are not marked for [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] or [[grammatical tense]], but [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] is marked using post-verbal particles.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|pp=12–13}}

The basic word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO), as in English.{{sfnp|Lin|1981|p=19}}
Nouns are generally preceded by any modifiers ([[adjective]]s, [[possessive]]s and [[relative clause]]s), and verbs also generally follow any modifiers ([[adverb]]s, [[auxiliary verb]]s and prepositional phrases).{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|pp=24–26}}

{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh|lang2=zh-Latn-pinyin|indent=3
|他 为/為 他的 朋友 作了 这个/這個 工作。
|Tā wèi tā-de péngyǒu zuò-le zhè-ge gōngzuò.
|He for he-GEN friend do-PERF this-CL job
|'He did this job for his friends.'{{sfnp|Lin|1981|p=169}}
}}

The predicate can be an intransitive verb, a transitive verb followed by a direct object, a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (linking verb) ''shì'' ({{lang|zh|是}}) followed by a noun phrase, etc.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|p=141}}
In predicative use, Chinese adjectives function as [[stative verb]]s, forming complete predicates in their own right without a copula.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|pp=141–143}} For example,
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh|lang2=zh-Latn-pinyin|indent=3
|我 不 累。
|Wǒ bú lèi.
|I not tired
|'I am not tired.'
}}
Another example is the common greeting ''nǐ hăo'' (你好), literally "you good".

Chinese additionally differs from English in that it forms another kind of sentence by [[Topic-prominent language|stating a topic and following it by a comment]].{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|pp=15–16}} To do this in English, speakers generally flag the topic of a sentence by prefacing it with "as for". For example:
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh|lang2=zh-Latn-pinyin|indent=3
|妈妈 给 我们 的 钱, 我 已经 买了 糖果。
|Māma gěi wǒmen de qián, wǒ yǐjīng mǎi-le tángguǒ(r)
|Mom give us REL money I already buy-PERF candy
|'As for the money that Mom gave us, I have already bought candy with it.'
}}

The time when something happens can be given by an explicit term such as "yesterday," by relative terms such as "formerly," etc.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|pp=320–320}}

As in many east Asian languages, [[Chinese classifier|classifier]]s or measure words are required when using [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and similar quantifiers.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|p=104}}
There are many different classifiers in the language, and each noun generally has a particular classifier associated with it.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|p=105}}
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh|lang2=zh-Latn-pinyin|indent=3
|一顶 帽子, 三本 书/書, 那枝 笔/筆
|yī-dǐng màozi, sān-běn shū, nèi-zhī bǐ
|one-top hat three-volume book that-branch pen
|'a hat, three books, that pen'
}}
The general classifier ''ge'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|个}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|個}}) is gradually replacing specific classifiers.{{sfnp|Li|Thompson|1981|p=112}}

== Vocabulary ==

[[Chinese honorifics|Many formal, polite and humble words]] that were in use in imperial China have not been used in daily conversation in modern-day Mandarin, such as ''jiàn'' ([[:wikt:贱|贱/賤]] "my humble") and ''guì'' ([[:wikt:贵|贵/貴]] "your honorable").

Although Chinese speakers make a clear distinction between Standard Chinese and the Beijing dialect, there are aspects of Beijing dialect that have made it into the official standard. Standard Chinese has a [[T–V distinction]] between the polite and informal "you" that comes from the Beijing dialect, although its use is quite diminished in daily speech. In addition, it also distinguishes between "''zánmen''" (''we'' including the listener) and "''wǒmen''" (''we'' not including the listener). In practice, neither distinction is commonly used by most Chinese, at least outside the Beijing area.

The following samples are some phrases from the Beijing dialect which are not yet accepted into Standard Chinese:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
* 倍儿 ''bèir'' means 'very much'; 拌蒜 ''bànsuàn'' means 'stagger'; 不吝 ''bù lìn'' means 'do not worry about'; 撮 ''cuō'' means 'eat'; 出溜 ''chūliū'' means 'slip'; (大)老爷儿们儿 ''dà lǎoyermenr'' means 'man, male'.

The following samples are some phrases from Beijing dialect which have become accepted as Standard Chinese:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* 二把刀 ''èr bǎ dāo'' means 'not very skillful'; 哥们儿 ''gēménr means'' 'good male friend(s)', 'buddy(ies)'; 抠门儿 ''kōu ménr'' means 'frugal' or 'stingy'.

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Chinese characters}}
Standard Chinese is written with characters corresponding to syllables of the language, most of which represent a morpheme.
In most cases, these characters come from those used in [[Classical Chinese]] to write cognate morphemes of late [[Old Chinese]], though their pronunciation, and often meaning, has shifted dramatically over two millennia.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=74}}
However, there are several words, many of them heavily used, which have no classical counterpart or whose etymology is obscure.
Two strategies have been used to write such words:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=74–75}}
* An unrelated character with the same or similar pronunciation might be used, especially if its original sense was no longer common.  For example, the [[demonstrative pronoun]]s ''zhè'' "this" and ''nà'' "that" have no counterparts in Classical Chinese, which used 此 ''cǐ'' and 彼 ''bǐ'' respectively.  Hence the character 這 (later simplified as 这) for ''zhè'' "to meet" was borrowed to write ''zhè'' "this", and the character 那 for ''nà'', the name of a country and later a rare surname, was borrowed to write ''nà'' "that".
* A new character, usually a phono-semantic or semantic compound, might be created.  For example, ''gǎn'' "pursue, overtake", is written with a new character 趕, composed of the signific 走 ''zǒu'' "run" and the phonetic 旱 ''hàn'' "drought".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=76}}  This method was used to represent many [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages#Chinese|elements in the periodic table]].

The government of the PRC (as well as some other governments and institutions) has promulgated a set of [[Simplified Chinese|simplified forms]]. Under this system, the forms of the words ''zhèlǐ'' ("here") and ''nàlǐ'' ("there") changed from 這裏/這裡 and 那裏/那裡 to 这里 and 那里.

[[Chinese characters]] were traditionally read from top to bottom, right to left, but in modern usage it is more common to read from left to right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">'''Sworn testimony''' is evidence given by a witness who has made a commitment to tell the [[truth]]. If the witness is later found to have lied whilst bound by the commitment, they can often be charged with the crime of [[perjury]]. The types of commitment can include oaths, affirmations and promises which are explained in more detail below. The exact wording of the commitments vary from country to country.

==Types of commitment==

The commitment can come in different forms depending on the situation of the witness. The types of commitment used in the [[United Kingdom]] are:

*'''Oath''': A commitment made to the witness's [[deity]], or on their holy book.
*'''Affirmation''': A [[Secularism|secular]] variant of the oath where the witness does not have to mention a deity or holy book.
*'''Promise''': A commitment made by a witness under the age of 17, or of all witnesses if none of the accused are over the age of 17.

'''Vartan Pasha''' ({{lang-hy|Վարդան փաշա}}), ('''Hovsep Vartanian''' or '''Osep Vartanian''') (1813 - 1879) was an [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian]] statesman, author, and journalist of the 19th century, promoted to the rank of "[[Pasha]]" after three decades in the service of the state. He is also notable for his [[novel]] "Akabi's Story" (''[[Akabi Hikayesi]]''), published in 1851 in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] written in the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] (a not unusual practice in the 19th century), and for having published the bilingual magazine ''[[Mecmua-i Havadis]]'', an important reference in the history of the Turkish written press.

His novel is, according to the [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Turkology|Turkologist]] [[Andreas Tietze]] who re-edited it and had a [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] published in 1991, the first genuine novel published in [[Turkey]] or, according to another viewpoint, "one of the five early, contemporaneous and intermediate works of fiction that were clearly distinct from earlier prose traditions in both [[Diwan (poetry)|Divan]] and [[Turkish folk literature|folk]] literature, and that approximate novelistic form."&lt;ref&gt;In her presentation of these five works, Dr. [[Gonca Gökalp]] of [[Hacettepe University]] points out that in the beginning, there was a [[Cretan Turks|Cretan]], [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]] with his "[[Muhayyelât]]" dated 1796, "Akabi's story" coming next in 1851, followed by "[[Hayalat-ı Dil]]" of [[Hasan Tevfik]] (1868), "[[Temaşa-i Dünya]]" of [[Evangelinos Misailidis]], an [[Anatolia]]n [[Greeks|Greek]] from [[Kula, Turkey|Kula]] (1872) and "[[Müsameretname]]" of [[Emin Nihat Bey]] (1875).  [http://www.edebiyatdergisi.hacettepe.edu.tr/700ozelGoncaGokalp.pdf Five intermediate works in the beginning of the Turkish novel in the Ottoman era, Dr. Gonca Gökalp, 1998] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142830/http://www.edebiyatdergisi.hacettepe.edu.tr/700ozelGoncaGokalp.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} {{tr}}, abstract also in English&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of which was the first Turkish novel is still debated. The first Turkish novel has often been considered to be [[Sami Frashëri]]'s "Love affair between Talat and Fitnat" (''[[Ta'aşşuk-ı Tal'at ve Fitnat]]''), published in 1872. On the other hand, although written in Turkish, Vartan Pasha's "Akabi's Story", because of its fully Armenian context, can also be considered as the first Armenian novel that saw print ([[Khachatur Abovian]]'s ''[[Wounds of Armenia]]'' having been published in 1858).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Biography==
Hovsep Vartanian ({{lang-hy|Յոսեփ Վարդանեան}}), was born in 1813 to [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholic Armenian]] parents. At the age of 13, he set out for [[Vienna]], where he was enrolled in the school of [[Mechitarists]]. Upon returning to the [[Ottoman Empire]], he worked as a teacher for a couple of years, after which he took up a post in 1837 in the [[Dragoman]]'s office of the Ottoman Empire. Rising through the ranks of the state bureaucracy, he was promoted to the rank of "Pasha" at the same time as his assignment as a founding member to the Ottoman Academy (''[[Encümen-i Daniş]]''), established along lines similar to those of the [[Académie française]] and which also acted as a consultative council for the [[Sultan]]. He wrote the novel "Akabi's Story" in 1851, while he was a member of the Academy, and a long story, also in Turkish, treating the deep divide and the strife between [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Gregorian]] and [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholic Armenians]], a secondary theme in Akabi's novel, followed the next year. After his retirement, he started and managed the magazine "Mecmua-i Havadis", bilingual in Turkish and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. He also wrote a biography of [[Napoleon I of France]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Strauss (disambiguation)|Johann Strauss]]&lt;!-- I have included this on purpose. This is "another" Johann Strauss, not a musician. --&gt;: ''Funktionsgebundenheit von Einzelsprachen und die Rolle von Übersetzungen am Beispiel des Osmanischen Reiches''. In: [[Harald Kittel]], [[Juliane House]], [[Brigitte Schultze]] (Hg.): ''Traduction: encyclopédie internationale de la recherche sur la traduction''. Volume 2 = raduction : encyclopédie internationale de la recherche sur la traduction. Tome 2, W. de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2007, S. 1238-1250. Hier S. 1247.&lt;/ref&gt; Vartan Pasha died in 1879.

==''Akabi's Story''==
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Alicenk Kizkulesi.jpg|thumb|180px|Maiden's Tower in Istanbul]] --&gt;
The novel relates an impossible love story between two young people issued from different communities which cultivate hostility between each other, either latent or evident, in the true fashion of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and many other stories produced by different cultures throughout the ages. Akabi is a daughter of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Gregorian]] Armenians, and Hagop, her reciprocated lover, is a [[Catholic]]. Despite being an early novel and having been written by a male writer, Akabi character is the more prominent of the two principal heroes. Furthermore, although a Catholic himself, Vartan Pasha is totally impartial in his observations on the behavior of the characters from the two communities, advantaging neither one nor the other, and not shying away from criticizing both. The novel is rich in its number of secondary characters and in short but astute depictions of these. Nevertheless, although social issues are briefly or indirectly touched upon, the definite central theme of the novel is love. And love has a number of rules independent of the social environment from which it rose. The loved one dominates the relationship and the lover has to suffer a lot and make many efforts to reach his beloved, and this well after the brief initial period of happiness till the tragic end.

'''Vishnushastri Chiplunkar'''  (20 May 1850 – 17 March 1882) ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] : विष्णु कृष्ण चिपळूणकर) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer, whose writings have had a decisive influence on modern Marathi prose style. He was the son of the writer and scholar [[Krushnashastri Chiplunkar]].

== Life ==
Vishnushastri was born in [[Pune]] in a [[Chitpavan Brahmin]] family to the Sanskrit scholar Krishnashastri Chiplunkar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolpert|first1=Stanley A.|title=Tilak and Gokhale : revolution and reform in the making of modern India|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi|isbn=9780195623925|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=De_ftH3bm-MC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=chiplunkar+chitpavan&amp;ots=_JQBQEpavT&amp;sig=Z4W0v0FW_JMFwYfLv5CbAJUNk80#v=onepage&amp;q=chiplunkar%20chitpavan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his B.A. from [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|
Deccan College]], Pune in 1872 and worked as a schoolteacher in government schools during the years 1872-1879. In 1880, he founded (together with [[Gopal Ganesh Agarkar]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]) the newspapers [[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]] (केसरी, in Marathi) and Mahratta (in English).He was also a co-founder  [[Deccan Education Society|The New English School]] in Pune.
These institutions intended to provide a more patriotically inclined education as opposed to the schools run by the government in [[British India]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2018}}

In 1878, Chiplunkar founded another monthly named  ''Kavyetihas Sangraha'' (काव्येतिहास संग्रह) with the objective of better familiarizing the readers with the poetry and history of Maharashtra. The same year he established two printing presses, namely ''Aryabhushan Press'' (आर्यभूषण छापखाना) and ''Chitrashala'' (चित्रशाळा) press, the latter for the purpose of printing pictures of historical and spiritual figures and deities in Maharashtra.The next year, he opened a bookshop named ''Kitabkhana'' (किताबखाना), with the objective of making available inspirational books to Marathi readers.

He died in Pune of [[typhoid]] at an early age of 32 in 1882.An early biography was written by his brother Lakshmanshastri Chiplunkar

== Writings ==
His career as a writer began in 1868, with his articles in the periodical ''Shalapatrak'' (शालापत्रक, The School Paper) founded by his father. Notable in this period are the critical appraisals of the [[Sanskrit]] poets [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]], [[Bhavabhuti]], [[Bāṇabhaṭṭa|Bana]], [[Subandhu]] and [[Daṇḍin|Dandin]]. These articles introduced his readers to the 'Western' tradition of literary criticism. They were later republished as ''Sanskrit Kavipanchak'' (संस्कृत कविपंचक ). Eventually he became the editor of this periodical, however some of his articles criticizing the conduct of the British Government and [[Christian Missionaries]] proved controversial, and the ensuing  repercussions forced the closure of ''Shalapatrak''  in 1875.

In 1874, he started the monthly ''Nibandhamala''  (निबंधमाला, A Garland of Essays) for which he is principally remembered. Nearly all of the writing in the 84 issues of this periodical published in 12 years is due to him.  His range is wide, and includes subjects such as the contemporary status of the Marathi language contrasted with that of English, Sanskrit and Marathi poetry, and the propriety of using foreign words in Marathi. ''Aamachya Deshachi Sthiti''  (अामच्या देशाची स्थिती, The state of our nation) and ''Mudranasvatantrya''  (मुद्रणस्वातंत्र्य, Freedom of the press) are two of his influential political articles.

He also translated the following works into Marathi in cooperation with his father:
*[[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]]
*[[Kadambari]] by [[Banabhatta]]
*The [[Arabian Nights]] (loosely following the translation into English by [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]])

A compilation of his selected writings has been edited by Buddhisagar

Vishnushastri's Marathi prose style was moulded on the one hand by his knowledge of Sanskrit, and on the other by his extensive reading into the works of [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Joseph Addison|Addison]] and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]]. His writing is characteristic of what is usually called the ''अव्वल इंग्रजी'' (high English) period, when Marathi written syntax shows the heavy influence of long, complex sentences incorporating several subordinate clauses, prevalent in 18th and 19th century English.

He is also commonly referred to as the [[Shivaji]] of the Marathi language. However, this honorific description was first applied to Vishnushastri by himself, and in fact, was spoken by him in English.

In the Marathi film [[Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush]] on the life of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Om Raut plays the character of Vishnushastrii.

A '''Wickelphone''' is a sequence of three letters or symbols, which occur together in a [[word]].  For example, the word ''strip'' may be decomposed into a set of [[trigram]]s such as ''rip'' and ''str'' &amp;mdash; these are Wickelphones.  The term was devised by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]] in reference to the work of [[Wayne Wickelgren]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Steven Pinker]], A. Prince |title=Connections and symbols |page=89 |chapter=Language and connectionism |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-262-66064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumelhart and McClelland then extended the idea by expressing the triples in [[phonetic]] terms as '''Wickelfeatures'''.  For example, the Wickelphone ''tri'' would correspond to a Wickelfeature of "[[stop consonant|stop]], [[lateral consonant|lateral]], [[vowel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=98 |title=Social networks and historical sociolinguistics |author=Alexander Bergs |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-11-018310-8 |chapter=Personal pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''word formation''' is the creation of a new [[word]]. Word formation is sometimes contrasted with [[semantic change]], which is a change in a single word's meaning. The boundary between word formation and [[semantic change]] can be difficult to define: a new use of an old word can be seen as a new word derived from an old one and identical to it in form. See '[[conversion (word formation)|conversion]]'. 

==Types==
There are a number of methods of word formation.

===Derivation===
{{main|Morphological derivation}}

===Compounding===
{{main|Compound (linguistics)}}

===Blending===
{{main|Blend word}}
A blend is a word formed by joining parts of two words after clipping.  An example is ''smog'', which comes from ''smoke'' and ''fog'', or ''brunch'', which comes from 'breakfast' and 'lunch'.

One subcategory of blending is the reduction of a word to one of its parts, e.g., fax (facsimile), flu (influenza) and bot (robot). Such [[clipped word]]s may not retain their original meaning. For example, "playing a [[video game]] against a [[video game bot|bot]]" is not the same as "playing a video game against a [[robot]]".

===Acronym===
{{main|Acronym}}

===Calque===
{{main|Calque}}

A calque is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word or root-for-root translation. For example, the English phrase ''to lose face'' is a calque from the Chinese "丟臉/丢脸".

A subcategory of calques is the [[semantic loan]], that is, the extension of the meaning of a word to include new, foreign meanings.

===Neologism===
{{main|Neologism}}
A neologism is a process of forming a new word by coining such as [[Quark#Etymology|''quark'']].

Subcategories of neologisms include:
* The [[eponym]], a proper noun that becomes commonly used for an idea it is associated with, usually by changing its part of speech, like [[Xerox]], [[Orwellian]], and Stentorian
* The [[loanword]], a word borrowed from another language, as ''cliché'' is from French
* An [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] word, a word which imitates natural sounds, like the bird name ''[[cuckoo]]''
* Formation using [[phono-semantic matching]], that is, matching a foreign word with a [[phonetic]]ally and [[semantic]]ally similar, pre-existing native word or root

'''Word learning biases''' are certain biases or assumptions that allow children to quickly rule out unlikely alternatives in order to effectively process and learn word meanings. They begin to manifest themselves around 18 months, when children begin to rapidly expand their vocabulary. These biases are important for children with limited processing abilities if they are to be successful in [[word learning]].&lt;ref name="Markman"&gt;Markman, E. M. (1991). The whole-object, taxonomic, and mutual exclusivity assumptions as initial constraints on word meanings. In S. A. Gelman, J. P. Byrnes, S. A. Gelman, J. P. Byrnes (Eds.) , ''Perspectives on Language and Thought: Interrelations in Development'' (pp. 72-106). New York, NY US: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guiding lexical principles have been defined as implicit and explicit strategies towards [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name=Mervis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mervis | first1 = C. B. | last2 = Bertrand | first2 = J. | year = 1994 | title = Acquisition of the Novel Name-Nameless Category (N3C) principle | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 65 | issue = 6| pages = 1646–1662 | doi = 10.2307/1131285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child learns a new word they must decide whether the word refers to the whole object, part of the object, its substance, color, or texture, solving an [[Referential indeterminacy|indeterminacy]] problem.

==Whole object assumption==
One way in which children constrain the meaning of novel words is through the whole object assumption. When an adult points to an object and says a word, a child assumes this word labels the entire object, not parts or characteristics of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markman|first=Ellen M|date=1990|title=Constraints Children Place on Word Meanings|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=14|pages=57–77|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a child is shown an object and given the label "truck", the child will assume "truck" refers to the entire object instead of the tires, doors, color or other parts.&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M. B. | last2 = Markman | first2 = E. M. | year = 2009 | title = Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 592–596 | doi = 10.1037/a0014838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen Markman]] pioneered work in this field. Her studies suggest that even in cases where color or a dynamic activity are made salient to children, they will still interpret the new word as a label for whole objects.

According to [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]] [[Elizabeth Spelke]], infants' perception of the physical world is guided by three constraints on the behavior of physical objects: objects must move as wholes, objects move independently of each other, and objects move on connected paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spelke|first=Elizabeth|date=1990|title=Principles of Object Perception|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=14|pages=29–56|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three constraints help guide children's interpretations of scenes, and, in turn, explains how the whole object bias reflects the non-linguistic status of objects.&lt;ref name="Hollich"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hollich | first1 = G. | last2 = Golinkoff | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Hirsh-Pasek | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Young children associate novel words with complex objects rather than salient parts | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 1051–1061 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.5.1051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domain specificity ===
It is often questioned if the word-learning constraints are specific to the domain of language, or if they apply to other cognitive domains. As for the whole object assumption, evidence suggests that the idea of objects is more advantaged than characteristics or relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markman|first=Ellen M|date=1992|title=Constraints on word learning: speculations about their nature, origins and domain specificity|url=|journal=Modularity and constraints in language and cognition: the Minnesota Symposium on Child Psychology|volume=|pages=59–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children assume a label refers to a whole object because the object is more salient than its properties. The whole object assumption may reflect non-linguistic levels of an object and exploits the cognitive tendency to analyze the world through a whole object lens, meaning the whole object assumption can be applied to cognitive domains outside of language.

=== Criticisms ===
One popular criticism is that evidence is only provided for children 18 months and older.&lt;ref&gt;Backscheider, A. and Markman, E. M. (1990). "Young children's use of taxonomic assumptions to constrain word meanings." Unpublished manuscript, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study strengthened the breadth of ages and stimuli conditions under which this bias occurs. As early as 12 months, infants can associate words with whole objects when the objects can be viewed as two separate objects and even when one of the parts is made salient.&lt;ref name="Hollich" /&gt; Another criticism is the claim that a restricted set of stimuli has been used that possibly favors a "whole" interpretation.&lt;ref name="Hollich" /&gt; To counter this claim, the whole object assumption has been tested with adults as well. Even when participants, 18–36 years of age, were instructed that they would be tested more frequently for parts, they were better able to recognize the whole objects rather than parts. These findings support the hypothesis that there is an assumption to encode the overall shape of the stimuli in working memory rather than individual details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Bly | first2 = B. | last3 = Porcelli | first3 = A. J. | last4 = Rypma | first4 = B. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory for global, object, and part-based information | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 738–751 | doi=10.3758/bf03193311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomic assumption==
After a child constrains a novel word to label a whole object, the child must learn how to apply the label to similar objects. Ordinarily, children focus on thematic relations between objects when categorizing. For example, if given soup, children will group it together with a bowl and a spoon. Those items would be thematically related. However, when children are given a new label they shift their attention to taxonomic relationships. What this means for the previous example is instead of soup being related to a bowl or spoon, children relate it to ice cream or pudding. The new label is assumed to refer to other objects within the same taxonomic category.

[[Ellen Markman]]'s early studies showed this constraint at work. When two- and three-year-olds were presented with two basic-level objects, two different kinds of dogs, and a third thematically related object, dog food, they showed a tendency to select a dog and dog food; however, if one of the dogs was labeled with an unfamiliar word, the children were more likely to select the two dogs.&lt;ref name="Markman" /&gt; Another study conducted by Backscheider &amp; Markman attempted to clarify whether this assumption was powerful enough to overcome the preference for thematic relations when objects are engaged in dynamic thematic relations at the time of labeling. A doll was repeatedly seated in a chair when the child either heard "see the bif" or "see this". The label, "bif", caused children to pick objects of the same kind, whereas, the absence of the label caused them to organize objects to the thematic event they had witnessed. Children use this assumption as early as 18 months of age.&lt;ref name="Markman" /&gt;

Similar to the taxonomic constraint researchers have looked into the principle of categorical scope, which also follows the assumption that children will believe new object labels refer to objects within taxonomic categories.&lt;ref name="Golinkoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golinkoff | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Hirsh-Pasek | first2 = K. | last3 = Bailey | first3 = L. M. | last4 = Wenger | first4 = N. R. | year = 1992 | title = Young children extend novel words at the basic level: Evidence for the principle of categorical scope | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 494–507 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.3.494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of categorical scope and perceptual similarity can be illustrated when children learn animal names. Studies show that children think the identity of an animal only changes if its internal properties change. Children extended labels to two perceptually similar animals more often than when they were dissimilar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diesendruck | first1 = G. | last2 = Gelman | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Lebowitz | first3 = K. | year = 1998 | title = Conceptual and linguistic biases in children's word learning | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 823–839 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.34.5.823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domain specificity ===
The taxonomic assumption is very clearly applicable to cognitive domains outside of language. One obvious domain is children's inductive reasoning. An example of this assumption at work in this domain would be for a child to know that Edgar is a grandfather, and Edgar is bald, so they assume all grandfathers are bald. While there are domains that taxonomic assumptions are seen, there are also clear cognitive domains where these assumptions are avoided, such as identifying causality or [[classical conditioning]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Identifying causality obviously does not utilize the taxonomic assumption. For example, learning that you are allergic to dogs means you realize being around dogs causes your allergies to flare up. However, you do not relate this causality to taxonomic associations and claim that you are also allergic to cats. Another domain where taxonomic associations are not made is in classical conditioning. The popular example is Pavlov's dog. The dog learns to associate the bell with salivating after the dog has associated the bell with food. While these things are thematically related, they are not considered to be associated in a taxonomic fashion.

=== Criticisms ===
There aren't as many criticisms on the taxonomic assumption as there are for other word learning assumptions. However, Nelson (1988) argues against the taxonomic assumption because children aren't responding to tests 100% accurately 100% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = K | year = 1988 | title = Constraints on word learning? | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 221–246 | doi=10.1016/0885-2014(88)90010-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of have perfect accuracy every time with every participant isn't something found in most research, but Nelson claims this assumption might not be biological.

Another critique of the taxonomic assumption is that it extends past words thus should not be considered a word learning bias. In 1990, Premack conducted a taxonomic assumption experiment with chimpanzees who were being taught words and those who were not. Premack found similar results of what studies using children found—chimpanzees learning language used the taxonomic assumption. Premack claimed these chimps did not have an idea of real words since they were in the beginning of the word learning process thus making the assumption a nonlinguistic assumption. Others criticize Premack by saying this assumption can fit language but doesn't stop at language which is where the domain specificity comes in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Premack | first1 = D | year = 1990 | title = The infants' theory of self-propelled objects | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(90)90051-k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual exclusivity assumption==
The whole object assumption leads children to constraining labels to an entire object, but children must also learn labels for characteristics or parts of an object. To override the whole object assumption, children also utilize the mutual exclusivity assumption. Simply put, the mutual exclusivity assumption suggests that every object only has one name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halberda|first=Justin|date=2002|title=The development of a word-learning strategy|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=87|pages=B23-B24|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children resist assigning a label to an object for which they already have a name or at least will not learn the new name as easily. Children are then able to start considering other possibilities for the new label, for instance, a part of the object. For example, an adult presents a child with two objects, a truck and a novel object. The adult asks the child to pick up the blicket. If the child already knows "truck" but has not heard "blicket" as a label for an object, the child will assume this label maps onto the novel object.

Markman and Wachtel's 1988 studies demonstrated the learning process through the whole-object and mutual exclusivity assumption. The experimenter told three-year-old children a word and then showed them a picture. She asked whether the label referred to the whole object or a part and outlined each option with her finger. When the whole object was unfamiliar they pointed to the part in only 20% of the trials, but pointed to the part in 57% of the trials when the object was familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markman | first1 = E. M. | last2 = Wachtel | first2 = G. F. | year = 1988 | title = Children's use of mutual exclusivity to constrain the meaning of words | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 121–157 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(88)90017-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study attempted to replicate and extend these results. Hansen and Markman taught children a new word for a part of a real object by saying the word and tracing the object's contours. (These gestures were meant to remain as naturalistic as possible). They then asked children to point to the new part in order to identify if they have linked the new name to the intended part. The main manipulation was whether the object was familiar or not. Upholding the mutual exclusivity assumption children pointed to the intended part more often in the familiar object condition. Furthermore, the gesture of pointing/outlining the part itself was insufficient for children to learn the part name. Mutual exclusivity and a gesture were necessary for children to select the novel part.&lt;ref name="Hansen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markman | first1 = E. M. | last2 = Wachtel | first2 = G. F. | year = 1988 | title = Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 592–596 | doi = 10.1037/a0014838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have come up with similar principles. Clark's contrast theory holds that "every two forms contrast in meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = E. V. | year = 1988 | title = On the logic of contrast | url = | journal = Journal of Child Language | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 317–336 | doi=10.1017/s0305000900012393}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a new word is presented the child assumes it refers to something that does not yet have a label, but contrast does not take into account the overlap words may have in meaning. Golinkoff's novel name-nameless category (N3C) also states that a child will map a new name to the unnamed object when a named object is present. Unlike contrast, N3C does not require children to understand [[synonymy]], and unlike mutual exclusivity it does not hold that objects have only one name.&lt;ref name="Golinkoff" /&gt; Furthermore, this principle is not one of the first assumptions child learn mainly because, at this point, children are not dependent on an explicit link between the new word and the object (i.e. by pointing). By acquiring this principle the indirect link of seeing an unnamed object while hearing a new word is enough for the child to map the new label to the unnamed object.&lt;ref name="Mervis" /&gt;

=== Domain specificity ===
Unlike the other two constraints, mutual exclusivity is easily identified as domain-general. The mutual exclusivity assumption is the one of the three constraints that is easily generalized to other cognitive domains. Within the domain of language but outside of word-learning, mutual exclusivity is applied to the one-to-one mapping principle of language acquisition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Charles A|last2=Slobin|first2=Dan I|date=1973|title=Cognitive Prerequisites for the Development of Grammar|url=|journal=Studies of Language Development|volume=|pages=175–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the acquisition of syntax.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While it is commonly applied throughout the domain of language, mutual exclusivity seems to be a domain-general principle used in analyzing many new domains of knowledge.

=== Criticisms ===
The mutual exclusivity assumption is disputed when children learn objects can have more than one name. For example, a dog can be a "dog" and an "animal" and named "Spot." According to the mutual exclusivity assumption, one would assume children would not accept that the dog could be three different names. However, children tend to accept the differences. Merriman (1986) found that children who were introduced to both or all names initially accepted one object having multiple names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merriman | first1 = W.

The example they use is if a unique car was a "bave," children would not call it a "car.&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, W. E., &amp; Bowman, L. L. (1989). The mutual exclusivity bias in children's word learning. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 54(3-4, Serial No. 220).&lt;/ref&gt;" Just like any of the assumptions, it's hard if not impossible to tell where one assumption starts and another stops.

==Noun-category bias ==

The noun-category bias suggests that children learn nouns more quickly than any other syntactic category. It has been found to appear in young children as early as the age of two and is used to help 
children differentiate between syntactic categories such as nouns and adjectives.  Preschool-age children have been found to be inclined to interpret words from just one linguistic category- nouns. Gentner &lt;ref&gt;Gentner, D. (1982). Why nouns are learned before verbs: Linguistic relativity versus natural partitioning. In S.A. Kuczaj (Ed.), Language development: Vol. 2. Language, thought and culture (pp. 301–334). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that this might be due to the fact that nouns represent a more concrete object.

The noun-category bias places regulations on the possible interpretations that a child might attach to a newly encountered noun. Experiments from Waxman and Gelman &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waxman | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Kosowski | first2 = T. D. | year = 1990 | title = Nouns Mark Category Relations: Toddlers' and Preschoolers' Word-Learning Biases | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = 5| page = 1461 | doi=10.2307/1130756}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Markman and Hutchinson &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markman | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Hutchinson | first2 = J.E. | year = 1984 | title = Children's sensitivity to constraints on word meaning: Taxonomic vs. thematic relations | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 1–27 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(84)90002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide results which support the claim that children show preference for categorical relations over random hypothesizing when learning new nouns. This suggests a correlation between [[language and thought]] and provides evidence for the theory that syntax and semantics are related. Kauschke and Hofmeister &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauschke | first1 = Christina | last2 = Hofmeister | first2 = Christoph | year = 2002 | title = Early lexical development in German: a study on vocabulary growth and vocabulary composition during the second and third year of life | url = | journal = Journal of Child Language | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 735–57 | doi=10.1017/s0305000902005330}}&lt;/ref&gt;  divide the noun-category bias into four separate components:  (1) nouns are acquired
earlier than verbs and other word classes; (2) nouns form the majority of children’s early
vocabularies; (3) nouns in children’s early vocabulary are predominantly object labels; (4) a preference
for nouns promotes further language development.

Research has found that a noun bias exists in at least English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Hebrew, and Japanese. However, conflicting data from Korean, Mandarin, and Turkish leads researchers
to believe that the noun-category bias may be language dependent. Dhillon claims that whether or not a language displays a noun-category bias depends on a language's  [[null subject parameter]] &lt;ref&gt;Dhillon, Rajdip. 2010. Examining the “Noun Bias”: A Structural Approach.
''University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics'' 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shape bias==

The shape bias proposes that children apply names to same-shaped objects. This stems from the idea that children are associative learners that have abstract category knowledge at many different 
levels. They should be able to identify specifics of each category (e.g. pickles are round, long, green, and bumpy).&lt;ref name="Cimpian" /&gt; This knowledge aids children in categorizing newly encountered objects. The shape bias is a widely contested area of study in psycholinguistics. As of now, identically performed experiments have provided evidence that can be used to argue either for or against the shape bias. The argument is, essentially, whether or not there is a shift in language learning from perceptual to conceptual.

[[Perception]] plays a part in child development, however, it is a matter of to what extent. According to the shape bias, children would choose same-shaped object no matter which category they
belonged to.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  For example, the word cat would mean all things that are cat-shaped. The juxtaposition to this is that children refer to kinds of objects which share unforeseen properties and perceptual features. For example, the word cat would refer to the idea of cats which share a same basic, though not exact, shape and often behave similarly.

Cimpian and Markman &lt;ref name="Cimpian"/&gt;  argue for this view. Their 
research found that children were less likely to extend a shape bias when other alternative methods of categorization were offered. However,  Smith and Samuelson &lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; argue that Cimpian and Markman tested only already known lexical categories which negates the effects of simulating word learning. In addition. they argue that the shape bias is not to be considered as the exclusive tool used in word learning, only that it aids the process.

&lt;ref name="Cimpian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cimpian | first1 = A. | last2 = Markman | first2 = E. | year = 2005 | title = The absence of a shape bias in children's word learning | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 1003–1019 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.6.1003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''writing systems of [[Formosan languages]]''' are [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]-based alphabet systems. Currently there are 16 languages including 45 dialects are regulated. These systems consists of 48 symbols. However, some alphabets and symbols are used for different voices in different languages. The system was made official in 2005 and currently are still revising.

'''Yugh''' ('''Yug''') is a [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] language, closely related to [[Ket language|Ket]], formerly spoken by the [[Yugh people]], one of the southern groups along the [[Yenisei River]] in central [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name=Vajda&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was once regarded as a dialect of the [[Ket language]], which was considered to be a [[language isolate]], and was therefore called ''Sym Ket'' or ''Southern Ket''; however, the Ket considered it to be a distinct language. By the early 1990s there were only two or three non-fluent speakers remaining, and the language was virtually [[extinct]]. In the 2010 census only one ethnic Yugh was counted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab6.xls 2010 census data]&lt;/ref&gt;
