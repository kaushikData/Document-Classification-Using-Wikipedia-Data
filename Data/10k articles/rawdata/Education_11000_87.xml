'''Academia.edu''' is an American [[social networking]] website for academics.&lt;ref name=ua&gt;[http://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/some-academics-remain-skeptical-of-academia-edu/ Some academics remain skeptical of Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/|publisher=OSC|title=A social networking site is not an open access repository|date=2015-12-01|author1=Fortney, Katie|author2=Gonder, Justin|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform can be used to share papers, monitor their impact, and follow the research in a particular field. It was launched in September 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cutler|first=Kim-Mai|title=Academia.Edu Overhauls Profiles As The Onus Falls On Researchers To Manage Their Personal Brands|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/academia-edu-profiles/|publisher=Techcrunch|accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 36 million unique visitors per month as of December 2017 and over 20 million uploaded texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/about|author=Academia.edu|title=About|accessdate=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academia.edu was founded by [[Richard Price (entrepreneur)|Richard Price]], who raised $600,000 from Spark Ventures, [[HOWZAT Partners]], [[Brent Hoberman]], and others.&lt;ref name="crunchbase1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/academia-edu |title=Academia.edu &amp;#124; CrunchBase Profile |publisher=Crunchbase.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The website allows its users to create a profile, upload their work(s), select areas of interests and then the user can browse the networks of people with similar interests among the almost, as of December 2017, 58 million users from around the world.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Academia.edu's competitors include [[ResearchGate]], [[Google Scholar]] and [[Mendeley]].&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/do-academic-social-networks-share-academics-interests|title=Do academic social networks share academics' interests?|last1=Matthews|first1=David|date=7 April 2016|website=[[Times Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417100025/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/do-academic-social-networks-share-academics-interests|archive-date=2016-04-17|dead-url=no|accessdate=2016-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to ResearchGate, in 2016 Academia.edu reportedly had more registered users (about 34 million versus 11 million&lt;ref name="Bloomberg2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-15/bill-gates-backed-research-network-targets-advertising-revenues|title=Bill Gates-Backed Research Network Targets Advertising Revenue|last1=Satariano|first1=Adam|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=2016-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130040113/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-15/bill-gates-backed-research-network-targets-advertising-revenues|archive-date=2016-11-30|dead-url=no|website=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and higher web traffic, but ResearchGate was substantially larger in terms of active usage by researchers.&lt;ref name="THE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nature140813"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Van Noorden|first1=Richard|date=13 August 2014|title=Online collaboration: Scientists and the social network|url=http://www.nature.com/news/online-collaboration-scientists-and-the-social-network-1.15711|dead-url=no|journal=|volume=512|issue=7513|pages=126–129|doi=10.1038/512126a|pmid=25119221|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026152432/http://www.nature.com/news/online-collaboration-scientists-and-the-social-network-1.15711|archive-date=2014-10-26|accessdate=2014-11-06|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|df=}}Quote 1: ResearchGate is certainly well-known [...] More than 88% of scientists and engineers said that they were aware of it.

Quote 2: "They do send you a lot of spam," [Billie Swalla] says

Quote 3: [...] regularly sending out automated e-mails that profess to come from colleagues active on the site

Quote 4: "I think it is a disgraceful kind of marketing and I am choosing not to use their service because of that", [Lars Arvestad] says

Quote 5: "I've met basically no academics in my field with a favourable view of ResearchGate", says Daniel MacArthur

Quote 6: Some of the apparent profiles on the site are not owned by real people, but are created automatically – and incompletely – by scraping details of people's affiliations, publication records and PDFs

Quote 7: That annoys researchers who do not want to be on the site, and who feel that the pages misrepresent them – especially when they discover that ResearchGate will not take down the pages when asked.

Quote 8: [Madisch] will not say how many of [the papers available on ResearchGate] have been automatically scraped from freely accessible places elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that ResearchGate restricts its user accounts to people at recognized institutions and published researchers may explain the disparity in active usage, as a high percentage of the accounts on Academia.edu are lapsed or inactive.&lt;ref name="THE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nature140813" /&gt;

==Open science==
Academia.edu claims it supports the [[open science]] or [[open access]] movements and, in particular, instant distribution of research, and a [[Peer review|peer-review]] system that occurs alongside distribution, instead of prior to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Richard Price |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/ |title=The Future of Peer Review |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-02-05 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the company stated its opposition to the proposed (since withdrawn) 2011 U.S. [[Research Works Act]], which would have prevented open-access mandates in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Richard Price |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/the-dangerous-research-works-act/ |title=The Dangerous "Research Works Act" |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Academia.edu is not an [[open access repository]] and is not recommended as a way to pursue [[green open access]] by [[Peter Suber]] and experts, who instead invite researchers to use field-specific repositories or general-purpose repositories like [[Zenodo]].&lt;ref name=OSC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Access book §10 self help |url= https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/?title=Open_Access_%28the_book%29&amp;oldid=5242#Chapter_10:_Self-Help |author=Peter Suber |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain name ==
Academia.edu is not a university or institution for higher learning and so under current standards it would not qualify for the ".edu" [[top-level domain]].  However, the domain name "Academia.edu" was registered in 1999, prior to the regulations requiring .edu domain names to be held solely by accredited post-secondary institutions. All .edu domain names registered prior to 2001 were [[.edu#Grandfathered uses|grandfathered in]], even if not an accredited post-secondary institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/eligibility.asp |title=edu Policy Information |publisher=Net.educause.edu |date=2001-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6G1XUuMML?url=http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/eligibility.asp |archive-date=2013-04-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web|author=McKenna, Laura|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/the-convoluted-profits-of-academic-publishing/421047/|title=The Convoluted Profits of Academic Publishing|work=The Atlantic|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A  critic, [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]], the Director of Scholarly Communication at the [[Modern Language Association]], said she finds the use of the ".edu" domain name by Academia.edu to be "extremely problematic", since the domain name might mislead users into thinking the site is part of an accredited educational institution rather than a for-profit company.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;

On its filings with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the company uses the legal name Academia Inc.&lt;ref name="UC"&gt;{{cite web|title=A social networking site is not an open access repository|url=http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/|publisher=University of California Office of Scholarly Communication|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial history ==
In November 2011, Academia.edu raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures.&lt;ref name="crunchbase1"/&gt; Prior to that, it had raised $2.2 million from Spark Ventures and a range of [[angel investor]]s including [[Mark Shuttleworth]], Thomas Lehrman, and [[Rupert Pennant-Rea]].&lt;ref name="crunchbase1"/&gt; In September 2013, the company raised $11.1 million from Khosla Ventures, True Ventures, Spark Ventures, Spark Capital and Rupert Pennant-Ream,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/about|title=About Academia.edu|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate= 23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing its total equity funding to $17.7 million.&lt;ref name="UC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academia.edu|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/academia-edu#/entity|publisher=Crunchbase|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Many academics are happy about the increased publicity their research can garner due to the website, but some are worried about the effect on research and science in general, especially since Academia.edu refuses to make its business model public.&lt;ref name=ua/&gt; ''[[TechCrunch]]'' remarked that Academia.edu gives academics a "powerful, efficient way to distribute their research"&lt;ref name="techcrunch1"&gt;{{cite web|author = |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/30/academia-edu-raises-4-5-million-to-help-researchers-share-their-scholarly-papers/ |title=Academia.edu Raises $4.5 Million To Help Researchers Share Their Scholarly Papers |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/11/academia-edu-4-5m-in-funding-3m-unique-monthly-visitors-%E2%80%93-can-they-change-science-publication/ |title=Academia.edu – $4.5M in Funding, 3M Unique Monthly Visitors – Can They Change Science Publication? |publisher=Singularity Hub |date=2011-12-11 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6G1XTMlPo?url=http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/11/academia-edu-4-5m-in-funding-3m-unique-monthly-visitors-%E2%80%93-can-they-change-science-publication/ |archive-date=2013-04-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that it "will let researchers keep tabs on how many people are reading their articles with specialized analytics tools", and "also does very well in [[Google search]] results".&lt;ref name="techcrunch1"/&gt;
Academia.edu seems to reflect a combination of social networking norms and academic norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/asi.23038| title = Academia.edu: Social network or Academic Network?| journal = Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology| volume = 65| issue = 4| pages = 721| year = 2014| last1 = Thelwall | first1 = M. | last2 = Kousha | first2 = K. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.308.6099}} [http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/Academia_preprint.pdf Preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

Months after its acquisition of Academia.edu rival [[Mendeley]], [[Elsevier]] sent thousands of [[takedown notice]]s to Academia.edu, a practice that has since ceased, following widespread complaint by academics, according to Academia.edu founder and chief executive Richard Price.&lt;ref name="Parr2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parr|first1=Chris|title=Sharing is a way of life for millions on Academia.edu|journal=Times Higher Education|date=June 12, 2014|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sharing-is-a-way-of-life-for-millions-on-academiaedu/2013839.article?nopaging=1 |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=Jennifer|title=Posting Your Latest Article?

=== Criticism ===
In early 2016, some users reported having received e-mails from Academia.edu where they were asked if they would be interested in paying a fee to have their papers recommended by the website's editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Scholars-Criticize/235102|title=Scholars Criticize Academia.edu Proposal to Charge Authors for Recommendations|date=2016-01-29|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led some users to start a campaign encouraging users to cancel their Academia.edu accounts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/02/01/should-you-deleteacademiaedu|title=Should you #DeleteAcademiaEdu? On the role of commercial services in scholarly communication.|date=2016-02-01|newspaper=Impact of Social Sciences|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include the fact that Academia.edu uses a "vendor lock-in" model: "It's up to Academia.edu to decide what you can and can't do with the information you've given them, and they're not likely to make it easy for alternative methods to access".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in reference to the fact that, although papers can be read by non-users, a free account is needed in order to download papers: "you need to be logged in to do most of the useful things on the site (even as a casual reader)".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A registered user, in order to use advanced search on the site and several other functions, needs to subscribe to premium ($100- per year, or $10- per month) as explained on the site when using basic title search. 

In December 2016, Academia.edu announced new premium features that includes data analytics on work and the professional rank of the viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@academia/how-do-people-find-your-papers-academia-edu-introduces-a-new-premium-feature-8b221176f57f|title=How do people find your papers?

Under an Act passed by the [[UK Parliament]] in 1931, there was established an '''Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK)''', referred to in the Act as "the Council".  The constitution of the Council was prescribed by the First Schedule to the Act.  The Act made the Council a body corporate by the name '''Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom'''.  It was habitually referred to colloquially by the [[acronym]] '''ARCUK'''.

When the [[Warne Report]] was published in 1993, it was found that its principal recommendation was abolition of this body.  Instead, after a consultation process conducted by the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] this body has been reconstituted and renamed as the [[Architects Registration Board]].  It now operates under the [[Architects Act 1997]].

==The statutory Register==

The originating Act was the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]].  Its [[long title]] was "An Act to provide for the Registration of Architects and for purposes connected therewith".  It stated that the Council's duty was to set up and maintain a register, referred to in the Act as "the [[Register of Architects]]".  The Act required the Council to cause to be entered in the Register the name and address of every person entitled to be registered under the Act, and annually to publish and offer for sale copies of the Register, setting forth the names of the registered persons in alphabetical order according to their [[surnames]], with their regular business address.

Hard bound copies of all volumes in the annual series so produced, from volume 1 for 1933 and continuing into the years after the name of the registration body was changed to the [[Architects Registration Board]], have been available for inspection by members of the public at the [[British Architectural Library]] of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], London.

==Qualification==

For ascertaining whether a person who claimed to be entitled to be registered was duly qualified, the Act required the Council to appoint annually a [[Board of Architectural Education]] referred to in the Act as "the Board", and a committee referred to in the Act as "the Admissions Committee".

The constitution of the Board was prescribed by the Second Schedule to the Act.  By the Act two duties were ascribed to the Board, namely, to hold examinations in architecture in accordance with the Act, and to make recommendations to the Council in two respects, namely:
* the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board, to qualify persons for registration under the Act; and
* the holding of any examination in architecture which ought, in the opinion of the Board, to be passed by applicants for registration under the Act.

The constitution of the Admissions Committee was prescribed in the Third Schedule to the Act.  The duty ascribed by the Act to the Admissions Committee was to consider every application for registration under the Act and to report thereon to the Council as to whether the applicant was, in the opinion of the Committee, qualified for registration.

Before a person who had duly applied to the Council could become entitled to be registered, the Act required the Council to be satisfied on a report of the Admission Committee that the applicant was qualified in one of four respects, namely:
* membership of the [[Royal Academy]] or of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]; or
* practising as an [[architect]] in the [[United Kingdom]] at the commencement of the Act; or
* having passed any examination in architecture which was for the time being recognised by the Council; or
* possessing "the prescribed qualifications".
The Council was required to make regulations in respect of anything which by the Act was to be prescribed, but no regulations of the Council were to be of any force or validity without the prior approval of the [[Privy Council]].

Among other things, [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996|the 1996 Act]] abolished the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]] and the Admissions Committee (subsection 118(2)).

==Restrictions on use of "architect"==

The [[long title]] of the originating Act of 1931 was "An Act to provide for the Registration of architects and for purposes connected therewith".  By subsection 3(3) of this Act the register which the Council was required to set up, maintain and publish annually was to be called the Register of Registered Architects; and under section 10 of the originating Act persons who were entitled to apply for registration could thereby claim "to take and use the name of 'Registered Architect'" as a statutory right, with effect from 1932.

By subsection 3(3) of the Architects Registration Act, 1938 the name of this statutory register was changed to the [[Register of Architects]], and this continues under the [[Architects Act 1997]].

The change of name was made in connection with the introduction of statutory restrictions on the use of the vernacular word "architect", which were to apply to all persons, including fully qualified practising members of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) or other chartered bodies of architects, or societies or associations.  This innovation was imposed under threat of [[Sentence (law)|penalty]] on [[prosecution]] in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates Courts]] for infringement.

==Professional conduct==

The Discipline Committee which was constituted under the 1931 Act was abolished under subsection 118(2) of the 1996 Act.  Instead there is a Professional Conduct Committee which operates under Part III of the 1997 Act.

The object of the game is to [[Scoring in association football|score]] by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.

Association football is one of a family of [[Football|football codes]], which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] were originally codified in England by [[The Football Association]].

Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] within the [[penalty area]]. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into [[extra time]] or a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] depending on the format of the competition. Association football is governed internationally by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA; {{lang-fr|Fédération Internationale de Football Association}}), which organises World Cups for both [[FIFA World Cup|men]] and [[FIFA Women's World Cup|women]] every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314003412/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0%2C3509%2C10%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2005 |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |publisher=FIFA |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century: "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe".&lt;ref name="Octavian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/hudson-octavian|title=Octavian - Robbins Library Digital Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states that the "rules of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101162441/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=football|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|date=1 January 2017|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''soccer'' comes from a slang or jocular abbreviation of the word "association", with the suffix "-er" appended to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-soccer/|title=What's the origin of the word "soccer"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''soccer'' (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of ''socca.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/soccer#etymonline_v_23809|title=soccer {{!}} Origin and meaning of soccer by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[English-speaking world]], association football is now usually called "football" in the United Kingdom and mainly "soccer" in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/Soccer-to-become-football-in-Australia/2004/12/16/1102787198357.html|title=Soccer to become football in Australia|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[FIFA]], the Chinese competitive game ''[[cuju]]'' (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball")&lt;!--transliterated as Tsu' Chu in ref--&gt; is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.&lt;ref name="fifa-or"/&gt; ''Cuju'' players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to [[rugby football|rugby]] occurred.&lt;ref name="abd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|title=Football For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGy_QNv-J4oC&amp;pg=PT33|date=30 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-66440-7|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFAClassicFootball|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), ''cuju'' games were standardised and rules were established.&lt;ref name="abd"/&gt;

Association football in itself does not have a classical history.&lt;ref name=bangkokpost/&gt; Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html |title=Classic Football History of the Game |publisher=FIFA |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely [[English public school football games|varying forms of football]] played in the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] of England. The history of football in England dates back to [[medieval football|at least the eighth century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Football&amp;nbsp;– Britain, the home of Football | publisher=FIFA| url = https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame2.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701210540/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame2.html| archivedate = 1 July 2007 | accessdate =20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cambridge Rules]], first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |page=126 |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=0-415-35018-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to formation of a [[Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In 1862, [[J. C. Thring|John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Winner |date=28 March 2005 | title = The hands-off approach to a man's game |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html |accessdate=7 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [[The Football Association]] (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] in [[Great Queen Street]], London.&lt;ref name="FAhistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the FA |publisher=Football Association (FA) |url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/history |accessdate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.&lt;ref name="FAhistory"/&gt; These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Percy M.|year=1964|title=Football in Sheffield|pages=28–29|publisher=S.

The world's oldest football competition is the [[FA Cup]], which was founded by [[C. W. Alcock]] and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The [[1872 Scotland vs England football match|first official international football match]] also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in [[Glasgow]], again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first [[The Football League|football league]], which was founded in [[Birmingham]] in 1888 by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Football League |publisher=The Football League |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501121005/http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1357277%2C00.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original format contained 12 clubs from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Northern England]].

The laws of the game are determined by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IFAB|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/aboutifab.html|publisher=FIFA |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board was formed in 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International FA Board |publisher=FIFA |url=http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,3,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422035010/http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0%2C3504%2C3%2C00.html |archivedate=22 April 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a meeting in [[Manchester]] of The Football Association, the [[Scottish Football Association]], the [[Football Association of Wales]], and the [[Irish Football Association]]. [[FIFA]], the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.&lt;ref name=Wherebegan/&gt; The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the [[International Football Association Board]] in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.&lt;ref name="IFAB works"/&gt;

Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world.

In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]], local communities, and even nations. R.

====Early women's football====

Women may have been playing "football" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ([[Tsu Chu]]) was played by women during the [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.&lt;ref name="globalgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Genesis of the Global Game |work=The Global Game |url=http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html |accessdate=22 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521234151/http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html |archivedate=21 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.&lt;ref name="footballnetwork"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chinese and Tsu Chu | work=The Football Network | url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history1.asp | accessdate=1 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.&lt;ref name="SFA"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Women's Football|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=18 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308172042/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|archivedate=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12080678.display/|title=A game of two sexes|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=8 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.&lt;ref name="FA"/&gt; The first match recorded by the [[Scottish Football Association]] took place in 1892 in [[Glasgow]].

The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist [[Nettie Honeyball]] in England in 1894. It was named the [[British Ladies' Football Club]]. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, "I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of [[Feminism|emancipation]], and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in [[Parliament]] and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." &lt;ref name="Nettie Honeyball"&gt;{{cite web | title=Women's involvement with soccer was part of the emancipation process | work=SoccerTimes | url=http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1999/jul20.htm | accessdate=4 May 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116204454/http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1999/jul20.htm | archivedate=16 November 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mårtensson|first=Stefan|title=Branding women's football in a field of hegemonic masculinity|journal=Entertainment and Sports Law Journal|date=June 2010|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Women's football match Menai Bridge against Penrhos (24622680915).jpg|thumb|A Welsh women's football team pose for a photograph in 1959]]
Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]], when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies]] of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston, England]]. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from [[Paris]], France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.&lt;ref name="SFA"/&gt;

Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leighton|first1=Tony|title=FA apologies for 1921 ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/11/newsstory.womensfootball|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when [[The Football Association]] outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witzig|first1=Richard|title=The Global Art of Soccer|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|isbn=0977668800|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=1921+fa+ban#v=onepage&amp;q=1921%20fa%20ban|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4603149.stm|title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football|date=3 June 2005|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the [[English Ladies Football Association]] and play moved to [[rugby football|rugby]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newsham|first1=Gail|title=In a League of Their Own. The Dick, Kerr Ladies 1917-1965|date=2014|publisher=Paragon Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/no-longer-the-game-of-two-halves.19185657 |title=No longer the game of two-halves |work=The Herald |publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |first=Alan |last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt; It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4607171.stm |title=How women's football battled for survival |last=Gregory |first=Patricia |work=BBC sport |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent [[team sport]] for British women.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt;

====20th and 21st century====
The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both [[Women's football around the world|national]] and [[international competitions in women's football|international]] level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a "golden age" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4603149.stm |title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football |last=Alexander |first=Shelley |work=BBC sport |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt; The [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/awards/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044344/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament%3D103/awards/index.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Tournaments: Women's World Cup |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=11 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while women's football has been an Olympic event [[football at the 1996 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Women's tournament|since 1996]].

[[File:U20-WorldCup2007-Okotie-Onka edit2.jpg|thumb|A goalkeeper saving a close-range shot from inside the penalty area]]

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. The game is played using a spherical ball of {{convert|68|–|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} circumference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ Circumference - FIFA Quality Programme&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119053959/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ |date=19 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''[[Ball (association football)|football]]'' (or ''soccer ball''). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a [[Captain (association football)|captain]] who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]].&lt;ref name="laws51-52"/&gt;

The primary law is that players other than [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]] may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, "heading" with the forehead)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expertfootball.com/wp/heading/ |title=How to head a football |accessdate=3 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101215132821/http://expertfootball.com/training/heading.php| archivedate= 15 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than their hands or arms.&lt;ref name="fouls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 12) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011115718/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] position.&lt;ref name="offsidelaw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 11&amp;nbsp;– Offside |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20121209 PSG-Juvisy - Kenza Dali 04.jpg|thumb|A player executing a slide [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] to dispossess an opponent]]
During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]] the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.&lt;ref name="restart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 8) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142456/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005–06 season]] of the English [[Premier League]] produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England Premiership (2005/2006) |work=''Sportpress.com'' |url=http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023234/http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,&lt;ref name=LAW301&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Number of Players) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142527/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of [[association football positions|specialised roles]] have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: [[Striker (association football)|strikers]], or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm |title=Positions guide, Who is in a team? |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 September 2007 | date=1 September 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061105213730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm| archivedate=5 November 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of a team's players is known as a ''[[Formation (association football)|formation]]''.

==Laws==
{{redirects here|Rules of football|the rules of other football games|Football}}
{{main|Laws of the Game (association football)}}
There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| title=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=2 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901044035/http://fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| archivedate= 1 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.

===Players, equipment, and officials===
{{See also|Association football positions|Formation (association football)|Kit (association football)}}
[[File:Howard Webb3.jpg|thumb|The [[referee (association football)|referee]] officiates in a football match]]
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (association football)|substitutes]]), one of whom must be the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [[penalty area]] in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [[association football positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.&lt;ref name=LAW301/&gt;

The basic equipment or ''[[Kit (association football)|kit]]'' players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate [[shin guard]]s. An [[jockstrap|athletic supporter]] and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strikingeagles.tripod.com/health_advice_for_boys.htm |title=Health Advice for Boys |publisher=Strikingeagles.tripod.com |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.leagueathletics.com/Images/Club/6097/The%20Prevention%20of%20injuries.pdf |title=Soccer Position Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association football headgear|Headgear]] is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's biggest headache|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/03/12/58c54bab268e3e64368b45a8.html|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Marca|location=Spain|date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 4–Players' Equipment) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141601/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three in ninety minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in [[exhibition game|friendly matches]]. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or [[timewasting]] at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Substitution procedure) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144947/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFAB recommends "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team." Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 3&amp;nbsp;– The Number of Players |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Match officials}}
A game is officiated by a [[referee (association football)|referee]], who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referees]]. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]] who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 5–The referee) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141909/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goal line technology]] is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining if a goal has or hasn't been scored, this was brought in to prevent there being controversy. [[Video assistant referee]] (VAR) has also been increasingly introduced to assist officials through video replay to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.&lt;ref name="protocol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knvb.nl/downloads/bestand/9844/var-handbook-summary |title=Video Assistant Referees (VARs) Experiment – Protocol (Summary) |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |date=26 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ball===
{{main|Ball (association football)}}

The ball is spherical with a circumference of between {{convert|68|and|70|cm|in}}, a weight in the range of {{convert|410|to|450|g|oz}}, and a pressure between {{convert|8.5|and|15.6|psi|bar|1|order=flip|lk=on|abbr=off}} &lt;!-- rounding and flipped to get the values to equal FIFA's --&gt; at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2013/2014|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en%5fneutral.pdf|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing/|title=Football manufacturing|work=FIFA quality program|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=3 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904193101/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing|archivedate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch===
{{Main|Football pitch}}
[[File:Football pitch metric.svg|thumb|Standard pitch measurements ([[:File:Football pitch imperial.svg|See Imperial version]])]]
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [[IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [[metrication]] (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will we ever go completely metric? |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3934353.stm |date=2 September 2004 |last=Summers |first=Chris |accessdate=7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3934353.stm| archivedate= 10 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110&amp;nbsp;m (110–120&amp;nbsp;yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75&amp;nbsp;m (70–80&amp;nbsp;yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120&amp;nbsp;m (100–130&amp;nbsp;yd) length and 45–90&amp;nbsp;m (50–100&amp;nbsp;yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105&amp;nbsp;m (344&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 68&amp;nbsp;m (223&amp;nbsp;ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/media/news/newsid=707751/|title=Goal-line technology put on ice |publisher=FIFA |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref for last sentence only --&gt; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf |title=FIFA Amendments to the Laws of the Game, 2008 |publisher=FIFA |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer boundary lines are ''touchlines'', while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ''goal lines''. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.1–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142202/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm| archivedate = 13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be {{convert|24|ft|m}} apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.4–The Field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144942/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-offs]], goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.3–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011084145/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration and tie-breaking methods===
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.&lt;ref name="rule7.2"/&gt; The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called ''additional time'' in FIFA documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721055324/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2012|title=Interpretation of the Laws of the Game&amp;nbsp;– Law 07|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_7_the_duration_of_the_match_en_47401.pdf|title=Law 7 - The Duration of the Match|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is most commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', while ''lost time'' can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is [[Ball in and out of play|out of play]], and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football reforms: Scrapping 45-minute half to be debated at Ifab|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40311889|accessdate=7 March 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.&lt;ref name="rule7.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.2–The duration of the match) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144952/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90&amp;nbsp;minutes had elapsed and the game was over.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sunday Times]] ''Illustrated History of Football'' Reed International Books Limited 1996. p.11 {{ISBN|1-85613-341-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_03.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019042952/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_03.htm |archivedate=19 October 2007 |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.3–The duration of the match) |accessdate=3 March 2010 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Didier Drogba Manuel Neuer last penalty kick Champions League Final 2012.jpg|thumb|Some football competitions use a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw]]
In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke [[Replay (sports)|replays]].&lt;ref&gt;For example in the [[FA Cup]] prior to the semi-finals.&lt;/ref&gt; A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).&lt;ref name="laws51-52"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Procedures to determine the winner of a match or home-and-away |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitions using [[two-legged match]]es, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the [[away goals rule]] may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.&lt;ref name="laws51-52"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the [[IFAB]] experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (''[[golden goal]]''), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (''[[silver goal]]''). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was [[France national football team|France]]'s victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in 1998. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the final of [[Euro 1996]]. Silver goal was used in [[Euro 2004]]. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Time running out for silver goal |publisher=Rediff.com |agency=Reuters | url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm | last=Collett |first=Mike | date = 2 July 2004 | accessdate =7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102232630/http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm| archivedate= 2 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ball in and out of play===
{{Main|Ball in and out of play}}

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each [[playing period]] with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

===Misconduct===
{{main|Foul (association football)}}

====On-field====
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and used consistently since.}}
A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].&lt;ref name="fouls"/&gt;

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution ([[Penalty card|yellow card]]) or dismissal ([[Penalty card|red card]]). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.&lt;ref name="fouls"/&gt;

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |title=Referee's signals: advantage |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 5: The Referee: Advantage |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Laws of the Game |chapter=Law 5: The Referee|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=5 May 2012 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.

====Off-field====
{{see also|Foul (association football)#Post-match}}
Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, [[Doping in sport|doping]], [[Age fraud in association football|age fraud]] and [[match fixing]]. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.&lt;ref name=FAsuspensions&gt;For example, see [[The Football Association]]'s rules regarding player suspensions in FA competitions: {{cite web|title=DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx |publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.{{efn|For example, the [[English Premier League]] fined and levied an 8-match suspension on [[Luis Suárez]] for [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|racially abusing]] [[Patrice Evra]]}} Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.&lt;ref name=FAsuspensions/&gt;

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the [[English Football League]]  deduct 12 points from any team that enters [[Administration (British football)|financial administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football League administration penalty raised to 12 points|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33027933|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.

==Governing bodies==
{{See also|Association football around the world}}
[[File:FIFA-Headquarter.jpg|thumb| Headquarters of [[FIFA]], the world governing body of football]]
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]]) is [[FIFA]]. The FIFA headquarters are located in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:&lt;ref name="confeds"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/confederations/ |title=Confederations |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asia: [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC)
* Africa: [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF)
* Europe: [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)
* North/Central America &amp; Caribbean: [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF)
* Oceania: [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC)
* South America: [[CONMEBOL|Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol]] (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the [[Fédération Camerounaise de Football]] in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the [[Scottish Football Association]] in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.&lt;ref name="confeds"/&gt;

While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the [[International Football Association Board]], where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.&lt;ref name="IFAB works"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/aboutifab.html |title=The IFAB: How it works |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competitions==
{{main|List of association football competitions}}
[[File:Roman Weidenfeller World Cup 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[FIFA World Cup]] is the largest international competition in association football]]
The major international competition in football is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to [[World War II]]. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.{{efn|The number of competing teams has varied over the history of the competition. The most recent changed was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], from 24 to 32.}} The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the [[Olympic Games]]; the cumulative audience of all matches of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]], a ninth of the entire population of the planet.&lt;ref name="2006coverage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/marketing/news/newsid=111247/index.html |title=2006 FIFA World Cup broadcast wider, longer and farther than ever before |publisher=FIFA |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dunmore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage Historical Dictionary of Soccer], page 235, quote "The World Cup is now the most-watched sporting event in the world on television, above even the Olympic Games."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dobson and John Goddard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GxyG0XXdvR4C&amp;pg=PA407#v=onepage The Economics of Football], page 407, quote "The World Cup is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world: the estimated cumulative television audience for the 2006 World Cup in Germany was 26.2 billion, an average of 409 million viewers per match."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn M. Wong, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEELS7T_Tm0C&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage The Comprehensive Guide to Careers in Sports], page 144, quote "The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event in the world. In 2006, more than 30 billion viewers in 214 countries watched the World Cup on television, and more than 3.3 million spectators attended the 64 matches of the tournament."&lt;/ref&gt; The current champion is [[France national football team|France]], which won its second title at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 tournament]] in Russia. [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] has been held every four years since [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]]. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year [[FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|qualification phase]]. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]], after winning their third title in the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]].

There has been a [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at every Summer Olympic Games since [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], except at the 1932 games in [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/football-equipment-and-history?tab=1 |title=Football Equipment and History |publisher=International Olympic Committee (IOC) |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.&lt;ref name=Wherebegan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,4,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608215029/http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0%2C3504%2C4%2C00.html |archivedate=8 June 2007 |title=Where it all began |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the [[Soviet Bloc]] countries of [[Eastern Europe]], where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Games]], the [[IOC]] decided to admit professional players. [[FIFA]] still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and [[CONCACAF]] to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting [[UEFA]] and [[CONMEBOL]] teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympics.sportinglife.com/olympics/story/0,23911,14986,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430181217/http://olympics.sportinglife.com/olympics/story/0%2C23911%2C14986%2C00.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Event Guide&amp;nbsp;– Football |work=sportinglife |publisher=365 media group |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torres, Mata and Ramos Euro 2012 trophy 01.jpg|thumb|Spanish footballers celebrating winning the [[UEFA European Championship]]]]
After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] (UEFA), the [[Copa América]] (CONMEBOL), [[African Cup of Nations]] (CAF), the [[Asian Cup]] (AFC), the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (CONCACAF) and the [[OFC Nations Cup]] (OFC). The [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current [[FIFA World Cup]] champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the [[UEFA Champions League]] in Europe and the [[Copa Libertadores]] in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organising Committee strengthens FIFA Club World Cup format |publisher=FIFA |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid=570740.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531094715/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid%3D570740.html |archivedate=31 May 2008 |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic competitions==
{{Main|Geography of association football|Geography of women's association football}}
[[File:David Villa in Clasico.jpg|thumb|upright|A 2011 Spanish [[La Liga]] match between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. This fixture, known as ''[[El Clásico]]'', is one of the most renowned in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMahon|first1=Bobby|title=El Clásico Is A Must-See Game, But Is Its Global Audience Overstated?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2017/12/21/el-clasico-is-a-not-to-be-missed-game-but-dont-believe-the-viewing-figures-youre-told/|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Forbes|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system]]s in a [[Domestic association football season|domestic season]], normally comprising several [[division (sport)|divisions]], in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [[Table (information)|tables]], placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to a lower division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scottish Journal of Political Economy |last=Fort |first=Rodney |date=September 2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1111/1467-9485.00172 |journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in [[List of association football competitions|international club competitions]] in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]] (Spanish for ''Opening'' and ''Closing''), awarding a champion for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/Estudiantes-win-Argentina-Apertura-title |title=Estudiantes win Argentina Apertura title |date=13 December 2010 |publisher=Fox Sports |agency=Associated Press |quote=Under the system used in Argentina and most of Latin America, two season titles are awarded each year&amp;nbsp;– the Apertura and Clausura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a [[single elimination tournament|knock-out]] basis.

Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and most of women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues&amp;nbsp;– the [[Bundesliga]] (Germany), [[Premier League]] (England),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7321408.stm |work=BBC Sport |title= Premier League conquering Europe |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008 | first=Ian | last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Liga]] (Spain), [[Serie A]] (Italy), and [[Ligue 1]] (France)&amp;nbsp;– attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Louise |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/29/premierleague |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Leading clubs losing out as players and agents cash in |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants and casual play==
{{see also|Variants of association football|Street football}}
[[File:O Jogo Bonito (The Beautiful Game).webm|thumb|To many, football is more than just a sport: a video short on the many styles and ethnicities who play football.]]
Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. [[five-a-side football]]) play in non-field environments (i.e. [[beach soccer]], [[indoor soccer]], and [[futsal]]) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. [[paralympic association football]]).

[[Street football|Casual games]] can be played with only minimal equipment&amp;nbsp;– a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.

The '''burning of books and burying of scholars''' ({{zh|t=焚書坑儒|s=焚书坑儒|p=fénshū kēngrú}}) refers to the supposed [[Book burning|burning of texts]] in 213 [[BCE]] and [[live burial]] of 460 Confucian scholars in 212 BCE by the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] of the [[Qin dynasty]] of [[Imperial China]]. The event caused the loss of many philosophical treatises of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. The official philosophy of government ("[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]") survived.

Modern scholars doubt the details of the story in the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''—the main source—since [[Sima Qian]], the author, wrote a century or so after the events and was an official of the [[Han dynasty]], which could be expected to portray the previous rulers unfavorably. While it is clear that the First Emperor gathered and destroyed many works which he regarded as subversive, two copies of each school were to be preserved in imperial libraries. These were destroyed in the fighting following the fall of the dynasty. It is now believed that there likely was an incident, but they were not Confucians and were not "buried alive."{{sfnp|Goldin|2005|p=151}}{{sfnb|Nylan|2001|pp = 29-30}}{{sfnb|Kern|2010|pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qY32-zfTU9AC&amp;dq=cambridge+history+of+china+burning+books&amp;q=%22status+of+the+Classics%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22status%20of%20the%20Classics%22&amp;f=false 111-112]}}

===Punishing of the scholars===

According to the [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (Shiji), after [[Qin Shi Huangdi]], the first [[emperor of China]], unified China in 221 BCE, his [[Chancellor of China|chancellor]] [[Li Si]] suggested suppressing intellectual discourse to unify thought and political opinion. 
{{quote|Chancellor Li Si Said: "I, your servant, propose that all historians' records other than those of [[Qin (state)|Qin]]'s be burned. With the exception of the academics whose duty includes possessing books, if anyone [[all under heaven|under heaven]] has copies of the ''[[Shi Jing]]'' [Classic of Poetry], the ''[[Shujing]]'' [Classic of History], or the writings of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought|hundred schools of philosophy]], they shall deliver them (the books) to the governor or the commandant for burning. Anyone who dares to discuss the ''Shi Jing'' or the ''Classic of History'' shall be publicly executed. Anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed. Any official who sees the violations but fails to report them is equally guilty. Anyone who has failed to burn the books after thirty days of this announcement shall be subjected to tattooing and be sent to build the [[Great Wall]]. The books that have exemption are those on medicine, divination, agriculture, and forestry. Those who have interest in laws shall instead study from officials."{{efn|相李斯曰：「臣請史官非秦記皆燒之。非博士官所職，天下敢有藏詩、書、百家語者，悉詣守、尉雜燒之。有敢偶語詩書者棄市。以古非今者族。吏見知不舉者與同罪。令下三十日不燒，黥為城旦。所不去者，醫藥卜筮種樹之書。若欲有學法令，以吏為師。}}&lt;br&gt;{{mdash}}''Shiji'' Chapter 6. "The Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin" thirty-fourth year (213 BC)}}

Three categories of books were viewed by Li Si to be most dangerous politically. These were poetry (particularly the ''Shi Jing''), history (''Shujing'' and especially historical records of other states than Qin), and philosophy. The ancient collection of poetry and historical records contained many stories concerning the ancient virtuous rulers. Li Si believed that if the people were to read these works they were likely to invoke the past and become dissatisfied with the present. The reason for opposing various schools of philosophy was that they advocated political ideas often incompatible with the totalitarian regime.{{sfnp|Chan|1972|pp=105-107}}

====Consequences====
The extent of the damage to Chinese intellectual heritage is difficult to assess, for details have not been recorded in history. Several facts, however, indicate that the consequences of this event, although enduring, had not been extensive. First, it is recorded in Li Si's memorial that all technological books were to be spared. Secondly, even the "objectionable" books, poetry and philosophy in particular, were preserved in imperial archives and allowed to be kept by the official scholars.{{sfnp|Chan|1972|p=106}}

Of the various categories of books mentioned, history suffered one of the greatest losses of its ancient time. Extremely few state history books before Qin have survived. Li Si stated that all history books not in the Qin interpretation were to be burned. It is not clear whether copies of these books were actually burned or allowed to stay in the imperial archives. Even if some histories were preserved, they possibly would have been destroyed in 206 B.C. when enemies captured and burnt the Qin imperial palaces in which the archives were most likely located.{{sfnp|Chan|1972|p=107}}

====Later book burnings====
At the end of the Qin, the [[Epang Palace]]'s national records were destroyed by fire. Tang dynasty poet Zhang Jie ({{zh|c=章碣}}) wrote a poem (titled 焚书坑, ''Fen Shu Keng'', "Pits for Book-burning") about the policy of destruction by both the Qin dynasty and the rebels (of which Liu Bang and Xiang Yu were the examples cited as they entered the capital city [[Xianyang]] one after the other.):

{{cquote|
As the smoke from burning bamboo and silk clears, the empire is weakened.&lt;br/&gt;
(The) [[Hangu Pass]] and the [[Yellow River]] guard the domain of [[Qin Shi Huang]] in vain.&lt;br/&gt;
Pits of ash were not yet cold, disorder reigned east of the [[Xiao Mountains]].&lt;br/&gt;
As it turned out, [[Liu Bang]] and [[Xiang Yu]] could not read.

===Burial of the scholars===
[[File:Killing the Scholars, Burning the Books.jpg|thumb|''Killing the Scholars and Burning the Books'' (18th century Chinese painting).]]

Tradition had it that after being deceived by two [[alchemy|alchemists]] while seeking prolonged life, Qin Shi Huang ordered more than 460 scholars in the capital to be buried alive in the second year of the proscription. The belief was based on this passage in the ''Shiji '' (chapter 6):

:The first emperor therefore directed the imperial censor to investigate the scholars one by one. The scholars accused each other, and so the emperor personally determined their fate. More than 460 of them were buried alive at [[Xianyang]], and the event was announced to all under heaven for warning followers. More people were internally exiled to border regions. [[Fusu]], the eldest son of the emperor, counselled: "The empire just achieved peace, and the barbarians in distant areas have not surrendered. The scholars all venerate Confucius and take him as a role model. Your servant fears if Your Majesty punish [sic] them so severely, it may cause unrest in the empire. Please observe this, Your Majesty."&lt;ref&gt;(於是使御史悉案问诸生，诸生传相告引，乃自除犯禁者四百六十馀人，皆阬之咸阳，使天下知之，以惩後。益发谪徙边。始皇长子扶苏谏曰：「天下初定，远方黔首未集，诸生皆诵法孔子，今上皆重法绳之，臣恐天下不安。唯上察之。」) ''Shiji'' vol. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to change his father's mind, and instead was sent to guard the frontier as a de facto exile. 

An account given by Wei Hong in the 2nd century added another 700 to the figure.

==Skepticism==
The scholar Michel Nylan observes that despite its mythic significance, the Burning of the Books legend does not bear close scrutiny. Nylan suggests that the reason Han dynasty scholars charged the Qin with destroying the Confucian Five Classics was partly to "slander" the state they defeated and partly because Han scholars misunderstood the nature of the texts, for it was only after the founding of the Han that Sima Qian labeled the Five Classics as “Confucian.” Nylan also points out that the Qin court appointed classical scholars who were specialists on the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which meant that these texts  would have been exempted, and that the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' and the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' did not contain the glorification of defeated feudal states which the First Emperor gave as his reason for destroying them.{{sfnb|Nylan|2001|pp = 29-30}} Martin Kern adds that Qin and early Han writings frequently cite the Classics, especially the ''Documents ''and the ''Classic of Poetry'', which would not have been possible if they had been burned, as reported.{{sfnb|Kern|2010|pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qY32-zfTU9AC&amp;dq=cambridge+history+of+china+burning+books&amp;q=%22status+of+the+Classics%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22status%20of%20the%20Classics%22&amp;f=false 111-112]}}

Sima Qian’s account of the execution of the scholars has similar difficulties. First, no text earlier than the ''Shiji'' mentions the executions, the ''Shiji ''mentions no Confucian scholar by name as a victim of the executions, and in fact, no other text mentions the executions at all until the 1st century AD. The earliest known use of the famous phrase “burning the books and executing the Confucians” is not noted until the early 4th century.{{sfnb|Kern|2010|pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qY32-zfTU9AC&amp;dq=cambridge+history+of+china+burning+books&amp;q=%22status+of+the+Classics%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22status%20of%20the%20Classics%22&amp;f=false 111-112]}}

{{Argentine Army}}
The '''National Military College''' ({{lang-es|'''Colegio Militar de la Nación'''}}) is the institution in charge of the undergraduate education of [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s of the [[Argentine Army]]. It is located at [[El Palomar, Buenos Aires]].

Established on October 11, 1869, by President [[Domingo Sarmiento]] at the height of the [[Paraguayan War]], its original quarters were opened in where the [[Parque Tres de Febrero]] stands today, with Col. [[János Czetz|Juan F. Czetz]] as the first superintendent. It was transferred to [[San Martín, Buenos Aires|San Martín]] in 1892, and to its present location, the site of the 1852 [[Battle of Caseros]] that deposed mid-19th century strongman [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], in 1938.

Its present facilities were inaugurated in 1937. ''El Palomar'' and ''La Casa de Caseros'', installations involved in the Battle of Caseros, were declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]].

Traditionally, most cadets belonged to high- or middle-class families, with many of them having a long military tradition. This has changed in recent years, the Corps of Cadetes becoming more representative of lower-class families.

Women were first admitted in the College in 1999, and allowed into Infantry and Cavalry arms in 2013.

==Courses==
{{stack|[[File:Presidenta Kirchner en Colegio Militar.jpg|thumb|260px|Former President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] addresses 2010 graduating class.]]}}
There are four different type of courses in the College:

'''Regular, four-year course'''. For officers of the five combat arms (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers and Signals), plus Quartermater and Ordnance corps. Cadets graduate as second lieutenant and get a degree in administration.

'''Course for professional nurses'''. Cadets spend three years at the College, graduate as second lieutenants, and a fourth year at the Central Military Hospital, after which they obtain their degree.

'''One-year course for officers of the professional corps'''. For university graduates (in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, biochemistry, veterinary, law, information technology and physical training) and private aviators. Graduate as either a lieutenant or second lieutenant (according to the duration of the previous career) in the relevant branch.

'''Two-year course for band officers'''. For band NCOs with at least five years of service. Graduate as second lieutenant.

A system of short courses for reserve officers was established in 2000, but was discontinued after a few years due to the poor performance of the graduates.

==Admission==

Admission is on a competitive basis, and consists of academic (according to the course of choice), medical, psychological and physical training examinations. For the four- and three-year courses, a high school diploma is the minimum previous education requirement, although a number of applicants usually have at least one year of college-level education.

== Cadet life ==
Cadets are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Instead they are officially called fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets. Unlike most academies the Regiment of Cadets marches on parade in the following order of precedence, in full [[dress uniform]]s:

* Infantry - with Mauser rifles and using the [[goose step]], currently the only military unit in Argentina to do so
* Cavalry, Armor, Artillery - with M4 or FN FAL slung rifles, marches on the high step
* Other arms and services - with FN FAL rifles, marches on the high step
* Cavalry Troop - with lances, using the cavalry walk or trot march

Formerly the College sported a horse artillery battery which used the walk or the trot march of the cavalry.

'''Community Scholars''' is a [[non-profit organization]] established in [[El Paso, Texas]]. The youth leadership development program hires high school sophomores/juniors and college students to study public policy and [[economic development]] topics in the Paso del Norte Region. The program offers paid internships to students who academically rank in the top 20 percent in their class and who also have demonstrated a record of academic rigor and [[community service]].

By offering paid [[internships]], the organization seeks to address El Paso's "[[brain drain]]," and begin to attract young talent back to their hometown to help move the community forward. Interns analyze all policy matters in small groups, ultimately understanding how policy comes to fruition and how numerous policy decisions affect the community. Topics generally focus on the areas of [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[workforce development]], [[infrastructure]], [[transportation]] and any other issue that is affecting the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communityinvestmentnetwork.org/nc/single-news-item-states/article/community-scholars/?tx_ttnews |title=Community Scholars |date=2007-03-01 |publisher=Community Investment Network |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309193945/http://www.communityinvestmentnetwork.org/nc/single-news-item-states/article/community-scholars/?tx_ttnews |archivedate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is well known for its 1999 report regarding El Paso branch financial institution's lending practices, analyzing whether the banks were meeting the credit and depository needs of El Paso. The report was received negatively by local financial and business institutions, including the chambers of commerce and some of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]'s business department professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newspapertree.com/opinion/3603-truth-and-reconciliation-reporting-and-banking-in-the-borderlands |title=Truth and Reconciliation: Reporting and Banking in the Borderlands |last=Mann |first=Lethe |publisher=Newspaper Tree |location=El Paso |date=2009-03-28 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complex and Adaptive Systems Laboratory''' (CASL) is an interdisciplinary research institute in [[University College Dublin]]. It is formed around four research clusters. The institute houses research groups from a number of Schools within UCD, notably computer science.
It is located in the Belfield Business Park at the northern end of the main UCD campus. The institute is involved in all aspects of research into complex systems from atomistic models, through to societal modelling.

==Natural Computing and Optimisation==
Led by Dr. Mike O'Neill this cluster studies computational systems inspired by the Natural World, including complex, physical, social and biological systems, and optimisation and model induction methods in their broader sense.  The main facets of the cluster are:  nature-inspired problem solving, understanding natural systems, exploiting natural processes as computational machines, and developing the next generation of optimisation and model induction methods. Groups in this cluster develop and apply methods to a broad range of problem domains including [[Finance]], [[Computer Science]], [[Design]], [[Architecture]], [[Music]], [[Sound Synthesis]], [[Bioinformatics]], [[Engineering]] and [[Telecommunications]].

==Networks and Data Analysis==
The Networks and Data Analysis cluster is concerned with the analysis of complex data from and about networks. These networks may be social networks (in the broadest sense), biological networks, sensor networks or communications networks. The defining characteristic of the research in this cluster is the significance of the network structure in the data. The research concerns the discovery of interesting structure in the data and the fusion of data from different sources.

==Security and Trust==
The Security and Trust cluster seeks to combine fundamental [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], with practical [[software engineering]] expertise and knowledge of human behaviour, to study problems in the areas of security and trust. Research topics include cryptography, security, privacy, trust, voting issues, information security, network coding and network information theory, watermarking, steganography, error correction, modulation, signal processing.

==Simulation Science and Extreme Events==
This cluster aims to study and link the broad common underpinning causes of extreme weather, market crashes, social fads, and global epidemics using simulation science as the tool of discovery.

==Research Training==
A number of structured PhD Programmes provide post-graduate education throughout the Institute:

'''Computer Arimaa''' refers to the playing of the [[board game]] [[Arimaa]] by [[computer program]]s.

In 2002, Indian American computer engineer Omar Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Syed|first=Omar|author2=Syed, Aamir|year=2003|title=Arimaa – a New Game Designed to be Difficult for Computers|journal=International Computer Games Association Journal|volume=26|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was claimed in 2015, when a computer program played 7:2 against three human players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpinchess.net/2015/07/arimaa-game-over/ Arimaa: Game Over?]&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been the subject of several [[#Research papers|research papers]].

==State space of Arimaa==

===Opening===
The number of different ways that each player can set up their pieces at the beginning of the game is:

&lt;math&gt;
\dbinom{16}{8} \cdot
\dbinom{8}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{6}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{4}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{2}{1}  \cdot
\dbinom{1}{1} 
= 64,864,800
&lt;/math&gt;

The player can put 8 rabbits on 16 possible squares, followed by 2 cats on the 8 remaining squares, 2 dogs on the 6 remaining squares, 2 horses on the four remaining squares, one camel on one of the two remaining squares, and the elephant on the final unused square.

Because each player can start the game with one of 64,864,800 opening setups, the total state space for the opening is:

&lt;math&gt;
64,864,800^2 \approx      4.2 \cdot 10^{15}
&lt;/math&gt;

As Christ-Jan Cox said in his Master's thesis, because the number of possible initial states is so large, "[i]t follows that it is very difficult to develop complete databases of opening moves."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/papers/CoxThesis/Cox_thesis1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence techniques==

===Material evaluation===
It is important for the computer to be able to evaluate the value of the pieces on the board so it can assess whether or not a capture or exchange would be desirable.  Assessing the relative value of pieces is an area of ongoing Arimaa research.  Some currently-used systems are DAPE and FAME.

===Techniques used in Arimaa bots===
The following techniques are used by some or all of the artificial intelligence programs that play Arimaa:
*[[Bitboard]]s
*[[Transposition table]]s
*[[Zobrist hashing]]
*[[Minimax#Minimax algorithm with alternate moves|Minimax]] and [[Alpha beta pruning]]
*[[Killer heuristic|Killer moves]] and [[Transposition table#Related techniques|refutation tables]]
*[[Static evaluation function]]
*[[Quiescence search]]
*[[Monte-Carlo Tree Search]]
*UCT

===Techniques rarely used In Arimaa bots===
*[[Chess opening book (computers)|Opening book]]
*[[Endgame tablebase]]

==Computer performance==

{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
Several aspects of Arimaa make it difficult for computer programs to beat good human players. Because so much effort has gone into the development of strong [[computer chess|chess-playing software]], it is particularly relevant to understand why techniques applicable to chess are less effective for Arimaa.

=== Brute-force searching ===
Top chess programs use [[brute-force search]]ing coupled with static position evaluation dominated by material considerations. Chess programs examine many, many possible moves, but they are not good (compared to humans) at determining who is winning at the end of a series of moves unless one side has more pieces than the other. The same is true for Arimaa programs, but their results are not as good in practice.

When brute-force searching is applied to Arimaa, the depth of the search is limited by the huge number of options each player has on each turn. Computationally, the number of options a player has available to them governs the number of different paths play can go down. This is known as the [[branching factor]]. The average branching factor in a game of Chess is about 35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1171.asp | title=Chess Programming Part IV: Basic Search | author=François Dominic Laramée | publisher=[[GameDev.net]] | accessdate=2007-05-01 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514205121/http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1171.asp | archivedate=14 May 2007 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Arimaa it is about 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arimaa.janzert.com/bf_study/ | title=A Look at the Arimaa Branching Factor | author=Brian "Janzert" Haskin | work=janzert.com/ | accessdate=2009-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091107141949/http://arimaa.janzert.com/bf_study/| archivedate= 7 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These differing branching factors imply that a computer which can search to a depth of eight turns for each player in chess, can only search about three turns deep for each player in Arimaa:

&lt;math&gt;35^8 \approxeq 17000^3&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alpha-beta pruning ===
Brute force search depth, for chess software, is nearly doubled by [[alpha-beta pruning]], which allows the software to conclude that one move is better than another without examining every possible continuation of the weaker move. If the opponent can crush a certain move with one reply, it isn't necessary to examine other replies, which dramatically increases search speed. In Arimaa, however, the side to move switches only every four steps, which reduces the number of available cutoffs in a step-based search.

Furthermore, the usefulness of alpha-beta pruning is heavily dependent on the order in which moves are considered. Good moves must be considered before bad ones in order for the bad ones to be neglected. In particular, checking and capturing moves are key for pruning, because they are often much better than other moves. In Arimaa software the speedup provided by alpha-beta pruning is less, because captures are rarer. In rated games played on arimaa.com, only 3% of steps result in capture, compared to about 19% of chess moves that result in capture.

In most Arimaa positions, particularly toward the beginning of the game when the board is still crowded, a competent player can avoid losing any pieces within the next two turns. Compared to chess, Arimaa allows either player to delay captures for longer. Indeed, the median move number of the first capture in chess is turn 6, whereas in Arimaa it is turn 12. The struggle is initially more positional in Arimaa, and revolves around making captures unavoidable at some point in the future. This magnifies the importance of correctly judging who is gaining ground in non-material ways. Thus the strength of computer programs (examining millions of positions) is not as significant as their weakness (judging the position apart from who has more pieces).

The weakness of Arimaa programs in the opening phases is further magnified by the setup phase. In chess every game starts from the same position. By compiling before the game a list of stock replies to all standard opening moves, chess programs may often make a dozen or more excellent moves before starting to "think". Humans do the same, but have a smaller and less reliable memory of openings, which puts humans at a relative disadvantage in chess. Arimaa, in contrast, has millions of possible ways to set up the pieces even before the first piece moves. This prevents programs from having any meaningful opening book.

As the game progresses, exchanges and the advancement of rabbits tend to make the position more open and tactical. Arimaa programs typically play better in this sort of position, because they see tactical shots which humans overlook. However, it is usually possible for humans to avoid wide-open positions by conservative play, and to angle for strategic positions in which computers fare worse. Against a conservative opponent it is almost impossible to bust open the position in Arimaa, whereas in chess it is merely difficult. One must beat defensive play by the accumulation of small, long-term advantages, which programs do not do very well.

One additional technique from computer chess which does not apply to Arimaa is [[endgame tablebase]]s. Master-level chess games sometimes trade down into unclear endgames with only a few pieces, for example king and knight vs. king and rook. It is possible to build, by [[retrograde analysis]], an exhaustive table of the correct move in all such positions. Programs have only to consult a pre-generated table in such positions, rather than "thinking" afresh, which gives them a relative advantage over humans. Arimaa, in contrast, seldom comes to an endgame. Equal exchanges of pieces are less common than in chess, so it is rare for a game of Arimaa to "trade down" and still be unclear. An average game of Arimaa has only eight captures (compared to seventeen for chess), and top humans can often defeat top programs in Arimaa without losing a single piece, for example [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=298810&amp;s=w the second game of the 2014 Challenge match]. Another example of low capture density is [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=218654&amp;s=w this semifinal game of the 2012 World Championship], featuring only a single capture, a goal-forcing elephant sacrifice.

Omar Syed hopes that, because traditional artificial intelligence techniques are only moderately effective for Arimaa, programmers will be forced to use new artificial intelligence techniques to create a strong Arimaa-playing program. The successful quest to build a world-championship-caliber chess program has produced many techniques to successfully play games, but has contributed essentially nothing to more general reasoning; in fact, the techniques of chess playing programs have been excluded from some definitions of [[artificial intelligence]]; a goal for Arimaa is that the techniques involved in playing it will help the larger goals of artificial intelligence.

The structure of Syed's man-against-machine challenge is focused on rewarding advances in AI software and not advances in hardware. In the annual challenge, programs are run on machines chosen and provided by Syed himself, under the criterion that it be a typical, inexpensive, off-the-shelf home computer. The challenge would not be open to anyone requiring expensive multi-processor machines such as those used to challenge top-level chess players, much less something like the custom-built supercomputer [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], even though it was the success of this hardware-intensive approach which inspired Arimaa's invention. Syed believes that even the computer used in the 2004 challenge match (a Pentium 4 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz system with 512 MB of RAM) had sufficient hardware to win the challenge prize if only it was running the proper software. Supercomputers might already have the power to conquer Arimaa by brute force using conventional AI software, and eventually personal computers will too, if hardware continues to advance at the current rate. This is why the Arimaa challenge prize is offered only until the year 2020.

==Comparing the Arimaa Challenge to chess challenges==
{{OR-section|date=April 2015}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

It has been argued that a computer has beaten the world chess champion but not beaten the human in the Arimaa Challenge (until 2015) because of six reasons:

# Arimaa is a new game. Therefore, the number of programmers and amount of time devoted to computer Arimaa is much less than for computer chess. Computer chess had thousands more programmers and 40 more years than computer Arimaa. The later and smaller effort resulted in less and slower progress in computer Arimaa.
# The rules for the Arimaa Challenge required the computer to show a higher playing ability than the rules for the chess matches. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt; [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2009/ Rules to the Arimaa Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules don't even contain the word chess! Clearly this reference alone cannot be used.--&gt; In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer must beat three human players in three matches. In the chess matches, the computer must win one match against one human player.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer needs to score 2/3 of the total points to win. In chess matches, the computer needs to score more than 1/2 of the total points to win.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer needs to win a qualification match. Humans are allowed to study the computer's previous games to find the computer’s weaknesses. In chess, there is no qualification match and no requirement that the computer's previous games be made publicly available.{{dubious|date=November 2013}}
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer cannot be improved between games. In chess, the computer was improved between games.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the rules reject powerful or custom-made computers priced over $1,000. However, a powerful custom-made computer beat the world chess champion.

However, the Arimaa community disputes this argument point by point. To the first point, Arimaa is a new game, so the playing community is still small and even the best players are not professional players and have only been playing the game for a few years. Thus the human players in the Arimaa Challenge are much weaker than the human players in the chess challenge. The weakness of human players should make the Arimaa Challenge easier to conquer than chess, which compensates developers for having studied the problem for a shorter time.

The remaining five points compare the Arimaa Challenge only to Kasparov vs. Deep Blue, ignoring all other man vs. machine chess matches in which computers have prevailed. The chess match which can most closely be compared to the Arimaa Challenge match is the [[Man vs Machine World Team Championship]]. In 2004 and 2005 a team of humans played against a team of computer opponents. In both years the computers won by wide margin. In 2005 all three humans lost, the computers won 2/3 of the total points, the chess engines were commercially available for the humans to study, and the machine hardware used was not a supercomputer, but rather comparable to hardware used in the Arimaa Challenge.

Man-vs.-machine chess matches since 2005 have shown increasing computer dominance. For example, the 2006 [[Vladimir Kramnik#Deep Fritz match|Deep Fritz vs. Vladimir Kramnik]] and 2007 Rybka vs. Jaan Ehlvest matches gave additional advantages to the human player, but the computers (running on commodity hardware) prevailed anyway.

==Resources for software developers==
The [http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/ Arimaa Engine Interface], developed by Brian Haskin, defines a protocol that allows an Arimaa engine to communicate with a controller.

According to the documentation: "An engine is a program capable of taking the state of an Arimaa game and selecting a legal move to make. A controller is anything that wants to communicate with and control an engine. This could be anything from a simple script to have the engine analyse a single position to a GUI program that allows games to be played with humans or other engines."&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/aei-protocol.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arimaa Engine Interface includes an implementation of an engine and controller, documentation, and various scripts to control the engine and play games on any website which supports the protocol, including the official Arimaa website.&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/readme.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/devBot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''GAMEST'''''|ゲーメスト|Gēmesuto}} was a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[arcade game]] [[magazine]] published by ''[[Shinseisha]]'' Ltd. from 1986 to 1999.&lt;ref name="netlaputa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arcadegear"/&gt; Its circulation reached 30 million copies.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=September 2016}} It was discontinued along with the [[bankruptcy]] of the publisher. It was succeeded by the arcade game magazine {{nihongo|''[[Monthly Arcadia]]''|月刊アルカディア|Gekkan arukadia}} by [[Enterbrain]].

== History ==
''Gamest'' arose from the bimonthly [[fanzine]] {{nihongo|''VG2 newsletter''|ＶＧ２ 会報|VG2 kaihō}} which was also called {{nihongo|''VG2 Union magazine''|ＶＧ２ 連合誌|VG 2 rengō-shi}} edited by {{nihongo|''Uemura Bankita''|植村伴北|Uemura Tomokita}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsknet.or.jp/~otayan/80s/keshi.html 消しゴムかけのおもひで] at &lt;code&gt;nsknet.or.jp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On the cover of the first issue of read {{nihongo|"''Game book Gamest - High score magazine for fans of games''"|ゲ一メス卜 Gamest ゲームファンのためのハイスコアマガジン|Gēmesu boku ''Gamest'' Gēmufan no tame no haisukoamagajin}}. Initially it covered arcade games with an emphasis on 2D [[Shoot 'em up]]s.

From issue 6 on, it appeared monthly and from issue 116 (1994) the magazine was published twice a month.

In the mid-90s, the magazine covered mainly the then booming [[beat 'em up]]s.

In 1999, the magazine was discontinued without a final issue due to the sudden bankruptcy of the publisher ''Shinseisha''.

Thereafter, much of the ''Gamest'' staff transferred to the publisher ''[[List of magazines published by ASCII Media Works|ASCII]]'' (currently [[Enterbrain]]) who launched the arcade game magazine {{nihongo|''Monthly Arcadia''|月刊アルカディア|Gekkan arukadia}}.

'''''Gangster High''''' is a 2006 South Korean [[action film]] written and directed by Park Ki-hyung.  

==Plot==
In 1991, studious soccer enthusiast Sang-ho creates a soccer club called "Tigers" along with his friends Jae-gu and Chang-bae. Through Jae-gu, he meets an attractive, rebellious girl named Su-hee, who turns out to be Jong-suk's girlfriend, leader of a gang called TNT. The two gangs soon become embroiled in intense and violent conflict. When Jae-gu is killed in a car accident related to a gang fight with Jong-suk, the Tigers decide to avenge him. The two gangs meet in a billiards club, and, despite the pleas of Su-hee, a vicious and brutal fight ensues. Three people end up dying, and the rest permanently damaged, including some of Sang-ho's friends. Sang-ho, being the person who started the fight and the only one to walk away relatively unscathed, is charged with the murder of the three people and is sent to prison, where he reminisces upon the fact that the Tiger soccer club was initially created for the enjoyment of soccer and friendship.&lt;ref name="beyondhollywood.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Mudge|url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/gangster-high-2006-movie-review/ |title=Gangster High (2006) Movie Review |website=Beyond Hollywood|date=24 January 2007|accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''Gangster High'' opened in South Korea in October, 2006, and premiered at the [[European Film Market]] in [[Germany]] on February 8, 2007. In the United States, Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as bleak and violent, but praised it as "well drawn in all its diversity (and with occasional humor) by a good cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley |first=Derek |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/reviews/gangster-high-1200512638/|title=Review: ''Gangster High''|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=15 October 2006|accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Mudge of ''Beyond Hollywood'' gave it a positive review: "Although its premise may sound overly familiar, ''Gangster High'' certainly stands as one of the best teen violence films of recent years, with Park proving that he has not lost his touch when it comes to dealing with tales of troubled youth. Hard-hitting and gripping, it offers a different and arguably more convincing take on the usual themes, and contains enough vicious action to entertain as well as provoke."&lt;ref name="beyondhollywood.com"/&gt;

The film was distributed in the Netherlands on DVD in 2009 by Splendid Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gangster High (2006) - Release Info|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0891562/releaseinfo|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sociology}}
'''James Samuel Coleman''' (May 12, 1926 – March 25, 1995) was an American sociologist, theorist, and empirical researcher, based chiefly at the University of Chicago. He was elected president of the [[American Sociological Association]]. He studied the sociology of education and public policy, and was one of the earliest users of the term "social capital." His Foundations of Social Theory influenced sociological theory. His "The Adolescent Society" (1961) and "Coleman Report" (Equality of Educational Opportunity, 1966) were two of the most cited books in educational sociology. The landmark Coleman Report helped transform educational theory, reshape national education policies, and it influenced public and scholarly opinion regarding the role of schooling in determining equality and productivity in the United States.

==Early life==
As the son of James and Maurine Coleman, he spent his early childhood in [[Bedford, Indiana]], but he moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. After graduating in 1944, he enrolled in a small school in [[Virginia]] but left to enlist in the [[US Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Coleman received his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from [[Purdue University]] in 1949.

He initially enrolled to study chemistry but became interested in sociology and continued his graduate studies at [[Columbia University]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1955, while studying to receive his Ph.D. from Columbia, he was influenced by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]].

==Career==
Coleman achieved renown with two studies on problem solving: ''An Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'' (1964) and ''Mathematics of Collective Action'' (1973). He taught at [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1959, he moved to [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he taught as an associate professor. In 1965 he became involved in [[Project Camelot]], an academic research project funded by the [[United States]] military through the Special Operations Research Office to train in counter-insurgency techniques. He eventually became a full professor in social relations until 1973, when he returned to Chicago.

Upon his return, he became the professor and senior study director at the National Opinion Research Center. In 1991, Coleman was elected President of the [[American Sociological Association]]. In 2001, Coleman was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in [[Richard Posner]]'s book, ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|title=Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00633-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major contributions==

===Coleman Report===
Coleman is widely cited in the field of sociology of education. In the 1960s, he and several other scholars were commissioned by the US [[U.S. Office of Education|Office of Education]], to write a report on educational equality in the US. It was one of the largest studies in history, with more than 650,000 students in the sample. The result was a massive report of over 700 pages. The 1966 report, titled ''Equality of Educational Opportunity'' (otherwise known as the "Coleman Report"), fueled debate about "school effects" that is still relevant today. The report is commonly presented as evidence that school funding has little effect on student achievement, a key finding of the report and subsequent research. &lt;ref name="JHU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/pdfplus/10.7758/RSF.2016.2.5.01 | title="The Coleman Report at Fifty: Its Legacy and Implications for Future Research on Equality of Opportunity" |publisher= Russell Sage Foundation| place=School of Education, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore |first1=Karl | last1=Alexander |first2=Stephen |last2=Morgan |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HU"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=New England Economic Review | title="Equality of Education Opportunity Revisited" |place=Department of Ecconomics and Afro-American Studies, Harvard University, Boston |url=https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/economic/neer/neer1996/neer396f.pdf |first1=John |last1=Kain |first2=Kraig | last2=Singleton |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSU"&gt;{{cite web| first1=Kacy |last1= Martin|title="Reflecting on Progress since the Coleman Report, 50 Years Later" |publisher=Michigan State University |url=https://edwp.educ.msu.edu/green-and-write/2016/reflecting-on-progress-since-the-coleman-report-50-years-later/ |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found as for physical facilities, formal curricula, and other measurable criteria, there was little difference between black and white schools. Also, a significant gap in the achievement scores between black and white children already existed in the first grade. Despite the similar conditions of black and white schools, the gap became even wider by the end of elementary school. The only consistent variable explaining the differences in score within each racial group or ethnic group was the educational and economic attainment of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=Daniel |title=The Coming of Post-Industrial Society |date=1973 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=0465012817 |page=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning that student background and socioeconomic status are more important in determining educational outcomes of a student. Specifically, the attitudes of parents and caregivers at home and peers at school of students toward education. Additionally, differences in the quality of schools and teachers, has a small positive impact on student outcomes. The report led to extensive further research. Modern research has led to similar conclusions.&lt;ref name="JHU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;

[[Eric Hanushek]] criticised the focus on the statistical methodology and the estimation of the impacts of various factors on achievement took attention away from the achievement comparisons in the Coleman Report.  The study had tested students around the country, and the differences in achievement by race and region were enormous.  The average black twelfth grade student in the rural South was achieving at the level of a seventh grade white in the urban Northeast.  At the fiftieth anniversary of the report's publication, [[Eric Hanushek]] assessed the closure in the black-white achievement gap.  He found that achievement differences had narrowed, largely from improvements in the South, but that at the pace of the previous half century it would take two and a half centuries to close the math achievement gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first1=Eric A. |last1=Hanushek |title="What Matters for Achievement: Updating Coleman on the Influence of Families and Schools." |journal= ''Education Next'' 16, no. 2 (Spring): 22-30.| year=2016| url=http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%202016%20EdNext%2016%282%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Eric A. Hanushek and John F. Kain,(1972), "On the value of 'equality of educational opportunity' as a guide to public policy." In ''On equality of educational opportunity'', edited by Frederick Mosteller and Daniel P. Moynihan. New York: Random House: 116-145&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Coleman published new research that further investigated the effects of school busing systems, intended to bring lower-class black students to upper-class, racially integrated schools. Upon advancements in school desegregation, white parents began to move their children out of integrated schools in large numbers. The mass exodus was termed [[white flight]]. In 1966, Coleman wrote an article explaining that black students benefited from integrated schooling only if most of the students were white.

Coleman's findings regarding "white flight" were not well received in some quarters, particularly among some members of the American Sociological Association. In response, efforts sprang up during the mid-1970s to revoke his membership. Still, Coleman remained a member and eventually became its president.

===Social capital===
In ''Foundations of Social Theory'', Coleman discusses his theory of social capital, the set of resources found in family relations and in a community's social organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James|title=The Foundations of Social Theory|publisher=Belknap of Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=300–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman believed that social capital is useful for the cognitive or social development of a child or young person. He discusses three main types of capital: human, physical and social.

Human capital is an individual's skills, knowledge, and experience, which determine their value in society. Physical capital, being completely tangible and generally a private good, originates from the creation of tools to facilitate production. In addition to social capital, the three types of investments create the three main aspects of society's exchange of capital.

According to Coleman, social capital and human capital are often complementary. By having certain skill sets, experiences, and knowledge, an individual can gain social status and so receive more social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James|title=The Foundations of Social Theory|publisher=Belknap of Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=300–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exchange of capital, comes Coleman's theories on obligations and expectations. He describes the situation of doing favors for someone as "credit slips." Should an individual need a favor, he is essentially giving someone else a credit slip, which signifies that they will be paid back for their goods and/or services. For an individual to believe that their favor will be reciprocated, Coleman believe there are two vital conditions. There needs to be a level of trustworthiness in a social environment to be able to believe the obligation will be met. Also, the individual needs to take into account the extent of the obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James|title=The Foundations of Social Theory|publisher=Belknap of Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=300–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While social capital has value in use, it is something that is not easily exchanged. Coleman explores the idea of relative capital. He believed that capital's value was truly dependent on the social environment and the individual. With that being the case, the value of human capital and physical capital will change as well.

Coleman also explores the idea that social capital is less easy to invest in than human and physical capital. To invest in physical capital is usually a good decision both financially and economically. To invest in human capital is to make oneself more intelligent and experienced, surely a positive thing. When it comes to social capital, the incentive to invest is not always personally appealing.

According to Coleman, when individuals invest in social capital, they are not necessarily investing in themselves. Investment in social capital leads to investment in the social structure, which the capital lies, which, in turn, will benefit those individuals and populations part of that particular social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James|title=The Foundations of Social Theory|publisher=Belknap of Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=300–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Coleman was a pioneer in the construction of mathematical models in sociology with his book, ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'' (1964). His later treatise, ''Foundations of Social Theory'' (1990), made major contributions toward a more rigorous form of theorizing in sociology based on rational choice.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Coleman wrote more than thirty books and published numerous articles. He also created an educational corporation that developed and marketed "mental games" aimed at improving the abilities of disadvantaged students. Coleman made it a practice to send his most controversial research findings "to his worst critics" prior to their publication, calling it "the best way to ensure validity."

At the time of his death, he was engaged in a long-term study titled the ''[[High School and Beyond]]'', which examined the lives and careers of 75,000 people who had been high school juniors and seniors in 1980.

Coleman published lasting theories of education, which helped shape the field. With his focus on the allocation of rights, one can understand the conflict between rights. Towards the end of his life, Coleman questioned how to make the education systems more accountable, which caused educators to question their use and interpretation of standardized testing.

Coleman's publication of the "Coleman Report" included greatly influential findings that pioneered aspects of the desegregation of American public schools. His theories of integration also contributed. He also raised the issue of narrowing the educational gap between those who had money and others. By creating a well-rounded student body, a student's educational experience can be greatly benefited.

== Biography ==
Australian by birth, Taylor began studying architecture at the [[School of Architecture, Oxford Brookes University]] after taking a course in nursing.&lt;ref name="Indesign"/&gt; She then completed a B.Arch (1967) and M.Arch (1969) at the [[University of Washington College of Built Environments|University of Washington]], Seattle.&lt;ref name="CICA"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cicarchitecture.org/members/taylor.htm|title = Profile: Jennifer Taylor|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = CICA – International Committee of Architectural Critics|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Master of Architecture (History) was in part by thesis entitled, ''An Inquiry into Some Aspects of Recent Unorthodox Trends in Architecture''.&lt;ref name="QUT"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/taylorje/|title = Adjunct Professor Jennifer Taylor Staff Profile|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = QUT – Queensland University of Technology|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==
Taylor spent much of her working life in Europe, America and Asia, and taught in architectural schools throughout the world.&lt;ref name="QUT"/&gt; She was appointed as an academic to the Architecture department of the University of Sydney from 1970 to 1998, and later taught at the [[Queensland University of Technology]], Brisbane.&lt;ref name="QUT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/past/2008/place_makers/architects/jennifer_taylor__and__james_conner |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150308235509/http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/past/2008/place_makers/architects/jennifer_taylor__and__james_conner |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-03-08 |title= |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded the inaugural [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] (RAIA) National Education Prize in 2000.

Taylor was a founding member of [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] Australia, [[Docomomo International|DOCOMOMO]] (Australian Working Party for Documentation and Conservation of Buildings, Sites and Neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement) Australia, and the Australian Architectural Association.&lt;ref name="CICA"/&gt;

Taylor credited the Japanese modernist architect, [[Fumihiko Maki]]—whom she first met during a Japan Foundation Professional Fellowship in 1975—as playing a major role in her career. Maki was appointed Taylor’s mentor and after initially looking at contemporary Japanese gardens, she realised, "I became very interested in contemporary architecture in Japan. I loved it. I just kept going back. I started writing on Japan. I have been influenced, unquestionably, by Japanese work."&lt;ref name="Indesign"/&gt;

Taylor was also the first Australian architect to establish a contemporary architectural dialogue with Asia—bringing leading Japanese and Chinese figures to lecture at Sydney University, and travelling to the region and lecturing there herself.&lt;ref name="Indesign"/&gt;

Taylor contributed extensively to international publications, conferences, architectural criticism, and also sat on numerous architectural juries and competitions. She was awarded the inaugural Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) [[Australian Institute of Architects#Marion Mahony Griffin Prize|Marion Mahony Griffin Prize]] in 1998—a prize established by the NSW Chapter of the Institute of Architects to "a knowledge a female architect for a distinctive body of architectural work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wp.architecture.com.au/nswawards/marion-mahony-griffin-prize/ |title=Marion Mahony Griffin Prize |date = 2018 |access-date=18 November 2018 |publisher=Australian Institute of Architects }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Taylor was awarded the inaugural Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) National President’s Prize for her "lifetime commitment to architecture as a thinker, writer, critic and historian."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/aaaa-extra-1/|title = Archive: National President’s Prize – Jennifer Taylor (originally published in Architecture Australia, May 2010, Vol 99 No 3)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = Architecture Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
After growing up in Boston and on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, D’Agata attended the liberal preparatory school [[Northfield Mount Hermon School|Northfield Mount Hermon]] on a scholarship. He graduated from [[Hobart College, Geneva|Hobart College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Days of Yore|url = http://thedaysofyore.com/2011/john_dagata/|website = The Days of Yore|accessdate = 2015-11-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a bachelor's degree in classics and English literature.

In 1998 D’Agata moved to Iowa City, where he went on to complete his MFA in poetry at the University of [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|Iowa Writers’ Workshop]], and then an additional MFA in nonfiction at the University’s Nonfiction Writing Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MFA in Nonfiction Writing {{!}} Department of English {{!}} College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences {{!}} The University of Iowa|url = http://www.english.uiowa.edu/graduate-program/mfa-nonfiction-writing/our-alum|website = www.english.uiowa.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently taught writing and research at a number of different schools, including Colgate University, Columbia University, and the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles, before returning to the University of Iowa in 2006, where he now directs the Nonfiction Writing Program.

== Professional life ==
D’Agata is the editor of a 3-volume series on the history of the [[essay]], entitled ''A New History of the Essay''. It is made up of the volumes: ''The Next American Essay''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Next American Essay {{!}} Graywolf Press|url = https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/next-american-essay|website = www.graywolfpress.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2003), ''The Lost Origins of the Essay''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Lost Origins of the Essay {{!}} Graywolf Press|url = https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/lost-origins-essay|website = www.graywolfpress.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2009), and ''The Making of the American Essay''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/making-american-essay&lt;/ref&gt; (2016) for which the critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] provided a foreword in which he writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;For well over a decade now, John D’Agata has been the renovator-in-chief of the American essay. As practitioner and theorist, writer and anthologist, as example and the enabler of examples, D’Agata has refused to yield to the idea of non-fiction as stable, fixed, already formed. . . . Instead, he has pushed the essay to yield more of itself, to find within itself an enactment of its own etymology—an essaying, a trying, a perpetual attempt at something (after the French verb essayer, to try). He has emphasized that the essay should make, and not merely take; that it should gamble with the fictive and not just trade in the real; that it should entertain uncertainty as often as it hosts opinion; that the essay can be as lyrical, as fragmented, as self-interrupting, and as self-conscious as the most experimental fiction or verse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;D’Agata is also the author of ''Halls of Fame''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Halls of Fame {{!}} Graywolf Press|url = https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/halls-fame|website = www.graywolfpress.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of experimental nonfiction about which [[David Foster Wallace]] wrote, "In nothing else recent is the compresence of shit and light that is America so vividly felt and evoked," calling D'Agata "one of the most significant U.S. writers to emerge in the past few years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = David Foster Wallace and "Blurbspeak" - The Los Angeles Review...|url = https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/david-foster-wallace-and-blurbspeak/|website = The Los Angeles Review of Books|accessdate = 2015-11-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''About a Mountain''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About a Mountain {{!}} W.

''The New York Times Book Review'' called the book "a breathtaking piece of writing" and listed it among the 100 best nonfiction books ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = As if You Don't Have Enough to Read|url = http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/as-if-you-dont-have-enough-to-read/?_r=0|website = The 6th Floor Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, D'Agata and Fingal discuss whether it is appropriate to change facts in writing that is both nonfiction and art.

'''John Friend''' (born May 30, 1959)&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anusara.com/?pagerequested=about_john_friend|title=About John Friend}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[yoga]] teacher and creator of [[Anusara Yoga]].

==Early life and career==

Friend first learned of yoga at the age of 8 in [[Youngstown, Ohio]] when his mother, Ann Friend, read him stories of yogis with hidden knowledge and supernatural powers. By age 13, he began studying yoga philosophy with the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Upanishads]], and also began an [[asana]] practice by following [[Swami Satchidananda]]'s book ''Integral Hatha Yoga.''

At 17, Friend began a regular practice of sitting [[meditation]] with a [[Sufi]] group as well as members of the [[Theosophical Society]]. At age 19 he moved to [[Houston, Texas]] where he studied various styles of [[hatha yoga]] including [[Ananda Yoga]], [[Sivananda Yoga]], and [[Kundalini Yoga]]. He also began teaching yoga part-time while working as a [[financial analyst]].

In 1984, Friend began practicing the [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]] Primary Series and, in 1986, quit his analyst job to teach yoga full-time. In 1987, Friend graduated to Secondary Series while studying with Ashtanga founder [[K. Pattabhi Jois]] in California where he also studied with [[Iyengar Yoga]] teacher [[Judith Lasater]]. That same year, Friend attended an Iyengar Yoga convention in Boston, where he met [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], after which Friend focused his studies and practice mainly in Iyengar Yoga. Between 1990 and 1995, John earned Iyengar's Introductory and Junior Intermediate teaching certificates and also served on the Board of Directors for the Iyengar Yoga National Association before departing in 1997 to found Anusara Yoga.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25Yoga-t.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Yoga Mogul (NY Times) | work=The New York Times | first=Mimi|last=Swartz|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anusara Yoga==
{{Main|Anusara Yoga}}

Friend set up Anusara as a style of hatha yoga founded on a [[Tantra|Tantric]] philosophy of intrinsic goodness and based on bio mechanical principles of alignment. Friend derived the name ''Anusara'' as meaning 'flowing with Grace,' 'flowing with Nature' and 'following your heart,'" as interpreted from the [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|anusāra}}'', meaning "custom, usage, natural state or condition". Founded on Iyengar's system of alignment, Friend streamlined everything into five "Universal Principles of Alignment", which corresponded to other [[quinary]] aspects of the world, such as the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]], five regular [[polygon]]s, five fingers on the hand, and so on. Friend also developed refinements to his quinary system, which included what he called "the Three A's of Anusara" (attitude, alignment and action), seven energy loops that comprise the human body, and various cues to assist in teaching.

Anusara's philosophical system drew from Friend's knowledge in [[India]]n schools of thought, including [[Samkhya]], [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and non-dual [[Hindu]] Tantric schools, particularly non-dual [[Shaivism]], which he refers to as [[Shiva]]-[[Shakti]] Tantra. Friend also incorporates his other studies, such as [[Taoism]], [[Sufism]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Wicca]], [[quantum physics]], [[sacred geometry]], and western [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Yoga Education"&gt;{{cite web|last=Friend|first=John|title=Yoga Education|url=http://www.johnfriend.com/yoga-education/|work=About John Friend|publisher=johnfriend.com|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 scandal===
In February 2012, an anonymous tipster published accusations on ''jfexposed.com'' (short for "John Friend exposed"), which later appeared on the blog ''YogaDork''.&lt;ref name="Yoga Dork Accuse"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dork|first=Yoga|title=John Friend, Head of Anusara: The Accusations|url=http://www.yogadork.com/news/john-friend-head-of-anusara-wiccan-leader-sexual-deviant-pension-withholding-homewrecker-the-accusations|work=YogaDork|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These allegations of mismanagement and abuse were later reported on at length in an article in ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="WP_feature"&gt;{{cite news | last = Roig-Franzia | first = Manuel | title = Scandal contorts future of John Friend, Anusara yoga | work = Washington Post | date = 29 March 2012 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/scandal-contorts-future-of-john-friend-anusara-yoga/2012/03/28/gIQAeLVThS_story.html?hpid=z2 | accessdate = 29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four key accusations against Friend were:

#That John Friend led a [[Wicca]]n [[coven]] called Blazing Solar Flames whose members allegedly included female Anusara students, teachers and employees. The tipster provided documentation that John Friend engaged in sexual relations with women in the coven, including a letter allegedly written by him to a coven member with whom he had sexual relations, and described an 'alignment' between Wicca and the Anusara system of yoga.&lt;ref name="Yoga Dork Accuse" /&gt;  Friend had Anusara’s graphics team design a logo for the coven according to three former employees.&lt;ref name=WP_feature /&gt; It was later revealed that John may not belong to any Wiccan lineage or tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pitzl-Waters|first=Jason|title=Details of John Friend’s "Blazing Solar Flames" Coven Emerge|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wildhunt/2012/04/details-of-john-friends-blazing-solar-flames-coven-emerge.html/|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#That John Friend had sexual affairs with several married Anusara employees and teachers. In a  February  2012 interview, Friend admitted to the truth of this allegation.&lt;ref name="Elephant Journal jfexposed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Waylon|title=My Interview with John Friend Regarding jfexposed Accusations|url=http://www.elephantjournal.com/2012/02/my-interview-with-john-friend-regarding-ijfexposedi-accusations|publisher=Elephant Journal|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#That John Friend froze funding of employees' defined benefits plans, avoiding notification to employees, and thus violated federal [[ERISA]] regulations. The tipster claimed that Friend's company, Anusara, Inc., made the change to the plan in January 2010, but waited until December 2010 to provide oral notification to some employees. In December 2011, 204(h) notification had still not been provided and the tipster made a complaint to the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]. In January 2012, Anusara, Inc. finally provided official notification, but attempted to backdate the notification, as well as the effective freeze date, to January 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dork|first=Yoga|title=Anusara Pension Documents and Timeline|url=http://www.yogadork.com/news/anusara-pension-documents-and-timeline/|publisher=Yogadork|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this complaint about the backdating, the Department of Labor advised Anusara, Inc. that it was in violation. Anusara, Inc. then restored funds to the account and provided notification of a freeze to take place in the future.  John Friend provided documentation verifying the pension notification violations and the timeline outlined by the tipster. The documentation included a letter from Anusara Inc. which assured employees that there was never an intention to be deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Waylon|title=John Friend: Pension Documents|url=http://www.elephantjournal.com/2012/02/john-friend-pension-documents/|publisher=Elephant Journal|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friend eventually admitted this was the result of his oversight that was subsequently corrected after an employee complained to government regulators.&lt;ref name=WP_feature /&gt;
# That John Friend placed employees and personal assistants in legal jeopardy, arranging for them to personally accept delivery of packages of [[marijuana]] shipped for Friend's own use to Anusara’s office. This allegation is supported by statements made by John Friend's former personal assistant and also by Friend's statements to a committee of Anusura advisers, as described in a document obtained by ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name=WP_feature /&gt;

===Exit from Anusara===
Friend announced in March 2012 that he would step down from the leadership, while retaining the sole ownership, of Anusara Yoga to take a short leave of absence to consider his next steps in the yoga community.&lt;ref name="Chicago Mom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mom|first = Chicago|title=John Friend Steps Down as Anusara Yoga Leader|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/ups-and-downs-of-a-yoga-mom/2012/02/john-friend-steps-down-as-anusara-yoga-leader/|publisher=ChicagoMom|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In September 2012, Friend returned to teaching, offering a set hatha yoga sequence of 54 [[asana]]s called "The Roots", originally created by Desi and Micah Springer, owners of Vital Yoga in Denver, CO. In 2013, Friend and Desi Springer co-founded Sridaiva with and rebranded their postural alignment method as "The Bowspring."

== Sridaiva and Bowspring ==

In 2013, John Friend began working with Colorado-based yoga teaching sisters Desi and Micah Springer to help systematize a yoga methodology they had developed.&lt;ref name="Warner, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warner|first1=Joel|title=Fallen yoga guru John Friend goes to the mat with a new technique|url=http://www.westword.com/news/fallen-yoga-guru-john-friend-goes-to-the-mat-with-a-new-technique-5123079|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=Westword|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called "The Roots" practice,&lt;ref name="YJ, Sep 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=YJ Editors|title=The Return of John Friend|url=https://www.yogajournal.com/blog/the-return-of-john-friend|website=Yoga Journal|language=en|date=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the yoga system was rebranded in 2013 as Sridaiva (Sanskrit for "divine destiny")&lt;ref name="Warner, 2014" /&gt; as coupled with an alignment methodology called Bowspring.&lt;ref name="Pizer, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pizer|first1=Ann|title=Sridaiva Yoga and Bowspring Alignment|url=https://www.verywell.com/sridaiva-yoga-and-bowspring-alignment-3566896|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=Verywell|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friend teaches the Bowspring method at Vital Yoga Studio as well as on international teaching tours with Springer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tintyoga.com/yogis/desi-springer-john-friend/|title=Online Training with Desi Springer &amp; John Friend  {{!}} TINT.

Krishna Reddy was born in 15 July 1925, in a small village called Nandanoor, near [[Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh|Chittoor]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ignca.nic.in/invitations/krishnareddy_biographical_journey.pdf|title=KRISHNA REDDY : biographical journey|last=|first=|date=|website=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/artist/Krishna_Reddy/11125410/Krishna_Reddy.aspx|title=Krishna Reddy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.askart.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddy studied at [[Visva-Bharati University]]'s [[Kala Bhavana]] (Institute of Fine Arts) with [[Nandalal Bose]], from 1941 to 1946, and graduated with a degree in fine arts.&lt;ref name="metMuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From 1947 to 1949, he was head of the art section at [[Kalakshetra Foundation]] and was also teaching art at the Montessori Teachers' Training Centre in [[Madras]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was at this time that he took interest in sculpture and painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1949, he moved to London, and continued his sculpture studies with [[Henry Moore]] at the [[University of London]]'s [[Slade School of Fine Art]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950, Reddy moved to [[Paris]] and met artist [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Through Brâncuși, he was introduced to cafe discussions on art and met many famous artists during studio visits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During his time in Paris he studied sculpture under [[Ossip Zadkine]] and engraving under [[Stanley William Hayter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1957, he traveled to [[Brera Academy|Academia Di Belle Arti Di Brera]] (Brera Academy) in [[Milan]] to study under [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marino Marini]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Printmaking ===
Reddy was considered a master in intaglio printmaking and after 1965 was an associate director at Hayter's [[Atelier 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artpublicmontreal.ca/en/artiste/reddy-krishna/|title=Krishna Reddy – Art Public Montréal|website=Art Public Montréal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atelier 17, a thriving artist workshop was founded in 1927 by Hayter and was originally located in Paris; however between 1939 and 1940 the workshop moved to New York City and in 1950 back to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ateliercontrepoint.com/17index.html|title=20th Century modern printmaking – S. W. Hayter and Atelier 17|last=|first=|date=1 March 2017|website=Roosevelt Fine Art LLC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atelier 17 has always been a meeting place to experiment with their art practices for both European and American artists including [[Joan Miró]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Juan Cárdenas|Juan Cardenas]], Constantin Brâncuși, and [[Zarina (artist)|Zarina Hashmi]].&lt;ref name="metMuseum" /&gt;

Reddy's technique and style distinguished him as an important printmaker. Reddy's prints are abstract, created with subtle grid-like designs on plates with intricate texturisations. The myriad complex colour that he introduced in prints are marked by a contemplative approach to the infinite mysteries of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryindianart.com/krishna_reddy.htm|title=Krishna Reddy|work=contemporaryindianart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at Atelier 17, Reddy was instrumental in developing a new printing process to produce multi-coloured prints from a single printing matrix by exploiting the viscosity and tackiness of the inks, subsequently named viscosity printing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farewell-to-printmaker-sculptor-world-renowned-modernist-artist-krishna-reddy/story-M3eGnL8r7QOgYIECRTNLZM.html|title=Farewell to printmaker, sculptor, world renowned modernist artist Krishna Reddy|last=|first=|date=23 August 2018|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=23 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A real guru, he always kept his links with India|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/a-real-guru-he-always-kept-his-links-with-india-5322150/|accessdate=24 August 2018|work=The Indian Express|date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddy received the [[Padma Shri]] award in 1972, in recognition of his distinguished contributions to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artpublic.ville.montreal.qc.ca/en/oeuvre/sans-titre-1865/|title=Sans titre|website=Bureau d'Art Public – Ville de Montréal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
Reddy was a guest professor and lecturer at many universities in the United States including [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], [[Pratt Institute]], [[Ruskin College]] School of Fine Art and Drawing, [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Among Reddy's pupils is the painter and printmaker [[Elaine Breiger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G. Heller|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-63882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The Lee Foundation was established in March 1952 with a funding of $3.5 million from [[business magnate]] Lee Kong Chian.

In 2015, the sister foundation in Malaysia also donated a total of RM50 million to [[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]] (UTAR) for the construction of its new campus building in Sungai Long, Kuala Lumpur. In honor of the foundation's founder, the university has named its engineering and science faculty as the Lee Kong Chian Faculty of Engineering and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/02/09/lee-foundation-rm50mil-utar/|title=Lee Foundation donates RM50mil to UTAR|last=|first=|date=|website=The Star Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generosity of the foundation has earned them many accolades such as the Distinguished Patron of the Arts Award by the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]] for several years, and the National Volunteerism and Philanthropy Award Special Recognition Award in 2004 for Pioneers of philanthropy work in Singapore. Chairman Lee Seng Gee was awarded the Distinguished Service Order by the President of Singapore. In line with its original mission, the Lee Foundation continues to drive and promote education in socially relevant disciplines, e.g. in health and medical-related fields, and especially for disadvantaged students in Singapore, Malaysia and worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">This is a list of attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and murder-suicides by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled. Accounts without reliable sources will be deleted.

The list is divided into three main chronological sections according to school classification: [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], and [[Higher education|post-secondary]]. Additionally, a list is provided for foiled school-related attack plots that resulted in a conviction of perpetrator(s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3348">'''Maria Newell Gützlaff''' (4 August 1794 – 16 February 1831) was an [[English people|English]] [[missionary]], [[teacher]] and [[translator]].

Maria was born at [[Stepney]], [[Middlesex]], in [[England]], the child of Samuel Newell, tallow chandler, and Mary Duchesne.

Maria studied Chinese under [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] during his furlough in the 1820s, and was appointed the first female missionary of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS). The plan was for her to carry on [[female education]] among the Chinese immigrants. Before this time sending unmarried female missionaries was absolutely unheard of. She sailed from England on 11 April 1827 (in the company of [[Maria (Tarn) Dyer|Maria Dyer]]) and reached [[Malacca]], Straits Settlements, on 26 August 1827.

On 26 November 1829 she was married to [[Karl Gutzlaff]], after their marriage she went with her husband to [[Siam]] on 11 February 1830. "These two devoted themselves to studying Siamese and translating, hardly allowing themselves time to eat or sleep, and daily employing a number of copyists. Thus they succeeded in evolving a very imperfect translation of the whole Bible in Siamese, a considerable portion of it into the Lao and Cambodian languages, and preparing a dictionary and grammar of the Siamese and Cambodian. These translations were later delivered by Mr. Gutzlaff to Mr. Robinson of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and the dictionary was taken over by [[John Taylor Jones|Mr. Jones]] of the [[American Baptist Missionary Union|Baptist Board]] and became the foundation of the dictionary later prepared by [[Eliza Grew Jones]]."&lt;ref&gt;George Bradley McFarland, ''Historical Sketch of Protestant Missions in Siam 1828-1928'', Bangkok: Bangkok Times Press, 1928, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 1831 Maria gave birth to twin daughters at [[Bangkok]], [[Siam]]. She died a few hours later. One child died at birth, the other was left for a time with her Siamese nurse, later, when it became possible she was put in the care of a Mrs. Thomson in [[Singapore]], she lived about four months.

Maria and the small children were buried by special permit at the upper side of the Portuguese Consulate gate. This plot continued to be the burial ground of the missionaries and others until [[King Mongkut]] made a grant for this purpose in 1853, and in 1893 this earliest cemetery which had eventually been bought by the Baptist Mission, was sold and the graves moved to the new [[Bangkok Protestant Cemetery|Protestant Cemetery]].

Not only do they travel the streets of this place but also the roads of their ancestors, learning to accept the other’s burdens as the two walk through the past and toward the future.

|Tara Beagan, Andy Moro
|''Reckoning'' is a triptych of stories about survivors and responses to the residential school system: "The first section, involving both text and movement, focuses on an adjudicator hearing the testimony of former school residents and the anxiety he feels as he deals with their statements. The second ... is a naturalistic two-hander involving two native people who meet online through a support group of IRS survivors and children of survivors. The third, a monologue, is part live video document and part attempt to right wrongs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/stage/theatre/the-reckoning-is-coming/|title=A Reckoning is coming|date=2016-04-12|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museo Pambata''' (''Children's Museum'' or ''Museum for Children'') is a [[children's museum]] in the [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita district]] of [[Manila]], near [[Rizal Park]], in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museopambata.org/ Museo Pambata's Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the former [[Elks Club Building (Manila)|Elks Club Building]], built in 1910, along [[Roxas Boulevard]] at the corner of South Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fun Museum at the Old Elks Club Building in Manila|url=http://traveleronfoot.wordpress.com/2008/07/21/a-fun-museum-at-the-old-elks-club-building-in-manila/|work=TRAVELER ON FOOT: A TRAVEL JOURNAL|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Museo Pambata is a children's interactive museum. Unlike traditional museums where items are stored behind glass and touching is highly discouraged, Museo Pambata invites visitors to learn with the exhibits by using their total senses. It envisions itself as a discovery museum and resource center promoting Filipino global culture, children's advocacy programs, and creative educational programs with linkages to global communities. The museum also has regular programs and events for various sectors.

==History==

Opened in 1994, Museo Pambata is dream come true of Nina Lim-Yuson, an early childhood educator and mother of four, who once brought her young children to the [[Boston Children’s Museum]] in America. They had so much fun with the museum's hands-on exhibits that she wished there was a similar place back home where her kids - and the millions of Filipino children - can learn and have fun at the same time.

In March 1993, Yuson, together with her mother, former Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary [[Estefania Aldaba-Lim]], presented a proposal of their dream museum, to be situated in the historical [[Elks Club Building (Manila)|Elks Club Building]] in Manila, to then Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim. Much to their joy and surprise, he readily approved it.

The Museo Pambata officers were elected in the first Board of Trustees meeting held in June 1993. Educators, visual artists, architects, museum workers and other professionals met regularly to brainstorm. Concepts were then translated into several theme rooms designed and produced pro bono by architect and stage designer Joselito Tecson.

In December 1993, the City Council of Manila, in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) granted the Museo Pambata a 10-year-free-of-lease-use of the Elks Club Building. The funds raised by the board of trustees were used to start its rehabilitation.

In March 1994, the recognition dinner for Museo's first Ninongs and Ninangs, (sponsors who gave one million pesos each) namely Luis H. Lim Foundation, Juan and Lualhati Cojuangco Foundation, A.Y. Foundation, Petron Corporation, Fe S. Panlilio, Don Emilio T. Yap, Helena Z. Benitez, Security Bank and Trust Company, Landbank and GSIS.

Finally, on December 21, 1994, after a year of preparatory work, the museum opened its doors to children, youth and parents as the country's pioneering children's museum.

With a strong leadership, a definite plan of action and imminent success, the list of Ninongs and Ninangs has grown longer: Department of Tourism, PAGCOR, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Health, Sen. Ramon Magsaysay, Jr., Consuelo Alger Foundation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, Coca-Cola Foundation, Development Bank of the Philippines, PHINMA Group, Splash Foundation, Aldaba-Lim Foundation, WS Family Foundation, Sen. Francis Pangilinan, E. Zobel Foundation, Globe Telecom, Inc., C Com Foundation, and Ford Foundation Philippines.

In March 2012, Museo Pambata was shortlisted and received a Special Commendation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/4/upload/2012_cma_judges_report_1_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rappler.com/nation/3068-kiddie-museum-makes-int-l-debut&lt;/ref&gt; from the jury of the First Children’s Museum Award in Bologna, Italy “for inspiring the creation of new children’s museums in the Philippines and Asia.”

Museo Pambata also received a Best Soft Power Cultural Organization nomination in the 2016 Leading Cultural Destinations Awards&lt;ref&gt;https://www.softpowerdestinations.com/awards-2016&lt;/ref&gt; (“the Oscars for museums”)

==Theme Rooms==
[[File:MuseoPambatajf0230 01.JPG|thumb|[[Marionette]]s display in the children's museum]]
There are eight theme rooms in Museo Pambata, namely:

* '''Kalikasan (Environment) and Karagatan (Under the Sea)''' - Contains a simulated rain forest and seabed where visitors can learn about environmental concerns and ecological conservation.
* '''Maynila Noon (Old Manila)''' - Visitors can learn about history by looking at artifacts and simulated exhibits depicting turn-of-the-century Manila.
* '''Paglaki Ko (Career Options)''' - Showcases various careers and encourages visitors to visualize themselves doing a particular career. Currently it features writers and illustrators.
* '''I Love My Planet Earth''' - Where visitors can learn about climate change and how one can take part in caring for the planet.
* '''Pamilihang Bayan (Marketplace)''' - Features a row of play stores and shops. One can pretend to be a store owner and practice their entrepreneurial skills.
* '''Katawan Ko (My Body Works)''' - Features the human body, how various organs work, and pointers on healthcare.
* '''Bata sa Mundo (Children in the Global Village)''' - Dolls from around the world are displayed in this room.

The museum also has a children's library, changing exhibits hall, gift shop, three venues for various events, playground, and parking space.

==Programs==

===Children's Rights===
Museo Pambata’s educational programs and special activities are anchored on the advocacy of children’s rights, primarily on their right to education, health, recreation, and mental and physical development.

An outstanding activity held in the Karapatan Hall, an area in the museum dedicated to children’s rights, is the Rights of the Child Awareness Tournament in 1995. It was followed by Mag-ROCK Tayo! (Rights Of the Child Kontest) in 2001-2002. In cooperation with the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC), Plan International, UNICEF, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Education (DepEd), and the Manila City schools, these projects familiarized children with their basic rights as stated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Kanino ba ang CRC? was a three-day children’s summit held in November 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The summit brought together 50 children who are living in different, often difficult situations. The summit aimed to raise awareness on the Convention on the Rights of the Child by posing the question “Whose responsibility is the CRC?”.  Children participants, in plenary and discussions in workshops, shared their views of the rights and responsibilities of the child and crafted messages to people and agencies concerned. The summit was organized with the help of the DSWD, UNICEF, National Council of Social Development, Children’s Lab, CHILDHOPE Asia-Philippines, and other private donors.

===Literacy Programs===
Started in 1995, the Mobile Library Program is a reading campaign for the economically disadvantaged children and out-of-school youth of Manila. It aims to impart the value of reading to children through storytelling and book-lending sessions. Six years later, the Mobile Library van was inaugurated through a grant from Ford Foundation Philippines. It is a six-wheeler roving library with over 3,000 children’s books and other learning aids for the benefit of the children of Manila and neighboring cities. In 2011, the van was refurbished through the help of Atty. Ging Gonzalez-Montinola and Pilipinas Hino, Inc.

In line with the Philippine Centennial celebration in 1998, Museo Pambata launched Aklat: Karapatan at Kapangyarihan para sa Kabataan (The Book: The Right and Empowerment of the Youth) or Aklat:KKK. It had two components: the outreach and the in-house programs. Four minilibraries were turned over to the Manila barangays as part of the outreach component, while storytelling sessions became regular Friday and Saturday activities at the Museo Pambata Library and Resource Center.

In 1999, the Office of Manila Mayor Lito Atienza and Museo Pambata launched Sa Aklat Sisikat!, a Manila-wide literacy campaign to promote the habit of reading among children in Manila’s public schools. This innovative pilot campaign addressed the alarming decline in reading abilities and literacy rate in the country, particularly among public schoolchildren.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''National Council of Teachers of Mathematics''' ('''NCTM''') was founded in 1920. It has grown to be the world's largest organization concerned with [[mathematics education]], serving members throughout the United States and Canada.

The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics presents itself as "the public voice of mathematics education, supporting teachers to ensure equitable mathematics learning of the highest quality for all students through vision, leadership, professional development, and research."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nctm.org/About/&lt;/ref&gt;

NCTM holds annual national and regional conferences for teachers and publishes five journals. Its published standards have been highly influential in the direction of mathematics education in the United States and Canada.

== Journals ==
NCTM publishes five journals. All are available in print and online versions.

''[http://www.nctm.org/publications/tcm.aspx?id=8590 Teaching Children Mathematics]'', an official journal of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), supports improvement of pre-K–6 mathematics education by serving as a resource for teachers so as to provide more and better mathematics for all students. It is a forum for the exchange of mathematics idea, activities, and pedagogical strategies, and or sharing and interpreting research.

''[http://www.nctm.org/publications/mtms.aspx Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School]'', an official journal of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, supports the improvement of 5–9 mathematics education by serving as a resource for practicing and prospective teachers, as well as supervisors and teacher educators. It is a forum for the exchange of mathematics idea, activities, and pedagogical strategies, and or sharing and interpreting research.

''[http://www.nctm.org/publications/mt.aspx?id=8594 Mathematics Teacher]'', an official NCTM journal, is devoted to improving mathematics instruction for grades 8–14 and supporting teacher education programs. It provides a forum for sharing activities and pedagogical strategies, deepening understanding of mathematical ideas, and linking mathematical education research to practice.

''[http://www.nctm.org/Publications/Mathematics-Teacher-Educator/About-Mathematics-Teacher-Educator/ Mathematics Teacher Educator]'' contributes to building a professional knowledge base for mathematics teacher educators that stems from, develops, and strengthens practitioner knowledge. The journal provides a means for practitioner knowledge related to the preparation and support of teachers of mathematics to be not only public, shared, and stored, but also verified and improved over time (Hiebert, Gallimore, and Stigler 2002).

NCTM does not conduct research in mathematics education, but it does publish the ''[http://www.nctm.org/publications/content.aspx?id=9436 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]'' (''JRME''), the most influential periodical in mathematics education research worldwide and the fourth most-cited educational research journal of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal Ranking: Education and Educational Research | url = http://www.journal-ranking.com/ranking/listCommonRanking.html?selfCitationWeight=1&amp;externalCitationWeight=1&amp;citingStartYear=1901&amp;journalListId=295 | accessdate = Aug 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summaries of the most important findings in [[Mathematics education#Research|mathematics educational research]] in regard to current practices can be found on their [http://www.nctm.org/news/content.aspx?id=8468 website]. ''JRME'' is devoted to the interests of teachers of mathematics and mathematics education at all levels—preschool through adult. ''JRME'' is a forum for disciplined inquiry into the teaching and learning of mathematics. The editors encourage the submission of a variety of manuscripts: reports of research, including experiments, case studies, surveys, philosophical studies, and historical studies; articles about research, including literature reviews and theoretical analyses; brief reports of research; critiques of articles and books; and brief commentaries on issues pertaining to research.

== NCTM Standards ==
NCTM has published a series of math Standards outlining a vision for school mathematics in the USA and Canada. In 1989, NCTM developed the ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics,'' followed by the ''Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics'' (1991) and the ''Assessment Standards for School Mathematics'' (1995). Education officials lauded these math standards, and the [[National Science Foundation]] funded several projects to develop curricula consistent with recommendations of the standards. The [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] cited several of these programs as "exemplary". However, implementation of the reform has run into strong criticism and opposition, including parental revolts and the creation of antireform organizations such as [[Mathematically Correct]] and HOLD. These organizations object especially to reform curricula that greatly decrease attention to the practice and memorization of basic skills and facts. Critics of the reform include a contingent of vocal mathematicians, and some other mathematicians have expressed at least some serious criticism of the reformers in the past.

In 2000, NCTM released the updated ''[[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]]''.
''Principles and Standards'' is widely considered to be a more balanced and less controversial vision of reform than its predecessor.

===Post–World War II plan===
In 1944, NCTM created a postwar plan to help World War II have a lasting effect on math education. Grades 1-6 were considered crucial years to build the foundations of math concepts with the main focus on algebra. In the war years, algebra had one understood purpose: to help the military and industries with the war effort. Math educators hoped to help their students see the need for algebra in the life of an everyday citizen.&lt;ref name="Arithmetic1941"&gt;{{Citation

  | title = Arithmetic in general education : The final report of the national council committee on arithmetic

  | origyear =1941
  | year = 1941}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The report outlined three strategies that helped math educators emphasize the everyday usage of algebra.  First, teachers focused on the meanings behind concepts.  Before, teachers were expected to use either the Drill or the Meaning Theory.  Now, teachers gave students purpose behind every concept while providing an ample number of problems.  Second, teachers abandoned the informal technique of teaching.  This technique was popular during the 1930s and continued during the war, and in essence depended on what the students wanted to learn, based on their interests and needs.  Instead, math teachers approached the material in an organized manner.  The thinking was that Math itself had a very distinct organization that could not be compromised simply because the student was uninterested in the matter.  Third, teachers learned to adapt to the students by offering the proper practice students needed in order to be successful.&lt;ref name="Arithmetic1941"/&gt;
After the sixth year, seventh and eighth grades were considered key in ensuring students learned concepts, and were increasingly standardized for all pupils.  During these years, teachers verified all key concepts learned in the previous years were mastered, while preparing students for the sequential math courses offered in high school.  The army credited poor performance of males during the war to the men forgetting math concepts; it was recommended that reinforcing past concepts learned would solve this problem.  The report lists the organization of the topics that should be taught in these years.  "(1) number and computation; (2) the geometry of everyday life; (3) graphic representation; (4) an introduction to the essentials of elementary algebra (formula and equation)."&lt;ref name="Arithmetic1941"/&gt; At the same time, these years were meant to help students gain critical thinking skills applicable to every aspect of life.  In middle school, students should gain maturity in math, and confidence in past material.&lt;ref name="Arithmetic1941"/&gt;
In ninth grade, NCTM expressed the need for a two track curriculum for students in large schools.  Those who have a greater desire to study math would go on one track, studying algebra.  Those who did not have a large interest in math would go another route, studying general mathematics, which eliminated the problem of students being held back.&lt;ref name="Arithmetic1941"/&gt;
Finally, grades 10-12 built math maturity.  In the tenth year, courses focused on geometry through algebraic uses.  The eleventh year focused on a continuation of more advanced algebra topics.  These topics were more advanced than those discussed in the ninth grade.  However, if the student took an advanced algebra class during the ninth year, then he took two of the semester classes offered the twelfth year.

===1961 ''The Revolution in School Mathematics'' ===
NCTM participated in promoting the adoption of the ''[[New Math|New Mathematics]]'' also known at that time as ''Modern Mathematics''. In 1960, NCTM with the financial support of the National Science Foundation, conducted eight Regional Orientation Conferences in Mathematics in various parts of the United States, pushing to "make a concerted effort toward rapid improvement of school mathematics"&lt;ref name="nctm-1961"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED034674.pdf | title = The Revolution in School Mathematics: A Challenge for Administrators and Teachers | year = 1961 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. In 1961 it issued a report ''The Revolution in School Mathematics'' subtitled ''A Challenge for Administrators and Teachers''. 

[[Morris Kline]], a Professor of Mathematics, asserted in his book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add]]'' that ''The Revolution in School Mathematics'' described the New Math curricula as a necessary milestone for establishing new and improved mathematics programs, and "implied that administrators who failed to adopt the reforms were guilty of indifference or inactivity"&lt;ref name="kline-1973"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kline | first = Morris | title = Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1973 | location = New York | isbn =  0-394-71981-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;. Most school administrators "did not have the broad scientific background to evaluate the proposed innovations"&lt;ref name="kline-1973"/&gt;, so they faced the choice of either adopting one of the modern programs, or admit that they are not competent to judge the merits of any one. Ultimately, "many principals and superintendents urged the modern curricula on their teachers just to show parents and school boards that they were alert and active"&lt;ref name="kline-1973"/&gt;.

Kline critiqued the ''Modern Mathematics'' approach to mathematics education and disparaged the adoption of the term "Modern Mathematics" as "pure propaganda". He noted that "traditional connotes antiquity, inadequacy, sterility, and is a term of censure. Modern connotes the up-to-date, relevant, and vital"&lt;ref name="kline-1973"/&gt;.

===1989 ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics''===
The controversial 1989 [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics#1989 ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics''|NCTM Standards]] called for more emphasis on conceptual understanding and problem solving informed by a constructivist understanding of how children learn. The increased emphasis on concepts required decreased emphasis on direct instruction of facts and algorithms. This decrease of traditional rote learning was sometimes understood by both critics and proponents of the standards to mean elimination of basic skills and precise answers, but NCTM has refuted this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nctm.org/standards/focalpoints.aspx?id=284&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[reform mathematics]], students are exposed to algebraic concepts such as patterns and the commutative property as early as first grade. Standard arithmetic methods are not taught until children have had an opportunity to explore and understand how mathematical principles work, usually by first inventing their own methods for solving problems and sometimes ending with children's guided discovery of traditional methods. The Standards called for a de-emphasis of complex calculation drills.

The standards set forth a democratic vision that for the first time set out to promote equity and mathematical power as a goal for all students, including women and underrepresented minorities. The use of calculators and manipulatives was encouraged and rote memorization were de-emphasized. The 1989 standards encouraged writing in order to learn expression of mathematical ideas. All students were expected to master enough mathematics to succeed in college, and rather than defining success by rank order, uniform, high standards were set for all students. Explicit goals of [[standards based education reform]] were to require all students to pass high standards of performance, to improve international competitiveness, eliminate the [[achievement gap]] and produce a productive labor force. Such beliefs were considered congruent with the democratic vision of [[outcome-based education]] and [[standards based education reform]] that all students will meet standards. The U.S. Department of Education named several standards-based curricula as "exemplary", though a group of academics responded in protest with an ad taken out in the Washington Post, noting selection was made largely on which curricula implemented the standards most extensively rather than on demonstrated improvements in test scores.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The standards soon became the basis for many new federally funded curricula such as the [[Core-Plus Mathematics Project]] and became the foundation of many local and state [[curriculum framework]]s. Although the standards were the [[consensus]] of those teaching mathematics in the context of real life, they also became a lightning rod of criticism as "[[math wars]]" erupted in some communities that were opposed to some of the more radical changes to mathematics instruction such as [[Mathland]]'s Fantasy Lunch and what some dubbed "rainforest algebra". Some students complained that their new math courses placed them into remedial math in college, though later research found students from traditional curricula were going into remedial math in even greater numbers. (See [[Core-Plus Mathematics Project#Debate|Andover debate]].)

In the United States, curricula are set at the state or local level. The California State Board of Education [http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/mthmain.asp] was one of the first to embrace the 1989 standards, and also among the first to move back towards [[traditional mathematics|traditional standards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.air.org/news/documents/Singapore%20Report%20(Bookmark%20Version).pdf
AIR report in pdf "The California mathematics framework is modeled on Singaporean and Japanese frameworks"&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 ''Principles and Standards for School Mathematics''===
{{main article|Principles and Standards for School Mathematics}}
The controversy surrounding the 1989 standards paved the way for revised standards which sought more clarity and balance. In 2000, NCTM used a consensus process involving mathematicians, teachers, and educational researchers to revise its standards with the release of the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, which replaced all preceding publications. The new standards were organized around six principles (Equity, Curriculum, Teaching, Learning, Assessment, and Technology) and ten strands, which included five content areas (Number and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis and Probability) and five processes (Problem Solving, Reasoning and Proof, Communication, Connections, and Representation). ''Principles and Standards'' was not perceived to be as radical as the 1989 standards and did not engender significant criticism. The new standards have been widely used to inform textbook creation, state and local curricula, and current trends in teaching.

===2006 ''Curriculum Focal Points''===
In September 2006, NCTM released [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Curriculum Focal Points|''Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence'']]. In the Focal Points, NCTM identifies what it believes to be the most important mathematical topics for each grade level, including the related ideas, concepts, skills, and procedures that form the foundation for understanding and lasting learning. In the Focal Points, NCTM made it clear that the standard algorithms were to be included in arithmetic instruction.

Mathematics curricula in the United States are often described as “a mile wide and an inch deep” when compared with curricula from other countries. State content expectations per grade level range anywhere between 26 and 89 topics. At just three per grade (plus a few additional "connection" topics), the focal points offer more than headings for long lists, providing instead descriptions of the most significant mathematical concepts and skills at each grade level and identifying important connections to other topics. NCTM believes that organizing a curriculum around these described focal points, with a clear emphasis on the processes that Principles and Standards addresses in the Process Standards—communication, reasoning, representation, connections, and, particularly, problem solving—can provide students with a connected, coherent, ever expanding body of mathematical knowledge and ways of thinking.

The Focal Points were one of the documents used in creating the 2010 [[Common Core State Standards]], which have been adopted by most states as the basis for new math curricula.

[[File:Sede storica di OCCAM -Osservatorio per la Comunicazione Digitale, Piazza Duomo,Milano.jpg|thumb|View from the previous OCCAM - Observatory on Digital Communication headquarters, in Milan, Piazza Duomo, with the UNESCO flag.]]

The '''Observatory on Digital Communication''' ('''OCCAM''') was established in 1996 by UNESCO in Milan, with the Agreements signed by the Director General, Federico Mayor and Mayor Marco Formentini in June 1996. The acronym stands for '''Observatory for Cultural and Audiovisual Communication in the Mediterranean'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Ferrari da Fiera Spa al Comitato UNESCO|last=|first=|date=18 October 2007|work=laRepubblica|access-date=|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tecnologia e Sviluppo - Ferrari "ambasciatore" per il Palazzo di Vetro|last=Belloni|first=Alberto|date=17 October  2007|work=il Cittadino|access-date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, OCCAM has been associated with the [[UN|United Nations]] ''Department of Public Information'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ultimavoce.it/infopoverty-world-conference/|title=l 21 aprile si terrà la Infopoverty World Conference, che porta le parole chiave di sviluppo e sostenibilità per l’abbattimento della povertà|last=Piromalli|first=Ilaria|date=26 July 2018|work=Ultima Voce|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2005 it received Special Consultative Status at the UN's Social and Economic Council ([[ECOSOC]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnr.it/it/evento/12100/il-contributo-italiano-alla-lotta-all-hiv-aids-ix-infopoverty-world-conference-iii-sessione-italiana|title=IL CONTRIBUTO ITALIANO ALLA LOTTA ALL'HIV/AIDS - IX INFOPOVERTY WORLD CONFERENCE - III SESSIONE ITALIANA|last=|first=|date=20 March 2009|work=Consgilio Nazionale delle Ricerche|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/consultativeStatusSummary.do?profileCode=2727|title=Civil Society Participation|last=|first=|date=|website=NGO Branch, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006 OCCAM is leader of the ''e-service for development'' Community of Expertise within the ''Global Alliance for Information and Communications Technologies and Development'' (UN - GAID), initiative launched by the UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of the Global Alliance for ICT and Development|last=Celik|first=Aliye P.|publisher=United Nations|year=|isbn=9789211045673|location=New York|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Observatory is the architect Pierpaolo Saporito, who founded it during his presidency at the UNESCO ''International Council of Cinema and Television'' (CICT- IFCT), nominated High Level Advisor of the ''United Nations Global Alliance for ICT and Development.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketpress.info/notiziario_det.php?art=3958|title=Pierpaolo Saporito, presidente di  OCCAM, nominato High Level Advisor dell'Alleanza Globale delle Nazioni Unite per le ICT e lo sviluppo|last=|first=|date=|work=Marketpress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCCAM was founded with the mission to fight poverty as effectively as possible using the new technologies and to promote sustainable development actions in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Innovazione e Tecnologia al servizio del Terzo Mondo|last=|first=|date=17 October 2007|work=il Giornale ed.Milano|access-date=|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and works to support the UN strategies for achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), former [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs, 2000-2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/documents/Press/OCCAM_statement1.pdf|title=Text delivered by Pierpaolo Saporito President of OCCAM 44th Commission on Social Development – ECOSOC|last=|first=|date=13 February 2006|work=United Nations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCCAM's actions, besides its function of Observatory on Digital Communication with studies and research, focuses also on two other main initiatives:

* the '''Infopoverty World Conference''' that has been held annually since 2001 in the UN headquarters in New York; it takes stock of the phenomena of the digital revolution as it can be employed to strengthen the fight against poverty;
* the '''Infopoverty Programme''' that collects the operational suggestions emerging from the conference to turn them into projects realized in various parts of the world.

As part of the Infopoverty program, OCCAM promoted the foundation of the Infopoverty Institute at the University of Oklahoma in 2004, to spread the Infopoverty vision in the American academic world, having as its scope to improve the living conditions of the population with ICT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopoverty.ou.edu/|title=Infopoverty Institute|website=infopoverty.ou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the IWC has reached a high government level, thanks to the presence of high-ranking officials such as: [[Staffan de Mistura]],  General Secretary Personal Representative; Armida de Lopez Contreras, Vice President of Honduras; [[John Negroponte]], former US Ambassador, Israel Chris, Deputy Secretary US department of Commerce (which announced in 2003 the creation of the Millennium Challenge Account by the Bush administration); Sonia Mendieta de Badaroux, President of the UNESCO General Assembly; Hisanori Isomura, president of CICT-UNESCO and ambassador of Japan in Paris; [[Mario Baccini]], Italian foreign minister; Carlos A. Braga, director of the World Bank; Donaldo Ochoa, director of the Central American Bank for Economic Intregation; [[Giuseppe Gargani]], president of the European Parliament's Media and Culture Committee; Adriana de Kanter, director of the US Department of Education; [[Guido Podestà]], Vice-President of the European Parliament; [[Arturo Vallarino]], Vice-President of the Republic of Panama; John Shirley, President of the Navajo Nation; John Gage, co-founder Sun Microsystems; [[Hamadoun Touré]], Secretary General ITU; Shashi Tharoor, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Communications and Public Information; Montassar Ouali, Tunisian Minister of Communication; Enrique Planas, Secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Social Communication; Sarbuland Khan, Director UN – GAID; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible to check comparing the agendas of every single conference.

The agendas are also collected in: Pierpaolo Saporito, 18 years of Infopoverty World Conference 2001-2018, {{ISBN|9781326464608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the ICT Village model, a project that is still active in the Infopoverty Programme, was formalized during the first phase of the World Summit Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/SMSI/Documents/2003-12-19_summit_participants.pdf|title=Final list of participants|last=World Summit on Information Society|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Infopoverty Programme was born from the Conference to promote the validated projects and implement them concretely in the countries most in need.

The conferences over the years have been organized in partnership with the European Parliament, Office of Milan, and have received the high patronage of the President of the Republic, the patronage of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and other national and international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794003985|title=Achieving the global public health agenda : dialogues at the Economic and Social Council|date=2009|publisher=United Nations|others=United Nations.

=== Infopoverty seminars ===

As a follow-up to the Infopoverty Conferences held annually in spring at the UN seat in New York, OCCAM was invited to hold in-depth seminars at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.

In particular, in 2003 the Seminar was held during the first phase of the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itu.int/net/wsis/docs/geneva/summit_participants.pdf|title=List of participants -WSIS|last=|first=|date=|work=International Telecommunicatoin Union|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where the Infopoverty Programme was launched.

In 2005, in the next phase of Tunis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/net/wsis/tunis/events/links-cont.html|title=World Summit on the Information Society|last=wsis|website=www.itu.int|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCCAM organized a second Seminar during which they presented the WSIS ICT Village in Borji Ettouil as a model of large-scale application.&lt;ref&gt;OCCAM - Observatory, The Infopoverty Programme for the WSIS and beyond (PDF), in UN Esa Coordination Alliance, http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/documents/website/brochure%20wsis%202005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a memorandum was signed with ITU (International Communication Union) and Navajo Nation for the creation of the Indigenous Portal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonprofitonline.it/default.asp?id=429&amp;id_n=2115|title=(2 novembre 2005) SEMINARIO: ' INFOPOVERTY PROGRAMME'.|website=www.nonprofitonline.it|language=IT|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itespresso.it/infopoverty-partecipa-al-summit-mondiale-sulla-societa-dellinformazione-16032.html?inf_by=5b28e074671db803208b567a|title=Infopoverty partecipa al Summit Mondiale sulla società dell'Informazione - ITespresso.it|date=2005-11-10|work=ITespresso.it|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and managed the WSIS-TV, on ITU delegation.&lt;ref&gt;OCCAM - Observatory, Infopoverty Seminat @ WSIS 2005, in ITU News, https://www.itu.int/net/wsis/tunis/events/docs/occam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Infopoverty seminars were held later, always at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, in conjunction with the work of the UN Commission for Science and Technology or the Annual Ministerial Review, accompanied by illustrative expositions at the ECOSOC biennial Innovation Fair.&lt;ref name="Economic and Social Council"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/innovfair2013/participants.shtml|title=Economic and Social Council|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infopoverty programme ==

The Infopoverty programme, born at the instigation of the Infopoverty Conferences as a moment of implementation of the related resolutions, deals with the development of operational projects in favor of the most disadvantaged communities, using new technologies, from solar to web, providing internet connections and digital services, oriented towards the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Many projects have been launched over the years, including '''ICT Villages''' to redeem poorer communities (SDG 1) from poverty, '''eMedMed''' for telemedicine (SDG 3), W'''orld Food &amp; Health Security e-Center''' for agricultural development and food security, (SDG 2). The Program is updated annually at each UN Infopoverty conference and illustrated with specific exposures.

=== ICT Villages ===

The ICT Village project stems from the need to provide technologies and services to the most disadvantaged communities to enable them to promote their own development. The replicable model of ICT Village focuses on three types of intervention: i) ensuring an education to young people aimed at enhancing local resources and creating jobs, ii) ensuring a basic level of health, iii) providing internet access to the whole community to strengthen its capacity for socio-economic development.

The ICT Village model, developed and launched by OCCAM has had a large echo, influencing deeply different levels of the society: the model has even been cited by the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]] Global Innovation and Strategy Center in one of its document concerning the Village Infrastructure  Kit-Alpha (VIKA).&lt;ref&gt;USSTRATCOM Global Innovation and Strategy Center Village Infrastructure Kit-Alpha Spring 2009 – Project 09-02 May 2009

http://star-tides.net/sites/default/files/documents/files/VIKA%20Final%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ICT village project was carried out in 1999 in Honduras,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Vecchie tecnologie per i nuovi scenari|last=Astesani|first=Marialuisa|date=November 2003|work=in Espansione|access-date=|page=110,111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=I nuovi sbarchi?

With the support of the Ministry of Science and Technology (COHCIT) and the local University (UCyT) and the main international organizationsit was possible to implement two projects initially called Solar Village in the communities of '''San Ramon''' and '''San Francisco de Lempira'''. Thanks to the use of solar panels and the first satellite equipped for the Internet of OnSatNet, the supply of electricity was guaranteed, and a connection to 108 mb / sec, a real record for the time, able to provide more than 30,000 people the first e-learning and telemedicine services provided, allowing the population to use these new technologies advantageously and to connect to the rest of the world through e-commerce and e-government initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/325000435|title=ECulture : cultural content in the digital age|last=M.|first=Ronchi, Alfredo|date=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540752769|location=Berlin|oclc=325000435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented and discussed in the various IWC 2001-2003, the model is proposed to the Government of Tunisia for an experimentation in the village of '''Borji Ettouil''' at the WSIS Summit in November 2003. The success of this WSIS -ICT Village - supported by the National Solidarity Fund &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/stocktaking/projects/Project/Details?projectId=1144248826|title=Details|website=www.itu.int|language=en|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itespresso.it/infopoverty-la-tecnologia-contro-il-digital-divide-12363.html?inf_by=5b28e074671db803208b567a|title=Infopoverty, la tecnologia contro il digital divide - ITespresso.it|date=2005-03-16|work=ITespresso.it|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visited by numerous government delegations and personalities, who appreciated the operational applications of telemedicine, e-learning and internet community access - allows validating their effectiveness and opens the doors to numerous invitations to replicate it over the years in various countries, including Peru, Ethiopia, Dominican Republic, Lesotho, Tunisia, Ghana, South Lebanon, Navajo Nation, Madagascar.

In particular, in the village of '''Meiss al-Jabal''', in South Lebanon, born from a collaboration with [[Staffan de Mistura]], High Representative of the UN Secretary General in the region, as a support action for the refugee communities, it was provided with two digitized classrooms, satellite connection and various specialized devices for remote consultation and assistance services, obtaining a rapid professionalization of the students, to offer them hope for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vita.it/it/article/2003/06/26/piano-di-battaglia-contro-linfopovert/25541/|title=Piano di battaglia contro l'infopovert|date=2003-06-26|work=Vita|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, with the war events of 2006, many villages have been destroyed, including Meiss al-Jabal. In Lebanon. Moreover, OCCAM promoted the birth of the Beirut Film Festival with the Ministry of Culture and the International Council for International Cinema and Television, and the reconstruction of the National Film Archive to make a contribution to the UN Peacekeeping action.

A longlasting project is the ICT Village of '''Sambaina''', born also thanks to the support of the then President of the Malgasy Republic S.E. Marc Ravalomanana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/MDG/05.%2024012012_Sambaina%202011%20Annual%20report.pdf|title=MILLENNIUM VILLAGE INITIATIVE IN SAMBAINA, MADAGASCAR2011 ANNUAL REPORT|last=|first=|date=|work=UNDP|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here the project has been developed focusing on:

• telemedicine, with the establishment of a new digitalized health unit, especially on maternal care, achieving a reduction in pre-postpartum and early childhood mortality,

• e-learning, with classes equipped with computers and other digital devices and courses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/Address%20by%20Ambassado%20Zina%20Andrianarivelo.pdf|title=Address by Ambassador Zina Andrianarivelo-Razafy, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Madagascar to the United Nations, at the preparatory meeting for the Annual Ministerial Review Innovation Fair|last=United Nations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development|first=|date=2 May 2007|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

• center for internet access for the population of the district.

All the vast territory, after a first satellite coverage provided by Eutelsat / Skylogic,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/Satellite%20Internet%20Service%20Donated%20to%20Sambaina.pdf|title=Satellite Internet Service Donated to Sambaina, Madagascar|last=United Nations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was connected in broadband using the state frequencies, so that hospitals, schools, municipalities, operated without charges, stating the principle, then decided in UNGAID, that public services must be able to take advantage of public broadband networks.

Sambaina soon arouses international attention, including the visit of [[Jeffrey Sachs]], director of the UN Millenium Project and Special Advisor of the Secretary General Kofi Annan, who proclaimed him in 2006 the first and only one of its kind, Millennium Village towards which both [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/news/2013/03/22/madagascars-millennium-village-goes-it-alone|title=Madagascar's Millennium Village goes it alone|date=2013-03-22|work=IRIN|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Millennium Challenge Corporation USA will launch support programs.

In support of Sambaina and the other ICT Village, OCCAM launched the '''Ville Village Project''' in 2005 to encourage direct collaboration &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;OCCAM - Observatory, INFOPOVERTY PROGRAMME @ WORLD SUMMIT ON INFORMATION SOCIETY (PDF), in UN ESA Coordination Alliance, http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/documents/website/PR%20Infopoverty%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; between communities in developing countries and cities in advanced countries, which have greatly encouraged the integration in the perspective of mutual cultural and social enrichment and in order to optimize the resources put in place by both local authorities and NGOs in development cooperation projects.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The first Ville-Village realization was ratified with the agreement signed by the Ambassador of Madagascar in Itala, SE Jean Pierre Razafi, on December 4, 2008, and the mayor of Lodi Lorenzo Guerini,&lt;ref&gt;Signing during the ceremony of twinning Lodi-Sambaina https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIsa9jcTKHE&lt;/ref&gt; Within this initiative the city of Lodi has been selected to better employ the excellences of its territory, such as the Padano Technology Park, the Hospital (already active in the telemedicine sector)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.key4biz.it/News-2008-12-09-Tecnologie-Banda-larga-cooperazione-internazionale-Skylogic-Madagascar-Lodi-189503/44782/|title=Banda larga e cooperazione internazionale: Skylogic collega il Madagascar ai Centri d'eccellenza di Lodi - Key4biz|date=2008-12-09|work=Key4biz|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vitadigitale.corriere.it/2008/12/09/lodi_madagascar_skylogic/|title=Lodi e il Madagascar|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NGOs operating in its territory. Innovative digital development service centers have also been created, focusing on e-phytopathology, and e-veterinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comune.lodi.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/845|title=Presentato il progetto di cooperazione tra Lodi e la comunità di Sambaina in Madagascar|last=www.comune.lodi.it|first=Comune di Lodi -|work=www.comune.lodi.it|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICT Village of '''Mahobong''', in Lesotho, experimented in 2007 the Digital Services Global Platform, both in the field of Food Security with applications of e-phytopathology and parasitology and of telemedicine, through a new ultrasound device, which allow remote ultrasounds suitable for prevent pre- and post-natal mortality and assist emergency interventions. The project realized by OCCAM in collaboration with the Department of Protection of Agrifood and Urban Systems and Biodiversity Valorization of the University of Milan and with the International Telemedicine Institute (IITM), supported by the Municipality of Milan, has allowed to export knowledge in the field of cultivation and protection of plants and food and limit production losses caused to production, giving considerable development to the communities involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878818701|title=La cooperazione internazionale allo sviluppo della Statale = The activities of international cooperation for development of the University of Milan|date=[2010?]|publisher=Università degli Studi di Milano|others=Sorlini, Claudia.|isbn=9788890598913|location=[Milano]|oclc=878818701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== eMedMed project ===

eMedMed  is the project born in the context of the Union for the Mediterranean; it aims to promote a more widespread and efficient diffusion of the health service in Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and Egypt, through telemedicine. It is the result of the experimentation of over 15 years of applications in the various ICT Village in the field of maternal care, emergencies, cardiology, and traumatology.

It has been selected among the most relevant projects for the development of the Mediterranean by the French Senate. On the 20th June 2014, it was presented during the Conference ''Au-delà des frontières: les partenariats euro-méditerranéens par ceux qui les font''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumforpeace.com/conference-2014-2/|title=Conférence 2014 - Forum pour la Paix|website=Forum pour la Paix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was validated at the UN in 2015 at the XV Infopoverty World Conference, where it was illustrated for OCCAM by the scientific director, Luigi De Vecchis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.toptrade.it/news/38374/emedmed-la-telemedicina-al-fianco-dei-paesi-in-via-di-sviluppo/#.W4QQYugzaUl|title=EMedMed: la Telemedicina al fianco dei Paesi in Via di Sviluppo - Top Trade|date=2015-03-23|work=Top Trade|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the Dedalus Group, by Giorgio Moretti,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sanita24.ilsole24ore.com/art/in-europa-e-dal-mondo/2015-04-08/emedmed-telemedicina-sbarca-nord-182555.php?uuid=AbAwzXfL&amp;refresh_ce=1|title=EmedMed: la telemedicina sbarca in Nord Africa|work=Sanità24|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for the software clinical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.corrierecomunicazioni.it/digital-economy/l-italiana-dedalus-firma-la-telemedicina-in-nord-africa/|title=L'italiana Dedalus "firma" la telemedicina in Nord Africa - CorCom|date=2015-03-17|work=CorCom|access-date=2018-08-27|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in20righe.it/cronaca/5469-sara-presentato-all-onu-un-progetto-di-telemedicina-realizzato-dal-gruppo-dedalus.html|title=Sarà presentato all'Onu un progetto di Telemedicina realizzato dal gruppo Dedalus|website=www.in20righe.it|language=it-it|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to improve health conditions in the Southern Mediterranean countries through the participation of a network of clinical centers and European experts connected with local structures through a specific platform with ICT Solutions and innovative scientific m-devices. The system integrates the resources of hospitals and service centers in the area and the data collected in the field (diagnostic imaging, medical records, patient records, consultations, training etc.) through the network, optimizing, which would also allow in our country, the 'home care of the patient, reducing costs and optimizing the use of resources. Focal moment for the operational definition of the project was the XXI Euromediterranean Conference, held in Catania on 26–27 February 2016, in which the E-MedMed Memorandum of Understanding was signed in the presence of representatives of the Italian Government, OCCAM and the Municipality of Catania to create the ''Hub Center of Catania for Health Security, Migrant Emergency and Solidarity Development in the Mediterranean Basin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metroct.it/e-med-med-project-firmato-protocollo-comune-di-catania-e-occam/|title=E-Med-Med Project.

The project had the chance to collaborate with the IRCCS Bonino health facilities Pulejo of Messina and Provincial Health Authority of Catania, while numerous actors have participated in the development of the Hub: IItm (International Institute of TeleMedicine), Nile Badrawi Foundation for Education and Development in Egypt, Tripoli National Diabetes Hospital and the National Center for Disease Control in Libya, Moroccan Society for TeleMedicine and e-Health in Morocco, Association for Promoting Pulmonology and Allergology in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivio.lasiciliaweb.it//articolo/137607/salute/catania-hub-mediterraneo-per-la-telemedicina|title=Catania hub mediterraneo per la telemedicina|website=archivio.lasiciliaweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to strengthen their capacity to use existing resources - often completely neglected - and start them towards a path of self-sustainable development that respects the environment and human rights.

==== World Food&amp;Health Security e-Center ====

The Centre was created for MilanEXPO 2015 and launched at the International Conference "Beyond EXPO: The New Digital Services for Food Security" held at the Palazzo Lombardia in Milan in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/italy/it/ufficio-a-milano/oltre-l-expo-i-nuovi-servizi-digitali-per-la-sicurezza-alimentare-comunicato-stampa|title=Oltre l'EXPO: i nuovi servizi digitali per la sicurezza alimentare, Comunicato Stampa|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was adopted on 17 November 2016 at the COP22 - UN summit on climate change in Marrakech,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sito.omnimilano.it/cop22-world-food-security-ecenter-porta-proposte-sostenibilita-a-marrakech/|title=COP22, WORLD FOOD SECURITY ECENTER PORTA PROPOSTE SOSTENIBILITÀ A MARRAKECH|website=omnimilano|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a tool able to provide rapid and low-cost solutions to rural communities, thanks to digital services provided by prestigious centers of excellence and networking of connected service providers thanks to the Infopoverty platform, able to share expertise with remote users, transfer data and support and connect local institutions with the main facilities for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Carta di Milano - Infopoverty Programme (PDF), in Carta di Milano, http://carta.milano.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/113.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The center is also distinguished by the use of sustainable and modular technologies, which rely on clean energy like the ones obtained from photovoltaics.

The Center, validated at the XVIII Infopoverty World Conference on the 13th of April 2018, can provide phytopathology, parasitology, remote diagnosis and analysis, soil and food evaluation, crop monitoring and soil protection. and analysis of water potability; telemedicine services such as radiology, ultrasound, extended to basic veterinary and cold chain testing services along the food supply chain. Moreover, the hub will form, thanks to new ICT technologies, new generation of experts and technicians, through a network of service providers such as AISSA (Italian Association of Agricultural Scientific Societies), the University of Milan, the University of Milan. of Sassari, the Padano Technology Park, Smithers Foundation&lt;ref&gt;Brochure World Food &amp; Health Security e-Center (PDF), in Softsol, https://www.softsol.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brochure_HFSeCenter-XVIII_IWC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other associated international centers of excellence.

The Center's structure is configured as a telecommunication hub with its own platform capable of providing and receiving, through broadband connectivity, remote data which, analysed by the Center, sends ad hoc solutions to the Service Users regarding the various problems submitted, in strict coordination with local government policies, according to precise protocols. The economic sustainability of the Center will be guaranteed by the benefits produced in the field, enhanced in blockchain mode, in order to guarantee maximum transparency and sharing of results.

=== Infopoverty programme exhibitions ===

Simultaneously with the various conferences and seminars, OCCAM has set up exhibitions illustrating its activities and the results achieved. In particular, there are the exhibitions in the Bramante Cloisters of the Catholic University of Milan 2001, at the Polytechnic of Milan, at the Palais des Nations in Genevra for the WSIS 2003 and the Ecosoc Innovation Fair 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amrif.blogspot.com/2007/07/exhibitors-list-and-synopses.html|title=.: Exhibitor's List and Synopses|last=Sud|first=Anisha|date=2007-06-29|website=.|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009,&lt;ref&gt;UN ECOSOC, LIST OF SIDE EVENTS 6-9 JULY 2009 (PDF), in High-level Segment 2009, http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/julyhls/pdf/side%20events%20-%20list%20for%20website_24_6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  2011, 2013 &lt;ref name="Economic and Social Council"/&gt; in the central pavilion of the 2005 WSIS in Tunis and also at the Glass Palace in New York.

Alberto Belloni, “Il lodigiano a capo di un organismo di cooperazione UNESCO - Tecnologia e sviluppo, Ferrari “ambasciatore” per il palazzo di vetro, il Cittadino,17/10/2007, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory has two representations at the UN, one in New York and one in Geneva and an international head of Institutional Relations.&lt;ref&gt;International Manager of the Institutional Relations, Gloria Kins Starr, editor of Diplomatic &amp; Society Review, https://www.sadrmedia.com/copy-of-our-history&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO and European Parliament partnership ==

Since its foundation, the Observatory has had a close relationship with UNESCO, which originated it  in 1996 as a special project associated with the Mediterranean Program, a network of agencies and institutions aimed at supporting the Barcelona Agreement of 1995 on free trade Euro-Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;The UNESCO Mediterranean Programme http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001160/116048Mo.pdf ; cfr p. 173 of the document, 36 of the English section.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, OCCAM assisted the organization of the "1st Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Cinema", under the patronage of the President of the Italian Republic, held in Venice in September 1995, with the UNESCO Conseil International du Cinema et de la Television, and the European Parliament, Rome office.

These annual conferences form a forum where the various protagonists of the Region work on the role that cinema and new media can play in the process of integration of the Mediterranean, identifying and promoting concrete initiatives to support the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/italy/it/ufficio-a-milano/xix-conferenza-euromediterranea|title=XIX CONFERENZA EUROMEDITERRANEA|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in twenty years, the Euro-Mediterranean Conferences on Cinema have seen among its participants representatives of governments, international organizations, public and private institutions, experts in the new media and men and women of culture;&lt;ref&gt;Message from Daniela Bas for the XVII Conferenza Euromediterranea sul Cinema https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UilMsfo7q9U&lt;/ref&gt;  this initiative has promoted and supported important initiatives in the Mediterranean, such as: the Euromed Audiovisuel program for cinema support policy; the Copeam for public televisions; the Film Festivals of Tirana, Ohrid, Zagreb, Beirut, Gaza, Kouribka, Kalamata, Menorca; the rencontres cinèma of Hammammet; the relaunch of the Antalya Festival in Turkey, the first Euro-Asian festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossi|first=Roberto|date=|title=Nuovi media...e il puibblico si fa creatore|url=https://issuu.com/eitalia/docs/eitalia52|journal=èItalia|volume=|pages=12|via=ISSUU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the XXI Conference was held on February 26 and 27 in Catania with the theme of the Mediterranean in the Digital Era and focused on ''Health Security, Migrant Emergency and Solidarity Development in the Mediterranean Basin'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://italplanet.it/occam-xxi-conferenza-euromediterranea/|title=OCCAM – XXI Conferenza Euromediterranea {{!}} Italplanet|last=Nice|website=italplanet.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with important contributions from the Mayor of Catania [[Enzo Bianco]], the ministerial undersecretaries Giuseppe Castiglione, Domenico Manzione, Vito De Filippo and Benedetto Della Vedova, senior representatives of the coastal countries, partners of the eMedMed project, and the President of OCCAM and Infopoverty Pierpaolo Saporito, who underlined how the conference goes beyond cinema and television to widen the field of digital communication, and can be integrated as a regional contribution to the worldwide mission of Infopoverty.

The official languages of Canada are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], which "have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] and [[Government of Canada]]," according to Canada's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/ddp-hrd/canada/guide/offcl-eng.cfm |title=Subsection 16(1) of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''}} (See [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].)&lt;/ref&gt; '''Official bilingualism''' is the term used in [[Canada]] to collectively describe the policies, constitutional provisions, and laws that ensure legal equality of English and French in the Parliament and courts of Canada, protect the linguistic rights of English and French-speaking minorities in different provinces, and ensure a level of government services in both languages across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html|title=Official Languages Act – 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work=Act current to July 11th, 2010|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2010-08-15| quote= The purpose of this Act is to (a) ensure respect for English and French as the official languages of Canada and ensure equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all federal institutions, in particular with respect to their use in parliamentary proceedings, in legislative and other instruments, in the administration of justice, in communicating with or providing services to the public and in carrying out the work of federal institutions; (b) support the development of English and French linguistic minority communities and generally advance the equality of status and use of the English and French languages within Canadian society; and (c) set out the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions with respect to the official languages of Canada.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the symbolic designation of English and French as [[official language]]s, official bilingualism is generally understood to include any law or other measure that:
*mandates that the federal government conduct its business in both official languages and provide government services in both languages;
*encourages or mandates lower tiers of government (most notably the provinces and territories, but also some municipalities) to conduct themselves in both official languages and to provide services in both English and French rather than in just one or the other;
*places obligations on private actors in Canadian society to provide access to goods or services in both official languages (such as the requirement that food products be labelled in both English and French);
*provides support to non-government actors to encourage or promote the use or the status of one or the other of the two official languages. This includes grants and contributions to groups representing the English-speaking minority in Quebec and the French-speaking minorities in the other provinces to assist with the establishment of an infrastructure of cultural supports and services.

At the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] officially recognizes the equal status of French and English. While French has equal legal status in Manitoba restored due to [[Reference re Manitoba Language Rights|a court ruling]] that struck down seventy-year-old English-only laws in 1985, in practice, French language services are only provided in some regions of the province.&lt;ref name="French Language Services Policy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Government of Manitoba|date=Mar 1999|title=French Language Services Policy|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/fls-slf/pdf/fls_policy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quebec]] has declared itself officially unilingual (French only). Alberta and Saskatchewan are also considered unilingual (English only).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/02/21/pas-de-statut-bilingue-pour-lalberta-et-la-saskatchewan-tranche-la-cour_n_4832079.html |title=Pas de statut bilingue pour l'Alberta et la Saskatchewan, tranche la cour |publisher=Quebec.huffingtonpost.ca |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some services in both English and French and some publicly funded education in both official languages up to the high school level (English language postsecondary education institutions are also present in Quebec, as are French language postsecondary institutions in other provinces, in particular in Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick). English and French are official languages in all three territories. In addition, [[Inuktitut]] is also an official language in [[Nunavut]], and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the [[Northwest Territories]].

==History==
===Before confederation===
====International auxiliary languages====
Linguistic diversity existed in northern North America long before the arrival of the French and the English. Due to the widespread trade that occurred between many linguistic communities, indigenous linguistic knowledge across northern North America appears to have consisted of bilingualism in the mother language and a pidgin as a standard. The known Pidgins included:

* [[Algonquian–Basque pidgin]] (spoken among Basque whalers and various Algonquian peoples and last attested in 1710),
* [[Broken Slavey]] (spoken by indigenous and European residents of the Yukon area in the 19th century)
* [[Chinook Jargon]] (spoken by members of indigenous, neighbouring, Hawaiian, Chinese, English, French, and other nations throughout the Pacific Northwest; reaching its peak in around 1900 with an estimated 100,000 speakers; and still spoken today),
* [[Eskimo Trade Jargon]] (spoken by the Mackenzie River Inuit and the Athabaskan peoples to their South until at least 1909),
* [[Haida Jargon]] (spoken mostly by the English and the Haida until the 1830s),
* [[Labrador Inuit Pidgin French]] (spoken between Breton and Basque fishermen and the Inuit of Labrador from the late 17th century to about 1760), and
* [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] (spoken by speakers of 37 oral languages in 12 families spread across an area of 2.6 million square kilometres stretching from what are now northern Mexico to the southern Northwest Territories, and from the Pacific Northwest to the Saint-Laurence Seaway).

French has been a language of government in the part of Canada that is today Quebec, with limited interruptions, since the arrival of the first French settlers in Canada in 1604 (Acadians) and in 1608 in Quebec, and has been entrenched in the Constitution of Canada since 1867. English has been a language of government in each of the provinces since their inception as British colonies.

Institutional bilingualism in various forms therefore predates the Canadian Confederation in 1867. However, for many years English occupied a ''de facto'' privileged position, and French was not fully equal. The two languages have gradually achieved a greater level of equality in most of the provinces, and full equality at the federal level. In the 1970s French in Quebec became the province's official language.

====Adopting a false ancestry====
{{main|German Canadians }}
Vilma Sindona Eichholz wrote in a book published in 1982:

‘The first Europeans after the Vikings came not as settlers but to exploit the country by trade with the Indians. They were both English and French speaking and had wars among themselves to gain access to this trade. The actual settling of the land took place much later. The French were the first settlers in 1617, but as early as 1660 a German was mentioned as a settler in the records of Quebec. The first English settlers came only a hundred years later, and here we discover a great paradox: These first ten ships full of ‘English’ settlers were exclusively German. In 1745 they founded Waldoburg and 8 years later Lunenburg in the province we now know as Nova Scotia. These protestant Germans were actually recruited in Germany by the British Government to offset the existing French Catholics. Later the governor of Nova Scotia who had already settled in Pennsylvania to move to “Nova Scotia, which will be materially strengthened by the acquisition of these frugal, laborious, and industrious people who will not only improve and enrich their property, but if need be, pertinaciously defend it.” It may surprise us that these first German settlers are “virtually the first English-speaking Canadians” (A.R. Lower). They were English not because of their origin, but because they learned English fast, anglicized their names, and wrote themselves as ‘English’ into the records.

‘It is important to pause here and to investigate why people from a highly civilized country wanted to forget their own language and culture and adopted a false ancestry. It is particularly important, because they were the first but not the last to behave like this. Their reasons for doing so may give us a clue as to why all Caucasian ethnic groups, except the English, behaved likewise including even members from the geographically well-protected French group […].

‘The reason for this strange behaviour is to be found in the ‘almost militant pride’ of the English in their origin. The lost wars against the Americans, who seceded from the English crown, had seriously hurt their pride. Compensating for this, they wanted to create a precise replica of their beloved England in Canada. They displayed an “ultra-British attitude which was heavy with emotion and excluded rational discussion.” They tried to be English to the core in political and social institutions and in their whole life-style. It is here that we find the seeds for the difficulties we face today. This attitude allowed a snobbism to develop, so much resented openly by French-Canadians today and felt by all the other groups too, even if they do not yet feel secure enough to voice their objection. Certain English families demanded special “public favours, power, and office as their birthright.” The desire to have the same privileges for a good start caused the Germans to choose to give up their identity rather than be second class citizens. Today many may say that this was a smart move, especially in light of the fate of another group of German settlers who came later to Ontario.

‘The 64 German families to whom Toronto owes its existence had not made an attempt to anglicize and did not fare as well as their earlier compatriots in Nova Scotia. The Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, found the strategic spot where Canada’s most populous city, Toronto, now stands. Actually this place existed only on paper until 1794 when 180 Germans, under the leadership of the first architect of Upper Canada, Albrecht Ulrich Moll, came, cleared Yonge Street and built the first houses. They accomplished this completely on their own. In return, each family was promised to receive 1000 acres one year later, but the government broke its word to the “suspicious aliens” who “could neither be trusted nor legally hold land before seven years’ residence here as subjects of the Crown. In desperation Moll travelled to the king of England to save his people, who had used up all their reserves during that one year of hard pioneer work. Though the king acknowledged that the settlers had kept their side of the contract and were therefore entitled to the 64 000 acres guaranteed to them, he made it dependent of the approval of the government of Upper Canada, which did not honour the agreement. A disastrous time of famine and death followed for the betrayed group of pioneers.

‘The Germans participated not only in the earlier stages of settlement but came in great numbers to Canada. [...] They also fought in the French and English armies, even in leading positions. For example, in 1755, a Baron von Dieskau from Saxony was appointed Supreme commander of the French troops in North America and General von Riedesel was commander of the German troops fighting under British colours. His wife introduced the first illuminated Christmas tree in Canada in 1781. Of special interest is the Proclamation of Lord Dorchester from July 24, 1788. It created four new districts which had German names and were to become the provinces of Upper Canada, namely Luneburg, Mecklenburg, Nassau and Hesse.

‘The right to have German schools was also granted to the Mennonites who came shortly after Mooll’s unlucky settlers. Many of these reliable industrious farmers left Canada when, after the First World War, this right was rescinded. Learning these facts, one gets the impression that the existence of early German settlers as well as their contributions and loyalty to Canada have been either misrepresented or silenced.’&lt;ref&gt;Esperanto in the Modern World, compiled by Rüdiger and Vilma Sindona Eiholz, Esperanto Press, Bailieboro, Ontario, K0L 1B0, 1982, {{ISBN|0-919186-18-1}}, Universal Decimal Classification 800.892, pages 366-368&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Canadian Indian residential school system====
{{main|Canadian Indian residential school system }}
From 1876 to 1996, the Government of Canada operated the Canadian Indian residential school system which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada described as cultural genocide. This system, combined with education, immigration, and other policies promoting English and French, contributed greatly to the promotion of English and French across Canada.

====The forgotten Coolies====
{{main|Chinese Canadians }}
Vilma Sindona Eichholz wrote:

‘John Alexander Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada, is credited with creating a nation through the construction of this band of steel [the transcontinental railroad] linking the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean. But in order to transform this dream into reality not only political battles had to be won. Thousands of tough labourers had to be found willing to do the actual work which, particularly in the granite canyons of the Western mountains, was not just hard but outright dangerous. Not many Canadians were willing to work for $1.50 a day, considered low even in those days. It soon became apparent that only by the hiring of 6000 collies from China could the railroad be built. They were even willing to work for $1.00 a day and had to give a percentage from that to the company that brought them over. And they worked well. A white foreman was amazed at their endurance and willingness: “I moved 2000 Chinese with all their belongings on their backs 25 miles and they were working normally the next day. With white workers this would have taken me a week.” Instead of either lowering their own expectations or just accepting the fact that foreigners were willing to work for less and get the railroad built, Canadians changed the virtues of these industrious foreigners into a crime. Anti-Chinese feelings ran high, even in areas where the Chinese were unknown such as Winnipeg, whose ‘Times’ wrote about the ‘immoral children of China’ who had ‘no sense whatever of any principle of morality’ and even dared to add: “it is an established fact that dealings with the Chinese are attended with evil results.” But according to their white foreman, not a single incident of dishonesty was known during all the years the Chinese worked on the railroad.

‘It had been the intention of these coolies to go back to their homeland after having earned a few hundred dollars in Canada. But for very few indeed this dream came true. Many had died either in accidents on the job or from scurvy because of bad food. [...] No records were kept about Chinese deaths and let alone any inquiries held. Only a few survivors could save enough to pay their trip back. Most Chinese eventually died separated from their loved ones, rejected by the hostile land they served so well. But some did manage to get their wives over here. They settled mostly in British Columbia.’&lt;ref&gt;Esperanto in the Modern World, compiled by Rüdiger and Vilma Sindona Eiholz, Esperanto Press, Bailieboro, Ontario, K0L 1B0, 1982, {{ISBN|0-919186-18-1}}, Universal Decimal Classification 800.892, pages 368-369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional provisions on official languages==
{{main|Constitution of Canada}}

===Constitution Act, 1867 (section 133)===

English and French have had limited constitutional protection since 1867. Section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' guarantees that both languages may be used in the Parliament of Canada, in its journals and records, and in court proceedings in any court established by the Parliament of Canada. The section also mandates that all Acts of the Parliament of Canada be printed and published in both languages. Guarantees for the equal status of the two official languages are provided in sections 16–23 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which became law in 1982. Sections 16–19 guarantee the equal status of both languages in Parliament, in all federal government institutions, and in federal courts. These sections also mandate that all statutes, records and journals of Parliament be published in both languages, with the English and French versions both holding equal status before the courts. [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 20]] guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is "a significant demand for communication with and services from that office". Significant demand is not defined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the purposes of the ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' of 1988 was to remedy this omission.

The ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' includes similar constitutional obligations making [[New Brunswick]] the only officially bilingual province in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=1982-04-17|title=Canadian charter of rights and freedoms: Official Languages of Canada|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/const_en.html#langues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Section Twenty-one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 21]] ensured that the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be read as supplementing, rather than replacing any rights of the English and French languages, which had been constitutionalized prior to 1982. [[Section Twenty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 22]] ensured that the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would not be interpreted by the courts as placing any new restrictions on non-official languages.

===Education Rights (section 23 of the Charter and section 59 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'')===

Section 23 provides a limited right to receive publicly funded primary and secondary-schooling in the two official languages when they are "in a minority situation"—in other words, to English-language schooling in Quebec, and to French-language schooling in the rest of the country.

====Asymmetrical application of education rights in Quebec versus elsewhere in Canada====
The right applies asymmetrically because section 59 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', provides that not all of the language rights listed in section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:
*In Quebec, a child may receive free public education in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.
*In the rest of Canada, a child may receive free public education in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her [[First language|mother tongue]] (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").
None of these education language rights precludes parents from placing their children in a private school (which they pay for) in the language of their choice; it applies only to subsidized public education.

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries only have access to French-language public schools for their children. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English. On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.

Section 23 also provides, subject only to the "where numbers warrant" restriction, a right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

However, admission to French-language schools outside Quebec remains restricted in some ways it is not in Quebec. In particular, rights holder parents who choose to enrol their child in English school may thereby deprive that child's descendants of the right to attend French school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfontario.ca/en/admission-criteria.html |title=French Education System Admission Criteria &amp;#124; Fle |publisher=Elfontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec, under article 76.1 of the ''Charter of the French Language'', rights holders do not deprive their descendants of the right to an English-language education by choosing to enroll their children in French school. (This applies if certain administrative steps are taken at each generation. Otherwise, the right may still be transmitted to grandchildren under article 76.)

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant".

====Additional restrictions on education rights====
There are some further restrictions on minority-language education rights:
#The rights attach to the parent, not the child, and non-citizens residing in Canada do not have access to this right (even if their children are born in Canada).
#If the parents' English-language or French-language education took place outside Canada, this does not entitle the child to be educated in that language.
#The right to receive public funding can only be exercised in localities where "...the number of children of citizens who have such a right is sufficient to warrant the provision to them out of public funds...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=1982-04-17|title=Canadian charter of rights and freedoms: Minority Language Educational Rights|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/const_en.html#instruction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ambiguous definition of entitlement to education rights====
The phrase, "where numbers ... warrant" is not defined in Section 23. Education is under provincial jurisdiction, which means that it has not been possible for Parliament to enact a single nationwide definition of the term, as the 1988 ''Official Languages Act'' did for the constitutional obligation to provide federal services where “there is a sufficient demand.” As a result, disputes over the extent of the right to a publicly funded minority-language education have been the source of much litigation.

The defining case was ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'' (1990), in which the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that section 23 guaranteed a "sliding scale". In certain circumstances, the children whose parents could exercise the right might be so few that literally no minority language education may be provided by the government. With a greater number of children, some schools might be required to provide [[classroom]]s in which the children could receive minority language education. An even greater number would require the [[construction]] of new schools dedicated solely to minority language education. More recent cases, which have significantly extended these rights, include ''[[Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island]]'' (2000) and ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' (2003).

===Language of the official text of the Constitution===

Many of the documents in Canada's Constitution do not have an official French-language version; for legal purposes only the English-language version is official and any French translations are unofficial. In particular, the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (which created Canada as a legal entity and still contains the most important provisions of governmental powers) has no official French-language version, because it was enacted by the United Kingdom Parliament, which functions in the English language exclusively. Similarly, all other parts of the Constitution that were enacted by the United Kingdom (with the important exception of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]'') have no official French-language version.

Sections 55–57 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' set out a framework for changing this situation. Section 55 calls for French versions of all parts of the Constitution that exist only in English to be prepared as quickly as possible. Section 56 provided that, following adoption of the French versions, both the English-language and French-language versions would be equally authoritative. To avoid the situation where an inaccurately translated French version would have a weight equal to the English original, Section 55 requires that the French-language versions be approved using the same process under which actual constitutional amendments are adopted.

Pursuant to section 55, a French Constitutional Drafting Committee produced French-language versions of all the British North America Acts in the decade following 1982. However, these versions were never ratified under the Constitution’s amendment procedure, and therefore have never been officially adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/intro.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030923020754/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/intro.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2003-09-23 | accessdate=2007-12-18 | work=Final Report of the French Constitutional Drafting Committee | title=Introduction | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 57 states that the “English and French versions of this Act [ie. the ''Constitution Act, 1982''] are equally authoritative.” The purpose of this provision is to clear up any ambiguity that might have existed about the equal status of the two versions as a result of the novel way in which this part of Canada's supreme law came into force. Had the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' been enacted as most preceding amendments to Canada's constitution had been, as a statute of the British parliament, it would, like any other British statute, have been an English-only document. Instead, the British parliament enacted a very concise law, (the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''), written in English only. The operative clauses of the ''Canada Act, 1982'' simply state that an appendix to the Act (the appendix is formally referred to as a "schedule") is to be integrated into the Canadian constitution. The schedule contains the complete text of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', in both English and French.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 'A' of the ''Canada Act'' is a French version of the operative clauses of the ''Canada Act''. Schedule 'B' contains the text of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', in both English and French.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal legislation on official languages==

===Official Languages Act===
{{main|Official Languages Act (Canada)}}
[[File:Montreal-Place Vauquelin, Note.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A bilingual sign in [[Quebec]].]]
Canada adopted its first ''Official Languages Act'' in 1969, in response to the recommendations of the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]]. The current ''Official Languages Act'' was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's efforts to address two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of linguistic minority communities. As well, following the adoption in 1982 of the ''Charter of Rights'', it was necessary to create a legislative framework within which the Government of Canada could respect its new constitutional obligations regarding the official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|title=Official Languages Act|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/ola_llo.asp?Lang=English|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106052455/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/ola_llo.asp?Lang=English|archivedate=2006-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to formalizing Charter provisions in Parts I through IV, the Act adopts several specific measures to achieve these objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|title=Official Languages Act Annotated version – Explanatory notes|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010021011/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Part V specifies that the work environment in federal institutions in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] and other prescribed bilingual regions be conducive to accommodating the use of French and English at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-04|title=Official Languages Act – Part V – Language of Work|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010021011/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part VI mandates that English-speaking Canadians and French-speaking Canadians not be discriminated against based on ethnic origin or first language learned when it comes to employment opportunities and advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-04|title=Official Languages Act – Part VI – Participation of English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010021011/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Act establishes a [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Commissioner of Official Languages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|title=Welcome to the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages!|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/home_accueil.asp?Lang=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifies their duties to hear and investigate complaints, make recommendations to Parliament, and delegate authority in matters pertaining to official languages in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-04|title=Official Languages Act – Part VIII – Commissioner of Official Languages|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/O-3.01/bo-ga:l_IX//en#anchorbo-ga:l_IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's current Commissioner of Official Languages is [[Raymond Théberge]].

Section 32 of the ''Official Languages Act'' authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal cabinet) to issue regulations that define the geographic regions where the federal government offers services in the relevant minority language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-17|title= Definition of English or French Linguistic Minority |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-92-48/bo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This provides a legal definition for the otherwise vague requirement that services be provided in the minority official languages wherever there is "significant demand." The definition used in the regulations is complex, but basically an area of the country is served in both languages if at least 5,000 persons in that area, or 5% of the local population (whichever is smaller), belongs to that province's English or French linguistic minority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-17|title= Calculation of Population Numbers|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-92-48/bo-ga:l_I-gb:s_4//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations were first promulgated in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|title=Official Languages Regulations|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/reg.asp?Lang=English|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110052520/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/reg.asp?Lang=English|archivedate=2006-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US influence on the status of English and French in Canada==
Book I Chapter 1.C of the report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, published on 8 October 1967, acknowledges the international influence on Canadian language policy:
{{quote|Compared to other bilingual states-among them Finland, South Africa, and Belgium, which we shall discuss later-Canada is fortunate that her official languages both have international status…

In Canada, however, one of the two language groups begins with a considerable advantage. As the national language of the United States, one of the most powerful countries of the world, English has a massive preponderance in North America. Thus the English-language group in this country draws much of its strength from the English-speaking population of our neighbour. The French-language group is, on the other hand, a minority on the North American continent and suffers from its isolation not only from France but from the other French speaking peoples of the world.&lt;ref name="publications.gc.ca"&gt;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1963-1-5-1-1-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Official bilingualism in the public service==
{{main|Official bilingualism in the public service of Canada}}
The issue of proportional hiring and promotion of speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each linguistic group have complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population. For the greater part of Canada’s history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service, and the disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of public servants. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades.

The first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, "for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices...."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 75. Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at the most senior level.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: “In the Dominion Civil Service, Côté’s ‘’Political Appointments’’, 1867–1895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.”

==Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories==
{{main|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories}}

Canada's thirteen provinces and territories have adopted widely diverging policies with regard to minority-language services for their respective linguistic minorities. Given the wide range of services, such as policing, health care and education, that fall under provincial jurisdiction, these divergences have considerable importance.

===New Brunswick===
Of Canada's ten provinces, only one ([[New Brunswick]]) has voluntarily chosen to become officially bilingual. New Brunswick's bilingual status is constitutionally entrenched under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Sections 16–20 of the ''Charter'' include parallel sections guaranteeing the same rights at the federal level and at the provincial level (New Brunswick only).
*Section 16(2) is a largely symbolic statement that "English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick" with "equality of status".
*Section 17(2) guarantees the right to use English or French in the New Brunswick legislature
*Section 18(2) states that New Brunswick's laws will be bilingual, with both texts equally authoritative, and that official publications will be bilingual.
*Section 19(2) guarantees the right to use either official language in all New Brunswick court proceedings.
*Section 20(2) guarantees the right to receive provincial government services in either official language.

===Manitoba===
Manitoba is the only province that was officially bilingual at the time of its establishment.
Following the [[Red River Rebellion]] led by the Francophone [[Métis]] [[Louis Riel]], the [[Manitoba Act]] was passed, creating the province and mandating the equal status of English and French in all legislative bodies, legislative records, laws and court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Parliament of Canada|date=12 May 1870|title=Manitoba Act, 1870|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ma_1870.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Manitoba had a majority Francophone population, but within 20 years mass immigration from Ontario and non-Francophone countries had reduced the Francophone proportion of the population to less than 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|title=The French Language in Manitoba: French-Canadian and European Roots |url=http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/en/article-564/The_French_Language_in_Manitoba:_French-Canadian_and_European_Roots_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the provincial government of [[Thomas Greenway]] stripped funding from the French school system and revoked the equal status of French, a controversial move that caused tension between French and English speakers throughout Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Canada's History|title=Controversy and Compromise over the Manitoba Schools Question|url=http://www.canadashistory.ca/Magazine/Online-Exclusive/Articles/Controversy-and-Compromise-over-the-Manitoba-Schoo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527213333/http://www.canadashistory.ca/Magazine/Online-Exclusive/Articles/Controversy-and-Compromise-over-the-Manitoba-Schoo|archivedate=2014-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the protests of Franco-Manitobans that the Manitoba Act had been violated, Manitoba remained monolingual in practice until the early 1980s, when legal challenges created a crisis that threatened to invalidate almost all laws passed in Manitoba since 1890, on the grounds that these statutes were not published in French as required by the Manitoba Act.&lt;ref name="The French Language Debate"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Manitoba Law Journal|date=2003|title=The French Language Debate|url=http://robsonhall.ca/mlj/sites/default/files/articles/The%20French%20Language%20Debate.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government under [[Howard Pawley]] tried and failed to address the crisis, with the opposition refusing to attend legislative sessions.&lt;ref name="The French Language Debate"/&gt; In 1985 the Supreme Court ruled that the Manitoba Act had been violated and that all provincial legislation must be published in both French and English, restoring the legal equality of the languages that had existed when the province was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Supreme Court of Canada|date=June 13, 1985|title=Re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/60/index.do}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this restoration of legal equality faced overwhelming public opposition at the time,&lt;ref name="The French Language Debate"/&gt; polls taken in 2003 showed a majority of Manitobans supported provincial bilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Association for Canadian Studies|date=Jan 1, 2003|title=Perceived Threat to the French Language and Culture and Support for Bilingualism in Canada|url=http://www.acs-aec.ca/pdf/polls/Perceived%20Threat%20to%20the%20French%20Language%20and%20Culture%20and%20Support%20for%20bilingualism%20in%20canada-2003-01-01.04.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Manitoba's unique history, it has a complex bilingual profile combining that of a province with a "small official-language minority and one with constitutional protection of said minority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fraser Institute|date=Jan 16, 2012|title=Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces|url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428174237/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the ''[[French Language Services Policy]]'' guarantees access to provincial government services in French, though in practice French language services are available only in some areas.&lt;ref name="French Language Services Policy"/&gt; Public primary and secondary education is provided in both French and English, and parents are free to choose instruction in either language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Government of Manitoba|title=Going to School|url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/schools/gts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Post-secondary Francophone education is provided by the [[Université de Saint-Boniface]],
the oldest university in Western Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Université de Saint-Boniface|title=Bref Historiquel|url=https://ustboniface.ca/page.aspx?pid=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
[[File:QuebecStoreSign.jpg|200px|thumb|Bilingual sign in a Quebec supermarket with ''markedly predominant'' French text]]French has been the only official language in Quebec since 1974, when the Liberal government of [[Robert Bourassa]] enacted [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''The Official Language Act'']] (better-known as "Bill 22"). However, the province's language law does provide for limited services in English. As well, the province is obliged, under Section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, to allow the provincial legislature to operate in both French and English, and to allow all Quebec courts to operate in both languages. Section 23 of the Charter applies to Quebec, but to a more limited degree than in other provinces. Quebec is required to provide an education in English to all children whose Canadian citizen parents were educated in English in Canada, while all other provinces are required to provide an education in French to the children of Canadian citizen parents who either received their education in French in Canada or whose native tongue is French.

In 1977, the [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]] introduced the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' (better known as "Bill 101") to promote and preserve the French language in the province, indirectly disputing the federal bilingualism policy. Initially, Bill 101 banned the use of all languages but French on most commercial signs in the province (except for companies with four employees or fewer), but those limitations were later loosened by allowing other languages on signs, as long as the French version is predominant. Bill 101 also requires that children of most immigrants residing in Quebec attend French-language public schools; the children of Canadian citizens who have received their education in Canada in English may attend English-language public schools, which are operated by English-language school boards throughout the province. The controversy over this part of Quebec's language legislation has lessened in recent years as these laws became more entrenched and the public use of French increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209161455/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebec's language laws have been the subject of a number of legal rulings. In 1988, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in the case of [[Ford v. Quebec (A.G.)]] that the commercial sign law provisions of Bill 101, which banned the use of the English language on outdoor signs, were unconstitutional. In 1989, the Quebec National Assembly invoked the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|"Notwithstanding Clause"]] of the Charter of Rights to set aside enforcement of the court ruling for five years. A UN appeal of the 'McIntyre Case' resulted in a condemnation of Quebec's sign law — regardless of the legality of the notwithstanding clause under Canadian law. In response, in 1993 Quebec enacted amendments to the sign law, availing itself of the suggestions proposed in the losing 1988 Supreme Court ruling by allowing other languages on commercial signs, subject to French being ''markedly predominant'' .

On March 31, 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously that the interpretation made by the provincial administration of the "major part" criterion in Quebec's ''language of instruction'' provisions violated the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. This criterion allows students who have completed the "major part" of their primary education in English in Canada to continue their studies in English in Quebec. The Court did not strike down the law but, as it had done in its 1988 ruling on sign laws, presented the province with a set of criteria for interpreting the law in conformity with the ''Charter of Rights'', broadening the interpretation of the phrase "major part".

===Territories===
French and English are official languages in Canada's three federal territories: [[Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Nunavut and the Northwest Territories also accord official language status to several indigenous languages. [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] are official languages in Nunavut because of the territory's [[Inuit]] population. The Northwest Territories accords official status to nine aboriginal languages ([[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], [[Slavey language|South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|Tłįchǫ/Dogrib]]). NWT residents have the right to use any of the territory's eleven official languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the government publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages only when asked by the legislature. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practice, this means that only English language services are universally available, and there is no guarantee that any particular government service will use other languages except the courts. Following a 2006 territorial supreme court ruling, ''Fédération Franco-Ténoise v. Canada (Attorney General)'', universal French-language services are also mandatory.

===Elsewhere in Canada===
[[File:Tim hortons ualbany.jpg|thumb|The comments box in both French and English at the now-defunct Tim Hortons store in the [[University at Albany, State University of New York|SUNY Albany]] campus center]]
Although no Canadian province has officially adopted English as its sole official language, English is the de facto language of government services and internal government operations in Canada's seven remaining provinces. Service levels in French vary greatly from one province to another (and sometimes within different parts of the same province).

For example, under the terms of Ontario's 1986 ''[[French Language Services Act]]'', Francophones in 25 designated areas across the province—but not in other parts of the province—are guaranteed access to provincial government services in French. Similarly, since 2005, the City of Ottawa has been officially required under Ontario law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/documents/Bills/38_Parliament/Session1/b163_e.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314091619/http://www.ontla.on.ca/documents/Bills/38_Parliament/Session1/b163_e.htm |date=March 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to set a municipal policy on English and French.

In Alberta, the ''[[Alberta School Act]]'' protects the right of French-speaking people to receive school instruction in the French language in the province.

==Language rights in the legal system==
There is considerable variation across Canada concerning the right to use English and French in legislatures and courts (federal, provincial and territorial).  Rights under federal law are consistent throughout Canada, but different provinces and territories have different approaches to language rights.  Three provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick and Quebec) have constitutional guarantees for bilingualism and language rights.  Three other provinces (Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan) have statutory provisions relating to bilingualism in the legal system, as do each of the three territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon).  Four provinces (British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island) are unilingual English.

Language rights in the legal system are summarized in the following table:

==Personal bilingualism in Canada==
{{main|Languages of Canada}}
[[Official bilingualism|'''Official''' bilingualism]] should not be confused with [[Multilingualism|'''personal''' bilingualism]], which is the capacity of a person to speak two languages. This distinction was articulated in the 1967 report of the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which stated:
{{cquote|A bilingual country is not one where all the inhabitants necessarily have to speak two languages; rather it is a country where the principal public and private institutions must provide services in two languages to the citizens, the vast majority of whom may well be unilingual."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, Book I (General Introduction), Ottawa: Queen's Printer, p. xxviii, at paragraph 29.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Nonetheless, the promotion of personal bilingualism in English and French is an important objective of official bilingualism in Canada.

At least 35% of [[Canadians]] speak more than one language. Moreover, fewer than 2% of Canadians cannot speak at least one of the two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, p. 6, line 108. In 2006, Canada’s population was 31,241,030. Of this, 520,385 Canadians, or 1.7%, did not speak either official language.&lt;/ref&gt; However, of these multilingual Canadians, somewhat less than one fifth of the population (5,448,850 persons, or 17.4% of the Canadian population) are able to maintain a conversation in both of the official languages according to a self-assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, pp. 2, 6. Statistics Canada collects data on mother tongue, on "first official language spoken", and on bilingualism in French and English. However, the agency does not collect data on bilingualism in non-official languages (either persons who speak more than one non-official language, or who have an official language as their mother tongue and afterwards learn a non-official language). Thus, it is possible only to determine that 6,147,840 Canadians have a non-official language as their mother tongue (see p. 2, line 5), and that 520,385 Canadians do not speak either official language (see p. 6, line 108). Since all persons who speak neither official language must have a non-official language as their mother tongue, simple subtraction shows that 5,627,455 Canadians, or 18.0% of the population, are bilingual in a non-official language plus an official language.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Canada the terms "bilingual" and "unilingual" are normally used to refer to bilingualism in English and French. In this sense, nearly 83% of Canadians are ''unilingual''.

Knowledge of the two official languages is largely determined by geography. Nearly 95% of Quebecers can speak French, but only 40.6% speak English. In the rest of the country, 97.6% of the population is capable of speaking English, but only 7.5% can speak French.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, pp. 6, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal bilingualism is most concentrated in southern Quebec and a swath of territory sometimes referred to as the ''[[bilingual belt]]'', which stretches east from Quebec through northern and eastern New Brunswick and west through [[Ottawa]] and that part of Ontario lying to the east of Ottawa, as well as north-eastern Ontario. There is also a large [[Franco-Manitobans|French-speaking population]] in Manitoba. In all, 55% of bilingual Canadians are Quebecers,&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, ''Population by knowledge of official language, by province or territory (2006 Census), http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo15-eng.htm. The 2006 census shows that 3017,860 Quebecers are bilingual, out of a total of 5,448,850 bilingual Canadians.&lt;/ref&gt; and a high percentage of the bilingual population in the rest of Canada resides in Ontario and New Brunswick. Statistics Canada collects much of its language data from self-assessments.

==Second-language education==
{{main|Bilingual education}}

Canada’s thirteen provincial and territorial education systems place a high priority on boosting the number of bilingual high school graduates. For example, in 2008 New Brunswick's provincial government reconfirmed its goal of boosting the percentage of bilingualism among graduates from its current rate of 34% to 70% rate by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See Jesse Robichaud, "Keep parents involved in language education: Lord," in the Moncton Times and Transcript, February 21, 2008, and Daniel McHardie, "Language battle: Education Minister will seek public input before responding to French Second Language Review," in New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal, February 28, 2008, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the federal government announced a ten-year plan of subsidies to provincial education ministries with the goal of boosting bilingualism among all Canadian graduates from its then-current level of 24% to 50% by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Privy Council Office, "The Next Act: New Momentum for Canada's Linguistic Duality—The Action Plan for Official Languages." Ottawa, 2003, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French second-language education (FSL)===
Three methods of providing French second-language education (known as "FSL") exist side-by-side in each of the provinces (including Quebec, where extensive French-language education opportunities are available for the province’s large population of non-Francophone children):
*'''Core French'''
*'''French Immersion'''
*'''Extended French'''
*'''Intensive French'''

====Core French====
Non-Francophone students learn French by taking courses on the French language as part of an education that is otherwise conducted in English. In Quebec and New Brunswick, French classes begin in Grade 1. In the other provinces, French classes typically start in Grade 4 or 5. Students normally receive about 600 hours of French-language classes by the time of graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpfnb.com/core_FAQ/CoreFAQ.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111142812/http://www.cpfnb.com/core_FAQ/CoreFAQ.html |date=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of “Core French” programs is not to produce fully bilingual graduates, but rather "to provide students with the ability to communicate adequately in the second language, and to provide students with linguistic tools to continue their second-language studies by building on a solid communicative base".&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick Department of Education, ''Policy Statement on Immersion and the Core Program''. Fredericton, 1983, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no mandatory core French class in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and second-language courses are  mandatory only in BC.

One result of this is that comprehension levels are often lower than parents would prefer. A scholar who interviewed a former New Brunswick premier, as well as the province's deputy ministers of education and health and the chairman of its Board of Management and Official Languages Branch reports: "[A]ll expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the Core program in promoting individual bilingualism and believed the program must be improved if anglophone students are to obtain a level of proficiency in the French language."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work? Attitudes Toward Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings into the Poirier-Bastarache Report''. Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====French immersion====
{{main|French immersion}}
Non-Francophone students with no previous French-language training learn French by being taught all subjects in the French language, rather than by taking courses on the French language as part of an education otherwise conducted in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpf.ca/English/FAQ/Immersion.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209024222/http://www.cpf.ca/English/FAQ/Immersion.pdf |date=December 9, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''early immersion'', students are placed in French-language classes starting in kindergarten or Grade 1.

In ''late immersion'', children are placed in French-language classes in a later grade. Currently, 7% of eligible students outside of Quebec are enrolled in French immersion programs.&lt;ref&gt;Official Languages: Annual Report 2007–2008, Volume 1, Official Language Support Programs". Canadian Heritage, cat. No. CH10-2008-1, 2008, pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extended French program====
Some schools in Ontario offer a third method of FSL education: the Extended French program. Students enter into this program as early as Grade 4—the starting grade is set by each region's school board—and may continue the program through to graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caslt.org/resources/french-sl/program-support-provincial-curriculum-ont_en.php |title=Ontario &amp;#124; Provincial Curriculum Guides &amp;#124; Program Support Materials (Teachers &amp; Administrators) &amp;#124; French as a Second Language &amp;#124; Resources for Teachers |publisher=Caslt.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program can also be entered when beginning [[secondary school]]; however, as there is a prerequisite number of previous instruction hours, usually only students previously enrolled in the Extended French or French Immersion programs can enter. In this program, at least 25% of all instruction must be in French. From Grades 4 through 8, this means that at least one course per year other than "French as a Second Language" must be taught solely in French. From Grades 9 through 12, along with taking the Extended French language course every year, students must complete their mandatory Grade 9 [[Geography]] and Grade 10 [[Canadian History]] credits in French. Students who complete these required courses and take one extra credit taught in French receive a [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] upon graduation in addition to their [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma|diploma]].

====Intensive French====
Intensive French is a method of FSL education that originated in Newfoundland. 
In 2004, Intensive French began in some schools in British Columbia. Intensive French is a choice program (in offering schools) during the grade 6 year. For the first five months of the school year students spend 80% of their time learning French, with the other 20% being for math. The rest of the core curriculum (Social Studies, Science, and Language Arts in English) is condensed for the second half of the year, comprising 80% of the time, with one hour for French. In the grade 7 year students continue to have one hour of core French per day. This results in 600 hours of French instruction over the two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmecarr.ca/IFinBC.html |title=Intensive French – A British Columbia Perspective |author=Wendy Carr |publisher=Mmecarr.ca |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English second-language education (ESL)===
New Brunswick, being an officially bilingual province, has both anglophone and francophone school districts.
 
* The francophone districts have '''Core English''' programs teaching ESL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0000/publications/mackay/appendixl.pdf |format=PDF |title=Current Status of the Education System in New Brunswick |date=January 30, 2005 |publisher=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Quebec's educations system provides ESL on a more restricted basis to the children of immigrants and to students who are members of the province's Francophone majority.
* '''Core English''': Most non-anglophone students are required to enrol in French-language schools. English is taught to all students, starting in Grade 1, in a program that is essentially identical to the "Core French" taught to English-speaking students in the other provinces.
* Most high schools offer advanced-level ESL programs where students complete the K–11 program in Secondary 3 (Grade 9) and follow with first-language level in Grade 10 and 11 (literature class).
* Programs of '''English immersion''' have existed for French-speaking students in Quebec but these programs are often in conflict with the official language policies of the Quebec government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030505103904/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/011603/news1.html|title=Montreal Mirror - The Front Page : Education|author=|date=5 May 2003|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational, linguistic, economic, and other challenges of official bilingualism==

===English and French orthography===
Page 5 of a Report of the OECD-CERI Learning Sciences and Brain Research titled ''Shallow vs. Non-shallow Orthographies and Learning to Read Workshop'', published in 2005, states:
‘A comparative study by Seymour ''et al''., undertaken in 2003 […], shows that after one year of instruction, English children show the lowest percentage of correct word reading on a scale in comparison to other European countries, with only 30-40% correct words compared to German, Greek and Finnish, with close to 100%.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/35562310.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The same report ranks French orthography among the more difficult European ones to learn too.

===Overall language rules===
Orthographic, grammatical, lexical, and other rules and exceptions to and redundancies in them determine a language’s ease of learning. On page 81 of ''L’enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique'', produced at the request of the ''Haut Conseil de l’Evaluation de l’École'' (in France) in 2005, François Grin quotes a study from the Department of Pedagogical Cybernetics of the University of Paderborn that reveals how a French-speaker can reach the same level after 150 hours of Esperanto as he can after more than 1,000 of Italian and 1,500 of English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/054000678.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional literacy in an official language===
According to the Conference Board of Canada, referencing functional literacy in an official language in 2011: ‘Forty-eight per cent of Canadian adults have inadequate literacy skills—a significant increase from a decade ago.’&lt;ref&gt;https://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/education/adlt-lowlit.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success rates in second-language instruction===

In ''Parlez-vous francais? The advantages of bilingualism in Canada'', published by the Canadian Council on Learning, page 6 states:

‘Although most Canadian school children are taught English or French as a second language in school, these lessons often fail to yield functional bilingualism. For example, New Brunswick’s French Second Language Commission recently reported that fewer than 1% of the students who enrolled in “core French” in 1994 had met the provincial minimum goal by 2007. And fewer than 10% of students who enrolled in early-French immersion in 1995 had attained the provincial goal by 2007.’

===Access to adequate teaching resources===
''The state of French-Language Education Programs in Canada: Report of the Standing Committee on Official Languages'', published in 2014, presents the following quote from the Peel District School Board’s Committee from 2011-2012:

‘The review committee found that although principals were finding it very difficult to hire teachers who are qualified to teach French immersion, qualifications alone were not enough to ensure a quality program.
‘The review committee heard repeatedly from different stakeholders regarding instances where a teacher had the requisite paper qualifications but was not fluent in French. Furthermore, the review committee heard that qualified and fluent teachers sometimes chose to leave the French immersion program to teach in the English program. The review committee heard that although it is very difficult for principals to find French immersion teachers for permanent contract teaching assignments, it is even more problematic for them to find FI teachers for long-term occasional assignments.’&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/parl/xc60-1/XC60-1-1-412-1-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''Section 4.6 of L’amélioration de l’enseignement de l’anglais, langue seconde, au primaire : un équilibre à trouver'', published by the Conseil supérieur de l’éducation (in Quebec) in 2014 reveals a struggle to recruit enough qualified second-language teachers for public schools in Quebec too.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cse.gouv.qc.ca/fichiers/documents/publications/Avis/50-0485.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependence on translation in the Government of Canada===

Jean Delisle stated in an article tilted ''Fifty Years of Parliamentary Interpretation'':

‘Interpretation is a good barometer of government activity. In the 1960s, a decade that interpreter Ronald Després called the “golden age of simultaneous interpretation,” it was not unusual for interpreters to put in 80-hour weeks. Marguerite Ouimet said that she spent more time in a booth than at home, as did many of her colleagues. From the mid-1970s onward, technician Jean-Pierre Dulude, whose outstanding skill was widely recognized in interpretation circles, supervised the installation of some 60 interpreters’ booths on Parliament Hill, and in federal departments and buildings across the country. He took great care to ensure that the booths met national standards.’&lt;ref&gt;http://revparl.ca/32/2/32n2_09e_Delisle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The article goes on to state:

‘The House cannot sit without interpreters and it has adjourned when the interpretation system experienced technical difficulties.’

A report of the Advisory Working Group on the Parliamentary Translation Services of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration revealed on 15 March 2018:

‘Many of the respondents cited inconsistency and quality control as major issues when it came to translation. The quality of the service varies greatly from one translator to another and there are often errors in the translations even when a request for a secondary review is made. Some respondents noted that the two language versions of committee reports often do not convey the same meaning and that, in some cases, the translation is simply erroneous. Much time is reportedly spent by senators and staff reviewing the documents in question and ensuring that the translation is accurate. Other respondents reported that longer documents that had been translated by more than one individual were disjointed and difficult to read because a common style had not been used. Recommendations ranged from the need to hire specialized translators to facilitate the translation of committee reports on technical matters, to ensuring proper revision of translations before their delivery, and to the need to provide for a feedback mechanism that could be used to alert the Translation Bureau when errors were detected.

‘Issues related to the quality of interpretation were also raised. Some senators reported hearing literal translations that did not convey the true meaning of what the speaker had said. Others noted that regional expressions were not properly interpreted. Many respondents asked if it would be possible to have the same interpreters covering the Chamber and specific committees as this would ensure continuity. The need to upgrade the Senate's technological equipment was raised as devices in some committee rooms did not work properly. Some committee clerks noted that a more modern way for clerks to provide material to the interpreters was needed. Such technological upgrades could make communication of information quicker and more efficient.’&lt;ref&gt;https://sencanada.ca/content/sen/committee/421/CIBA/Reports/CIBA_RPT27_TRANAWG_APX1_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary cost of official bilingualism===
In Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces: Costs and Benefits in 2006, published by the Fraser Institute in 2012, we read on page xii:

‘In our previous study, Official Language Policies at the Federal Level in Canada: Costs and Benefits in 2006, we estimated that the total cost of federal bilingualism at $1.8 billion. Since these expenditures include transfers to provinces that are spent by them on official language programs (Vaillancourt and Coche, 2009: 25, table 1), aggregating federal, provincial, and local spending must net out these transfers to avoid double counting. Once transfers are netted out, we have $1.5 billion at the federal level and $868 million at the local and provincial level for a total rounded of $2.4 billion or $85 per capita for 2006/07.’&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces-rev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of wealth between official and Deaf, indigenous, and other unofficial linguistic communities===

In ''Parlez-vous francais? The advantages of bilingualism in Canada'', published by the Canadian Council on Learning, page 4 states:

‘The bilingual advantage appears to extend to individual income. According to the 2001 Canadian census, people who speak both official languages had a median income ($24,974) that was nearly 10% higher than that of those who speak English only ($22,987) and 40% higher than that of those who speak French only ($17,659). Similar gaps remain after controlling for individual characteristics such as educational attainment and work experience.’&lt;ref name="docplayer.net"/&gt;

In an Article in the National Post of 10 November 2017, Member of Parliament Romeo Saganash stated in reference to requiring Supreme-Court judges to speak English and French:

“All Indigenous people in Canada speak one official language or the other, English or French,” Saganash argued. “To exclude that part of the population from the possibility of sitting on the Supreme Court has always seemed unacceptable to me.”&lt;ref name="nationalpost.com"&gt;https://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-indigenous-mp-opposes-fellow-new-democrats-on-official-bilingualism-for-supreme-court&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Murray Sinclair has opposed requiring Supreme Court judges to know both official languages too.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-courts-bilingual-requirement-unfair-sinclair-bellegarde/article32011596/&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic provisions of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act,&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38/&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]], and other laws obligate a greater demand for English and French speakers than a freer linguistic market would require. This, combined with English and French being more difficult to learn than some languages due to their orthographic (especially for the Deaf, dyslexics, and Deaf-dyslexics), grammatical, and lexical particularities, accentuates the wealth gap between official and Deaf, indigenous, and other unofficial language communities by limiting market supply and blocking equal access to Federal and federally-regulated employment ranging from the packaging and labelling industries all the way up to appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada for unofficial language communities. [[Perry Bellegarde]] and Romeo Sagansh have addressed this concern as it applies to indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/afn-asks-ottawa-to-declare-all-aboriginal-languages-official/article25378218/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalpost.com"/&gt;

===The perception of official bilingualism as an exclusively bi-ethnocentric policy===

The mandate of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism was to {{block quote|inquire into and report upon the existing state of bilingualism and biculturalism in Canada and to recommend what steps should be taken to develop the Canadian Confederation on the basis of an equal partnership between the two founding races, taking into account the contribution made by the other ethnic groups to the cultural enrichment of Canada and the measures that should be taken to safeguard that contribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/pco-bcp/commissions-ef/dunton1967-1970-ef/dunton1967-70-vol1-eng/dunton1967-70-vol-part2-eng.pdf, page 173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same report clarifies the status of Canada’s indigenous peoples relative to ‘the two founding races’ in its Book I, General Introduction, Paragraph 21:

{{block quote|We should point out here that the Commission will not examine the question of the Indians and the Eskimos. Our terms of reference contain no allusion to Canada's native populations. They speak of "two founding races," namely Canadians of British and French origin, and "other ethnic groups," but mention neither the Indians nor the Eskimos. Since it is obvious that these two groups do not form part of the "founding races," as the phrase is used in the terms of reference, it would logically be necessary to include them under the heading "other ethnic groups." Yet it is clear that the term "other ethnic groups" means those peoples of diverse origins who came to Canada during or after the founding of the Canadian state and that it does not include the first inhabitants of this country.&lt;ref name="publications.gc.ca"/&gt;}}

Chapter I, Paragraph 19 states:

{{block quote|Still, as we have pointed out earlier, there is such a thing as a French culture and a British culture. Of course, the differences between them are not as great as they would be if either were compared to one of the many Asian or African cultures. In Canada, the Anglophones and the Francophones wear the same sort of clothing, live in the same sort of houses, and use the same tools . They are very similar in their social behaviour, belong to religions which are not exclusive, and share the same general knowledge. To a greater or lesser extent, they share a North American way of living.&lt;ref name="publications.gc.ca"&gt;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1963-1-5-1-1-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Book II, Chapter V.E.1, Paragraph 325 indicates that the government's policy with reference to indigenous Canadians was ‘to integrate these students as completely as possible into the existing provincial school systems.’&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1963-1-5-2-1-eng.pdf, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioner J. B. Rudnyckyj wrote a separate statement challenging his colleagues’ proposals for an exclusively Anglo-French language policy. Esperanto Services, Ottawa; the Indian-Eskimo Association of Canada, Toronto; and other organizations representing different indigenous and other unofficial linguistic communities likewise presented briefs that presented alternative notions to that of 'two founding races.'&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1963-1-5-1-2-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unofficial use of an international auxiliary language between English and French Canadians==
English and French Canadians of the Pacific Northwest sometimes used [[Chinook Jargon]] (also known as Chinuk Wawa) to interact not only with the local indigenous, Chinese, and other populations but even with one another up until at least 1900 after which it began to decline as a result of the Spanish flu, World War I, and the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]]. Some English and French Canadians have turned to [[Esperanto]] since at least 1901 in Quebec when A. P. Beauchemin founded the Esperanto group La Lumo (published from 1902 to 1904 and read by 1710 readers).

Both Esperanto and Chinook Jargon (possibly fed in part by a combination of the low rate of success in official-second-language instruction in Canada's public schools, a growing belief in the need for [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|reconciliation]], the comparative ease of learning of these languages, the comparative grammatical precision of Esperanto conferring on it an advantage as a source language for translation and machine translation, the relative decline of English in an increasingly international world economy,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/english-set-to-decline-as-a-world-language-71197.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the advantages of direct communication in a standard language over translation and broken language) have experienced revivals since the 2000s leading to the publication of a self-instruction book for Chinuk Wawa in Esperanto in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8672371/learn-esperanto-language-duolingo-app-origin-history&lt;/ref&gt;

People have made use of the mobile application [[Amikumu]] to network with one another in Esperanto since 22 April 2017 and in other languages since the LangFest in Montreal on 25 August 2017. It has since spread to 130 countries speaking 525 languages.

==Proposed alternatives to official bilingualism based on the personality principle==

===Official bi-unilingualism based on the territoriality principle===
In Lament for a Notion, Scott Reid proposes maintaining the present official languages but deregulating them, limiting them mostly to the official sphere, and applying the territoriality principle except where numbers warrant it.&lt;ref&gt;Lament for a Notion, by Scott Reid, {{ISBN|0889782695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Quebec Premier Jean Charest had called on the Federal Government to apply the Charter of the French Language to all federally-regulated institutions operating in the province of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/charest-proposes-broadening-quebec-language-laws-1.1201421&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebec has tended to oppose calls on the part of French-speakers to broaden French-language rights outside of that province such as when it opposed the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon’s case at the supreme Court of Canada fearing that a victory for the French-language school board in the Yukon could have negatively affected the promotion of French in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;https://odl.openum.ca/le-quebec-et-la-francophonie-canadienne-une-position-contradictoire/#_ftnref2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official indigenous multilingualism based on the personality principle===
In an article written by Gloria Galloway and published in the Globe and Mail on 8 July 2015, Galloway writes about how the [[Assembly of First Nations]] wants to make all of Canada’s indigenous languages official. She writes:

‘The head of the Assembly of First Nations is calling for the nearly 60 indigenous languages spoken in Canada to be declared official along with English and French, an expensive proposition but one that he says is becoming more urgent as the mother tongues of aboriginal peoples disappear.
‘Perry Bellegarde, who was elected National Chief of the AFN last fall, agrees it would not be easy to require translations of all indigenous languages to be printed on the sides of cereal boxes and milk cartons.

‘"That would be the ultimate goal," Mr. Bellegarde said in an interview on Wednesday at the three-day annual general meeting of the AFN, Canada's largest indigenous organization. "But let's do small steps to get there."’&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt;
Romeo Saganash has expressed the belief that Members of Parliament have a constitutional right to speak any of Canada’s indigenous languages in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;http://aptnnews.ca/2018/03/20/committee-considers-indigenous-language-use-parliament-hill/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official indigenous multi-unilingualism based on the territoriality principle===
Given the logistic and economic challenges of official multilingualism based on the personality principle, some proponents of an equal right to the indigenous language have proposed a policy of official indigenous unilingualism based on the territoriality principle whereby a local or regional government would have an obligation to provide services only in the local indigenous languages but not in any other of Canada’s indigenous languages.

===Official multilingualism or multi-unilingualism including one or more official sign languages whether according to the personality or territoriality principle===
Some have proposed that Canada adopt ‘sign language’ as one of its official languages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-rally-sign-language-asl-lsq-1.4835096&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official interlingualism in the first language, the local indigenous language, and an international auxiliary language===

In Esperanto in the Modern World, compiled by Rüdiger and Vilma Sindona Eicholz in 1982, Vilma Sindona Eicholz writes in her essay A Fair Bilingualism for Canada, in the section subtitled Steps for a Better Canada, on pages 381-382:

‘For every child the same amount of money should be allotted for education. Parents should have the right to send their children to a school which teaches in the language of their choice. Education standards in all non-linguistic fields should be the same, but in all schools the first language, after the language of instruction, should be Esperanto. It should be taught for one year only on a daily basis. After this year, one subject, possibly geography, should be taught in Esperanto in order to keep the language skills alive.

‘In some areas there will probably not be enough children in certain languages to pay for teachers and schools. It should be up to the parents to choose the most suitable of many alternatives. Here are a few possibilities: A. Raising the necessary additional money among themselves and/or negotiating a lower salary for the teacher. B. Bussing the student to a school which teaches in the desired language. The parents would have to pay the additional expense. C. Boarding the students close to such a school. D. Putting children from a multitude of language backgrounds into one school, where the language of instruction in all subjects is Esperanto, except for lessons in the mother tongue, which would be taught separately for Croatians, Estonians, Vietnamese and Chileans for example. If there are enough students, subjects taught in the mother tongue could be enlarged. E. Let the children visit the school of another language group, but give them separate instruction in their mother tongue. F. Teach the students at home, possibly with help from cable TV or videorecorders.
‘The only groups which I believe need and deserve our special care with respect to language rights are the Indians and the Inuit, on whose former land we live. [...] If students want to continue formal education in trade schools, high schools or universities, they might have to switch over to Esperanto as the language of instruction, because they might have to join the natives or other Canadians speaking other languages. But never should a native be instructed in the language of another ethnic group.’&lt;ref&gt;Esperanto in the Modern World, compiled by Rüdiger and Vilma Sindona Eicholz in 1982, {{ISBN|0-919186-18-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a policy would conform to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Section 26 (3):
‘Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and opposition==

===Poll data===

Polls show that Canadians consistently and strongly support two key aspects of Canadian official languages policy: {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
*bilingual federal government services,
*the right of official-language minorities to receive an education in their maternal language.
However, among English-speaking Canadians there is only limited support for broadening the scope of official bilingualism, and reservations exist among Anglophones as to the intrusiveness and/or fairness of the policy. Among Francophones, polls have revealed no such reservations.

Among Anglophones, support for providing federal French-language services to French-speakers living outside Quebec has remained consistently high over a quarter-century period—79% in 1977 and 76% in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Parkin and Andre Turcotte, ''Bilingualism: Part of Our Past or Part of Our Future?''. CRIC Paper #13. Ottawa: Centre for Research and Information on Canada. March 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, support among English-speakers for the "right to French language education outside Quebec where numbers make costs reasonable" has ranged from 79% to 91%.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, p. 9. This is the wording used in the 2002 poll. In the 1977 poll, respondents were asked whether they supported "the provinces providing opportunities and facilities for education in French wherever practicable".&lt;/ref&gt; Among French-speaking Canadians, support for these policies was even higher.

The national consensus has, at times, broken down when other aspects of official bilingualism are examined. However, a significant shift in anglophone opinion has occurred since the mid-2000s, in favour of bilingualism.&lt;ref name="ocol-clo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/html/evolution_opinion_section_1_e.php |title=OCOL – 1. General Support for Bilingualism |publisher=Ocol-clo.gc.ca |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a review of three decades' worth of poll results published in 2004 by Andre Turcotte and Andrew Parkin, "Francophones in Quebec are almost unanimous in their support of the official languages policy" but "there is a much wider variation in opinion among Anglophones&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

This variation can be seen, for example, in responses to the question, "Are you, personally, in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?" Between 1988 and 2003, support for this statement among Francophones ranged between 79% and 91%, but among Anglophones support was never higher than 48%, and fell as low as 32% in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, p. 8. A parallel question, "Are you in favour of bilingualism for your province?" also received a much more favourable response from Francophone respondents (most of whom were located in Quebec) than from Anglophone respondents, indicating that Francophones were consistently more supportive than Anglophones of a fully bilingual Quebec within a fully bilingual Canada, whereas Anglophones were consistently more supportive than Francophones of a unilingual French Quebec within a Canada where the other provinces are for the most part unilingual English.&lt;/ref&gt; The ebb in support for bilingualism among anglophones can likely be attributed to political developments in the late 1980s and 1990s, including the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], and the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence.&lt;ref name="ocol-clo1"/&gt;

By 2006, affirmative responses to the question "Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?" had increased considerably, with 72% of Canadians (and 64% of anglophones) agreeing. 70% of Canadians, and 64% of anglophones were "in favour of bilingualism for [their] province".&lt;ref name="ocol-clo1"/&gt; Support for bilingualism is thought likely to continue to increase, as young anglophones are more favourable to it than their elders.&lt;ref name="ocol-clo1"/&gt;

According to Turcotte and Parkin, other poll data reveal that "in contrast to Francophones, Anglophones, in general, have resisted putting more government effort and resources into promoting bilingualism&amp;nbsp;... What is revealing, however, is that only 11% of those outside Quebec said they disagreed with bilingualism in any form. Opposition seems to be directed to the actions of the federal government, rather than to bilingualism itself&amp;nbsp;... [T]his distinction is key to understanding public opinion on the issue."&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, p. 10. The specific reference is to a 1977 poll in which 54% of non-Quebecers but only 34% of Quebecers identified with the statement, "I generally agree with or support the principle of bilingualism but I disagree with the form bilingualism has taken under the present federal government."&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to explain results that would otherwise seem contradictory, such as a 1994 poll in which 56% of Canadians outside Quebec indicated that they either strongly or moderately supported official bilingualism, but 50% agreed with a statement that "the current official bilingualism policy should be scrapped because it's expensive and inefficient."&lt;ref&gt;Angus Reid Group, "The National Angus Reid/Southam News Poll: Canadians' Views on Official Bilingualism". Release date: April 29, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In English Canada, there is some regional variation in attitudes towards federal bilingualism policy, but it is relatively modest when compared to the divergence between the views expressed by Quebecers and those expressed in the rest of the country. For example, in a poll conducted in 2000, only 22% of Quebecers agreed with the statement, “We have gone too far in pushing bilingualism,” while positive response rates in English Canada ranged from a low of 50% in the Atlantic to a high of 65% in the Prairies.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians tend to regard the capacity to speak the other official language as having cultural and economic value,&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; and both groups have indicated that they regard bilingualism as an integral element of the Canadian national identity. Once again, however, there is a marked divergence between the responses of French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians. In a 2003 poll, 75% of Francophones indicated that "having two official languages, English and French" made them proud to be Canadian. Among English-speakers, 55% said that bilingualism made them proud, but far higher percentages (86% and 94%, respectively) indicated that multiculturalism and the Charter of Rights made them feel proud.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin and Turcotte, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings of Public Hearings===

From time to time, boards or panels are commissioned, either by the federal government or the government of one of the provinces, to conduct hearings into the public’s views on matters of policy. Some of these hearings have dealt largely, or even primarily, with official languages policy, and the responses that they have collected provide snapshots into the state of public opinion at particular points in time.

====Findings of the public hearings into the Poirier-Bastarache Report (1985)====

The ''Advisory Committee on the Official Languages of New Brunswick'' was commissioned by the provincial legislature as a way of determining the response of the population to the 1982 Poirier-Bastarache Report, which had recommended a considerable expansion of French-language services.&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick. Official Languages Branch (Bernard Poirier and Michel Bastarache). ''Towards Equality of Official Languages in New Brunswick.'' 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Public hearings were conducted in twelve cities and towns across the province in 1985, and a report was submitted by the committee in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick (Irene Grant-Guerette and Lloyd B. Smith). Report of the Advisory Committee on Official Languages of New Brunswick. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The briefs submitted to the Advisory Committee were subsequently summarized in an academic study of the hearings in the following terms:

{{cquote|Qualitative analysis illustrate[s] that, as the majority, anglophones are reticent about extending opportunities and services to the francophone minority for fear of placing themselves at a disadvantage, whether it be in the education system or civil service employment. Francophones, as the minority, resent the anglophone hesitancy to make available rights and privileges secured under the Official Languages Act of New Brunswick of 1969 and the Constitution Act (1982)&amp;nbsp;... They favour their own schools, control over their education, increased access to civil service positions and services in their own language through separate institutions and administrations.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work? Attitudes Towards Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings on the Poirier-Bastarache Report''. Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Findings of the Spicer Commission (1990)====

In late 1990, a six-man ''Citizens’ Forum on Canada’s Future'' was established by the federal government with a mandate to engage in "a dialogue and discussion with and among Canadians&amp;nbsp;... to discuss the values and characteristics fundamental to the well-being of Canada". The Forum, which was headed by former Commissioner of Official Languages Keith Spicer, published a report in June 1991, which included a detailed discussion of Canadians’ reactions to a variety of issues, including federal official languages policy.

These comments, which probably represent the most extensive consultation ever with Canadians on the subject of official bilingualism, were compiled statistically by the Spicer Commission, and tend to reinforce the findings of pollsters, that Canadians are favourable towards bilingual services, but frustrated with the implementation of official languages policy. Thus, for example, nearly 80% of group discussions sponsored by the Commission produced favourable comments from participants on what the Commission's report refers to as "bilingualism generally", but nearly 80% of these discussions produced negative comments on "official languages policy".&lt;ref&gt;Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, Report to the People and Government of Canada. Ottawa: Minister of Supply and Services, 1991, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

These results prompted Spicer to write,

{{cquote|Canada's use of two official languages is widely seen as a fundamental and distinctive Canadian characteristic. Among many, especially the young, the ability to speak, read and write both French and English is accepted as a significant personal advantage. Even many parents who dislike "official bilingualism" are eager to enrol their children in French immersion.

On the other hand, we find that the application of the official languages policy is a major irritant outside Quebec, and not much appreciated inside Quebec&amp;nbsp;... In spite of real and needed progress in linguistic fair play in federal institutions, a sometimes mechanical, overzealous, and unreasonably costly approach to the policy has led to decisions to that have helped bring it into disrepute. Citizens tell us that bilingual bonuses, costly translation of technical manuals of very limited use, public servants' low use of hard-acquired French-language training, excessive designation of bilingual jobs, and a sometimes narrow, legalistic approach are sapping a principle they would otherwise welcome as part of Canada's basic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, Report, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Advocacy groups===

;Advocacy in support of expanding / extending official bilingualism exclusively of other language communities
A number of groups exist, which, as part of their mandate, seek to promote official bilingualism or to extend the scope of the policy (although advocacy is not always the sole, or even the primary activity, of the groups). Among these groups:
*'''[[Alliance Quebec]]''' (defunct)
* '''L'Association des municipalités francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick '''
* '''Canadian Parents for French''', established with the assistance of the Commissioner of Official Languages in 1977, promotes French second-language education for children whose mother tongue is English;
*'''Commission nationale des parents francophones'''
*'''Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada''' serves as an umbrella for 22 groups representing French-speaking minorities in different provinces and territories;
*'''Fédération des jeunes francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick'''
*'''Fédération nationale des conseils scolaires francophones'''
*'''[[Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario]]''' seeks to oversee the maintenance and development of municipal government services in French, in Ontario municipalities with French-speaking populations.
*'''Impératif français''' seeks to promote the use of French within Quebec, and to challenge inequalities between the languages that may arise within areas of federal administration.
*'''Quebec Community Groups Network''' serves as an umbrella for 38 English language community organizations across Quebec for the purposes of supporting and assisting the development and enhancing the vitality of the English-speaking minority communities;
* '''Société des Acadiens et Acadiennes du Nouveau-Brunswick'''

;Advocacy in favour of restraining or abolishing official bilingualism
A number of groups have existed, since the first ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' was proclaimed in 1969, which sought to end official bilingualism or to reduce the scope of the policy. Among these groups:
*'''The [[Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada]]''' (often referred to as "APEC"). In 2000, the group was renamed '''Canadians Against Bilingualism Injustice'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''Canada Gazette''|date=2000-02-26|title=Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada: Change of name and relocation of head office|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2000/2000-02-26/html/misc-divers-eng.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204145821/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2000/2000-02-26/html/misc-divers-eng.html|archivedate=2012-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the organization changed its name again, becoming the '''Canadian Network for Language Awareness'''.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''Canada Gazette'' Part I, p. 3872|date=2001-10-06|title=Supplementary letters patent (name change)|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-10-06/pdf/g1-13540.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321014222/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-10-06/pdf/g1-13540.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Canadians for Language Fairness]]''';
*'''The [[New Brunswick Association of English-speaking Canadians]]''' was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1986. Its primary purpose was to oppose the proposals of the province's "Poirier-Bastarache Committee" for an expansion of the province's policy of official bilingualism.

In the first decade or so following the 1969 adoption of the Act, opposition to the new policy sometimes took a radical form that has subsequently nearly disappeared. Books such as Jock V. Andrew's ''[[Bilingual Today, French Tomorrow]]'', advocated either the repeal of the ''Official Languages Act'' or an end to the policy of official bilingualism. [[Leonard Jones]], the mayor of [[Moncton]], New Brunswick, was an aggressive opponent of bilingualism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Jones challenged the validity of the ''Official Languages Act'' in court, arguing that the subject matter was outside the jurisdiction of the federal government. In 1974, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled against Jones, and [[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick|found the law constitutional]]. In 1991, a local resurgence in anti-bilingualism sentiments allowed the [[New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party|Confederation of Regions Party]] to win 21.2% of the vote in New Brunswick's provincial election and to briefly form the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|official opposition]] with eight seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|provincial legislature]].

Some organizations or individuals within certain movements also propose introducing a more inclusive language policy either via official multilingualism, or an official unilingual language policy in an auxiliary language so as to intrude minimally into the first-language choice of residents. Such ideas are sometimes inspired by Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to discrimination on the basis of language, and Article 26(3) of the same Declaration so as to give parents the freedom “to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.” Others can be inspired by religious or other beliefs.

'''Assembly of First Nations''': National First Nations Language Strategy, presented by the Assembly of First Nations on 5 July 2007, inspired by previous statements including the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples presented in 1996, rejects official bilingualism in favour of linguistic equality for speakers of indigenous languages:

“First Nations seek legislated protection via a First Nations Languages Act that would be consistent with First Nations and Government of Canada laws dealing with languages.”

===Positions of the federal political parties===

====Language issues currently dividing the parties====
The issues on which Canada’s political parties have most recently shown divergent voting patterns are two [[private members’ bills]].

The first, ''An Act to amend the Official Languages Act (Charter of the French Language)'' (Bill C-482), was introduced by Bloc MP [[Pauline Picard]]. If adopted, it would have had the effect of amending the ''Official Languages Act'', the ''Canada Labour Code'', and the ''Canada Business Corporations Act'', to cause them to conform to the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'', “effectively making the federal government French-only in the province,” according to ''[[Maclean’s]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Patriquin, “Are you still here?” ''Maclean’s'', February 25, 2008, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was defeated on May 2008, with Bloc and NDP MPs voting in favour and Conservative and Liberal MPs opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2&amp;DocId=3499224#T1755 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 095 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second private member’s bill is NDP MP [[Yvon Godin|Yvon Godin’s]] ''Act to amend the Supreme Court Act (understanding the official languages)'' (Bill C-232). If adopted, this bill will have the effect of blocking any candidate who is not already sufficiently bilingual to understand oral arguments in both official languages from being appointed to the Supreme Court. This bill was passed at third reading on March 31, with all NDP, Liberal and Bloc members in support and all Conservative MPs opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=3&amp;DocId=4402489&amp;File=0#Div-20 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 021 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not pass the Senate.

====Conservative Party of Canada and its predecessors====
The [[Conservative Party of Canada]] was created in 2003 by the merger of the old [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] and the Canadian Alliance. The new party adopted the principles of the old Progressive Conservatives as its founding principles, with only a handful of changes. One of these was the addition of the following founding principle, which is lifted almost verbatim from Section 16(1) of the ''Charter of Rights'':

"A belief that English and French have equality of status, and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada."

At its founding convention in 2005, the new party added the following policy to its ''Policy Declaration'' (the official compilation of the policies that it had adopted at the convention):

: "The Conservative Party believes that Canada’s official languages constitute a unique and significant social and economic advantage that benefit all Canadians.

: "i) A Conservative Government will support the Official Languages Act ensuring that English and French have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada.

: "ii) The Conservative Party will work with the provinces and territories to enhance opportunities for Canadians to learn both official languages."&lt;ref&gt;''Conservative Party of Canada Policy Declaration'', March 2005, p. 32 (Policy #91).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, in the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Reform Party of Canada]] had advocated the policy's repeal. However, the party's position moderated with time. By 1999, the ''Blue Book'' (the party's declaration of its then-current policies) stated that "The Reform Party supports official bilingualism in key federal institutions, such as Parliament and the Supreme Court, and in critical federal services in parts of the country where need is sufficient to warrant services on a cost-effective basis."&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Blue Book': Principles and Policy of the Reform Party of Canada – 1999'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, the policy declaration of the Reform Party's political successor, the [[Canadian Alliance]], had been moderated further, and stated that it was "the federal government's responsibility to uphold minority rights" by providing services in both languages in any "rural township or city neighbourhood where at least ten percent of the local population uses either English or French in its daily life".&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Alliance Declaration of Policy'', April 2002, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal Party of Canada====
The [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] sees itself as the party of official bilingualism, as it was a Liberal prime minister, [[Pierre Trudeau]], who enacted the first ''Official Languages Act'' in 1969 and who entrenched detailed protections for the two official languages in the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' in 1982.

The depth of the party’s commitment to official bilingualism is demonstrated by the fact that the constitution of the Liberal Party contains provisions modelled almost word-for-word on [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16(1)]] of the ''Charter of Rights'': "English and French are the official languages of the Party and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all federal institutions of the Party. In pursuing its fundamental purposes and in all its activities, the Party must preserve and promote the status, rights and privileges of English and French."&lt;ref&gt;Liberal Party of Canada, “Constitution”, as adopted and amended at the biennial convention, November 30 – December 1, 2006, Section 2(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Democratic Party====
[[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrat]] MPs voted in favour of the 1969 ''Official Languages Act'', the 1988 ''Official Languages Act'', and the protections for the two official languages contained in the ''Charter of Rights''. More recently, the party has edged towards supporting an asymmetrical version of bilingualism. Early in 2008, the party’s languages critic, [[Yvon Godin]], stated that its MPs would vote in favour of a bill, sponsored by the Bloc Québécois, which would cause federal institutions to operate on a French-preferred or French-only basis in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Yvon Godin, “Commons Debates” (Hansard), February 6, 2008, p. 2691.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, NDP MP Romeo Saganash spoke forcefully against making Anglo-French bilingualism a requirement for Supreme-Court judges in addition to criticizing official bilingualism generally due to the linguistic barriers it imposes on indigenous candidates.&lt;ref name="nationalpost.com"/&gt;

====Bloc Québécois====
Although the main objective of the [[Bloc Québécois]] is to assist in the secession of Quebec, the party’s parliamentary caucus has maintained an active interest in issues relating to official languages policy (for example, sending MPs to participate in the standing Commons committee on official languages). The party seeks to alter federal language policy, as it applies within Quebec, so as to eliminate the statutory equality of English that is guaranteed under the ''Official Languages Act'' and other federal legislation. In recent years, this has included introducing a private member's bill titled ''An Act to amend the Official Languages Act (Charter of the French Language)'' (better known as Bill C-482), intended to supersede the ''Official Languages Act'' with the ''Charter of the French Language'' for all federally regulated corporations within Quebec.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">'''Rebecca Wright''' (5 December 1945, [[Springfield, Ohio]] – 29 January 2006, [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]]) was an [[United States|American]] ballerina, teacher, choreographer and ballet school director.

==Biography==
Her background in gymnastics and tap dance was a pivotal influence in early dance training under Josephine Schwarz at the [[Dayton Ballet]]. In 1966 she joined the then prominent but small [[Joffrey Ballet]] as a principal until 1975, becoming a soloist with [[American Ballet Theatre]] (ABT) until her retirement from dance in 1982. She can be seen on television and on [[DVD]] as The Doll in [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]'s production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', which was first telecast in 1977.

After her retirement she married fellow dancer [[George de la Peña]] (who also appears in the Baryshnikov ''Nutcracker'') and turned to teaching and choreographing before becoming director of the Washington School of Ballet in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonballet.org/school/index.htm The Washington Ballet.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

De la Peña and Wright had two children before they separated.

She held a dance professorship at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] and was director of dance programs at [[Adelphi University]] in [[Garden City, NY]]. She also spent several years as director of dance programs at the private St. Paul's School in Concord, NH.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bernstein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/30/AR2006013001636.html "Dancer, Teacher Rebecca Wright; Led Washington School of Ballet"], ''The Washington Post'', January 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 she succeeded Mary Day, the legendary founder of the Washington School of Ballet and [[Washington Ballet]], who had run the school for 60 years. Under Wright's leadership school enrollment grew from 350 to 450 students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Kaufman (critic)|Sarah Kaufman]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/30/AR2006013001629.html "Troubled Washington Ballet Is Further Shaken by Death Of Its School's Director"], ''The Washington Post'', January 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in 2006 at her home in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]], of [[cancer]].

In [[education]], '''response to intervention'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtinetwork.org/learn/what/whatisrti|title=What is Response to Intervention (RTI)? {{!}} RTI Action Network|last=Gorski|first=Deb|website=www.rtinetwork.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly abbreviated '''RTI''' or '''RtI''') is an approach to academic intervention used in the United States to provide early, systematic, and appropriately intensive assistance to children who are at risk for or already underperforming as compared to appropriate grade- or age-level standards. RTI seeks to promote academic success  through universal screening, early intervention, frequent progress monitoring, and increasingly intensive research-based instruction or interventions for children who continue to have difficulty. RTI is a multileveled approach for aiding students that is adjusted and modified as needed if they are failing.

In terms of identifying students with [[learning disability|specific learning disabilities]] (SLD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.specialeducationguide.com/disability-profiles/specific-learning-disabilities/|title=A Guide to Specific Learning Disabilities {{!}} Special Education Guide|work=Special Education Guide|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, RTI was proposed as an alternative to the ability–achievement discrepancy model, which requires children to exhibit a significant discrepancy between their ability (often measured by [[Intelligence quotient|IQ testing]]) and academic achievement (as measured by their grades and standardized testing). Methods to identify students with SLD have been controversial for decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ysseldyke, J., Thurlow, M., Graden, J., Wesson, C., Algozzine, B., &amp; Deno, S. L.|year=1983|title=Generalizations from five years of research on assessment and decision-making:  The University of Minnesota Institute|journal=Exceptional Education Quarterly|volume=4|pages=75–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proponents of RTI claim that the process brings more clarity to the Specific Learning Disability (SLD) category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act]] (IDEA 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/|title=Individuals with Disabilities Education Act {{!}} IDEA|website=sites.ed.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while opponents claim that RTI simply identifies low achieving students rather than students with learning disabilities.

==Description==
RTI is originally a special education term that has broadened into general education framework that involves research-based instruction and interventions, regular monitoring of student progress, and the subsequent use of these data over time to make a variety of educational decisions, including, but not limited to SLD eligibility.&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/handouts/revisedPDFs/rtiprimer.pdf|title=Response to Intervention (RTI): A Primer for Parents|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this broadened conception of RTI, a shift to labeling this as one of the approaches of a Multi-Tier System of Supports (MTSS) occurring in schools and the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gresham, F., Reschly, D., &amp; Shinn, M. R.|year=2010|chapter=RTI as a driving force in educational improvement: Historical legal, research, and practice perspectives|editors=M. R. Shinn &amp; H. M. Walker |title=Interventions for academic achievement problems in a three-tier model, including RTI|pages=47–77|location=Bethesda, MD|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key to the RTI process is the application of scientifically based interventions that have been demonstrated to work in [[randomized controlled trial]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025811/|title=Randomized Control Trial - National Library of Medicine|last=pmhdev|website=PubMed Health|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A goal of the RTI process is to apply accountability to educational program by focusing on programs that work rather than programs that simply look, sound, or feel good.

RTI follows a number of core assumptions:&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt; 
#The educational system can effectively teach all children
#Early intervention is critical to preventing problems from getting out of control
#The implementation of a multi-tiered service delivery model is necessary
#A problem solving model should be used to make decisions between tiers
#Research based interventions should be implemented to the extent possible
#Progress monitoring must be implemented to inform instruction
#Data should drive decision making

A learning disability is defined as a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store, and respond to information. They are a group of disorders that can impact many areas of learning, including reading, writing, spelling, math, listening, and oral expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language|title=Language &amp; Math|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626065701/http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language|archivedate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of identifying learning disabilities, RTI differs from the formerly standard "ability–achievement discrepancy" approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/evaluations/evaluation-basics/the-discrepancy-model-what-you-need-to-know|title=The Discrepancy Model: What You Need to Know|work=Understood.org|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that decisions are based on outcomes of targeted interventions rather than mathematical discrepancies between scores achieved on standardized assessments.

In the RTI process, service delivery is typically divided into three levels (tiers) of support, with the intensity of interventions increasing with each level.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gresham, F.M.|year=2004|title=Current status and future directions of school-based behavioral interventions|journal=School Psychology Review|volume=33|issue=3|pages=326–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Tier 1''' is focused specifically within the core curriculum, with instruction and interventions targeting all students. Approximately 80% to 85% of the general student body should be able to meet grade level norms without additional assistance beyond the first tier. Students who consistently do not perform within the expected level of performance through Tier 1 instruction are then provided with additional supplementary interventions at '''Tier 2''', which typically involves small group instruction. Approximately 3% to 6% of students will continue to have difficulties after Tier 2 interventions; these students will then receive '''Tier 3''' intervention services, which is the most intense level of intervention (often one-on-one) provided in the regular education environment. As RTI is a regular education initiative, all three tiers of services are intended to be provided as supplements to, not replacements for, the regular education curriculum; there are some, however, who view Tier 3 as [[special education]].&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale (2006) first presented a model that included Standard Protocol Model RTI at Tier 1, Problem-Solving Model RTI at Tier 2, and individualized special education at tier 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===School-wide screening===
The first level of data collected in the RTI process comes from universal school-wide screenings. These screening assessments are typically given to all students within targeted grade levels, and cover basic academic subjects such as reading and mathematics. Most screening measures aim to be practical and efficient to administer, with the goal of identifying students who may require further assessments and interventions.

To evaluate student performance on the screening measures, scores are compared to specific criteria (''criterion referenced'') or to broad norms (''norm referenced''). When specific criteria are used, ''cut scores'' are established to evaluate students against a specific level of proficiency (e.g., achieving a score of 15 or above); in a normative comparison, students' scores are compared against those of a larger group (e.g., scoring above the 25th percentile compared to a national sample of 3rd grade students).

Screenings usually occur three times per year (fall, winter, and spring), and the data from these assessments help to guide instruction through the three tiers of the RTI process. This is important not only for identifying students who are having difficulties, but also for identifying possible areas of improvement in the general classroom instruction in the cases where too many students fall below expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Jenkins, J.R. |date=December 2003|title=Candidate measures for screening at-risk students|conference=NRCLD Responsiveness-to-Intervention Symposium|location=Kansas City, MO|accessdate=April 3, 2006|url=http://www.nrcld.org/symposium2003/jenkins/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because a single universal screening at the beginning of the year can over-identify students who require preventative intervention, the National Research Center on Learning Disabilities recommends that schools also integrate at least five weeks of weekly progress monitoring to identify students who require preventative intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/resources_new/9749|title=National Research Center on Learning Disabilities {{!}} LD OnLine|website=www.ldonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Teaching ===
Core curriculum in the classroom should be research-based and field tested. This means, based on evidence from congregating research, that the core curriculum contains all the fundamentals found necessary to efficiently teach reading and has a recognized record of achievement. Such curriculum is to be delivered by "highly qualified" teachers adequately trained to deliver the selected instruction as intended, that is, with fidelity to design.

===Progress monitoring and tiered service delivery===
Progress monitoring is a set of assessment procedures for determining the extent to which students are benefiting from classroom instruction and for monitoring effectiveness of curriculum.

[[Curriculum-based measurement]] (CBM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deno, S. L.|year=1985|title=Curriculum-based measurement: The emerging alternative|journal=Exceptional Children|volume=52|issue=3|pages=219–232|pmid=2934262}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often used to collect [[data]] on interventions and their effectiveness to determine what works best for an individual student. Additional methods are attempted until students "respond" to the intervention and improve their skills. Students that do not respond, or respond at significantly low rates, may be deemed to have biologically based learning disabilities, rather than simply learning difficulties.

Progress monitoring is the scientifically based practice of assessing students' academic performance on a regular basis for three purposes: 
#To determine whether children are profiting appropriately from the instructional program, including the curriculum
#To build more effective programs for the children who do not benefit
#To estimate rates of student improvement

Three tiers of Scientifically Research-Based Interventions (SRBIs) of increasing intensity incorporate the key components of RTI and help ensure the academic growth and achievement of students.

====Tier 1====
The first tier states that all students receive core classroom instruction that is [[differentiated instruction|differentiated]] and utilizes strategies and materials that are scientifically research-based. Assessment in the classroom should be ongoing and effective in that it clearly identifies the strengths and weaknesses for each learner. Any necessary interventions at this level are within the framework of the general education classroom and can be in the form of differentiated instruction, small group review, or one-on-one remediation of a concept.

Progress monitoring in Tier 1 uses universal screening assessments to show individual student growth over time and to determine whether students are progressing as expected. In this process, data are collected, students are identified using benchmark scores, and measurable goals are set for the next data collection point for those who display difficulties. The team then follows a problem-solving process to determine interventions for at-risk students that will work within whole-class instructions. The classroom teacher implements the interventions, observations are conducted to ensure the fidelity of the classroom instruction, and the problem-solving team periodically reviews the progress of students.

====Tier 2====
In the second tier, supplemental interventions may occur within or outside of the general education classroom, and progress monitoring occurs at more frequent intervals. Core instruction is still delivered by the classroom teacher, but small groups of similar instructional levels may work together under a teacher's instruction and/or guidance. This type of targeted instruction is typically for 30 minutes per day, two to four days per week, for a minimum of nine weeks. This targeted instruction may occur in the general education setting or outside in a smaller group setting with a specialized teacher (such as a Literacy Support teacher for struggling readers).

In Tier 2, the main purpose of progress monitoring is to determine whether interventions are successful in helping students learn at an appropriate rate. Decision rules are created to determine when a student might no longer require extra interventions, when the interventions need to be changed, or when a student might be identified for special education.

Oral language abilities at the onset of reading intervention programs are an excellent predictor of final outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lovett 2008 333–352"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=M. W.|last2=De Palma |first2=M. |last3=Frijters |first3=J. |last4=Steinbach |first4=K. |last5=Temple |first5=M. |last6=Benson |first6=N. |last7=Lacerenza |first7=L.|title=Interventions for reading difficulties: A comparison of response to intervention by ELL and EFL struggling readers.|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|year=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=333–352|doi=10.1177/0022219408317859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both English as a first language and English-language learners demonstrate that the greater the oral language impairment, the greater the associated growth from RTI.&lt;ref name="Lovett 2008 333–352"/&gt; Phonics-based RTI programs are most effective prior to grade 1, however, after grade 1 comprehension and mixed RTI programs are associated with greater effect sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suggate|first=S. P.|title=Why what we teach depends on when: Grade and reading intervention modality moderate effect size.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2010|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1556–1579|doi=10.1037/a0020612|pmid=20873927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tier 3====
Tier three is for students who require more intense, explicit and individualized instruction and have not shown sufficient response to Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions. This type of targeted instruction is delivered for a minimum of two 30-minute sessions every week for nine to twelve weeks. The interventions in this tier may be similar to those in Tier 2 except that they are intensified in focus, frequency, and duration. The instruction in Tier 3 is typically delivered outside of the general education classroom. Programs, strategies, and procedures are designed and employed to supplement, enhance, and support Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction by remediation of the relevant area and development of compensatory strategies. If Tier 3 is not successful, a child is considered for the first time as potentially having a learning disability.

In some cases, Tier 3 is considered to be [[special education]], with instruction being provided to individual students or small groups by special education teachers ''in place of'' general education instruction (rather than as a supplement). Initial goals are established through an [[individualized education program]] (IEP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/iep-overview/|title=The Short-and-Sweet IEP Overview {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is guided by the results of a comprehensive evaluation, and ongoing progress monitoring helps to direct the teaching process. Special education instruction likely will be considerably longer than the 10 to 12 weeks of supplemental instruction delivered in Tier 2 and beyond. The frequency of special education instruction depends upon student need, and the criteria to exit special education are specified and monitored so that placement can be flexible.

===RTI implementation===
The number of schools implementing RTI continues to grow and 61% of schools surveyed in 2010 indicated that they had fully implemented or were in the process of implementing RTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council of Administrators of Special Education|last2=National Association of State Directors of Special Education|last3=American Association of School Administrators|title=Response to Intervention Adoption Survey|date=2010|publisher=Spectrum K-12 School Solutions|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most schools in the survey indicated that the continued to focus on reading interventions at the elementary school. RTI is primarily implemented by grade-level teams or professional learning communities as part of a school-wide problem-solving plan, and previous research found that implementing RTI resulted in several positive outcomes such as reductions in students referred to and placed into special education, more students passing state accountability tests, and increased academic skills among students at-risk for reading failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Matthew|last2=Appleton|first2=James|last3=Stehouwer|first3=Jonathon|title=Meta-analysis of response-to-intervention research: Examining field-based and research-implemented models.|journal=Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment|date=2005|volume=23|pages=381–394|doi=10.1177/073428290502300406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fidelity of implementation===
In an RTI model, fidelity is important at both the school level (e.g., implementation of the process) and the teacher level (e.g., implementation of instruction). Although the concept of fidelity of implementation is supported by research and is generally viewed as common sense, there are practical challenges associated with achieving high levels of fidelity.
Factors that can reduce fidelity when implementing instruction include:&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E., Mellard, D.F., Fuchs, D., &amp; McKnight, M.A. (2006). Responsiveness to intervention (RTI): How to do it. Lawrence, KS: National Research Center on Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Complexity of the interventions and the time required to implement them
*Inaccessibility of required materials and resources
*Low perceptions/expectations of effectiveness (teachers may not fully commit to an intervention if they believe that it will not be effective, or if it is inconsistent with their teaching style)
*Low numbers, expertise, and motivation of those who deliver the interventions
Factors that can increase fidelity when implementing an RTI model include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Matthew|last2=Gibbons|first2=Kimberly|title=Implementing response to intervention in elementary and secondary schools: Procedures to assure scientific-based practices|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well-functioning professional learning communities
*Using a universal screener that is brief, aligned with the curriculum, result in reliable data, and is validated for screening decisions
*Using a data-management system that is easily accessible by classroom teachers
*Implementing interventions that address the skill deficit of students
*Identifying and addressing class-wide needs
*Establishing well-defined decision rules
*Clear leadership from the building principal
*Ongoing training and professional development
*Key stakeholders working together in a flexible manner to improve student learning
*Use of standard-protocol interventions for tier 2
*Not making entitlement (i.e., special education disability identification) decisions until the RTI system is in place and well established.

==Classification of RTI==
RTI is a general education process that is used in schools to ensure students receive the supports they need to be successful and excel in school.  In the educational literature, RTI is often referred to as a ''Standard Protocol Approach'',  as a ''Problem Solving Model.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., Mock, D., Morgan, P. L., &amp; Young, C. L.|year=2003|title=Responsiveness-to-Intervention: Definitions, evidence, and implications for the learning disabilities construct|journal=Learning Disabilities Research and Practice|volume=18|issue=3|pages=157–171|url=http://danlane.wiki.westga.edu/file/view/Fuchs+(Responsiveness+to+intervention...).pdf|doi=10.1111/1540-5826.00072}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a hybrid of the two. However, some have challenged a dichotomous view of RTI because both models incorporate problem solving to identify the academic or social-emotional difficulty the student is having and both use a systematic, universal screening procedure during Tier 1 to determine which students are having difficulties meeting age or grade level benchmarks for a specific skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christ|first1=Theodore|last2=Burns|first2=Matthew|last3=Ysseldyke|first3=James|title=Conceptual confusion within response-to-intervention vernacular: Clarifying meaningful differences.|journal=NASP Communique|date=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1, 6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, [[Curriculum Based Measurement]] (CBM) or other predictive data are used to flag the students who are not meeting expected levels of performance. In the problem-solving model approach, the teacher typically refers the student to a problem-solving team to ascertain the challenges a student is having within the classroom. Using information collected from the classroom teacher and others, observations, etc., the team determines what additional supports the student might need to address the learning gap. Standard-protocol approaches tend to rely more on grade-level teams and professional learning communities to make intervention decisions, but both approaches use a problem-solving procedure to make decisions, which makes the distinction somewhat meaningless. Many schools rely on grade-level teams to make intervention decision and use a standardized intervention for tier 2, but then rely on a problem-solving team to develop individualized interventions for tier 3.

When a student is identified as having difficulties in school, a team provides interventions of increasing intensity to help the child catch up with the rest of his or her peers. When students continue to struggle, even when appropriate evidence-based practices have been delivered with fidelity, students may be referred for a special education evaluation.  Parents can request a special education evaluation at any time in this process, however.   While the RTI process can be a way to ensure that each student is afforded the opportunity to learn, some opponents feel that it allows school districts to avoid or delay identifying students who need special education services. Proponents would point out that RTI is not the process of identifying students with a learning disability by starting tiered interventions when a disability is suspected, but is the process of examining data that already exist from implementing a tiered intervention model, which should expedite the identification process. The expected outcome of RTI is improved instruction that will result in improved outcomes for all students&lt;ref name="Mary Wagner &amp; Phyllis Levine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro, E., Zigmond, N., Wallace, T., &amp; Marston, D.|title=Models for Implementing Response to Intervention|date=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60918-124-6|pages=377–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for RTI ==
There are at least four main reasons for implementing RTI: 1) to increase achievement for all students; 2) to reduce racial/ethnic disproportionate representation of minority students in special education; 3) to increase collaboration and integration of general and special education; 4) and to identify students with learning disabilities through a different lens than the IQ-achievement discrepancy model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawyer, Holland, &amp; Detgen|first1=R., D., &amp; A.|title=State policies and procedures and selected local implementation practices in response to intervention in the six southeast region states|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/southeast/pdf/REL_2008063.pdf|website=National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, regional educational laboratory southeast|accessdate=Feb 6, 2015|ref=REL 2008-063}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTI proponents claim that when interventions work, fewer children, particularly minority children, are referred for special education, and that the RTI model acts as a safeguard, ensuring that a child is not given a label of a disability inappropriately. In addition, proponents state that RTI  helps school districts by eliminating unnecessary referrals, which drain time and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=AE Farstrup |year=2007|title=RTI: A vital concern for reading professionals|journal=Reading Today|volume=25|issue=3|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics express concern, however, that in attempting to eliminate unnecessary referrals, RTI may also delay or eliminate necessary referrals.

Proponents feel that response to intervention is the best opportunity for giving all students the additional time and support needed to learn at high levels,&lt;ref&gt;Buffum,A., Mattos, M., &amp; Weber,C. (2010). "The why try behind RTI: Response to Intervention flourishes when educators implement the right practices for the right reasons." Educational Leadership, Oct. 2010, 10–16&lt;/ref&gt; and see great benefit in that it applies to the classroom teachers, paraeducators, counselors, and the administration. The RTI process can help identify students who are at-risk, guide adjustments to instruction, monitor student progress, and then make other recommendations as necessary. The objective is that with minor adjustments or simple interventions, students may respond and achieve at higher levels.

RTI is also very useful when working with students who have severe emotional problems.  The structure and evaluation of RTI will help this particular group of students to be successful in the academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearce, I. R. |year=2009|title=Helping children with emotional difficulties: A response to intervention investigation|journal=The Rural Educator |volume=30|issue=2|pages=34–36|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ869307.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading difficulties is one of the most common reasons students need intervention support.  Reading goals can develop reading self-concept, which influence reading fluency skills and promotes the importance of goal setting in reading intervention programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quirk|first=M.|author2=Schwaneflugel, P. J. |author3=Webb, M. Y. |title=A short-term longitudinal study of the relationship between motivation to read and reading fluency skill in second grade.|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|year=2009|volume=41|pages=196–227|doi=10.1080/10862960902908467|pmc=2838245}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that students monitor these goals and celebrate their progress. Students involved in multiple-component reading intervention programs show significant improvement, and students in different socioeconomic, racial, and intellectual quotient groups make equivalent gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=R. D.|author2=Lovett, M. W. |author3=Wolf, M. |author4=Sevcik, R. A. |author5=Steinbach, K. A. |author6=Frijters, J. C. |author7=Shapiro, M.

== Relationship between IDEA and RTI ==
The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was revised and signed into law in 2004 and became effective in July 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/idea/|title=IDEA—the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the law, a specific learning disability is a disorder of one or more of the basic psychological processes that adversely affects academic achievement in one or more domains (e.g., reading, writing, math, language). There are three methods of SLD identification under IDEA, as defined in §300.8(c)(10) (OSERS Final Regulations-8/06):
#a discrepancy between "ability" and "achievement"
#failure to respond to scientific research-based  intervention
#alternative research-based procedures for determining whether a child has a specific learning disability
(The "third method" is often considered a "processing strengths and weaknesses" model.)

The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA makes mention of RTI as a method of part of the process of identifying SLD: 
#In diagnosing learning disabilities, schools are no longer required to use the discrepancy model. The act states that, "a local educational agency shall not be required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability[...]"
#Response to intervention is specifically mentioned in the regulations in conjunction with the identification of a specific learning disability. IDEA 2004 states, "a local educational agency may use a process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention as a part of the evaluation procedures."
#Early Intervening Services (EIS) are prominently mentioned in IDEA for the first time. These services are directed at interventions for students prior to referral in an attempt to avoid inappropriate classification, which proponents claim an RTI model does. IDEA now authorizes the use of up to 15% of IDEA allocated funds for EIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/,root,dynamic,QaCorner,8,|work=ed.gov|title=Q&amp;A on Response to Intervention and Early Intervening Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI was included in the regulations due to considerable concerns raised by both the House and Senate Committees regarding proponents of RTI claims about the use of IQ tests to identify learning disabled students. There was also recognition in these committees of a growing body of scientific research supporting methods of pre-referral interventions that resolved learning difficulties short of classification. However, the final regulations also allow a third method of SLD identification, often considered a processing strengths and weaknesses model.

The IDEA Committee Conference Report (CCR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to Intervention in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)|year=2004|url=http://www.reading.org/downloads/resources/IDEA_RTI_report.pdf|access-date=2009-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324040342/http://www.reading.org/downloads/resources/IDEA_RTI_report.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the use of scientifically based early intervention programs, describes a model response-to-intervention program, and recommends the development of the most effective implementation of responsiveness to intervention models. The report describes such a model as an essential service for reducing the need to label children as disabled.

===Evaluating SLD using RTI===

First, it should be noted that whatever procedures are used to evaluate students as eligible for special education in the category of specific learning disabilities (SLD) must conform to the requirements of the IDEA regulations (2006), which indicate that a full and individual evaluation of a student suspected as having an SLD must address four qualifications. First, the evaluation must document that "...the child does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the following areas, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or state-approved grade-level standards: oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading skill, reading fluency skills, reading comprehension, mathematics calculation, mathematics problem-solving" (§300.309[a][1]). Second, the evaluation must document that "...(t)he child does not make sufficient progress to meet age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas identified ...when using a process based on the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention; or (t)he child exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined by the group to be relevant to the identification of a specific learning disability, using appropriate assessments (§300.309[a][2). Third, the evaluation must establish that the child's academic deficiencies are not the results of "...visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; emotional disturbance; cultural factors; environmental or economic disadvantage; or Limited English proficiency" (§300.309[a][3]) or of a lack of instruction ((§300.309[a][4]). Notably, a child must demonstrate qualifications under all four of these criteria to be identified with an SLD.

Kovaleski, VanDerHeyden and Shapiro (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovaleski, J.F.|author2=VanDerHeyden, A.M.|author3=Shapiro, E.S.|title=The RTI approach to evaluating learning disabilities|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-4625-1154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; used these IDEA regulations to operationalize how evaluation teams could utilize data collected during the provision of a multi-tier system of support in the evaluation process, particularly those data that inform the second SLD criterion of the child's failure to make sufficient progress in response scientific, research-based intervention (namely, RTI). Although evaluation teams may collect additional data after parents give permission for a full and individual evaluation, there should be ample data collected during three tiers of core instruction and robust intervention that can be analyzed to address all four of the SLD criteria.

In regard to the first SLD criterion, students undergoing multiple tiers of support have typically undergone multiple assessments of their academic skills, including annual state tests, universal screenings of all students that schools typically conduct three times per year, and academic assessments by specialists who deliver increasingly intense academic interventions. To qualify under this first criterion, the preponderance of these data should indicate a significant academic deficiency in at least one of the identified areas.

When using RTI as a component of eligibility decision-making, the school entity (school district, state) establishes a policy that identifies the option of using RTI to address the second SLD criterion (and opts not to select the option to use an assessment of the student's pattern of strengths and weaknesses).  The determination that the student fails to make sufficient progress toward age or grade standards is based on an analysis of the progress-monitoring data that are collected during the provision of intensive intervention, typically at tiers 2 and 3 of a multi-tier system of support. These data consist of the results of short assessments of key academic indicators that are administered as often as once or twice weekly. These data are graphed and rates of improvement calculated so that school teams can determine whether their interventions are working. These data are then compared to the rates of improvement made by typically performing students to determine whether the interventions that are being implemented in general education are sufficient to allow the student to reach grade standards. If not, a need for special education is indicated, and the student meets the second qualification for SLD.

The process for ruling out other disabilities or conditions when using RTI is similar to that employed in other special education evaluations, and consists of procedures to ensure that sensory or intellectual disabilities or environmental disadvantage or cultural/linguistic differences are not the true cause of the student's assessed academic deficiencies. Establishing that the student's deficiencies are not the result of a lack of instruction, however, requires that the evaluation team document that the school has sufficiently provided good core instruction in the basic skills and robust interventions when students have failed to profit from typical instructional practices. The evaluation team must also show evidence that the school personnel conducted repeated assessments of the student's academic problems and communicated the results of those assessments to the student's parents. Schools that use a multi-tier system of support at a high degree of fidelity can typically readily rule out lack of instruction as a cause of the student's academic concerns. On the other hand, in enacting this provision, Congress was demonstrating a concern that students might be identified with a disability (SLD) when the actual cause of their academic failure was ineffective schooling. Identifying students with SLD in failing schools is arguably problematic.

==Response to RTI==
Criticisms point to delays in identifying students needing special education (which was also a concern in a 2010 OSERS Memorandum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.esc13.net/thescoop/special/files/2011/01/RTI-Memo-1-21-111.pdf|title=2010 OSERS Memorandum|access-date=2011-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503092705/http://www5.esc13.net/thescoop/special/files/2011/01/RTI-Memo-1-21-111.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), difficulties in accurately determining the presence of a learning disability,&lt;ref name="Hale et al 2010" /&gt; and the amount of training needed by general education teachers. RTI can require additional work for teachers, and a potentially significant change in expectations represents a great source of resistance toward RTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richards, C.|displayauthors=etal|title=Response to Intervention: Building the Capacity of Teachers To Serve Students with Learning Difficulties|journal=Teacher Education|volume=16|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|pages=55–64|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ796252.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of RTI is that while its core assumptions include "that the educational system can effectively teach all children," interpretations of the approach often do not account for gifted education. An inverted pyramid showing analogous increasing interventions for gifted children could be added to the model so that all children are addressed. A framework for such an approach has been developed by the Montana Office of Public Instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opi.mt.gov/PDF/Gifted/RtI_GTFramework.pdf|title=Response to Intervention (RtI) and Gifted and Talented Education (GT)|date=Fall 2009|publisher=Montana Office of Public Instruction|access-date=2010-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304091817/http://www.opi.mt.gov/PDF/Gifted/RtI_GTFramework.pdf|archive-date=2010-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns and criticisms of RTI for SLD classification==
Criticisms of the RTI model first surfaced in 2004 when IDEA identified it as a viable method for use in SLD eligibility determination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hale, J.B., Naglieri, J.A., Kaufman, A.S., &amp; Kavale, K.A.|year=2004|title=Specific learning disability classification in the new Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: The danger of good ideas|journal=The School Psychologist|volume=58|issue=1|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that RTI is valuable for prevention, but see little empirical support for using RTI to determine learning disabilities, and have concern that it could be used to delay or deny services to children with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reynolds, C. R., &amp; Shaywitz, S. E.|year=2009|title=Response to intervention: Remediation, perhaps, diagnosis, no|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=3|pages=44–47|issue=1|pmid=20161671|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2008.00075.x|pmc=2819473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that there are many unanswered questions about RTI implementation, and that proponents have tended to gloss over or ignore criticisms of the RTI approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., &amp; Deshler, D. D.|year=2007|title=What we need to know about responsiveness to intervention (and shouldn't be afraid to ask)|journal=Learning Disabilities Research &amp; Practice|volume=22|pages=129–136|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5826.2007.00237.x|url=http://danlane.wiki.westga.edu/file/view/Fuchs+(What+we+need+to+know+about...).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major research efforts have supported these contentions through findings suggesting that RTI does not produce reliable sets of responders and non-responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Barth, A. E., Stuebing, K. K., Anthony, J. L., Denton, C. A., Mathes, P. G., Fletcher,  J. M., &amp; Francis, D. J.|year=2008|title=Agreement among response to intervention criteria for identifying responder status|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|volume=18|issue=3|pages=296–307|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2008.04.004|pmc=2600471|pmid=19081758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., Fuchs, L.

==Technology application to RTI==
Technology is becoming increasingly important in improving instructional practices and student achievement. Tools that educators can utilize within their classrooms include [[weblog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[RSS]] [[News aggregator|aggregators]], [[social bookmarking]], online photo galleries, [[webcasting|audio/visual casting]], [[Twitter]], and [[social networking]] sites.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Will|title=Blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other powerful web tools for classrooms|year=2010|publisher=Corwin|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these tools can be used for team-based learning and in facilitating students' use of higher forms of thinking such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2009" /&gt;

Properly integrated technology can increase student learning in areas such as motivation, collaborative learning, critical thinking, and problem solving.&lt;ref name="Schacter 1999" /&gt; Some techniques that have been found to work in education include: identifying similarities and differences; summarizing and note taking; reinforcing effort and providing recognition; assigning homework and practice; utilizing graphic representations of concepts; cooperative learning; providing objectives and feedback; generating and testing hypotheses; providing cues and questions; and using advanced organizers.&lt;ref name="Marzano 1998" /&gt; Technology-rich environments can also be effective for at-risk students, and can motivate students to stay in school and hopefully lessen the achievement gap.&lt;ref name="Collins 2009" /&gt;

Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/computer-assisted-instruction-and-reading|title=Computer-Assisted Instruction and Reading|date=2013-04-24|work=Reading Rockets|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been studied for its effects on lower achieving students. The effectiveness has been attributed to it being non-judgmental and motivational, while giving immediate and frequent feedback, individualizing learning to meet the students' needs, allowing for more student autonomy, and providing multi-sensory components (Barley ''et al.'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref name="Barley 2002" /&gt; A review of 17 different studies found that CAI positively affected scores in mathematics and literacy for all grade levels and significantly improving scores for students labeled "at-risk" (Barley ''et al.'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;105).&lt;ref name="Barley 2002" /&gt;

Technology can also effectively help teach basic literacy skills such as phonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, word recognition, alliteration, and comprehension. Today the use of specialized educational software applications can help support and enhance students' literacy skills. Presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] can be used to enhance young children learning experience. The use of pictures, colors, sounds, animation, slide designs, or slide transitions can be easily implemented into a literacy lesson, and such software has been used, for example, to help students with autism learn and respond to activity schedules.&lt;ref name="Grabe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabe|title=Using Animation in Microsoft PowerPoint to Enhance Engagement and Learning in Young Learners with Developmental Delay|year=2007|journal=[[Teaching Exceptional Children]]|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For young learners, the use of animation directs their attention to important features and prompts them to help ensure correct responses. Teachers can create literacy lessons with attention-grabbing elements such as moving graphic images. For example, a teacher might focus on the initial /d/ sound in the word "dog" as an instructional goal; a presentation slide for this would show a picture of a dog, and the teacher would select three possible letters to represent the initial sound in dog, such as /b/, /c/, and /d/. After showing the picture of the dog, and then displaying each of the three letter choices one-by-one, the teacher would ask the student what letter he or she thinks "dog" starts with.&lt;ref name="Parette 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Article|last=Parette|first=H|author2=Blum, C. |author3=Hourcade, J.J |date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of presentation software for literacy instruction, such as [[Photo Story]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://download.cnet.com/Photo-Story-3-for-Windows/3000-12511_4-10339154.html|title=Photo Story 3 for Windows|website=Download.com|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, can allow teachers to add a variety of special effects, soundtracks, captions, and their own voice narration to the photo stories.

'''Show and tell''' is the practice of showing something to an [[audience]] and telling them about it.  In the [[United Kingdom]], [[North America]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], it is a common classroom activity at early [[elementary school]].  It is used to teach young children the skills of [[public speaking]].&lt;ref name="amer580"&gt;Ammer, Christine. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA580&amp;dq= "show and tell,"] ''The American Heritage dictionary of idioms,'' p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a child will bring an item from home and will explain to the class why they chose that particular item, where they got it, and other relevant information.

==In popular culture==
*The television series ''[[Timothy Goes to School]]'' regularly featured this practice, except that it was referred to as "In the Spotlight," which became the title for one of the program's stories.
*In the comic strip ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' by [[Bill Watterson]], show and tell in Calvin's class is an occasionally recurring theme.

He studied [[theology]] in the school of the order Sankt Gabriel in  [[Maria Enzersdorf]] near [[Mödling]] and received his [[ordination]] to the priesthood in 1901. Richarz studied geology, [[paleontology]], [[petrology]] and [[chemistry]] at the   [[University of Vienna]] and later [[mineralogy]], philosophy and geology at the [[University of Munich]]. He received his phD for work with [[Ernst Weinschenk]] and [[Ernst Stromer von Reichenbach|Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach]] in 1919 from the University of Munich on [[basalt]]s from a quarry near Groschlattengrün.

In the following years he taught geology and [[astronomy]] at the school of the order [[Sankt Gabriel]]. In 1921 he changed to the school of the Divine Word Missionaries in [[Techny, Illinois]] where he lectured on geology, chemistry, mathematics and astronomy. In 1933 Richarz became dean of the science department of the [[Catholic University of Peking]]. In his first year, he went on a geological  field trip to [[Mengyin County]], [[South Shantung]], China where he died  13. July, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM20/AM20_184.pdf | title = Memorial of Stephen Richarz [1874-1934] | journal =  American Mineralogist | volume =  20 | issue =  3 | pages =  184–187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www2.uibk.ac.at/downloads/oegg/Band_27_147_150.pdf | journal = Mitteilungen der Geologischen Gesellschaft in Wien | year = 1934 | pages = 147–150 | title = P.

'''Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology''' is a [[Education in New Zealand#Tertiary education|New Zealand tertiary education institute]] with campuses in [[Rotorua]], [[Tauranga]], and other towns in the [[Bay of Plenty]] region. It was formed in May 2016 after the amalgamation of the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and [[Waiariki Institute of Technology]]. Toi Ohomai is the largest tertiary provider in the Bay of Plenty, and the third largest institute of technology in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="toi ohomai"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toiohomai.ac.nz/about-us|title=About Us {{!}} Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology|website=toiohomai.ac.nz|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Waiariki Community College'' was opened in Rotorua in April 1978.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the college established additional campuses in Tokoroa, Whakatane, Taupo, [[Turangi]] and [[Kawerau]]. In 1998, the college was renamed ''Waiariki Institute of Technology''. The institute provided education in various areas, such forestry, [[Māori studies]], business management, journalism, sport and music.&lt;ref name="wairiki"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.waiariki.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/waiariki-history|title=From Waiariki to Toi Ohomai {{!}} Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology|website=waiariki.ac.nz|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the ''Bay of Plenty Community College'' was opened in Tauranga (later known as ''Bay of Plenty Polytechnic''). The college initially ran various administration, engineering, and agriculture courses, later expanding to other areas such as hospitality, tourism and television. By 1991, the polytechnic had expanded to two main centres - the Windermere Campus in Poike, and the Bongard Centre in downtown Tauranga. In 2010, a total of 9,443 students were studying at Bay of Plenty Polytechnic.&lt;ref name="bop poly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boppoly.ac.nz/go/history|title=History {{!}} Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology|website=boppoly.ac.nz|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2016, the two institutions merged to form Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology. The new name was gifted by local iwi, and means "to aim high and achieve great heights; to be awakened by learning."&lt;ref name="toi ohomai" /&gt;

'''''Trans World''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] computer game for the [[Commodore 64]] published by [[Starbyte Software]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

==Summary==
The player takes control of a new [[trucking company]] and competes against up to either three other human or computer players to make the most money. The game has two modes to choose from, a continuous play mode that plays indefinitely or a [[game mode|timed mode]] that runs a select number of turns. Players control all aspects of the company from purchasing new trucks to hiring [[mechanic]]s to building new [[office]]s. Each round of the game controls one day of game time with each player taking a turn. Periodically, a random event will happen which can either help or hinder the player's company. Some events are offers to have goods delivered while others are [[sick day]]s that skip the player's turn. The game ends when a player chooses to end it or when the selected number of rounds have been completed. The winner is the player with the most money at the game's end.

}}''' Michoacan University of Saint Nicholas of Hidalgo''' ('''UMSNH''') is a public university in [[Morelia]], [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]], and the oldest institution of higher education in the Americas. The University grants [[law]], [[economics]], [[computer science]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]], and [[dentistry]] degrees, plus several other additional [[fields of study]], mainly in Humanities, Science and Arts.

== History ==
[[Image:Biblioteca Pública UMSNH 093.jpg|thumb|left|250px|miniaturadeimagen|izquierda|Public library &lt;small&gt;UMSNH&lt;/small&gt;.]]
It has its origins in a college founded in 1540 by [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in Pátzcuaro, the ''Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo''. This school gained the royal seal and patronage in 1543. In 1566, colonial religious authorities took over the school, and in 1574, academics began to be under the jurisdiction of the Jesuits. With the Episcopal seat changed to Valladolid (modern day [[Morelia]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Mexico.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the school moved also in 1580, and was fused with the already existing Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. The school was reformed in the 17th century and its curriculum was redesigned in the 18th to include courses in philosophy, religious law, civil law and other subjects. At the end of the 18th century, the school became one of New Spain’s main centers of learning and academia, producing scholars such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[José María Morelos]], José Sixto Verduzco, José María Izazaga and [[Ignacio López Rayón]], most of whom would have a role in the upcoming [[Mexican War of Independence]]. The school closed during the war but was reopened in 1847 with the name Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, focusing more on secular studies such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology, based on the European university model. After the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1917), the school was reorganized and renamed again to the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, which consolidated a number of other schools and disciplines into the new organization.

== Location ==
The University has several campuses, located at [[Morelia]], [[Ciudad Hidalgo, Michoacán|Ciudad Hidalgo]], and [[Apatzingan]].

== Accreditation ==
The University is accredited at the national level by the ''Asociación Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educación Superior''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anuies.mx (ANUIES)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
The University is divided into several academic ''facultades''.  Prospective students must have a high school degree, preferably from a college preparatory high school, and pass a university entrance exam to be admitted into the academic division of their choice. The University integrates various programs amongst its extracurricular offerings.

The '''valuation of nonmarket housework''' comprises attempts to attach value to non-exchange domestic tasks. Housework may include a variety of activities, particularly those traditionally associated with [[housekeeping]] (or [[homemaking]]), along with child care and nurturing. These activities have recognizable economic and social significance, but are not included in standard economic measurements, such as the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). While the symbolic or subjective benefits of housework are difficult to measure, various attempts have been made to attach value to economically productive household activity.

==Economic Valuation==

===''Tracking Measures''===

Traditional means of tracking economic activity, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), do not take account of non-exchange, nonmarket household activity. Therefore, various adjustments to GDP calculations and novel measurements have been proposed, such as the GPI or GHP.

====Gross domestic product ([[Gross domestic product|GDP]])====

In 2012, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) created an adjusted measure of GDP to account for productive household activity.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using detailed [[time use survey]]s for the period 1965-2010, the BEA found that incorporating “nonmarket household production” raises the GDP measure by 39% in 1965 and 26% in 2010.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surveys used seven categories of time use in American household production (housework, cooking, odd jobs, gardening, shopping, child care, and domestic travel) and the BEA assigned a low-end market wage to the hours spent on each activity.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declining impact on the adjusted GDP reflects the steadily decreasing number of (nonmarket) hours households spent on home production. While men increased their weekly hours of home production in the time span from 14 to 17, this increase was more than offset by the decline in women's home production from 40 to 26 hours.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA explains this shift by increased women's participation in the work force as well as the steadily decreasing market wages of household workers (such as cleaners and nannies), raising the opportunity costs of self-participation and encouraging outsourcing.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genuine progress indicator ([[Genuine progress indicator|GPI]])====

The [[Genuine progress indicator|GPI]] is an alternative to GDP as a measure of economic growth that is generally designed to incorporate environmental and social factors that are not traditionally included. While much of the focus is typically placed on environmental costs, most GPI measurements explicitly include additions for the value of household work and parenting.

One of the most well-known examples is the GPI measure used across Atlantic Canada. In a 1999 report &lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|publisher=GPI Atlantic|accessdate=17 February 2014|year=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GPI Atlantic describes the household production infrastructure as akin to the access to raw materials, labour and markets required for the business sector.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"/&gt; The Atlantic GPI employs time use variables and assigns explicit monetary values to [[unpaid work]] according to its replacement value in the market. According to their (1999) measurements, “unpaid work contributes $325 billion worth of services to the Canadian economy annually” and they argue that GPI analysis should be explicitly incorporated into policy considerations.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"/&gt;

====Gross household product (GHP)====

Gross household product is a specific estimation of the economic value added by the unpaid work and capital of households.&lt;ref name=Ironmonger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=Duncan|author2=Faye Soupourmas |title=Output-Based Estimates of the Gross Household Product of the United States 2003-2010|date=Aug 2012|url=http://www.iariw.org/papers/2012/IronmongerPaper.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the “household economy.” [[Duncan Ironmonger]] defines a country's Gross Economic Product as comprising both the Gross Market Product (typically defined as GDP) and Gross Household Product. Using one of the same time use surveys as the BEA study referenced above (the American Time Use Survey), Ironmonger estimates the USA's 2011 GHP at 11.6 trillion dollars (as compared to a GDP of 13.3 trillion).&lt;ref name=Ironmonger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=Duncan|author2=Faye Soupourmas |title=Output-Based Estimates of the Gross Household Product of the United States 2003-2010|date=Aug 2012|url=http://www.iariw.org/papers/2012/IronmongerPaper.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Approaches to the Economic Valuation of Housework''====

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] report ''Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World'' defines unpaid work as, “the production of goods and services by household members that are not sold on the market” .&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=V.|title=Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World|journal=OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers|year=2011|issue=116|doi=10.1787/5kghrjm8s142-en |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kghrjm8s142-en |accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses the “third-person” rule &lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Margaret|title=Economics of Household Production|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to distinguish between work and leisure, claiming that if a third person can be paid to do the activity while benefiting the household, it is work.

While paid work outside of the home is readily measurable, housework is much more difficult to calculate. A number of models have been created to determine the value of work in the home, each with different conceptualizations of the process. There is currently no consensus on the appropriate approach.

These methods are generally divided into two main camps: the [[opportunity cost]] approach and the [[market value]] approach. The former views housework as equivalent to the amount one would make in the labour market. Housework is therefore evaluated at the wage rate that the member would otherwise have received. The market value approach bases the value of work done in the home on the cost of hiring someone to do the same job.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|page=388}}&lt;ref name=ferber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferber|first=M.A.|author2=Birnbaum, B.G. |title=Housework: Priceless or Valueless?|journal=Review of Income and Wealth|year=1980|volume=26|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither method is without criticism.

The opportunity cost method is flawed in that it is difficult to pinpoint a comparator group. Not all workers have their choice of job, nor the number of hours they work.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–389}} Furthermore, wages vary depending on the location of the job and the gender of the employee, and the time it takes to get to and from work is not factored into the calculation.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}} Age, level of education, and work experience are good predictors of what one would make in the labour market, but they are simply a subset of the aspects that can be used to calculate what a house worker would make.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–389}} Therefore, while many studies regarding the valuation of work in the home have attempted to come up with a standard wage and multiply it by the number of hours worked, there is no agreement as to how this standard wage should be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt-Clermont|first=L.|title=Unpaid work in the household.|year=1983|publisher=International Labor Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market value approach comes with its own set of flaws. One type of approach within this category is the Direct Output Method, which is based on the value of production rather than the hours of labour performed in the household.&lt;ref name="Ciscel 215"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciscel|first=David H|author2=Heath, Julia |author3=Sharp, David |title=Back To Becker: valuing women's economic contribution from housework with household production functions|journal=Journal of Forensic Economics|date=Fall 1998|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It solves the problem of having to come up with a standard wage,&lt;ref name="Ciscel 215"/&gt; but it is inherently difficult to obtain data on production output (e.g., number of pants folded) in the home. Furthermore, comparing the value of individual tasks performed to the average market price it would cost to get that same task completed may not be accurate, as multiple tasks can and are often done simultaneously in the home. To counteract this problem, one can construct a valuation based on the total wages of a housekeeper who performs a similar set of tasks.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}} Yet, even then, the model does not take into account that men and women in the labour market often do housework, but hire housekeepers to do specific jobs that may require particular skills or expertise and demand a higher wage as a result.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}}

Overall, while these methods have attempted to create ways to determine the value of household labour, there is no accepted approach.

===Gender Disparity===

Despite women's increased participation in the work force, several North American studies show that women still engage in significantly more housework activity than men.

A recent study by [[Statistics Canada]] indicates that while men and women participate (nearly) equally in the labour force, women spend far more hours on unpaid housework, such as child care and domestic work (including house cleaning, cooking, yard work and home maintenance).&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milan|first=Anne|title=Families, Living Arrangements and Unpaid Work: Women in Canada: A Gender-based Statistical Report|year=2011|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-503-x/2010001/article/11546-eng.htm.|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=Statistics Canada|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it was found that men spend an average of 24.4 hours per week on child care, while women spend 50.1 hours on the same tasks.&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"/&gt; In the domestic work category, men conduct 8.3 hours of unpaid work, compared with 13.8 hours per week for women.&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"/&gt;

According to GPI Atlantic, “[t]ime use surveys reveal that Canadian women spend about twice as much time on total unpaid household work, including child and elder care, as men. They spend three times as long cooking and washing dishes, and nearly seven times as much time cleaning house and doing laundry”.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=GPI Atlantic|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|date=October 1999|page=5|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite a doubling of the female labour force from 1960-1999.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic 5"/&gt;  The report argues that due to the invisibility of unpaid household production in traditional economic measures (like GDP), women are subject to wage and gender discrimination that has significant adverse effects on their economic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GPI Atlantic|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|date=October 1999|page=7|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis found a smaller discrepancy between genders on productive (but nonmarket) housework. According to their May 2012 report, women spend approximately 26 hours per week on home production, as opposed to 17 hours for men. Note, however, that the tasks included vary significantly between studies.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Weekly Reader''''' was a weekly educational classroom [[magazine]] designed for children. It began in 1928 as '''''My Weekly Reader'''''. Editions covered curriculum themes in the younger grade levels and news-based, current events and curriculum themed-issues in older grade levels. The publishing company also created workbooks, literacy centers, and picture books for younger grades.

In 2012, ''Weekly Reader'' ceased operations as an independent publication and merged with its new owner, ''Scholastic News'', due primarily to market pressures to create digital editions as well as decreasing school budgets.&lt;ref name=nyp723&gt;{{cite web|author=Kosman, Josh and Keith J.

==History==
Formerly ''My Weekly Reader'', the ''Weekly Reader'' was a weekly newspaper for elementary school children. It was first published by the American Education Press of [[Columbus, Ohio]], which had been founded by Charles Palmer Davis in 1902 to publish ''Current Events'', a paper for secondary school children.&lt;ref&gt;''History of American Education Publications, Inc. 1902–1965''. Columbus, Ohio: American Education Publications, 1965. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of ''My Weekly Reader'' appeared on September&amp;nbsp;21, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, Harrison M. ''Random Recollections''. Iowa City, Iowa: (Privately published), [1974], 2011. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first editor was Martha Fulton, who had been hired that summer by Preston Davis, the major owner of the Press, and Harrison Sayre, who became managing editor. Sayre, also the editor of ''World News'', a paper for high school students, had been urged to start a paper for grade schools by teachers he had met in June 1928, while on a sales trip in [[Indiana]]. Martha Fulton, who was a friend of Sayre's wife, Mary, and a graduate of Wells College, enjoyed travel and adventure. During [[World War I]], she had been an [[American Red Cross]] worker in [[France]]. She also had "a remarkable rapport with children and had lively interests in every direction."&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The lead article was about the boyhoods of [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Al Smith]]. There were two shorter articles: "Wings for Safety", about street crossing guards; and, "Sky Medicine", which was about the healthful qualities of the Sun. The most popular was a letter from "Uncle Ben" about a ride in a German glider on [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref&gt;''My Weekly Reader'', September 21, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Fulton wrote all these articles. Her sister Peg was the first artist, though soon replaced by her friend Mary Sherwood Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the third issue, Eleanor Johnson, director of elementary schools in [[York, Pennsylvania]], designed tests for the back page.&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

''My Weekly Reader'' was an instant success. By December, circulation was 99,000. In 1929, a second edition was started for younger children, and their combined circulation was 376,000. By 1931, there were four editions, with a combined circulation of 1,099,000.&lt;ref&gt;Circulation ledger, AEP archives, 1986. Middletown, Connecticut: AEP Offices.&lt;/ref&gt;

The secrets of its early success were the timely news articles that had a children's angle, and the Uncle Ben letters describing new inventions and discoveries that excited children's imaginations. For example, the second issue's lead article, "A Village Moves to the South Pole", was about Admiral Byrd's 75-man expedition, their sled dogs, and Paul Siple, a Boy Scout who was with them. Uncle Ben wrote about planned "Seadromes", floating airports that airplanes could use to hop across the Atlantic. The third issue, published on October 5, 1928, began with "How Mother Nature Prepares for Winter".  Uncle Ben described seeing his "first radio television set", even though the paper itself had yet to print even a photograph—illustrations for the ''Reader'' having only been drawings to date. On October&amp;nbsp;12, he wrote about [[Zeppelins]], and the first ''Reader'' photographs appeared. They depicted "Mr. and Mrs. Hoover" and "Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Grandchildren".

Harrison Sayre, who became president of the American Education Press while remaining managing editor of ''My Weekly Reader'', gave Martha Fulton the major credit for the newspaper's popularity. In his memoirs, Sayre quoted Gertrude Wolff, another editor who shared an office with Fulton: "As I had had some editorial experience, she at times sought my advice on minor details, but the conception and execution of those first issues were hers alone. With her imagination, enthusiasm, intuitive understanding of a child's world, she sensed what would appeal to her young readers. Her very personal stamp on the new publication distinguished the succeeding issues during her years as editor."&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

As the new editions for upper and lower grades were added, Fulton remained the principal writer, even after her marriage in 1930 (to Clarence L. Sager, a [[New York City]] lawyer) and her moves to New York City and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut]]. Sayre remembered that Fulton wrote for the papers for 12 years, adding that "men of the composing room...testify that with her square, legible, longhand copy, she never missed a deadline."&lt;ref name=Sayre111&gt;Sayre, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people who were important to the newspaper's early years were Laura E. Zirbes, a reading expert at the Ohio State University laboratory school, and Dr. Charles H. Judd of the University of Chicago, who introduced Sayre to Dr. [[William S. Gray]], who in turn supplied Fulton with graded vocabulary lists.&lt;ref name=Sayre111 /&gt; In 1930, Eleanor Johnson moved from York to [[Lakewood, Ohio]], where she was assistant superintendent of schools until 1934, when she moved to Columbus and later became a managing editor.&lt;ref name=History54&gt;''History'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, a fifth edition was added for the fifth and sixth grades. The price was twenty cents per semester. Circulation continued to rise, passing two million in 1942. Many people still fondly remember the papers they read as children and how they looked forward to Friday afternoons when their teachers handed out the latest issue.

In 1949, the American Education Press was sold to [[Wesleyan University]] and became American Education Publications, a division of the [[Wesleyan University Press]]. Editorial offices were moved to [[Middletown, Connecticut]], but printing continued to be done in Columbus, Ohio. There were then six editions, one for each elementary grade, with a total circulation of 4,269,000. Total circulation of AEP papers was 5,605,000. In 1965, Wesleyan sold American Education Publications to the [[Xerox Corporation]]. By then, there was also a kindergarten edition. Eleanor Johnson was editor-in-chief of all editions.&lt;ref name=History54 /&gt; In later years, there were other owners, including the [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] and Field Publications.

A [[pre-kindergarten]] edition was added in 1980. There were also curriculum-specific magazines for middle and high school students, including areas such as health, science, careers, reading, and writing.

[[Weekly Reader Publishing]], which began with the publication of the first ''Current Events'' on May 20, 1902, celebrated its 100th birthday in 2002.

At various times through its publishing history, the magazine was known as ''My Weekly Reader'' or ''Weekly Reader''.

In 2007, Weekly Reader Corporation became part of [[The Reader's Digest Association]], based in [[Chappaqua]], New York. ''Weekly Reader''{{'}}s main office was relocated from [[Stamford, Connecticut]], to Chappaqua at the end of May 2007. Financial difficulties marred the publication during its time under Reader's Digest ownership; the magazine made efforts to launch an online presence for the magazine but were unable to secure the funds from the parent organization to do so, a factor in the magazine's decline.&lt;ref name=nyp723/&gt;

In February 2012, ''Weekly Reader'' was acquired by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/rda-sells-weekly-reader_b53252 RDA Sells Weekly Reader]&lt;/ref&gt; which operated the competing ''Scholastic News''. Scholastic announced that it would be shutting down ''Weekly Reader'' publication and moving some of its staff to ''Scholastic News''.&lt;ref name=nyp723/&gt; Following the completion of the merger, the merged magazines are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklyreader.com/classroom-magazines-for-kids/ Weekly Reader Classroom Magazine For Kids] Retrieved September 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polls==
One of the best-known events in the magazine's history is its quadrennial "Weekly Reader Student Presidential Election Poll". The poll is an educational exercise in which ''Weekly Reader''-subscribing teachers conduct mock elections to find their students' preference for president. Teachers tabulate the results, then send them to ''Weekly Reader''. (Since the 2000, the surveys have been developed with, and tabulated by, the Zogby International polling organization.) This survey of students in grades K through 12 began in 1956, when readers chose [[Dwight Eisenhower]] over [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].

The poll has now been conducted 14 times, most recently in 2008, and the students have voted for the person who became president 13 out of 14 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.rda.com/news/polls-find-kids-and-adults-disagree-on-whether-u-s-can-solve-its-problems| title=Weekly Reader and IBOPE Zogby Polls Find Kids and Adults Disagree on Whether U.S. Can Solve Its Problems|date = December 8, 2011|publisher=Reader's Digest|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception was in 1992, when [[George H.W.

==''Read''==
In 2005, Weekly Reader Publishing's literary magazine, ''[[Read (magazine)|Read]]'', launched ''Word'', a blog that features student writing and other literary news. It also offers interactive opportunities for reading and writing, including its "What's Your Story?" program, which features "The Weekly Writer", where students can help authors such as [[Stephen King]] and [[R. L. Stine]] finish an original story. ''Read'' magazine has pioneered "electronic issues" around literary themes, including ''Canterbury Tales'', William Shakespeare, and Edgar Allan Poe; these interactive websites incorporate video and film, music and sound effects, rap renditions and flash animation. In the 2009-2010 school year, the company extended these "e-issues" to four other ''Weekly Reader'' publications, including ''Weekly Reader'' editions 3 and Senior (4-6 grades), ''Current Events'' and ''Current Science'' magazines.

'''William Carey''' (17 August 1761 – 9 June 1834) was a British Christian [[missionary]], [[Particular Baptist]] minister, translator, social reformer and cultural anthropologist who founded the [[Serampore College]] and the [[Serampore University]], the first degree-awarding university in India.&lt;ref&gt;Vishal Mangalwadi (1999), The Legacy of William Carey: A Model for the Transformation of a Culture, pp. 61–67, {{ISBN|978-1-58134-112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], India in 1793, but was forced to leave the British Indian territory by non-Baptist Christian missionaries.&lt;ref name=brit1/&gt; He joined the Baptist missionaries in the Danish colony of Frederiksnagar in India ([[Serampore]]).

==Early life==

William Carey, the oldest of 5 children, was born to Edmund and Elizabeth Carey, who were [[weaving|weavers]] by trade, in the hamlet of [[Pury End]] in the village of [[Paulerspury]], Northamptonshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paulerspury: Pury End|url=http://www.thecareyexperience.co.uk/paulerspury.htm|website=The Carey Experience|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Carey's Historical Wall – Carey Road, Pury End, Northamptonshire, UK|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM8V98_William_Careys_Historical_Wall_Carey_Road_Pury_End_Northamptonshire_UK|website=UK Historical Markers|publisher=Waymarking.com|accessdate=9 July 2016}} ''Includes image of memorial stone''&lt;/ref&gt; William was raised in the [[Church of England]]; when he was six, his father was appointed the parish clerk and village schoolmaster. As a child he was naturally inquisitive and keenly interested in the [[natural sciences]], particularly [[botany]]. He possessed a natural gift for language, teaching himself [[Latin]].

At the age of 14, Carey's father apprenticed him to a [[cordwainer]] in the nearby village of [[Piddington, Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps045.shtml |title=Glimpses #45: William Carey's Amazing Mission |publisher=Christian History Institute |accessdate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050404040813/http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps045.shtml |archivedate=4 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His master, Clarke Nichols, was a churchman like himself, but another apprentice, John Warr, was a [[Dissenter]]. Through his influence Carey would eventually leave the Church of England and join with other Dissenters to form a small [[Congregational church]] in nearby Hackleton. While apprenticed to Nichols, he also taught himself [[Greek language|Greek]] with the help of a local villager who had a college education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

When Nichols died in 1779, Carey went to work for the local shoemaker, Thomas Old; he married Old's sister-in-law Dorothy Plackett in 1781 in the Church of St. John the Baptist, Piddington. Unlike William, Dorothy was illiterate; her signature in the marriage register is a crude cross. William and Dorothy Carey had seven children, five sons and two daughters; both girls died in infancy, as well as son Peter, who died at the age of 5. Thomas Old himself died soon afterward, and Carey took over his business, during which time he taught himself [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Italian, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and French, often reading while working on his shoes.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Carey acknowledged his humble origins and referred to himself as a cobbler (one who repairs shoes). However, the local community often knew him by the higher status of a shoemaker (or "cordwainer"). John Brown Myers entitled his biography of Carey ''William Carey the Shoemaker Who Became the Father and Founder of Modern Missions''.

==Founding of the Baptist Missionary Society==
[[File:Detail from Hanging in Carey Baptist Church - Moulton - Northamptonshire.JPG|thumb|Detail from wall hanging depicting William Carey's life, in Carey Baptist Church, Moulton, Northamptonshire, UK]]
Carey became involved with a local association of [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]] that had recently formed, where he became acquainted with men such as [[John Ryland]], [[John Sutcliff]], and [[Andrew Fuller]], who would become his close friends in later years. They invited him to preach in their church in the nearby village of Earls Barton every other Sunday. On 5 October 1783, William Carey was [[baptism#Baptist|baptised]] by Ryland and committed himself to the Baptist denomination.
[[File:W H Carey.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait sketch by [[Colesworthey Grant]]]]
In 1785, Carey was appointed the schoolmaster for the village of [[Moulton, Northamptonshire|Moulton]]. He was also invited to serve as pastor to the local Baptist church. During this time he read [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' ''Account of the Life of the Late Rev. [[David Brainerd]]'' and the journals of the explorer [[James Cook]], and became deeply concerned with propagating the Christian [[Gospel]] throughout the world. [[John Eliot (missionary)#Legacy|John Eliot]] (c. 1604 – 21 May 1690), Puritan missionary in New England, along with David Brainerd (1718–47) and the Apostle Paul himself, became the "canonized heroes" and "enkindlers" of Carey.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, John, (2002) "New England Puritans: The Grandparents of Modern Protestant Missions," ''[[Fides et Historia]]'' 30.4, 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey's friend Andrew Fuller had previously written an influential pamphlet in 1781 titled "The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation," answering the [[Calvinism#Hyper-Calvinism|hyper-Calvinist]] belief then prevalent in the Baptist churches, that all men were not responsible to believe the Gospel. At a ministers' meeting in 1787, Carey raised the question of whether it was the duty of all Christians to spread the Gospel throughout the world. [[John Collett Ryland]] is said to have retorted: "Young man, sit down; when God pleases to convert the heathen, he will do it without your aid and mine." However Ryland's son, Dr. John Ryland, disputed that his father made this statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = F Deaville | last = Walker | title = William Carey.  Missionary Pioneer and Statesman | origyear = 1925 | edition = repr. | place = Chicago | publisher = Moody Press | date = n.d.| page = 54}}, n.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stanley, The History of the Baptist Missionary Society 1792–1992 (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1992), 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eustace Carey, Memoir of William Carey, D.D. (London: Jackson and Walford, 1836), 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1789 Carey became the full-time pastor of Harvey Lane Baptist Church in [[Leicester]]. Three years later in 1792 he published his groundbreaking missionary manifesto, ''An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens''. This short book consists of five parts. The first part is a theological justification for missionary activity, arguing that the command of Jesus to make disciples of all the world ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:18–20) remains binding on Christians. 
{{cquote|That there are thousands in our own land as far from God as possible, I readily grant, and that this ought to excite us to ten-fold diligence in our work, and in attempts to spread divine knowledge amongst them is a certain fact; but that it ought to supersede all attempts to spread the gospel in foreign parts seems to want proof. – William Carey, Sect I&lt;ref name="wmcarey.edu"&gt;William Carey (1792), [http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/anenquiry.pdf AN ENQUIRY INTO THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHRISTIANS, TO USE MEANS FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE HEATHENS] reprinted London: Carey Kingsgate Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second part outlines a history of missionary activity, beginning with the early Church and ending with David Brainerd and [[John Wesley]].
{{cquote|BEFORE the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ the whole world were either heathens, or jews; and both, as to the body of them were enemies to the gospel. – William Carey, Sect II&lt;ref name="wmcarey.edu"/&gt;}}

Part 3 comprises 26 pages of tables, listing area, population, and religion statistics for every country in the world. Carey had compiled these figures during his years as a schoolteacher. The fourth part answers objections to sending missionaries, such as difficulty learning the language or danger to life. Finally, the fifth part calls for the formation by the Baptist denomination of a missionary society and describes the practical means by which it could be supported. Carey's seminal pamphlet outlines his basis for missions: Christian obligation, wise use of available resources, and accurate information.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

{{cquote|It is true all the reward is of mere grace, but it is nevertheless encouraging; what a treasure, what an harvest must await such characters as PAUL, and ELLIOT, and BRAINERD, and others, who have given themselves wholly to the work of the Lord. What a heaven will it be to see the many myriads of poor heathens, of Britons amongst the rest, who by their labours have been brought to the knowledge of God. – William Carey, Sect V&lt;ref name="wmcarey.edu"/&gt;}}

Carey later preached a pro-missionary sermon (the so-called [[Deathless Sermon]]), using [[Isaiah]] 54:2–3 as his text, in which he repeatedly used the epigram which has become his most famous quotation: {{cquote|Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God.}}
Carey finally overcame the resistance to missionary effort, and the ''Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen'' (subsequently known as the ''Baptist Missionary Society'' and since 2000 as [[BMS World Mission]]) was founded in October 1792, including Carey, Andrew Fuller, John Ryland, and John Sutcliff as charter members. They then concerned themselves with practical matters such as raising funds, as well as deciding where they would direct their efforts. A medical missionary, Dr. John Thomas, had been in [[Calcutta]] and was currently in England raising funds; they agreed to support him and that Carey would accompany him to India.

==Missionary life in India==
[[File:Grave of William Carey, India, ca. 1920 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS15-65).jpg|thumb|Grave of William Carey, Serampore, West Bengal, India, ca. 1920. Black and white lantern slide showing the grave of missionary William Carey (1761-1834), his second wife Charlotte Emelia Carey (1761-1821) and third wife Grace Carey (d. 1835).]]
Carey, his eldest son Felix, Thomas and his wife and daughter sailed from London aboard an English ship in April 1793. Dorothy Carey had refused to leave England, being pregnant with their fourth son and having never been more than a few miles from home; but before they left they asked her again to come with them and she gave consent, with the knowledge that her sister Kitty would help her give birth. En route they were delayed at the [[Isle of Wight]], at which time the captain of the ship received word that he endangered his command if he conveyed the missionaries to Calcutta, as their unauthorised journey violated the trade monopoly of the [[British East India Company]]. He decided to sail without them, and they were delayed until June when Thomas found a Danish captain willing to offer them passage. In the meantime, Carey's wife, who had by now given birth, agreed to accompany him provided her sister came as well. They landed at [[Calcutta]] in November.&lt;ref name=notefrom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/s/smith_geo/carey/carey.htm|title=Note from the preparer of this etext_ I have had to insert a view comments mainly in regards to adjustments to fonts to allow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first year in Calcutta, the missionaries sought means to [[Tentmaking|support themselves]] and a place to establish their mission. They also began to learn the Bengali language to communicate with others. A friend of Thomas owned two [[indigo dye|indigo]] factories and needed managers, so Carey moved with his family north to [[Midnapore]]. During the six years that Carey managed the indigo plant, he completed the first revision of his Bengali [[New Testament]] and began formulating the principles upon which his missionary community would be formed, including communal living, financial self-reliance, and the training of indigenous ministers. His son Peter died of [[dysentery]], which, along with other causes of stress, resulted in Dorothy suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] from which she never recovered.&lt;ref name=notefrom/&gt;

Meanwhile, the missionary society had begun sending more missionaries to India. The first to arrive was [[John Fountain]], who arrived in Midnapore and began teaching school. He was followed by [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]], a printer; [[Joshua Marshman]], a schoolteacher; David Brunsdon, one of Marshman's students; and William Grant, who died three weeks after his arrival. Because the East India Company was still hostile to missionaries, they settled in the Danish colony at [[Serampore]] and were joined there by Carey on 10 January 1800.&lt;ref name=notefrom/&gt;

===Late Indian period===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Carey House - Serampore College - Hooghly 2017-07-06 0903.JPG|thumb|Carey lived here at the Serampore College.]]
Once settled in [[Serampore]], the mission bought a house large enough to accommodate all of their families and a school, which was to be their principal means of support. Ward set up a print shop with a secondhand press Carey had acquired and began the task of printing the Bible in Bengali. In August 1800 Fountain died of dysentery. By the end of that year, the mission had their first convert, a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] named [[Krishna Pal]]. They had also earned the goodwill of the local Danish government and [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]], then Governor-General of India.

The conversion of [[Hindu]]s to Christianity posed a new question for the missionaries concerning whether it was appropriate for converts to retain their [[caste]]. In 1802, the daughter of Krishna Pal, a [[Shudra|Sudra]], married a [[Brahmin]]. This wedding was a public demonstration that the church repudiated the caste distinctions.

Brunsdon and Thomas died in 1801. The same year, the Governor-General founded Fort William, a college intended to educate civil servants. He offered Carey the position of professor of Bengali. Carey's colleagues at the college included [[pundit (India)|pundit]]s, whom he could consult to correct his Bengali testament. One of his colleagues was Madan Mohan Tarkalankar who taught him the Sanskrit language. He also wrote grammars of Bengali and [[Sanskrit]], and began a translation of the Bible into Sanskrit. He also used his influence with the Governor-General to help put a stop to the practices of infant sacrifice and [[Sati (practice)|suttee]], after consulting with the pundits and determining that they had no basis in the Hindu sacred writings (although the latter would not be abolished until 1829).

Dorothy Carey gave birth to Jim Carey. Then later she died in 1807. Due to her debilitating mental breakdown, she had long since ceased to be an able member of the mission, and her condition was an additional burden to it. John Marshman wrote how Carey worked away on his studies and translations, "…while an insane wife, frequently wrought up to a state of most distressing excitement, was in the next room…".

Later that same year Carey made the following entry in his diary: "Tuesday, Dec. 8, 1807. This evening Mrs. Carey died of the fever under which she has languished some time. Her death was a very easy one; but there was no appearance of returning reason, nor any thing that could cast a dawn of hope or light on her state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1992/issue36/3627.html?start=3 ''William Carey's Less-than-Perfect Family Life''], ChristianHistory.net, Issue 36, 10 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Several friends and colleagues had urged William to commit Dorothy to an asylum. But he recoiled at the thought of the treatment she might receive in such a place and took the responsibility to keep her within the family home, even though the children were exposed to her rages.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy George, The Life and Mission of William Carey, IVP, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808 Carey remarried. His new wife [[Charlotte Rhumohr]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] member of his church was, unlike Dorothy, Carey's intellectual equal. They were married for 13 years until her death.

From the printing press at the mission came translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. Many of these languages had never been printed before; William Ward had to create [[Punchcutting|punches]] for the type by hand. Carey had begun translating literature and sacred writings from the original Sanskrit into English to make them accessible to his own countryman. On 11 March 1812, a fire in the print shop caused £10,000 in damages and lost work. Among the losses were many irreplaceable manuscripts, including much of Carey's translation of Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and related languages, which would have been a seminal [[philology|philological]] work had it been completed. However, the press itself and the punches were saved, and the mission was able to continue printing in six months. In Carey's lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages and dialects.

Also, in 1812, [[Adoniram Judson]], an American [[Congregational Church|Congregational]] missionary en route to India, studied the scriptures on baptism in preparation for a meeting with Carey. His studies led him to become a Baptist. Carey's urging of American Baptists to take over support for Judson's mission, led to the foundation in 1814 of the first American Baptist Mission board, the ''General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign Missions'', later commonly known as the [[Triennial Convention]]. Most American Baptist denominations of today are directly or indirectly descended from this convention.

[[File:SeramporeCollege.jpg|thumb|left|Serampore College]]
In 1818, the mission founded [[Serampore College]] to train indigenous ministers for the growing church and to provide education in the arts and sciences to anyone regardless of caste or country. The [[King of Denmark]] granted a royal charter in 1827 that made the college a degree-granting institution, the first in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Senate of Serampore College (University)|Senate of Serampore College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820 Carey founded the [[Agri Horticultural Society of India]] at Alipore, Kolkata, supporting his enthusiasm for botany. When [[William Roxburgh]] went on leave, Carey was entrusted to maintain the Botanical Garden at Calcutta. The genus ''[[Careya]]'' was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= William Carey| author=Culross, James| publisher=A.C. Armstrong and Son| place= New York| year=1882|page=190|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamcarey00culr#page/190/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{botanist|Carey|Carey, William}}

Carey's second wife, Charlotte, died in 1821, followed by his eldest son Felix. In 1823 he married a third time, to a widow named Grace Hughes.

Internal dissent and resentment was growing within the Missionary Society as its numbers grew, the older missionaries died, and they were replaced by less experienced men. Some new missionaries arrived who were not willing to live in the communal fashion that had developed, one going so far as to demand "a separate house, stable and servants."   Unused to the rigorous work ethic of Carey, Ward, and Marshman, the new missionaries thought their seniors – particularly Marshman – to be somewhat dictatorial, assigning them work not to their liking.

Andrew Fuller, who had been secretary of the Society in England, had died in 1815, and his successor, John Dyer, was a bureaucrat who attempted to reorganise the Society along business lines and manage every detail of the Serampore mission from England. Their differences proved to be irreconcilable, and Carey formally severed ties with the missionary society he had founded, leaving the mission property and moving onto the college grounds. He lived a quiet life until his death in 1834, revising his Bengali Bible, preaching, and teaching students. The couch on which he died, on 9 June 1834, is now housed at [[Regent's Park College]], the Baptist [[Permanent Private Hall|hall]] of the [[University of Oxford]].

===Criticism===
Much of what is known about William Carey's missionary life in India is from missionary reports sent to Britain. Historians such as Comaroffs, Thorne, Van der Veer and Pennington note that the representation of India in these reports must be examined in their context and with care for its evangelical and colonial ideology.&lt;ref name=bkp2/&gt; The reports by Carey were conditioned by his background, personal factors and his own religious beliefs. The polemic notes and observations of Carey, and his colleague William Ward, were in a community suffering from extreme poverty and epidemics, and they constructed a view of Indian culture and Hinduism in light of their missionary goals.&lt;ref name=bkp2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low (2003), Christians and Missionaries in India, pp. 156–157, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-3956-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports were by those who had declared their conviction in foreign missionary work, and the letters describe experiences of foreigners who were resented by both the natives as well the British colonial officials and competing Christian groups. Their accounts of culture and Hinduism were forged in impoverished Bengal (modern [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]) that was physically, politically and spiritually difficult.&lt;ref name=bkp2/&gt; Pennington summarizes the accounts reported by Carey and his colleagues as follows,

{{cquote|Plagued with anxieties and fears about their own health, regularly reminded of colleagues who had lost their lives or reason, uncertain of their own social location, and preaching to crowds whose reactions ranged from indifference to amusement to hostility, missionaries found expression for their darker misigivings in their production of what is surely part of their speckled legacy: a fabricated Hinduism crazed by blood-lust and devoted to the service of devils. – Brian Pennington&lt;ref name=bkp2&gt;Brian K. Pennington (2005), Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction, pp. 76–77, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;}}

William Carey recommended that British people in India must learn and interpret Sanskrit in a manner "compatible with colonial aims".&lt;ref name=sn1&gt;Silvia Nagy (2010), Colonization Or Globalization?: Postcolonial Explorations of Imperial Expansion, p. 62, {{ISBN|978-073-91-31763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey wrote, "To gain the ear of those who are thus deceived, it is necessary for them to believe that the speaker has a superior knowledge of the subject. In these circumstances, knowledge of Sanskrit is valuable."&lt;ref name=sn1/&gt; Carey lacked understanding and respect for Indian culture, writes Rao,&lt;ref name=vr1/&gt; describing Indian music as "disgusting" and bringing to mind practices dishonorable to God. Such prejudices affected the literature authored by Carey and colleagues.&lt;ref name=vr1/&gt;

==Family history==
Biographies of Carey, such as those by F. D. Walker&lt;ref&gt;Frank Deauville Walker, ''William Carey'' (1925, repr. Chicago: Moody Press, 1980). {{ISBN|0-8024-9562-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. B. Myers]], only allude to Carey's distress caused by the mental illness and subsequent breakdown suffered by his wife, Dorothy, in the early years of their ministry in India. More recently, Beck's biography of Dorothy Carey paints a more detailed picture: William Carey uprooted his family from all that was familiar and sought to settle them in one of the most unlikely and difficult cultures in the world for an uneducated eighteenth century English peasant woman. Faced with enormous difficulties in adjusting to all of this change, she failed to make the adjustment emotionally and ultimately, mentally, and her husband seemed to be unable to help her through all of this because he just did not know what to do about it.&lt;ref name="Beck, James R. 1992"&gt;Beck, James R. ''Dorothy Carey: The Tragic and Untold Story of Mrs. William Carey.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8010-1030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carey even wrote to his sisters in England on 5 October 1795, that "I have been for some time past in danger of losing my life. Jealousy is the great evil that haunts her mind."&lt;ref&gt;"Dorothy's Devastating Delusions," [http://ctlibrary.com/3918 Christian History &amp; Biography], 1 October 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy's mental breakdown ("at the same time William Carey was baptizing his first Indian convert and his son Felix, his wife was forcefully confined to her room, raving with madness"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelcollege.edu/academics/library/Archives/reflections/v2n1p25_28.pdf Book Review — Dorothy Carey: The Tragic And Untold Story Of Mrs. William Carey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915144241/http://www.bethelcollege.edu/academics/library/Archives/reflections/v2n1p25_28.pdf |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) led inevitably to other family problems. [[Joshua Marshman]] was appalled by the neglect with which Carey looked after his four boys when he first met them in 1800. Aged 4, 7, 12 and 15, they were unmannered, undisciplined, and even uneducated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Eschatology==
Besides [[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]]'s study, ''The Puritan Hope'',&lt;ref&gt;Iain H. Murray, ''The Puritan Hope.''  Carlisle, PA: Banner of Truth, 1975. {{ISBN|0-85151-037-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; less attention has been paid in Carey's numerous biographies to his [[postmillennial]] [[eschatology]] as expressed in his major missionary manifesto, notably not even in [[Bruce J. Nichols]]' article "The Theology of William Carey."&lt;ref&gt;"The Theology of William Carey," ''Evangelical Review of Theology'' 17 (1993): 369–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Carey was a [[Calvinist]].”&lt;ref name=yeh13&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeh|first1=Allan|last2=Chun|first2=Chris|title=Expect Great Things, Attempt Great Things: William Carey and Adoniram Judson, Missionary Pioneers|page=13|publisher=Wipf and Stock|date=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzNNAwAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[postmillennialist]]. Even the two dissertations which discuss his achievements (by Oussoren&lt;ref&gt;Aalbertinus Hermen Oussoren, William Carey, Especially his Missionary Principles (Diss.: Freie Universität Amsterdam), (Leiden: A. W. Sijthoff, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt; and Potts&lt;ref&gt;E. Daniels Potts. British Baptist Missionaries in India 1793–1837: The History of Serampore and its Missions, (Cambridge: University Press, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;) ignore large areas of his theology. Neither mention his eschatological views, which played a major role in his missionary zeal.&lt;ref&gt;D. James Kennedy, [http://www.coralridge.org/nem/NEMrelatedmessage.asp?dt=0627 "William Carey: Texts That Have Changed Lives"]: "It was the belief of these men that there was going to be ushered in by the proclamation of the Gospel a glorious golden age of Gospel submission on the part of the heathen. It is very interesting to note that theologically that is what is known as 'postmillennialism,' a view which is not very popular today, but was the view that animated all the men who were involved in the early missionary enterprise."&lt;/ref&gt; One exception, found in James Beck's biography of his first wife,&lt;ref name="Beck, James R. 1992" /&gt; mentions his personal optimism in the chapter on "Attitudes Towards the Future," but not his optimistic perspective on world missions, which he derived from postmillennial theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Schirrmacher]], ''[http://www.contra-mundum.org/schirrmacher/careypostmil.html William Carey, Postmillennialism and the Theology of World Missions]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey devoted great efforts and time to the study not only of the common language of Bengali, but to many other Indian vernaculars including the ancient root language of [[Sanskrit]]. In collaboration with the [[Fort William College|College of Fort William]], Carey undertook the translation of the Hindu classics into English, beginning with the three-volume epic poem the [[Ramayana]]. He then translated the [[Bible]] into [[Bengali language|Bengali]], Oriya, Marathi, Hindi, Assamese, Sanskrit and parts of it into other dialects and languages.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=William Carey|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Carey}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 30 years Carey served in the college as the professor of Bengali, Sanskrit and Marathi.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=George|authorlink=George Smith (1833–1919)|title=The Life of William Carey, D.D.: Shoemaker and Missionary, Professor ..., Part 4|date=1885|publisher=R &amp; R Clark, Edinburgh|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhopadhyay|pages=71, 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey and his team produced textbooks, dictionaries, classical literature and other publications which served primary school children, college-level students and the general public, including the first systematic Sanskrit grammar which served a model for later publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brockington|first=John| date=1991–1992|title=William Carey’s Significance as an Indologist|url= http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol17-18/vol17-18_art05_BROCKINGTON.pdf |journal=Indologica Taurinensia – the online journal of…Sanskrit studies|volume=17-18|pages=87–88|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter 1700s and early 1800s in India, only children of certain social strata received education, and even that was limited to basic accounting and Hindu religion. Only the Brahmins and writer castes could read, and then only men, women being completely unschooled. Carey started [[Sunday School]]s in which children learned to read using the Bible as their textbook.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1885, p. 150&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 Carey opened, at his own cost, what is considered the first primary school in all of India.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1885, p. 148&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The public school system that Carey initiated expanded to include girls in an era when the education of the female was considered unthinkable. Carey’s work is considered to have provided the starting point of what blossomed in to the Christian Vernacular Education Society providing English medium education across India.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1885, p. 102&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey has at least nine schools named after him: William Carey Christian School (WCCS) in [[Sydney, NSW]], William Carey International University in [[Pasadena, California]], [[Carey Theological College]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, [[Carey Baptist College]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, [[Carey Baptist Grammar School]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria]], [[Carey College, Colombo|Carey College]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, [[William Carey University]], [[Hattiesburg]], [[Mississippi]] and [http://www.carey.wa.edu.au Carey Baptist College] in [[Perth]], [[Australia]]. The William Carey Academy of [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]] teaches both Bangladeshi and expatriate children, from kindergarten to grade 12, and the William Carey Memorial School, (A Co-ed English Medium), operates in Serampore, Hooghly.

==Legacy and influence==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
William Carey has been referred to as the "father of modern [[Christian mission|missions]]",&lt;ref name="Gonzalez, Justo L p. 306"/&gt; and as "India's first cultural anthropologist."&lt;ref name=kopf70&gt;{{cite book|last=Kopf|first=David| authorlink = David Kopf|title= British Orientalism and the Renaissance: The Dynamics of Indian Modernization 1778–1835 |date=1969|publisher=Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay|location=Calcutta|pages=70, 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His motto, which has inspired many across the centuries, was “Expect great things from God and attempt great things for God.”&lt;ref name=yeh117&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeh|first1=Allan|last2=Chun|first2=Chris|title=Expect Great Things, Attempt Great Things: William Carey and Adoniram Judson, Missionary Pioneers|page=117|publisher=Wipf and Stock|date=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzNNAwAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His teaching, translations, writings and publications, his educational establishments and influence in social reform are said to have “marked the turning point of Indian culture from a downward to an upward trend.” 
{{Quote|text= [Carey] saw India not as a foreign country to be exploited, but as his heavenly Father’s land to be loved and saved... he believed in understanding and controlling nature instead of fearing, appeasing or worshipping it; in developing one’s intellect instead of killing it as mysticism taught. He emphasized enjoying literature and culture instead of shunning it as ''maya.''|author=[[Vishal Mangalwadi]]&lt;ref name=mangalwadi24&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangalwadi|first=Vishal|title=The Legacy of William Carey: A Model for the Transformation of a Culture|date=1999|ISBN=978-1-58134-112-6|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
Thus Carey significantly contributed to the birth of [[Indian nationalism]].&lt;ref name=mangalwadi24/&gt;

Carey’s life inspired the founding of a number of educational institutions. He was instrumental in launching [[Serampore College]] near Calcutta,&lt;ref name=yeh39&gt;Yeh page=39&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Serampore is recognized as the standard for Christian theological accreditation throughout much of India.

Carey’s passionate insistence on change resulted in the founding of the [[BMS World Mission|Baptist Missionary Society]]&lt;ref name=yeh117/&gt; which today supports over 350 workers in 40 countries.

[[William Carey University]], founded in 1892, has campuses in [[Hattiesburg]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcarey.edu/about-william-carey|title=About William Carey|publisher=William Carey University|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Carey’s life, in 1976 [[missiology|missiologist]] [[Ralph D. Winter|Ralph Winter]] founded [[William Carey International University]] and the [[Venture Center]]. Its 17-acre campus in [[Pasadena, California]] includes a children’s school, Bible school, publishing department, library, spacious meeting hall and offices for a number of charitable Christian organizations.

An English Medium School named William Carey International School was established on 17 August 2008 at 70-D/1, Indira Road, [[Tejgaon]], [[Dhaka]] 1215, [[Bangladesh]].

By the time Carey died, he had spent 41 years in India without a furlough. His mission could count only some 700 converts in a nation of millions, but he had laid an impressive foundation of [[Bible translations]], education, and social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/131christians/missionaries/carey.html?start=2|title=William Carey|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey is also credited with setting up "The Statesman" and bringing the potato to the then undivided [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal Province]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Artifacts==
St James Church in Paulerspury, Northamptonshire, where Carey was christened and attended as a boy, has a William Carey display. Carey Baptist Church in Moulton, Northamptonshire, also has a display of artefacts related to William Carey, as well as the nearby cottage where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecareyexperience.co.uk|title=The Carey Experience|first=Matthew|last=Cooper|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey Lane Baptist Church in Leicester, the last church in England where Carey served before he left for India, was destroyed by a fire in 1921. Carey's nearby cottage had served as a 'Memories of Carey' museum from 1915 until it was destroyed to make way for a new road system in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council-services/lc/growth-and-history/blueplaques/blueplaquespeople/williamcarey/&lt;/ref&gt; The artefacts from the museum were given to [http://www.central-baptist.org.uk Central Baptist Church] in Charles Street, Leicester.
[http://theangus.rpc.ox.ac.uk The Angus Library and Archive] in Oxford holds the largest single collection of Carey letters as well as numerous artefacts such as his Bible and the sign from his cordwainer shop. There is a large collection of historical artifacts including letters, books, and other artifacts that belonged to William Carey at the Center for Study of the Life and Work of William Carey at Donnell Hall on the William Carey University Campus in Hattiesburg, MS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon promoted to Associate Curator, Schevill traveled with Professor Raymond on "significant fossil-collecting expeditions to the Burgess Shale, British Columbia (1930) and to Estonia, Norway and Sweden (1934)." &lt;ref name="euppublishing.com"/&gt;

===Kronosaurus discovery===

The skull—which matched the holotype jaw fragment of ''K. queenslandicus''—was prepared right away, but time and budget constraints put off restoration of the nearly complete skeleton - most of the bones of which remained unexcavated within the limestone blocks - for 20 years.

Following his return from the expedition, William E. Schevill was made a librarian of the MCZ from 1935 to 1943,&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; "and Barbour noted in 1937 that he had 'a  decided  taste  for  bibliography'." Unsurprisingly, Mr. Schevill became a founding member of the ''Society for the Bibliography of Natural History'' in 1936.&lt;ref name="euppublishing.com"/&gt; During this period he earned a Master's degree in paleontology from Harvard, and met his future wife, [[Vassar College]] student [[Barbara Lawrence (zoologist)|Barbara Lawrence]]. They married December 23, 1938, and would have two children: a daughter name Lee, and a son named Edward.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmfyK0QtsRAC|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2000-07-27|isbn=9780203801451|first=Joyce|last=Harvey|first2=Marilyn|last2=Ogilvie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=BARBARA LAWRENCE (1909–1997) {{!}} Society of Ethnobiology|url=https://ethnobiology.org/awards/barbara-lawrence-award/about-barbara-lawrence|website=ethnobiology.org|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;W.

==Cetology==
Becoming an Associate in Physical Oceanography at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts in 1943, Bill Schevill's first work regarded US Naval auspices investigating echo-location of U-boats. Indeed, he had been rejected for military service because of chronic iritis, he joined a small group that worked with Allied submariners on observing the temperature of the ocean's upper levels so as to exploit it for stealth when dealing with enemy sonar.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; As he later wrote in 1962: ''"During World War II many people on both sides listened to underwater sounds for military reasons. Not only the wanted sounds (those made by enemy ships), but a bewildering variety of others were heard. Most of these were ascribed to animals living in the sea, usually as “fish noises” ... Some were ascribed to whales, in part correctly, but without identification of the kind of whale; most military listeners were not biologists, and in any case the traditional naval sonar room is woefully deficient in windows."''&lt;ref&gt;SCHEVILL, W. E., 1962 Whale music. Oceanus 9 (2): 2–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Such maritime work inspired him and, leaving Palaeontology behind, led William E. Schevill become "one of the world's most innovative whale biologists and an undisputed pioneer in the field of whale sounds,"&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; performing the first recordings of underwater sounds and extrapolating their purpose from these recordings. In accordance with his groundbreaking work, Dr. Schevill would publish over fifty papers on whale phonation and thus provide the framework for “literally hundreds of scientific studies produced by other workers from the 1960s until the present day."&lt;ref&gt;BACKUS, R. H., BUMPUS, D., LAWRENCE, B., NORRIS, K. S., RAY, C. E., RAY, G. C., TWISS, J. R. and WATKINS, W. A., 1995 William Edward Schevill 1906–1994. Marine mammal science 11 : 416–419&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is worthy of note that his wife Barbara Lawrence, by now the MCZ's Curator of Mammals, often co-wrote these documents with him.&lt;ref name="euppublishing.com"/&gt; However, in spite of his change in field, it is reported that Bill Schevill split his time equally between the MCZ and the WHOI - his work with the latter likely relating to Cetology as opposed to fossil studies.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;

William E. Schevill's study of whales also at one point harked back to the U.S. Naval operations that first set him down this path. As noted upon his death by the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History, ''"Bill helped defuse a tense moment between the USA and [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. The US military suspected that low frequency blips were being used by the Soviets to locate American submarines,  whereas Bill showed these were produced by fin whales ([[Fin whale|Balaenoptera physalus]]) hunting prey."''&lt;ref name="euppublishing.com"/&gt;

William E. Schevill technically retired in 1985, though he continued to work unofficially even after, and died of pneumonia Monday July 25, 1994 at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass, where he lived; survived by his wife, daughter, and son.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The University comprises: School of Business and Economics, School of ICT and Engineering, School of Hospitality and Tourism, School of Education and Social Arts and the Department of Media Arts and Design.

The current chancellor is Professor Susan Alfano, and the Vice Chancellor is Prof. Njenga Munene.

==History==

Although Zetech University was officially founded in 1999, Ken Mbiuki had been offering basic IT training in his dorm room since 1997, where he operated under the name ''Zenith Technologies'' while pursuing his undergraduate studies at the University of Nairobi. At the time, computing technology was fairly new in Kenya.

In 1999 Ken Mbiuki leased office space in Summit House and registered an academic institution under the name Zetech College – a fusion of the words 'Zenith' and 'Technology'. The college initially offered purely I.T.-based courses and has slowly grown over the years. It is now accredited as Zetech University by the Commission for University Education.

==Campuses==
Zetech University's main campus is located off Thika road in Ruiru, about 20&amp;nbsp;km from capital city of Nairobi:

===Thika Road Campus===

The structured state-of-the-art University Complex in Ruiru, the Thika Road Campus, marks the transition of the college into a fully fledged chartered university that will offer degree courses and award students a Zetech University Certificate upon the successful completion of their curriculum. Officially launched by the President of Kenya H.E President Uhuru Kenyatta, the complex is a home away from home for students.

===Library===

The 750-seater capacity library in the newly proposed Zetech University facility serves as Zetech's main Library, superior facilities including an expansive 3 floor library fitted with an all round digital experience. The library can hold up to a total of 750 students at one go and is expected to provide the ultimate room for a thorough academic research. The facility comprises approximately 2,500 titles and incorporates computer-based learning support facilities to provide access to up-to-date research information. Also the library features wi-fi Internet access as well as an automated [[Integrated Library System]].&lt;ref name="zetechcollege"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zetech.ac.ke/content/zetech-University-automates-library |title=Zetech University Automates Library |publisher=Zetech University  |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same library collections are also housed in its Pioneer Campus Library.

==Academic Programmes==

===Religion===
The Universities mandate is primarily the pursuit of secular education. The institution, however, generally subscribes to values of the Christian Faith. Students from diverse religious backgrounds are allowed to practice their faith without hindrance, so long as these practices do not make demands on or interfere with the smooth running of university operations, and university academic programs in particular. All students are expected to accord due respect and exhibit tolerance towards members of the different faiths.
