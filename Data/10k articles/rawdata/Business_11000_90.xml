'''''Absolute Power''''' is a British comedy series, set in the offices of Prentiss McCabe, a fictional [[public relations]] company (or 'government-media relations consultancy') in London, run by Charles Prentiss ([[Stephen Fry]]) and Martin McCabe ([[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]]).

It started in 2000 on [[BBC Radio 4]], lasting until 2004 with the fourth and final radio series. A six-part television series ran on [[BBC Two]] towards the end of 2003; the second six-episode television series ran on BBC Two on Thursdays at 10 pm from 21 July to 25 August 2005. A one-off radio episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006.

The title is taken from a quotation by the historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]: "power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely".

}}
The series was devised and written by [[Mark Tavener]], and logically follows the series ''[[In the Red (novel)|In the Red]]'', ''In the Balance'', ''In the Chair'', and ''In the End'' which he wrote with [[Peter Baynham]]. In some of these, Prentiss and McCabe (again played by Fry and Bird) are elevated members of the [[BBC]], before getting kicked out. Indeed, there is a scene on the last page of the novel ''[[In the Red (novel)|In the Red]]'', in which the newly appointed director general of the [[BBC]] gives them the sack.
The idea is that after this they created Prentiss McCabe, which is the subject of ''Absolute Power''. The tone and style of ''Absolute Power'' is so different from the ''In the...'' series that it can be regarded as a totally different programme. It was produced, like so much of Tavener's work, by Dawn Ellis.

Prentiss is a man without morals, whose only objectives are money and power. He is portrayed as being the brains, while McCabe, though an excellent speech-writer, lacks his motivation and insight. McCabe's ambitions include retiring and drinking [[claret]], and he spends his life in a state of cynicism, lack of energy and boredom. McCabe (who describes himself as "a first class mind") does sometimes have good ideas, but they usually become Prentiss's ideas by the time they are presented to the client, and he lacks the energy to make more than mild objections. McCabe is also more likely to baulk at a scheme for moral reasons than Prentiss.

Stephen Fry said of Charles Prentiss, "He's a brute of a man, out to win, with no morals; he's completely shameless. There's not much to say that's nice about him, except that there is some pleasure in watching a natural born killer at work and knowing whatever happens he will win".

Prentiss and McCabe often find themselves working on behalf of two rival clients, one of whom is often the shadier side of the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government, often called their "Downing Street Retainer". This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch ([[Tony Gardner]], [[Alex Lowe (actor)|Alex Lowe]]), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as [[Frank Dobson]]'s campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the [[European Union]], while also being employed by the [[Eurosceptic]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe seems to want to do any real work.

The third member of the company is Sandy ([[Siobhan Hayes]]), who is there as the office trainee, getting work experience for her [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]] level 2. She usually does all the work that the partners in the firm cannot be bothered to do, such as filling out thousands of public opinion polls in different handwritings, though she will only agree to do something if it can be twisted into one of the 'nine levels of competence' of her NVQ. Another member of the office is the useless Clive ([[Tom George (actor)|Tom George]]) or as Martin calls him, 'young, er, thing', who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths. He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).

Another regular character is Maurice, the waiter at McCabe's [[gentlemen's club (traditional)|club]]. Each time he serves McCabe's claret, he corrects the English pronunciation of Maurice (Morris) to the French (Maur-ees), and each time Prentiss puts him down with a verse like "One man by circumstance is in splendour set; whilst another irons pants in a laundrette. Go and iron my pants, Morris".

In series 1, one of the running jokes is the company trying to avoid working on "The Sir Harold Dixon Account." Although he is never heard, it is known that he is a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician. As the series goes on, Sandy becomes more frustrated, and in the last episode she changes jobs and starts working for Sir Harold. However, after allegations of sleaze, Sir Harold is made bankrupt and Sandy returns to Prentiss McCabe.

In series 2, another character was created, Gayle Shand, played by [[Tamsin Greig]]. Gayle was a former employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, with whom she had a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from [[Philadelphia]]. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the [[Tony Blair|PM]] via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the [[Gordon Brown|Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Prentiss McCabe always come up with a plan to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle's attempts to stop them, even trying to make Charles a partner in her firm.

Also introduced was her assistant, Janice&lt;!--not sure who played her!--&gt;, who suspected that Gayle's personal rivalry with Charles did not lead to the best decisions.

In the last episode of series 2, Gayle was leaving for America, and made one last bet with Charles. She bet her company against Charles's testicles that he could not make the [[Home Secretary]] say, "Prison doesn't work". Despite Charles's best attempts, Gayle won because she bribed the Home Secretary, as she was having an affair with someone in the Home Office. Luckily, she called off the bet providing Charles could make love to her to the tune of the [[1812 overture]]. Charles managed to get his own back, however, by planting some Class A Drugs in her suitcase as she left for America. Charles may nevertheless still have some feelings for her, and sometimes reminisces about their relationship.

A one-off special episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006, with Tony Gardner playing Archie. In the special, Martin goes to jail for seven years for fraud (having been implicated in the [[Cash for Peerages]] scandal). Archie, who has left New Labour, then blackmails Charles into giving him a job to prevent any more embarrassing information getting out about the company.

However, Charles soon learns that in fact Archie has framed both Martin and himself, with the assistance of Martin's girlfriend, and they are planning to take over Prentiss McCabe. After Charles finds proof, Archie goes to jail and Martin gets released, but as he has been moved to an open prison, he does not feel like leaving too soon.

The radio series is sometimes repeated on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] as part of the "Comedy Club" hour.

===Hutton Report===
The first episode of series 4 was controversially edited because of references to the [[Hutton Report]]. The words "manipulation and lying" was cut from Prentiss's line: "There's nothing Prentiss McCabe can teach this Prime Minister about deception, manipulation and lying, except how to do it properly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3453603.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; BBC denies axing political satire |publisher=BBC News |date=3 February 2004 |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writewords.org.uk/news/381.asp |title=BBC censor comedy scripts in post-Hutton panic and paranoia |publisher=Writewords.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204071940/http://www.writewords.org.uk/news/381.asp |archivedate=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television series was written by [[Guy Andrews]], [[Mark Lawson]] and Andrew Rattenbury, and had the tag "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]] is dead, long live [[public relations|PR]]". Unlike most radio to TV sitcom transfers, none of the TV episodes was based on a radio episode. There are many differences to the radio version. Prentiss McCabe is a much more powerful and respected organisation than in the radio series. Martin McCabe is much more worldly wise. The secret meetings with government representatives are gone and replaced with more cups of coffee with newspaper editors and private secretaries.

While the radio series has one trainee, the TV version has several young professionals working at the agency. Most notable are Jamie Front ([[James Lance]]) and Alison Jackman ([[Zoe Telford]]). While Jamie is a brilliant liar and naturally devious, Alison is very intelligent but too honest and somewhat literal-minded. Charles Prentiss said of her, "Most of the young people here at Prentiss McCabe don't know their arse from their elbow, but with Alison, at least you know she'll join the Royal Arse Society and get a book about elbows from the library". Also in the firm are Cat Durnford ([[Sally Bretton]]), the young party girl, and Nick Mayer ([[Nicholas Burns (British actor)|Nick Burns]]), Charles's personal assistant.

Instead of political schemes, the agency concentrates on working with celebrities: something that is rare in the radio version. In the radio episode where McCabe works with a [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]] contestant, this is shown as an exceptional event, but would be normal behaviour in the TV series. Contrariwise, in the TV episode "The House of Lords", Charles is mildly surprised to be contacted by a government spin doctor.

===The London bombings===
Owing to the terrorist attacks on London on the 7 and 21 July 2005, the first episode of the second series (in which a member of the [[bin Laden family]] attempted to buy [[British Airways]]) was replaced by an episode from later in the series. The bin Laden episode was aired several weeks later.

==Critical reception – Television series==

*{{quote|Transferring a radio series to television can be risky [...] Absolute Power, however, succeeds where previous comedies have failed, and looks set to do for PR what [[Drop The Dead Donkey]] did for the newsroom. A good cast helps.|''[[The Independent]]'', 8 November 2003}}
*{{quote|fitfully amusing comedy|Stuart Price in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', 9 November 2003}}
*{{quote|The script presses the right buttons relentlessly. The names that are invoked contribute artfully to the atmosphere of heightened unreality. The idea of Mark Thatcher is tossed about in this corner, while the notion of Dennis Waterman is examined in another [...] I suppose it is a credit to all involved in the programme that I didn't like it at all. Although the characters are clearly exaggerations and grotesques, I felt they were probably close enough to the truth to be convincing. Form and content were perfectly matched. Like [[Trevor's World of Sport]], of which this is clearly a superior relation, it is impossible to like any of the characters. [...] It delivers a stringently corrective dose of satire. It is quite appallingly knowing, and deliberately so.|Pete Clark in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 11 November 2003}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9368">'''Accountant–client privilege''' is a confidentiality [[Privilege (evidence)|privilege]], or more precisely, a group of privileges, available in American federal and state law. Accountant–client privileges may be classified in two categories: '''evidentiary''' privileges and '''non-evidentiary''' privileges.

An evidentiary privilege is one that may as a general rule be successfully asserted in a court of law. A non-evidentiary privilege is (A) one that may not be maintained in a court of law, or (B) one which is, according to the terms of the statute granting the privilege, not applicable in the face of an order from the court compelling disclosure of the communication for which the privilege is claimed. The evidentiary and non-evidentiary versions of the accountant-client privilege are, as a general rule, creations of Federal or state [[statute]].

Under English [[common law]], on which American law is based, there was generally no accountant–client privilege. In the United Kingdom in particular the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] actually requires accountants (and solicitors, insolvency practitioners, etc.) who suspect their clients of tax evasion to report them to the authorities without telling the clients they have done so, subject to a maximum punishment of 14 years in jail. This affects even accountants who uncover a possibly inadvertent claim for expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dolan|first=Liz|title=Solicitors must 'shop' suspected tax dodgers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/2864661/Solicitors-must-shop-suspected-tax-dodgers.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=1 October 2003|quote=if a client subsequently informs an accountant that he has wrongly claimed expenses, the accountant is required to report this fact to the authorities in secret.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal took note of the American policy but refused to give any weight to it on the grounds that it is for Parliament to choose to enact a similar rule in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tower v. M.N.R. (F.C.A.), 2003 FCA 307, [2004] 1 F.C.R. 183|url=http://reports.fja.gc.ca/eng/2004/2003fca307.html|publisher=Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada|accessdate=2013-03-06|date=July 22, 2003|quote=Advice given by tax accountants not elevated to level of solicitor-client privilege}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-evidentiary accountant–client privileges==

Some states have enacted a non-evidentiary accountant–client privilege.

For example, Texas has a privilege rule that requires that a [[certified public accountant]] (CPA) not voluntarily disclose information communicated to the CPA by a client in connection with the engagement without the client's permission. The privilege generally does not apply, however, in the case of an administrative [[summons]] by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] under {{usc|26|7602}}, in the case of a summons under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], or in the case of a court order.&lt;ref&gt;Tex. Occup. Code sec. 901.457. (A few other exceptions also apply under the Texas law.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The federally authorized tax practitioner privilege==

The ''federally authorized tax practitioner privilege'', is a limited evidentiary privilege available in American federal [[tax law]]. The privilege is defined in an amendment to the [[Internal Revenue Code]] made by the [[Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998]]:&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 105-206 (H.R. 2676) (July 22, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

::With respect to tax advice, the same common law protections of confidentiality which apply to a communication between a taxpayer and an attorney shall also apply to a communication between a taxpayer and any federally authorized tax practitioner to the extent the communication would be considered a privileged communication if it were between a taxpayer and an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7525(a)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the law, the term "federally authorized tax practitioner" (or FATP) means an individual authorized under Federal law to practice before the Internal Revenue Service where the practice is subject to Federal regulation under {{usc|31|330}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|7525(a)(3)(A)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'tax advice' means advice given by an individual with respect to a matter that is within the scope of the individual's authority to practice.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|7525(a)(3)(B)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, some significant limitations on the FATP privilege.

===Not applicable in criminal proceedings or state law matters===

Unlike the attorney–client privilege, the FATP privilege does not apply in criminal matters, and does not apply in state tax proceedings. The privilege may be asserted only in a "noncriminal tax matter before the Internal Revenue Service" and a "noncriminal tax proceeding in Federal court brought by or against the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7525(a)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of date of the communication on availability of the FATP privilege===

The FATP privilege applies only to communications made on or after July 22, 1998. The privilege does not apply to any written communication before October 22, 2004, between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director, shareholder, officer, employee, agent, or representative of a corporation in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter.&lt;ref&gt;The term tax shelter is defined in {{usc|26|6662(d)(2)(C)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 7525 was amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 108-357.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the privilege does not apply to written communications made on or after October 22, 2004, involving a federally authorized tax practitioner with respect to the participation of any person (not just a corporation) in a tax shelter. This is a further limitation of the privilege.

===The practitioner===

The term FATP includes an [[Lawyer|attorney]], a CPA, an [[Enrolled Agent|enrolled agent]], or an enrolled [[actuary]]. The FATP privilege does not generally apply to accountants who are not CPAs or EAs (unless they qualify as enrolled actuaries).

The FATP privilege might not apply to certified public accountants who are not licensed to practice in the state in which the client lives (for example, in a situation where the client lives in New Jersey but works in New York, where he consults a CPA who is licensed in New York but not in New Jersey). Because the CPA is not licensed to practice in the state where the client resides, the communication might not qualify for the privilege.{{Cn|date=July 2016}}

===Tax advice versus business advice===

The FATP privilege applies only to tax advice. The advice must be treated as confidential by both the accountant and the client to be covered by the privilege. If the communication is divulged to third parties, then it is not confidential.  The privilege does not cover general business consultations or personal financial planning advice.

===Tax return preparation===

With respect to communications involved in the preparation of tax returns, there is a split of authority. Much of the relevant case law was rendered prior to the creation of the FATP privilege in 1998, and relates to the attorney–client privilege.

Most of the case law indicates that a communication in connection with tax return preparation is not covered.  Under the argument accepted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, communication pertinent merely to preparing a tax return does not involve giving or receiving legal advice (see e.g., ''United States v. Gurtner'').&lt;ref&gt;474 F.2d 297 (9th Cir. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, meanwhile, has held that tax returns are not privileged. This holding is based on the rationale that tax returns are intended for disclosure to a third party, i.e., the Internal Revenue Service, so there can be no expectation of confidentiality,&lt;ref&gt;This use of the term "confidentiality" should not be confused with the rules regarding confidentiality of tax returns and tax return information held by the Internal Revenue Service or the practitioner, at {{usc|26|6103}}, {{usc|26|7213}}, {{usc|26|7213A}}, and {{usc|26|7216}}. The confidentiality protections in those rules do not render the communication "confidential" for purposes of the FATP privilege.&lt;/ref&gt; which defeats a claim that the return or pertinent communication is privileged.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Cote'', 456 F.2d 142 (8th Cir. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

One minority view finds the privilege might apply to a communication about what to claim on a return.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Abrahams'', 90-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,310 (9th Cir. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Another minority view is that such communications could be considered "legal" advice.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Colton v. United States'', 306 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1962); contrast with ''Gurtner'' above.&lt;/ref&gt;

On balance, however, the weight of authority is that communication in connection with tax return preparation is probably not protected by the privilege.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

''' Agricultural marketing ''' is inferred to cover the services involved in moving an [[agricultural]] product from the [[farm]] to the [[consumer]]. It is also the planning, organizing, directing and handling of agricultural produce in such a way as to satisfy the farmer, producer and the consumer. Numerous interconnected activities are involved in doing this, such as planning production, growing and [[harvesting]], [[Food grading|grading]], [[Food packaging|packing and packaging]], transport, [[Food storage|storage]], agro- and [[food processing]], [[Food distribution|distribution]], [[advertising]] and sale. Effectively, the term encompasses the entire range of supply chain operations. However, its key function is to help direct these services, by providing competent and able market information, thereby linking the other operations into an integrated service with targeted outcomes.

==Agricultural marketing development==
[[File:Adjamemarche2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Congestion at a market in [[Abidjan]]]]
[[Image:Mercado de Xipamanine Maputo Moçambique.png|thumb|right|250px|A typical market in Africa]]
Efforts to develop agricultural marketing have, particularly in developing countries, tended to concentrate on a number of areas, specifically infrastructure development; information provision; training of farmers and traders in marketing and post-harvest issues; and support to the development of an appropriate policy environment. In the past, efforts were made to develop government-run marketing bodies but these have tended to become less prominent over the years.&lt;ref name="AbbottNations1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=John Cave|author2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Marketing Improvement in the Developing World: What Happens and what We Have Learned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-1I-W3lvIsC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1986|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=978-92-5-101427-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural Market infrastructure===
Efficient marketing infrastructure such as [[wholesale marketing|wholesale]], retail and assembly markets and [[Warehouse|storage]] facilities is essential for cost-effective marketing, to minimize [[post-harvest handling|post-harvest losses]] and to reduce health risks. Markets play an important role in [[rural development]], income generation, [[food security]], and developing rural-market linkages. Experience shows that planners need to be aware of how to design markets that meet a community's social and economic needs and how to choose a suitable site for a new market. In many cases sites are chosen that are inappropriate and result in under-use or even no use of the infrastructure constructed. It is also not sufficient just to build a market: attention needs to be paid to how that market will be managed, operated and maintained.&lt;ref name="Tracey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4851e.HTM|title=Planning and Designing Rural Markets|author=Tracey-White, John|date=2003|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ags/publications/AGSF_WD_24.pdf|title=A guide to upgrading rural agricultural retail markets|author=Marocchino, Cecilia|date=2009|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural assembly markets are located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent.&lt;ref name = "Tracey"/&gt; Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracey-White John | title= Wholesale markets: Planning and Design Manual|url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0521e/t0521e00.htm |publisher=FAO|location= Rome| accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of [[wholesale market]]s have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity. These changes may require responses in the way in which traditional wholesale markets are organized and managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Reardon T. | author2= Timmer P.|author3= Berdegue J.|title= The Rapid Rise of Supermarkets in Developing Countries: Induced Organizational, Institutional, and Technological Change in Agrifood Systems|url= https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6557502.pdf|publisher=electronic Journal of Agricultural and Development Economics|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail marketing systems in western countries have broadly evolved from traditional street markets through to the modern hypermarket or out-of-town shopping center. In developing countries, there remains scope to improve agricultural marketing by constructing new retail markets, despite the growth of supermarkets, although municipalities often view markets primarily as sources of revenue rather than infrastructure requiring development. Effective regulation of markets is essential. Inside a market, both hygiene rules and revenue collection activities have to be enforced. Of equal importance, however, is the maintenance of order outside the market. Licensed traders in a market will not be willing to cooperate in raising standards if they face competition from unlicensed operators outside who do not pay any of the costs involved in providing a proper service.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey-White, J. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V8390E/V8390E00.htm] Retail markets planning guide. FAO, Rome, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market information===
{{Main|Marketing information system}}
Efficient [[Market Information Systems|market information]] can be shown to have positive benefits for farmers and traders. Up-to-date information on prices and other market factors enables farmers to negotiate with traders and also facilitates spatial distribution of products from rural areas to towns and between markets.&lt;ref&gt;Aparajita Goyal  [http://www.aeaweb.org/issue.php?journal=APP&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=3], Information, Direct Access to Farmers, and Rural Market Performance in Central India, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Most governments in developing countries have tried to provide [[Market Information Systems|market information services]] to farmers, but these have tended to experience problems of sustainability. Moreover, even when they function, the service provided is often insufficient to allow commercial decisions to be made because of time lags between data collection and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/X6993E/], Market information services – Theory and Practice. FAO, Rome, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern communications technologies open up the possibility for market information services to improve information delivery through [[Short message service|SMS]] on cell phones and the rapid growth of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stations in many developing countries offers the possibility of more localised information services. In the longer run, the internet may become an effective way of delivering information to farmers. However, problems associated with the cost and accuracy of data collection still remain to be addressed. Even when they have access to market information, farmers often require assistance in interpreting that information. For example, the market price quoted on the radio may refer to a wholesale selling price and farmers may have difficulty in translating this into a realistic price at their local assembly market.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf], Understanding and Using Market Information. FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts have been made in developing countries to introduce commercial market information services but these have largely been targeted at traders, commercial farmers or exporters. It is not easy to see how small, poor farmers can generate sufficient income for a commercial service to be profitable although in India a new service introduced by [[Thomson Reuters]] was reportedly used by over 100,000 farmers in its first year of operation. [[Esoko]] in West Africa attempts to subsidize the cost of such services to farmers by charging access to a more advanced feature set of mobile-based tools to businesses.

===Marketing training===
Farmers frequently consider marketing as being their major problem. However, while they are able to identify such problems as poor prices, lack of transport and high post-harvest losses, they are often poorly equipped to identify potential solutions. Successful marketing requires learning new skills, new techniques and new ways of obtaining information. Extension officers working with ministries of agriculture or NGOs are often well-trained in agricultural production techniques but usually lack knowledge of marketing or post-harvest handling.&lt;ref&gt;Grahame Dixie [https://www.share4dev.info/ffsnet/documents/3628.pdf] Horticultural Marketing, Marketing Extension Guide 5, FAO, Rome, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enabling environments===
Agricultural marketing needs to be conducted within a supportive policy, legal, institutional, [[macroeconomics|macro-economic]], infrastructural and bureaucratic environment. Traders and others are generally reluctant to make investments in an uncertain policy climate, such as those that restrict imports and exports or internal produce movement. Businesses have difficulty functioning when their trading activities are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Inappropriate law can distort and reduce the efficiency of the market, increase the costs of doing business and retard the development of a competitive private sector. Poor support institutions, such as [[agricultural extension]] services, [[municipality|municipalities]] that operate markets inefficiently and inadequate export promotion bodies, can be particularly damaging. Poor roads increase the cost of doing business, reduce payments to farmers and increase prices to consumers. Finally, [[Political corruption|corruption]] can increase the transaction costs faced by those in the marketing chain.

===Agricultural marketing support===
Most governments have at some stage made efforts to promote agricultural marketing improvements. In the United States the [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (AMS) is a division of [[USDA]] and has programs that provide testing, support standardization and grading and offer market news services. AMS oversees marketing agreements and orders research and promotion programs. It also purchases commodities for federal food programs. USDA also provides support to agricultural marketing work at various universities. In the United Kingdom, support for marketing of some commodities was provided before and after the Second World War by boards such as the [[Milk Marketing Board]] and the [[Egg Marketing Board]]. These boards were closed down in the 1970s. As a colonial power, Britain established [[marketing board]]s in many countries, particularly in Africa. Some continue to exist although many were closed at the time of the introduction of [[structural adjustment]] measures in the 1990s.

Several developing countries have established government-sponsored marketing or agribusiness units. South Africa, for example, started the [http://www.namc.co.za/ National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC)] as a response to the deregulation of the agriculture industry and closure of marketing boards in the country. India has the long-established [[National Institute of Agricultural Marketing]]. These are primarily research and policy organizations, but other agencies provide facilitating services for marketing channels, such as the provision of infrastructure, market information and documentation support. Examples from the Caribbean include the [http://www.namdevco.com/ National Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO)] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [http://www.newgmc.com/ New Guyana Marketing Corporation] in [[Guyana]].

===Recent developments===
New marketing linkages between [[agribusiness]], large retailers and farmers are gradually being developed, e.g. through [[contract farming]], group marketing and other forms of [[collective action]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Markelova and Ruth Meinzen-Dick {{cite web|url=http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716224158/http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-16 |df= }} Collective action and market access for smallholders: A summary of findings.

More attention is now being paid to the development of regional markets (e.g. East Africa) and to structured trading systems that should facilitate such developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CTA and EAGC|title=Structured grain trading systems in Africa|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of [[supermarkets]], particularly in Latin America and East and South East Asia, is having a significant impact on marketing channels for horticultural, dairy and livestock products.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, T., C.P. Timmer, C.B. Barrett, J. Berdegue. “The Rise of Supermarkets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 85 (5), December 2003: 1140-1146.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, “spot” markets will continue to be important for many years, necessitating attention to infrastructure improvement such as for retail and [[wholesale marketing|wholesale markets]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10447">[[File:Loening_S-1.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Loening Model 23|Loening S-1 ''Flying Yacht'']]]]
An '''air yacht''' is a private aircraft, usually a [[:en:flying boat|flying boat]]. They developed [[:en:interwar period|between the wars]] as a recreation and status symbol for rich businessmen.

The first aviation of this form developed immediately before [[World War I]], when 'sporting' gentlemen, i.e. those both rich and with ample leisure time, could indulge in private flying. For the first time this regarded flight as a means of safe and reliable transport, not merely an achievement in itself. Right from the outset, the speed of flight and its ability to make long distances manageable was recognised as an advantage. The idea of seasonal commuting between [[New York City|New York]] and [[Florida]], previously done by train, was one goal.&lt;ref name="NYT, 1915" /&gt;

All aspects of aviation were spurred by World War I and there were many technical developments, particularly for [[aircraft engine|engine]] reliability and the construction of larger, more robust aircraft, including [[seaplane]]s. Despite this, the time immediately after World War I was a recession in the aircraft industry, as the surplus market was flooded by ex-military machines and engines. Manufacturers sought any available market they could, including building a handful of specialised aircraft for the very rich. In a more buoyant climate, this minority market might have been less attractive.

A typical air yacht of the early 1920s was the [[Kirkham Air Yacht]], built to the order of [[:en:Harold Stirling Vanderbilt|Harold Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref name="Flight, 1925" /&gt; Vanderbilt intended it for transport between his business offices in New York and the family estate at [[:en:Newport, Rhode Island#Gilded Age|Newport, Rhode Island]]. Like the contemporary [[Loening Model 23|Loening Flying Yacht]], it included an enclosed passenger cabin for four with an open pilot's cockpit ahead. Both were of the most modern construction, as [[:en:monoplane|monoplane]]s with [[duralumin]] [[:en:stressed skin|stressed-skin construction]].&lt;ref name="Flight, 1925" /&gt; A difference was that the Loening used a war-surplus [[:en:Liberty L-12|Liberty engine]] whilst the Kirkham had the latest, and more powerful, British [[:en:Napier Lion|Napier Lion]].&lt;ref name="Flight, 1925" /&gt; Both were flying boats, able to land on any expanse of open water, which was available to the rich at both New York and their seaside country homes. The journey to Newport could be made in around two hours, three times faster than by train and still twice as fast as the journey by car today. As public airfields developed in this decade, later aircraft became [[:en:amphibious aircraft|amphibian]]s, making them more flexible about their destinations.

In 1927, Vanderbilt's Kirkham was destroyed in a [[hangar]] fire{{efn-lr|name=fire|Reports of the hangar fire are conflicting and it is not clear if there was one fire, which aircraft was involved, or two. Many reports claim that the Kirkham burned in a fire and was replaced by the Fokker B.IIIc because this was available quickly.&lt;ref name="Fokker B.3" /&gt;}} and he replaced it with a larger, six-seater Fokker. First the [[Fokker B.IIIC]] registered as NC149,.{{efn-lr|later NC3996}}&lt;ref name="Fokker B.3" /&gt; This design had been developed by Fokker as the B.3 military patrol aircraft, but failed to sell to the [[:en:Netherlands Naval Aviation Service|Dutch Navy]] and so had been converted with a passenger cabin and shipped to the US, meaning it was available to Vanderbilt at short notice. A crash in March 1928, or possibly a further hangar fire,{{efn-lr|name=fire}} destroyed Vanderbilt's Fokker and this was replaced by NC7887, an example of Fokker's new [[:en:Fokker F.11|F.11]] design. This was an [[:en:amphibious aircraft|amphibian]] design, making it much more flexible for travel inland. Flight in this 'Golden Age' period of aviation was developing rapidly in the US, and better airfield facilities were becoming available throughout the country.

Even after the start of the Great Depression, these very-rich pilots were little affected and continued to order larger and larger custom-designed aircraft. Commercial land-based aircraft were also developing and many new owners, affluent but not super-rich, could afford a production-line aircraft when they could not afford a custom design. 'Production' in this pre-war era often meant only a handful of aircraft.

Air yachts were owned by rich businessmen and were also found to be useful for purely business travel.&lt;ref name="Pacific Trends, 1932" /&gt; These were mostly landplanes by now, rather than seaplanes. Belgian financier [[:en:Alfred Loewenstein|Alfred Loewenstein]] used a [[:en:Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VII]] Trimotor for this purpose, but fell to his death from it in 1928. In time they gave rise to the wider use of [[:en:executive aircraft|executive aircraft]].&lt;ref name="Wisc MoH, 1983" /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Akio Morita'''|盛田 昭夫|Morita Akio|January 26, 1921 – October 3, 1999}} was a Japanese businessman and co-founder of [[Sony]] along with [[Masaru Ibuka]].

==Early life==
Akio Morita was born in [[Nagoya|Nagoya, Aichi]], Japan. Morita's family was involved in [[sake]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]] production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname City]]) on the western coast of [[Chita Peninsula]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]] since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from [[Osaka University|Osaka Imperial University]] with a degree in physics. He was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and served in [[World War II]]. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.

==Sony==
On May 7, 1946, Ibuka founded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199801/ibuka-e.html|title=Sony Global - Press Release - Masaru Ibuka 1908-1997|website=www.sony.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha'' (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, the forerunner of Sony Corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of ¥190,000. Ibuka was 38 years old. Morita, 25 years old joined ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha'' shortly after its inception, with Morita's family investing in Sony during the early period and being the largest shareholder.

In 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first [[tape recorder]] in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully [[transistor]]ized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from "sonus"—–[[Latin]] for "sound"—–and ''Sonny-boys'' the most common American expression).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Akio_Morita |title=Akio Morita |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morita was an advocate for all the products made by [[Sony]]. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a "pocket sized" appearance. In 1960, it produced the first [[transistor]] television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an [[Emmy Award]] for its [[Trinitron]] television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first [[Betamax]] home video recorder, a year before [[VHS]] format came out. In 1979, the [[Walkman]] was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players. In 1984, Sony launched the [[Discman]] series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.

In 1960, the Sony Corporation of America (SONAM, currently abbreviated as SCA) was established in the United States. In 1961, Sony Corporation was the first Japanese company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], in the form of [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs), which are traded over-the-counter. Sony bought CBS Records Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-19/business/fi-22750_1_cbs-records | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Paul | last1=Richter | first2=WILLIAM K. | last2=KNOEDELSEDER Jr | title=Sony Buys CBS Record Division for $2 Billion After Months of Talks | date=November 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of [[Columbia Records]], [[Epic Records]] and other CBS labels in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment ([[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]] and others) in 1989.

On November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while playing tennis. He was succeeded by [[Norio Ohga]], who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.

==Other affiliations==
Morita was vice chairman of the [[Japan Business Federation]] ([[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]]), and was a member of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, also known as the "Wise Men's Group". He was also the third Japanese chairman of the [[Trilateral Commission]]. His amateur radio call sign is JP1DPJ.

==Publications==
In 1966, Morita wrote a book called ''Gakureki Muyō Ron'' (学歴無用論, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled ''[[Made in Japan (biography)|Made in Japan]]''. He co-authored the 1991 book ''[[The Japan That Can Say No]]'' with politician [[Shintaro Ishihara]], where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. (Actually, Morita had no intention to criticize American practices at that time.) The book was translated into English and caused controversy in the United States, and Morita later had his chapters removed from the English version and distanced himself from the book.&lt;ref&gt;City Mayors [http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/tokyo_mayor.html Shintaro Ishihara Governor of Tokyo 7 September 2012] Retrieved on September 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Morita was awarded the [[Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Albert Medal]] by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious [[Legion of Honour]], and in 1991, was awarded the First Class [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] from the [[Akihito|Emperor of Japan]]. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|British knighthood (KBE)]]. Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1987. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1999.

==Death==
Morita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. On November 25, 1994, he stepped down as Sony chairman. On October 3, 1999, Morita died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 78.

It is the second installment in the [[Atlas Shrugged (film series)|''Atlas Shrugged'' film series]] and the first [[sequel]] to the 2011 film ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part I]]'', continuing the story where its predecessor left off.&lt;ref name=LA20120202&gt;{{cite web |title='Atlas Shrugged Part 2' to start production in April |first=Rebecca |last=Keegan |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=February 2, 2012 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/02/atlas-shrugged-part-2-shooting-april.html |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on October 12, 2012.

==Plot==
[[Dagny Taggart]] pilots an airplane in pursuit of another plane. Dagny asks herself, "Who is [[John Galt]]?" before apparently crashing into a mountainside.

Nine months earlier, Dagny is trying to understand the abandoned prototype of an advanced motor she and her lover [[Hank Rearden]] have found. Scientists across the country have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances, but Dagny is able to locate Quentin Daniels, who agrees to help from an abandoned laboratory in [[Utah]].

Dagny's brother [[James Taggart (Atlas Shrugged)|James Taggart]], president of the family [[railroad]] company, meets store clerk Cherryl Brooks and brings her to see a renowned pianist, who disappears during his performance, leaving a note asking, "Who is John Galt?" Later, at James and Cherryl's wedding, Dagny's friend [[Francisco d'Anconia]] argues with other guests about whether money is evil, and secretly informs Rearden about devastating explosions at his [[Copper extraction|copper mine]]—the next day. Rearden spends the night with Dagny. Later, he is confronted about the affair by his wife Lillian, but when he offers a divorce she declines, in order to maintain her position in society.

Rearden sells his advanced Rearden Metal to Ken Danagger's [[coal mining]] company, but refuses to sell it to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], in defiance of the newly enacted "Fair Share" law that forces businesses to sell to all buyers. The two are charged under the law. Dagny barges into Danagger's office, realizes that he too is about to disappear, and understands that she is close to understanding the force behind the disappearances. At trial, Rearden defends [[Individualism|individual freedom]] and the pursuit of profit, and is given only a token penalty by the court, which fears turning him into a martyr. The government announces "Directive 10-289", which freezes employment and production and requires that all patents be gifted to the government. Rearden defies this decree as well, but relents when he is blackmailed with photos of himself and Dagny that would damage Dagny's reputation.

When Dagny hears about Rearden's "gift" and her brother's complicity, she quits the railroad. During her absence, a Taggart Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel, due largely to political pressure by a passenger and human error by Dagny's poorly trained replacement. This impels Dagny back to her job. D'Anconia tries to dissuade her from returning, as he had earlier tried to talk Rearden into leaving his business, but she returns anyway.

Dagny takes a train to [[Colorado]] to show her faith in the railway, but its engine fails. The repair technician used to work for 20th Century Motor Company, which produced the motor Dagny found. He tells Dagny how the [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|need-based]] reward system in his company failed, and his coworker John Galt left the company vowing to "stop the motor of the world." Dagny calls Daniels, who tells her that he is quitting. Dagny buys a small airplane and flies to [[Utah]] to try to dissuade him, but as she is landing, she sees him get into a plane on the airstrip.

After a pursuit in the air—the opening scene of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by [[stealth technology]]. A wounded Dagny Taggart crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt.

==Production==
The producers intended to finance ''Part II'' using profits from ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part I]]''. When that film failed to generate a profit, a private debt sale in early 2012 raised $16 million of the $25 million the producers sought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Atlas Shrugged: Part 2' movie funded |first=Peter |last=Key |work=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]] |date=February 6, 2012 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/peter-key/2012/02/atlas-shrugged-part-2-movie-on-the-way.html |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling a budget larger than that of the first film. There is some confusion about the relative size of the budget for the first two movies. The part 2 production budget was around $10 million and the marketing budget around $10 million, between 2010 and 2012. During the first movie a total of less than $20 million were spent over the course of the preceding 18 years. Hence, more was spent directly on producing the 2nd movie. The production company announced that Part 2 would be released to coincide with the U.S. general election season in fall 2012.&lt;ref name="LA20120202" /&gt;

Duncan Scott, who in 1986 was responsible for creating a new, re-edited version of the [[We the Living (film)|1942 Italian film adaptation]] of Ayn Rand's novel ''[[We the Living]]'' with English subtitles, joined the production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Bond |title='Atlas Shrugged Part 2' Timed to Hit Screens Just Before Presidential Election (Video) |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-part-2-prduction-april-286633 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the production company for the second film, Either Or Productions, LLC, is taken from the title Rand gave to the middle section of her novel. An April press release stated the name of the film as ''Atlas Shrugged, Part 2: Either Or.''&lt;ref name="atlas20120402" /&gt;

[[Principal photography]] began on April 2, 2012 with an all-new cast, including [[Samantha Mathis]] as the heroine [[Dagny Taggart]], [[Jason Beghe]] as the industrialist [[Henry Rearden]], and [[Esai Morales]] as the playboy [[Francisco d'Anconia]].&lt;ref name="atlas20120402"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=DeSapio |url= http://blog.atlasshruggedmovie.com/2012/04/atlas-shrugged-part-2-begins-principal.html |title=Atlas Shrugged Part 2 Begins Principal Photography |publisher=Official Atlas Shrugged Movie Blog |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer John Aglialoro has implied that hiring the cast of Part I for the sequel exceeded the movie's budget, saying "it's hard to lock people down", and also noting that [[Taylor Schilling]], the actress who played Dagny in Part I, is "a bona fide movie star now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 53 Percent Shrugged |last=Weigel |first=David |authorlink=David Weigel |date=September 20, 2012 |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/creators_of_the_new_atlas_shrugged_ii_film_believe_it_speaks_to_mitt_romney_s_critique_of_47_percent_of_americans_.2.html |work=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report before the film was released, the film was to be on a 31-day shooting schedule, four days more than that of the first movie, and to undergo two months of post-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= On the Set of Atlas Shrugged Part II |url= http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/20/on-the-set-of-atlas-shrugged-part-ii |publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' |first= Brian |last= Doherty |authorlink= Brian Doherty (journalist) |date= April 20, 2012 |accessdate= April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' was not [[film screening|screen]]ed for critics before its release, with producer John Aglialoro questioning "the integrity of the critics".&lt;ref name="FNC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/12/atlas-shrugged-part-ii-kept-from-mainstream-movie-critics-but-public-interest/ |title='Atlas Shrugged: Part II' kept from mainstream movie critics, but public interest remains high |last=McKay |first=Hollie |date=October 12, 2012 |work=[[FoxNews.com]] |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was screened for the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] think-tank [[The Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

===Box office===

''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' opened on 1,012 screens and earned [[USD|$]]692,000 on its premiere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/363039/atlas-shrugged-part-2-falters-at-the-north-american-box-office/ |title=‘Atlas Shrugged Part 2′ Falters At The North American Box Office |publisher=''The Inquisitr'' |date=October 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $1.7 million its opening weekend, debuting at #11. Despite opening on more than three times the screens of ''Part I'', it did not significantly improve on ''Part I'''s opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2012&amp;wknd=40 |title=Weekend Box Office Results for October 5-7, 2012 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82399.html?hp=r7 |title=The box office shrugs at 'Atlas' |first=Patrick |last=Gavin |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.altfg.com/blog/movie/atlas-shrugged-part-2-box-office-samantha-mathis/ |first=Zac |last=Gille |title=One of Worst Opening Weekends Ever at Domestic Box Office: ''Atlas Shrugged Part 2 |publisher=Alt Film Guie |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The box office take totaled $3,286,255 through November 4, 2012, the last date for which the producers released numbers. When adjusted for inflation, the film had one of the two hundred least profitable wide openings of the past thirty years, followed by one of the two hundred largest week-over-week drops recorded for the same period. By the third week of release it was down to under 150 screens, taking in under $100,000 on its third weekend.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 4% based on reviews from 23 professional critics, with an average score of 3/10, and the site's consensus is: "Poorly written, clumsily filmed and edited, and hampered by amateurish acting, ''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' does no favors to the ideology it so fervently champions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_part_ii/ |title= Atlas Shrugged: Part II (2012) |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 26 based on 11 reviews, which is interpreted as "Generally unfavorable" by Metacritic.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlas Shrugged Part 2 |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/atlas-shrugged-part-2 |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]]| work = [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics were not impressed with the film based on several reviews: reviewer Danny Baldwin gave the film a "D" rating;&lt;ref name="CS-20121012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Danny |title=Review: "Atlas Shrugged: Part II – The Strike" |url=http://www.criticspeak.com/review-atlas-shrugged-part-ii/ |date=October 12, 2012 |publisher=''CriticSpeak'' |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Post]]'''s Kyle Smith gave the film a "1" rating (of 4), saying "...even if you overlooked the production values from a 1986 porno and special effects like something your nephew cooked up on his Mac, the movie's "Yay, money!" zingers are just a big bag of sad."&lt;ref name="NYPost-20121012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kyle |title=Saw the film &amp; shrugged |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/saw_the_film_shrugged_fJIj4XwcW2XB6eW0TScgRI |date=October 12, 2012 |publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' |accessdate=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias of [[The A.V.

Economics columnist John Tamny of [[Forbes.com]] gave the film a positive review and argued that it is "a must see because it in a very handsome way describes the world in which we live today whereby the achievers are being shackled by the moochers."'''''&lt;ref name="JTF"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2012/10/07/movie-review-why-atlas-shrugged-part-ii-is-a-must-see-film/ |title=Why Atlas Shrugged, Part II Is a Must See Film |last=Tamny |first=John |date=October 7, 2012 |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''''

He is a major shareholder in [[Time Warner]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnnie L.

==Early life==
Nevo was born in [[Bucharest]] in [[Communist Romania]] and then moved to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] as an infant with his parents.&lt;ref name="times2008"/&gt; His father, a chemical engineer and his mother, an [[anesthesiologist]], eventually divorced. Nevo is an only child. He is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/celebrities/chinese-women-western-men-celebrity-couples/ | title=Chinese Women Western Men Celebrity Couples | publisher=Love Love China | accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Stan Berk]], a former [[hedge fund]] manager who hired Nevo in the 1980s after they met at a Los Angeles gym, said Nevo worked for him from 1985 to 1988, and then "just disappeared." After a certain time period, they met again, and "Nevo had befriended billionaires and media titans.&lt;ref name="thewrap"&gt;{{cite web | last=Waxman | first=Sharon | title=Vivi Nevo Revealed: 'Attention of a Hummingbird on Crack' | website=TheWrap | date=July 21, 2010 | url=https://www.thewrap.com/vivi-nevo-revealed-attention-hummingbird-19443/ | access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an anonymous business associate of Nevo, with an inheritance of around $10 million, Nevo set about investing and networking. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Nevo "opened trading accounts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as Allen &amp; Co., which eventually won him an invitation to Sun Valley... Through diligence and hard work, the right contacts and a lot of the right trades during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, he turned his inheritance into a sizable fortune ... Later on, Nevo began sprinkling money around in private companies, many of which were new media ventures."&lt;ref name="times2008"&gt;{{cite web | last=Arango | first=Tim | title=Behind the scenes, a force in the media world | website=The New York Times | date=July 27, 2008 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/technology/27iht-27viviNEW.14814862.html | access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In July 2008 Nevo said that long-running rumors of an [[engagement]] to [[Chinese people|Chinese]] actress [[Zhang Ziyi]] were true.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/crouching-tiger-actor-zhang-ziyi-says-yes-to-boyfriends-drone-proposal-20150210-13ar1k.html 'Crouching Tiger' actor Zhang Ziyi says yes to boyfriend's drone proposal] Rachel Clun, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/10/vivi-nevo-201110|title=Veni, Vidi, Vivi|last=Ward|first=Vicky|work=The Hive|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caliper, A PerkinElmer Company'''  is based in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] with direct sales, service and application-support operations in countries around the globe.  Founded in 1995, Caliper
develops products and services to the life sciences research community, including [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] companies, and government and other not-for profit research institutions.

Caliper’s integrated systems, consisting of instruments, software and [[reagents]], [[laboratory automation]] tools and [[drug discovery]] assay services enable researchers to better understand the basis for disease and more effectively discover safe and effective drugs.  Caliper’s product portfolio includes,  [[microfluidics]], lab automation &amp; liquid handling, optical imaging technologies, and [[drug discovery]] &amp; [[drug development]] outsourcing solutions.

== Microfluidic platform ==
Caliper is a pioneer in [[microfluidic]] [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology which represents a significant advancement in laboratory experimentation, bringing the benefits of miniaturization, integration and automation to numerous research-based industries.  Caliper’s proprietary microfluidic sipper chips are a high-throughput complement to the planar chips which Caliper manufactures for the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.  The microfluidic technology forms the basis of Caliper’s LabChip EZ reader systems used for drug screening and profiling and the LabChip GX series for molecular biology [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein analysis]].

== Optical imaging ==
Through its acquisition of Xenogen Corporation in 2006, Caliper is now a developer of [[in vivo]] biophotonic imaging technology, which allows for real-time, non-invasive exploration of [[genes]], proteins, pathogens, and tumor cells in living animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Advancing bioluminescence imaging technology for the evaluation of anticancer agents in the MDA-MB-435-HAL-Luc mammary fat pad and subrenal capsule tumor models.| date=2009-01-01 | publisher=| pmid=19118051| doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0897| volume=15| issue=1| journal=Clin. Cancer Res.| pages=238–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caliper offers a complement of patented biophotonic and fluorescent imaging technologies, as well as genetically modified animal programs.  Caliper’s imaging product lines include a suite of IVIS imaging systems - many measuring both bioluminescence and fluorescence, ''in vivo'' imaging reagents, specialized light producing animal models, and genetic modification programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development. In a recent Japanese study, the IVIS imaging system was used to evaluate the binding affinity and RNA interference ([[RNAi]]) of LMWC/[[siRNA]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evaluation of the binding affinity and RNA interference of low-molecular-weight chitosan/siRNA complexes using an imaging system | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=| pmid=19337002 | volume=129 | issue=4 | journal=Yakugaku Zasshi | pages=475–84 | doi=10.1248/yakushi.129.475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lab automation and liquid handling ==
Caliper has held a long standing position in laboratory automation starting with the introduction of the world’s first lab robotic system, the Zymark Zymate.  To date, Caliper has a number of lab automation and liquid handling systems for the life sciences industry.  In January 2009, the Zephyr Genomics Workstation was introduced which promises to deliver a benchtop solution for automating routine but critical processes for [[molecular biology]] such as [[nucleic acid purification]], reaction setup and normalization.

In addition to automating molecular biology, Caliper has many other [[robotic]] systems including the Zephyr SPE and RapidTrace SPE workstations to automate [[solid phase extraction]] and several liquid handling and plate management systems including the Sciclone ALH 3000 liquid handler and Twister II systems to automate drug discovery and development.

Caliper also custom designs integrated vendor-neutral instruments and software such as the Twister II - LightCycler (Roche) integrated system which fully automates real-time [[PCR]].

== Discovery and development outsourcing solutions ==
Caliper’s Discovery Alliances &amp; Services division (CDAS) was created from the acquisitions of NovaScreen, a provider of [[in vitro]] &amp; [[in vivo]] discovery services.  CDAS develops, utilizes, and provides a comprehensive array of services to improve the productivity, accelerate the pace, and reduce the cost of the [[drug discovery]] process. The ''in vitro'' service arm of CDAS includes a comprehensive array of ''in vitro'' drug discovery and development solutions including more than 1000 screening [[assays]] that help define the mode of action, side effect profiles, selectivity, and other relevant activities of drug candidates. ''In vivo'' capabilities include:  non-invasive ''in vivo'' [[optical imaging]], OncoMouse studies, and ''in vivo'' compound evaluations for safety assessment and [[drug repositioning]].

== History ==
Caliper Life Sciences was founded in 1995 by [[Larry Bock]] and Drs. Michael Knapp, Michael Ramsey and Andreas Manz. as Caliper Technologies with a strong focus on microfluidics technology. In 2003, Caliper acquired Zymark a leader in laboratory automation and robotics and Caliper Life Sciences was born.  In October 2005, Caliper acquired NovaScreen Biosciences Corporation a privately held CRO offering pre-clinical drug discovery and development services.  NovaScreen’s services included ''in vitro'' compound profiling for safety assessment, drug discovery screening services for targets such as  GPCRs, Kinases, Ion Channels, Transporters, Nuclear Receptors and customized assay development services.  In August 2006, Caliper acquired Xenogen Corporation,  a developer of ''in vivo'' optical imaging systems (IVIS systems) and its division, Xenogen Biosciences a CRO offering ''in vivo'' transgenic animal production, phenotyping, gene targeting and ''in vivo'' optical imaging services.

== Intellectual property ==
Caliper's portfolio of microfluidics-related patents has been ranked as high as #2 in technological strength in the Biotech/Pharma sector of the MIT Technology Review Patent Scorecard. Caliper actively out-licenses this portfolio as part of its Caliper Driven program to broaden and accelerate the availability of new technologies and products for life science and diagnostics applications. Licensing Caliper's microfluidic intellectual property benefits existing and  potential partners by enhancing the strength of their product and service offerings through the incorporation of Caliper’s technology. Caliper also provides commercial and academic customers with proprietary methods via its Optical Imaging Patent Suite.  The notification of allowance of Caliper’s patent claims for conjugate fluorescence imaging methods from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has added yet another valuable component to Caliper's widespread intellectual property estate.

The '''Cambridge Science Park''',  founded by [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[[#BPGCSE]]&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest [[science park]] in the United Kingdom. It is a concentration of science and technology related businesses, and has strong links with the nearby [[University of Cambridge]].

The science park is situated about 3&amp;nbsp;km to the north of [[Cambridge]] city centre, by junction 33 of the [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14]], in the parish of [[Milton, Cambridgeshire|Milton]], contiguous with Cambridge itself. The park is served by [[Cambridge North railway station]] and by the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]. It is directly adjacent to [[St John's Innovation Centre]] and [[Cambridge Business Park]].

==History==

The land was originally given to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] when the latter was founded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1546. The land was used for farming until the [[Second World War]], when it was requisitioned by the [[US Army]] and used to prepare vehicles and tanks for [[D-Day]]. After the war, the land was left derelict until 1970, when, at the suggestion of [[Tony Cornell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Ghostbuster-who-had-the-spirit-to-persevere.htm|title=Ghostbuster who had the spirit to persevere|publisher=Cambridge Evening News|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=24 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322082346/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Ghostbuster-who-had-the-spirit-to-persevere.htm|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the supervision of [[John Bradfield (scientist)|Sir John Bradfield]], the college worked with Sir Francis Pemberton of [[Bidwells]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Great-man-Sir-Francis-dies-at-95-04112011.htm|title='Great man' Sir Francis dies at 95|publisher=Cambridge Evening News|date=6 November 2011|accessdate=21 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174558/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Great-man-Sir-Francis-dies-at-95-04112011.htm|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop it into a new centre for scientific enterprise and innovation.

In 2017, following decades of rapid expansion in Cambridge, the park appointed its first director and announced a large investment intended to improve facilities and reduce traffic congestion.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;

==Cambridge Fun Run==

The Cambridge Fun Run is a charity race for [[Children in Need]] organised and mainly entered by employees of businesses based in and around the Science Park.  It has been held each November since 1989.  Contestants compete in teams of four, some in fancy dress, running either one lap (as a group) or four laps (as a relay) of the {{convert|1.1|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} Science Park ring road. The race begins and ends, and medals and trophies are awarded (for fastest runners and best costumes) in front of the [http://www.Cambridge.Consultants.com Cambridge Consultants] building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camfunrun.org/about/ Cambridge Fun Run in aid of Children in Need] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121212919/http://www.camfunrun.org/about/ |date=21 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgefirst.co.uk/news/gallery_600_workers_pass_the_baton_for_children_in_need_1_1130867 GALLERY: 600 workers pass the baton for Children in Need] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120170730/http://www.cambridgefirst.co.uk/news/gallery_600_workers_pass_the_baton_for_children_in_need_1_1130867 |date=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Columbia Senior Executive Program''' ('''CSEP''') is awarded by [[Columbia Business School]] to students who complete a total of 26 consecutive program days of a specialized executive education course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/programs/detail/10407/Columbia+Senior+Executive+Program "CSEP Description"]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the length of the program, CSEP provides multiple sessions covering strategy, leadership, functional excellence and details of global business issues. Participants explore business cases, as well as crucial issues and perspectives through faculty interaction, individual coaching and collaboration with a selective group of peers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/programs/detail/10407/Columbia+Senior+Executive+Program "CSEP Program Agenda"]&lt;/ref&gt; The admission to CSEP and other advanced management programs for elite business schools is highly selective. In general, advanced management programs similar to CSEP limit class size to less than 50 students and schedule programs once or twice per year. Most often executives who attend are sent to the program by management or company boards because they are being groomed for a promotion or new position, many times to the C suite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122245005298479309 WSJ Article: "It’s Intense at the Top”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients of the CSEP designation are granted select alumni status with [[Columbia Business School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/connected/article/481114/A+Conversation+with+Keith+Sanders:+On+Earning+Alumni+Status/ |title=Columbia Business School |access-date=2010-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213160525/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/connected/article/481114/A+Conversation+with+Keith+Sanders:+On+Earning+Alumni+Status/ |archive-date=2012-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer aided call handling''' is a methodology for managing calls to service providers, such as emergency services, through the use of computer based algorithms in order to make consistent and objective decisions on action to be taken.  The computer software can provide scripting, prompts or interactive questioning to assist the call handler in gathering information.

The algorithms in the software will depend on the requirements of the service provider, the resources they have available, and the information that may be useful to resources dispatched or assigned to the call.  The output is likely to be a prioritised list of tasks for action, where the action could be passing to another remote service (such as a telephony centre), dispatching a physical resource (such as an [[ambulance]], [[police car]] or recovery truck) or closing the call without action.  The advantage in using a computer based system is objectivity in decisions made, meaning a consistent service delivery.

Call handling software can be linked to [[computer aided dispatch]] in order that this process is fully integrated, and information from the call handling software is passed directly to dispatch software where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7646858.html Protocol builder for a call handling system]&lt;/ref&gt;  This could also mean dispatching services which are not part of the organisation using the call handling software, such as an ambulance control centre automatically dispatching police to a violent incident, without the requirement to involve a further operator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerphone.com/dev/news/pdf/PowerPhone_ENP_CACH_Article.pdf Computer-Aided Call Handling: Improving Technology at the Front End of Dispatch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715111233/http://www.powerphone.com/dev/news/pdf/PowerPhone_ENP_CACH_Article.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">'''Cornelis Lievense''' (1890 – September 22, 1949) was a [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] businessman who ran several import/export companies in the United States from the 1920s through the 1940s.

Lievense was born in [[Maassluis]], The [[Netherlands]], and came to the United States in 1924. During his career in the United States, Lievense was the President or director of a number of import/export companies and banks, most notably the [[Union Banking Corporation]], whose assets were seized by the United States government in 1942 under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]] and the [[Domestic Fuel Corporation]], which was blacklisted by the Canadian government in 1940 for similar suspicions.&lt;ref&gt;for details, including primary references, see the [[Union Banking Corporation]] article&lt;/ref&gt;

Lievense died at his home in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], on September 22, 1949 at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/09/24/86785025.pdf "Cornelis Lievense"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 24, 1949. Accessed November 17, 2017."Ridgewood, N.

'''Data Discovery and Query Builder''' (DDQB) is a data abstraction technology, developed by [[IBM]], that allows users to retrieve information from a data warehouse, in terms of the user's specific area of expertise instead of SQL.

DDQB serves the user through a web based graphical user interface and configurable data abstraction model (DAM), which contains both an understanding of the user knowledge domain and the database below it.

DDQB uses a set of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based customization tooling and can be deployed as a set of [[Web Services]].

Boudewyns, where [[stressor]]s are vividly and safely confronted to help combat [[veteran]]s, and patients suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[panic disorder]], or [[phobia]]s. [[Exposure therapy]] has supporting evidence with both simple and complex traumas.&lt;ref&gt;Baschnagel, J.S., Coffey, S.F., and  Rash, C.J. (2006).

It was reported in 2015 that Chappell, with the backing of investors, became the 90% owner of [[Retail Acquisitions]], the firm that acquired [[British Home Stores]] (BHS) from [[Sir Philip Green]] for £1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neilan |first=Catherine |url=http://www.cityam.com/211443/here-everything-we-know-about-new-owners-bhs-retail-acquisitions-and-what-it-planning |title=Here is everything we know about BHS' new owner Retail Acquisitions, and what it is planning for the department store|work=[[City A.M.]]|location=London |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Butler |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/13/bhs-sale-store-that-failed-to-battle-it-out-on-high-street |title=BHS sale: the store that failed to battle it out on the high street |work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2015-03-12/struggling-bhs-sold-to-consortium-for-1/ |title=Struggling BHS sold to consortium for £1 |work=[[ITV News]]|location=London |date=12 March 2015|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It subsequently transpired that instead of injecting new capital into the cash-strapped company as agreed with Arcadia, Chappell extracted £1,789,250 within three months of acquiring control of BHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/business-innovation-and-skills/Correspondence/2015-20-Parliament/Olswang-to-Pensions-Regulator-1-June-2015.pdf|title=Work and Pensions Committee BHS inquiry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13-month period he controlled BHS, Chappell by his own admission, extracted a total of £2,627,643 from BHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/work-and-pensions/Correspondence/Dominic-Chappell-to-BIS-and-Work-and-Pensions-Committees-10-June-2016.pdf  |title=Work and Pensions Committee BHS inquiry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2016, it was reported that when it became likely that BHS would be going into receivership Chappell had moved £1.5&amp;nbsp;million from the firm to a company owned by a friend who was also a fellow board member of Retail Acquisitions. The sum had been later refunded at the request of BHS' chief executive Darren Topp (less £50,000 bank transaction fees).&lt;ref name="BBC News 26 April 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Jack |first= Simon |title= BHS owner tried to move cash out of firm |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36146161| date= 26 April 2016| publisher= [[BBC News]] | accessdate=27 April 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just days after putting BHS into liquidation, and with its £571m pension deficit absorbed by the UK government's [[Pension Protection Fund]], Chappell was said to be considering re-purchasing some parts of the firm.&lt;ref name="City A.M. 27 April 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Neilan |first= Catherine |title= Blame game kicks off following BHS failure |url= http://www.cityam.com/239888/blame-game-kicks-off-following-bhs-failure-| date= 27 April 2016|newspaper= [[City A.M.]] |location=London| accessdate=27 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on this development, the BBC's Business editor [[Simon Jack]] noted: "Sources at BHS treated the announcement with bewilderment. Other very senior retail sources used more colourful language. His credibility has taken a very serious knock. The details that have emerged about Dominic Chappell and his fellow directors' extraction of millions in professional fees has attracted widespread criticism".&lt;ref name="BBC News 27 April 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last= Jack |first= Simon |title= Is Dominic Chappell's BHS bid serious?|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36153514| date= 27 April 2016| publisher= [[BBC News]] | accessdate= 27 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2016, another Chappell owned company, Swiss Rock plc was put into liquidation.   The Statement of Affairs included unpaid VAT debts of £365,000 and outstanding Corporation Tax of £197,306.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 05 September 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Ruddick |first= Graham |title= HMRC begins legal battle with Dominic Chappell over tax |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/23/ex-bhs-boss-dominic-chappell-ordered-to-pay-87000-in-pensions-case | date= 5 September 2016| work= [[The Guardian]] | accessdate= 5 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail Acquisitions Limited, the company used by Chappell to take over BHS in 2015 was wound up by the High Court of Justice on 3 May 2017 on the petition of BHS owed £6.1M in respect of an unpaid loan &lt;ref name="The Gazette 23 May 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title= Official Public Record | url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2787117 | date= 23 May 2017 | work= [[The London Gazette]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chappell had previously disclosed that Retail Acquisitions Limited had paid £1.5M to settle a mortgage debt secured on his parents’ home.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 29 April 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Ruddick |first= Graham |title= BHS collapse: more details emerge on Retail Acquisitions' loans |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/29/bhs-collapse-dominic-chappell-could-be-forced-to-repay-millions| date= 29 April 2016| work= [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Chappell was found guilty of three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents to The Pensions Regulator at Brighton Magistrates’ Court on 11 January 2018 and ordered to pay a fine of £50,000 and £37,000 court costs.  Chappell said he could not pay because he had “no funds”, and claimed he had extensive outgoings, of almost £9,000 per month made up of: £3,800 a month rent on a Dorset mansion; £2,666 a month leasing a 2017-plate Range Rover; and £2,500 a month school fees for his two children, aged eight and 12, on which he was in arrears. &lt;ref name="The Guardian 23 February 2018"&gt;{{cite news |title= Ex-BHS boss Dominic Chappell ordered to pay £87,000 in pensions case |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/hmrc-dominic-chappell-tax-high-court-petition-bhs-swiss-rock| date= 23 February 2018| work= [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappell is currently appealing the sentence which is due to be heard in September 2018

On 27 March 2018 the UK Insolvency Service announced that intends to ban Chappell, and three other former BHS directors, from serving as company directors for up to 15 years, following its investigation into the collapse of BHS under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. &lt;ref name="The Independent 23 March 2018"&gt;{{cite news | last= Morrison |first= Caitlan|title= Ex-BHS owner Dominic Chappell banned from running companies for 15 years |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ex-bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-banned-philip-green-collapse-retailer-a8276031.html | date= 23 March 2018| work= [[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Francis "Ed" Boyd''' (June 27, 1914 &amp;ndash; April 30, 2007) was an American business executive who was responsible for the marketing of products specifically to [[African American]]s in an era when [[racial discrimination]] was rampant and blacks had either been ridiculed or systematically ignored in [[advertising]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/business/06boyd.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries&amp;oref=slogin | author=[[Douglas Martin (journalist)|Douglas Martin]] | date=May 6, 2007 | title=Edward F.

==Early life==
Boyd, an African American himself, was born and grew up in [[Riverside, California]]. After high school, he trained at a local [[opera]] company and wanted to be a [[diplomat]]. After graduating from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1938, he enjoyed a short film career, playing minor roles, often as stereotypical singing and dancing roles which he resented.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; During his time in [[Hollywood]], he escorted [[Hattie McDaniel]] to the 1939 [[Academy Award]]s ceremony when she became the first African American performer to win the prestigious award.&lt;ref name="smiley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200702/20070227_boyd.html |first=Smiley |last=Tavis |date=February 27, 2007 |title=Edward Boyd |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |format=interview |accessdate=2007-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205458/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200702/20070227_boyd.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later worked for the [[Screen Actors Guild]], was the first African American to work for the [[Civil Service Commission]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]],&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and then worked as a housing specialist for the [[National Urban League]].

==Career at Pepsi==
[[Image:Pepsi targeted ad 1940s.jpg|thumb|Boyd's advertisement for Pepsi. The young boy is [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]].]]
When Boyd joined Pepsi in 1947, most U.S. businesses either ignored the African American market or depicted them using ethnic stereotypes such as the "[[Mammy archetype]]".&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; But [[Walter Staunton Mack Jr.|Walter S. Mack]], president of Pepsi at the time, saw the potential of a vast untapped market.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In fact, he had previously established an all-black sales team in 1940, but had to drop it due to the onset of [[World War II]].

Boyd's idea, revolutionary at the time, was to create advertisements that showed black Americans as normal, middle-class people. One such ad featured a smiling mother holding a [[six pack rings|six pack]] of Pepsi while her son (a young [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]], who grew up to be [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;) reaches up for one. Another [[ad campaign]], titled "Leaders in Their Fields", profiled twenty prominent African Americans such as [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Ralph Bunche]].

Boyd also led a sales team composed entirely of African Americans around the country to promote Pepsi. [[Racial segregation in the United States|Racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow laws]] were still in place throughout much of the U.S. and Boyd's team encountered a great deal of discrimination.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Not only did they have to ride on segregated trains and stay in black-only hotels, but they faced insults from Pepsi co-workers and even endured threats from the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; On the other hand, they were able to use [[racism]] as a selling point, attacking Coke's reluctance to hire blacks and the support of segregationist [[Governor of Georgia]] [[Herman Talmadge]] by the chairman of Coke.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; As a result, Pepsi's market share (as compared to Coke's) shot up dramatically. After the sales team visited [[Chicago]], Pepsi's share in the city overtook that of Coke for the first time.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

This focus on the African American market caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates. They did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear that [[whites]] would be pushed away.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In a meeting at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], Pepsico president Mack, who favored progressive causes and was the impetus for this marketing push, tried to assuage the 500 [[bottling company|bottlers]] in attendance by saying, "We don't want it to become known as the [[nigger]] drink."&lt;ref name="smiley"/&gt; Boyd understood that those were not Mack's sentiments. "I didn't forget it, but I didn't hold it against him either," he told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; After Mack left the company in 1950, support for the black sales team faded and Boyd was let go.

''Wall Street Journal'' writer Stephanie Capparell argues in her book ''The Real Pepsi Challenge'' that Boyd faced a more difficult challenge than [[Jackie Robinson]] in breaking the color barrier of corporate America. By doing the same work and competing for the same jobs as white people, Boyd's team presented more of a threat to the average white man.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2007-01-22-pepsi-book_x.htm?csp=34 | title=Pepsi's challenge in 1940s: Color barrier | publisher=[[USA Today]] | first=Michelle | last=Archer | date=January 22, 2007 | accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
There were few opportunities for a black man as a business executive at that time, but Boyd's career continued over a variety of public and private sector jobs.  He was a mission chief for [[CARE (relief)|CARE]], worked with the [[Society of Ethical Culture]], and helped to pioneer [[alpaca]] farming in the U.S.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;

Boyd's sister, Helen Boyd Howard, was married to Dr. [[T.R.M. Howard]], a surgeon, entrepreneur, and civil rights leader in Mississippi who was a mentor to [[Medgar Evers]] and [[Fannie Lou Hamer]].&lt;ref&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, ''Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 75, 79 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd died in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] due to various complications including a [[stroke]] he had suffered nearly two months earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6756">The '''Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program''' ('''ERSP''') is a self-regulatory program created in 2004 by American business organizations to promote consumer confidence. ERSP is a program of the Electronic Retailing Association http://www.retailing.org in conjunction with the [[National Advertising Review Council]] (NARC) and administered by the Council of [[Better Business Bureaus]]. The mission of the program is to enhance consumer confidence in electronic retailing, by providing a forum to self-regulate [[direct response advertising]].

ERSP was created for several reasons, to: improve consumer confidence in electronic retailing; demonstrate the strong commitment of this industry to effective self-regulation; provide a quick and efficient mechanism for review of high-profile [[advertising]] (such as weight-loss advertising) and affecting the discontinuance of advertising containing egregious claims. ERSP investigates the truth and accuracy of claims in direct response advertising from inquiries brought to ERSP’s attention through competitor’s challenges, consumer’s concerns, or through ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. Working as a voluntary program, ERSP is an efficient and useful tool to assist direct response marketers with timely and cost effective measures to minimize government interference and increase consumer confidence. 

The direct response industry includes long-form ([[infomercial]]) productions, short-form [[commercials]], live home [[shopping channels]], print advertising, Internet marketing, cell phone advertising, [[broadband]] channels, and radio advertising. Anything that has a direct link to the marketer: either a 1-[[800 number]], [[email]], or [[website]] is within ERSP’s purview.

ERSP inquires about the evidentiary support that a marketer possesses for product claims communicated through any form of direct-response advertising. Advertising claims come to ERSP’s attention through competitive challenges and ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. 

Among the most significant benefits afforded by this program are:&lt;br&gt;
• '''speed''' – the ERSP mandate is to resolve all inquiries within 60 calendar days&lt;br&gt;
• '''cost''' –low cost alternative to litigation &lt;br&gt;
• '''burden of proof''' – ERSP does not require that injury to a consumer be proven as may be required by law and&lt;br&gt; 
• '''confidentiality''' – a company may bring cases anonymously to ERSP and, conversely, any proprietary information submitted confidentially will remain so in an ERSP challenge.&lt;br&gt;
 
The 60-day structure of this program is vital in limiting marketer inconvenience, but comprehensive enough to provide a thorough review. The success of the program lies in the voluntary participation by direct response marketers and the nature of the self-regulatory format. With the beneficial nature of this format for the electronic retailing industry, ERSP looks forward to not only continuing its monitoring program but to addressing the challenges brought by both consumers and competitors of electronic marketing.

Core claims at issue in an ERSP inquiry might include:

• Establishment Claims (“Clinically proven”)&lt;br&gt;
• Performance Claims (how well a product performs)&lt;br&gt;
• Testimonials (Anecdotal tales from consumers about their results with the product)&lt;br&gt;
• Weight Loss Claims&lt;br&gt;
• Health and Safety&lt;br&gt;
• Disclosures&lt;br&gt;
• Before and After Photographs&lt;br&gt;
• Puffery&lt;br&gt;
• Comparative Claims

ERSP opened its first case in August 2004.

== How the ERSP Process Works ==

ERSP details its concerns in an initial letter of inquiry and the marketer is given 15 calendar days to respond to ERSP with substantiation for the issues raised. ERSP then has 15 calendar days to ask the marketer for more information regarding its submission. Upon receipt of that request the marketer has 10 days to answer ERSP’s questions, and upon receipt of that, ERSP has 15 calendar days to reach a decision. 

If a marketer does not respond to the initial inquiry letter by ERSP, a press release summarizing the claims at issue and announcing a 10-calendar-day response for the marketer is released.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:ERSP5.jpg]] --&gt;

== ERSP Determinations – What to Expect ==

Participants in an ERSP review can anticipate one of three results:

• ERSP determines that the core claims at issue are supported by reasonable evidence. &lt;br&gt;
• ERSP recommends the marketer modify core claims.&lt;br&gt;
• ERSP determines there is no support for the claims at issue and recommends that the advertiser pull the advertisement.

ERSP also refers marketers to the appropriate [[regulatory agency]] if they fail to respond or refuse to comply with ERSP’s findings. Compliance inquiries are also conducted to confirm compliance with ERSP recommendations.&lt;br&gt;

== ERSP Review Program ==
In January 2012, the Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program (ERSP) expanded its purview to monitor and review advertising of the coaching and mentoring and live seminar industry. The program is called the “ERSP Review Program.”  The ERSP Review Program has two fundamental components: 1) review of telemarketing practices and free live seminar events which include telesales phone calls,  scripts and recordings of free, live seminar events ; 2) monitoring of lead generation advertising applicable to the coaching and mentoring industry including print, broadcast and online advertising.

== ERSP Copy Review ==
In 2014 ERSP introduced its Copy Reviewservice which is offered to members of the direct response industry and provides a review of advertising and the reasonable messages being communicated in the advertisement (usually conducted before the advertising is nationally disseminated). The review is focused on the legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and/or statutory provisions that should be considered and/or adhered to with respect to representations (express or implied) disseminated in an advertisement. Unlike a preclearance service which entails a comprehensive review of a marketer’s substantiation, a copy review evaluation is a “''non evidentiary''” review and is limited to “''primary''” and “''core''” claims communicated in an advertisement. Consumer complaints can be sent into ERSP via this [http://savvyshopper.org/savvyshopper/complaintlog/complaint_frame.htm complaint form].&lt;br&gt;

'''Frederick Cathcart''' (1859 - 1934) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[impresario]], who was the [[Clerk of the Course]] and [[Chairman]] of [[Cheltenham Racecourse]] from 1908 to 1934.  He was responsible for the development of Cheltenham as the world headquarters of [[National Hunt]] racing, establishing the [[Cheltenham Festival]] as the leading National Hunt event in the racing calendar, and for instigating two of its major races - the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] and the [[Champion Hurdle]].  In 1999, industry paper the [[Racing Post]] named him at number 11 in the list of ''100 Makers of 20th Century Racing''.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;

He was born in 1859, the son of a professional [[comedian]].  He joined [[racecourse]] management firm Pratt &amp; Co in 1895 and progressed to be senior partner.

In 1911 he gave the National Hunt Meeting (the precursor to the Cheltenham Festival) a permanent home at Cheltenham and set about expanding it.  Under his leadership, the inaugural runnings of the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] (1924) and [[Champion Hurdle]] (1927) were held.

On his death, one obituary read, "He was indefatigable in his efforts to increase the popularity and public appeal of the race meetings with which he was associated . . . Much of the success of the 'chasing at Cheltenham was due to Mr Cathcart's energy and enterprise."&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;

The [[Cathcart Challenge Cup]] (later replaced by the [[Ryanair Chase]]) at the Cheltenham Festival meeting was named in his honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4716">The '''Glass Age Development Committee''' was established in 1937 by [[Pilkington]] to promote the use of [[glass]] as a building material in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1964|title=A Multi-Purpose Seven Storey Bridge Project for the Thames in London|journal=Indian Concrete Journal|volume=38|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commissioned designs for many large-scale schemes, none of which were ever built.

Initially its name was the Glass Age Town Planning Committee. The first committee consisted of first-generation modern architects Maxwell Fry, R Furneaux Jordan, Raymond McGrath, Howard Robertson, G Grey Wornum and FRS Yorke. Each was asked to ‘suggest solutions to certain problems of town planning in London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Bournemouth’, using ‘all the structural and decorative resources of the Glass Age, but [to] produce practical schemes that could actually be built. An imaginative use of modern materials, rather than mere romantic fantasy was desired’. This being a marketing tool led by Pilkington, most of the problems were as unrealistic as the solutions. The designs followed early CIAM ideals in sweeping away historical areas such as The Strand and Bond Street in London, and Princes Street in Edinburgh in favour of extrusions of stacked floorplates walled in glass similar to the Miesian skyscrapers c1920.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Parnell (2014) "In praise of advertising", ''The Architectural Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 50s the Committee was formed by Geoffrey A. Jellicoe, Edward D. Mills and Ove Arup &amp; Partners; and it was joined by other architects for individual projects. The design briefs were for Britain in the year 2000, but realistic in that they were to make use of technology that was already available.&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture and Design for the Family in Britain, 1900-1970''; by David Jeremiah (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Notable schemes included a proposal in 1955 to demolish the entire area of [[Soho]] and rebuild it entirely in glass;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Chris|title=Urban Culture|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|year=2004|pages=226|isbn=0-415-30497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1957 proposal for the replacement of [[St Giles Circus]] in London with a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} tall glass [[heliport]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=Crystal Gazing|journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology|volume=29|issue=4|pages=97|doi=10.1108/eb032812}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1963 "Crystal Span" proposal for the replacement of [[London]]'s [[Vauxhall Bridge]] with a seven-story glass building straddling the [[River Thames]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Brian|title=Crossing the River|publisher=Mainstream|location=Edinburgh|year=2006|isbn=1-84018-976-2|oclc=63400905|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was to have contained a shopping mall, luxury hotel, residential development and a museum to house the [[modern art]] collection now housed at [[Tate Modern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeremiah|first=David|title=Architecture and Design for the Family in Britain 1900–70|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|year=2000|isbn=0-7190-5889-9|oclc=186445752|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glass Age Development Committee is best known for its ambitious 1968 proposal for a glass and concrete [[Seasteading|offshore city]] housing 21,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=City at Sea to House 30,000|last=|first=|date=29 February 1968|newspaper=Times|access-date=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sea City"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115965/english/info/future/sea.htm |work=Future City Types |title=Sea City |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408032505/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115965/english/info/future/sea.htm |archivedate=2008-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be anchored off the coast near [[Great Yarmouth]] and accessed from the mainland by [[hovercraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/sea-city.html|title=Sea City|publisher=Austin Tate|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was to have been called Sea City. The structure would have been {{convert|4700|ft|m}} long and {{convert|3300|ft|m}} wide, and would have rested on concrete islands supported by [[pier (architecture)|piers]].&lt;ref name="Sea City" /&gt; It was intended that the development would have been economically self-sufficient thanks to [[boatbuilding]] workshops, [[fish farming]], and the export of fresh water from an onboard [[desalination]] plant, while a lagoon in the centre of the development would support a tourist industry based on [[Scuba diving|skin diving]] and [[water skiing]].&lt;ref name="Sea City" /&gt;

The '''Home Builders Federation''' (HBF) is a [[trade association]] representing private sector homebuilders in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Its members deliver around 80% of new homes built each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbf.co.uk/media-centre/company-overview/ HBF company overview]. Accessed 19 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The HBF can trace its roots back to 1939 and the establishment of the '''National Association of House Builders'''.&lt;ref name=honourboards&gt;[http://www.honourboards.co.uk/association_honour_boards.html Federations, Institutes &amp; Associations] Accessed: 16 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This became the '''Federation of Registered House Builders''' in 1946 (representing the housing element of the [[National Federation of Building Trades Employers]], NFBTE, in whose annual reports its activities were described),&lt;ref name="Warwick records"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection: National Federation of Building Trades Employers (NFBTE), earlier the Association of Master Builders of Great Britain|url=http://dscalm.warwick.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=DServe2.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=FastTree.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqItem=FBT%2F1%2F1&amp;dsqField=RefNo|website=Warwick University|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''House Builders Federation''' in 1970.&lt;ref name=honourboards /&gt;

From 1997 to 2000 it was part of the NFBTE successor umbrella organisation, the [[Construction Confederation]], but started to withdraw in 2000,&lt;ref name="HBF to leave CC"&gt;{{cite news|title=House Builders’ Federation set to quit Confederation|url=http://www.building.co.uk/house-builders8217-federation-set-to-quit-confederation/592.article|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=Building|issue=20|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; voting in 2001 to terminate its membership by January 2003.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Phil|title=HBF finally pulls out of the Construction Confederation|url=http://www.building.co.uk/hbf-finally-pulls-out-of-the-construction-confederation/1009206.article|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=Building|issue=27|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It changed its name to the '''Home Builders Federation''' in 2005.

==Structure==
HBF members include national names (e.g. [[Barratt Developments]], [[Crest Nicholson]]) and smaller local businesses, plus [[Registered Social Landlord]]s, suppliers and companies who provide professional services to the home building industry.

==Activities==
The HBF represents member interests on a national and regional level, addressing technical issues (e.g. regulations and standards), planning issues, and health and safety, among other areas.

It also represents home building interests by attending meetings of the [[Strategic Forum for Construction]].&lt;ref name="TCI re SFfC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Relaunch for construction’s Strategic Forum|url=http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/relaunch-for-constructions-strategic-forum|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=The Construction Index|date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Gandois''', [[Honorary Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (born 7 May 1930, [[Nieul]],  [[Haute-Vienne]]) is a French businessman.

==Education==
He is a former pupil of the French [[École polytechnique]], where he graduated in 1949, as an engineer of bridges &amp; road construction.

==Career==
From 1954 to 1960 he worked on public projects in [[Guinea]], as an expert for the road programs of [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]. In 1961 he returned to France and worked for the Wendel Group. After various positions, in 1972, he became general manager of [[Sacilor]], then Chairman and managing Director of [[Sollac]]. In 1976 he started working at the [[Rhône-Poulenc]], eventually becoming Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref name="CoignardGuichard2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coignard|first1=Sophie|last2=Guichard|first2=Marie-Thérèse|title=French Connections:Networks of Influence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVyohk7knogC&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=25 February 2011|year=2000|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-1-892941-02-2|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the group in 1982 and until 1986 he worked as an international consultant. In 1986 he became Chairman and managing Director of the Pechiney Group. He left them in 1994 to take the chair of the National Council of French Employers ([[CNPF]], old name of Medef).

From 1987 to 1999 he worked as a crisis manager for Cockerill Sambre. He is currently a president of the board of trustees of Suez. He is a member of the Belgian businessclub [[Cercle de Lorraine]].

In 1995 he was appointed an Honorary Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM), "for service to Australian-French relations, particularly in the business sphere".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1042994&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was reportedly "devastated" by the ad, although she "had the right to approve the ad before it was released".

'''Nerio Alessandri''' ([[Gatteo]], [[Province of Forlì-Cesena]], 8 April 1961) is an Italian entrepreneur &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitnesschic.it/interview/technogym-nerio-alessandri.html |title=Interview: Nerio Alessandri |publisher=Fitnesschic.it |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President and founder of [[Technogym]] (since 1983).

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2017}}
In 1983 Nerio Alessandri founded Technogym, and began building exercise equipment in the garage of his home.

In 1984 he designed the Isotonic Line, the very first Technogym training line for gyms and then in 1986 came Unica, the first, hi-tech design, home trainer.

In 1988 he patented the CPR system, a scientific algorithm for constant pulse/heart rate training that became the hallmark of Technogym products.

In 1993 at the 1st California Tradefair International Conference in Rimini, Alessandri defined his Wellness concept: a lifestyle based on regular physical activity, balanced diet and a positive outlook. From this moment on Wellness became the foundation of the Technogym philosophy and the tagline “The Wellness Company” was added to the corporate logo.

In 2001 Alessandri was nominated “Cavaliere del Lavoro” (Knight of Industry) by the President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, which made him the youngest-ever holder of this title in Italian history.

In November 2003 he was named Italian “Entrepreneur of the Year 2003” and then represented Italy at the “World Entrepreneur of the Year”.

In March 2004 he was elected to the Association of Italian Industrialists (Confindustria) Board of Directors and this mandate was renewed in 2008 for the next four years.

In April 2004 he received an honorary degree (Laurea Honoris Causa) from the Faculty of Motor Sciences at the University of Urbino.

In November 2004 he was presented the Leonardo Award for Italian Quality by the President of the Italian Republic.

In April 2005 he received an [[honorary degree]] (Laurea ''[[ad honorem]]'') from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Bologna.

In November 2007 the United States Chamber of Commerce named Nerio Alessandri entrepreneur of the year in the economics category.

In February 2009 he was nominated Vice President of the Leonardo Committee, an association that promotes Italian quality and the image of Italy throughout the world.

In September 2009 Nerio Alessandri was nominated “World Heart Champion” by the World Heart Federation, the cardiology association of the World Health Organisation, for his commitment to promoting Wellness and a healthy lifestyle.

In May 2010 he was awarded the Guido Carli Award for the “Corporate Social Responsibility” category.

He received the ''America Award'' of the [[Italy-USA Foundation]] in 2017.

The concept of Wellness is founded on the ancient Roman maximum of ''mens sana in corpore sano'' (a healthy mind in a healthy body) and is a genuine alternative to the American concept of fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nerio Alessandri idea of fitness | url = http://www.howtospendit.com/#/articles/2756-the-captains-table-nerio-alessandri}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fitness focuses on a small group of sports enthusiasts, whereas Wellness speaks to a much wider range of people who wish to improve their lifestyle.

In 2003, at the Wellness Congress organized in Cesena by the Wellness Foundation, Alessandri launched the slogan “Stare bene conviene” (Wellness pays) to highlight that a good psycho-physical condition is an all round advantage. For individuals who enjoy a better life. For companies, who can count on a more creative, more productive, more focused team. And for public health expenditure too, as a healthier population has less need of the National Health Service.

==Wellness Foundation==

In 2003 the Wellness Foundation was established. This no profit association supports scientific research, health education and the promotion of a Wellness lifestyle. The Foundation operates with specific projects in the sphere of health, instruction, research, art and culture.
This foundation is the expression of the entrepreneur’s social responsibility, as it decides how to use its capital in social utility projects aimed at improving people’s quality of life with a particular emphasis on the local area in which the company is based.
This is why one of the main initiatives promoted by the Foundation is the “Wellness Valley, Romagna Benessere” project with the aim of enhancing the natural characteristics of the Romagna region and establishing it as a leader in terms of people’s quality of life.

Moreover, in 2007, the Wellness Foundation promoted the “Cesena città che cammina” (Cesena, the walking city) project, which offered local people a free health check up and advice on illness prevention.

In 2008, together with the Municipality of Cesena and the local health service, the Foundation conducted a survey on the level of physical exercise practised by young people in Cesena. For many years now, the Foundation has worked together with a number of major prevention, research and care organizations to provide information and raise awareness of health issues.
These organizations include the Istituto Oncologico Romagnolo (Romagna Oncology Institute), the Lega Italiana Lotta ai Tumori (Italian Tumour Prevention League), and the Fondazione Italiana per il Cuore e Diabete Italia (Italian Heart and Diabetes Foundation) .

The Foundation also promotes the Wellness Congress, the main event for promoting and raising awareness of Wellness issues. The first congress was held in Cesena in 2003, and has since met every year in various countries around the world. Through the shared experiences of doctors, entrepreneurs, fashion designers, architects, and celebrities from the worlds of sport, culture and institutions, the Wellness Congress demonstrates how a healthy lifestyle can concretely improve people's quality of life, corporate performance and state expenditure.

'''Organising''' is a systematic process of structuring, integrating, co-ordinating task goals, and activities to resources in order to attain objectives.

==History==
The [[information organization|organizing of information]] could be seen since humans began to [[write]]. Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history, but also supports the communication of history. Recording ideas in a written text, as opposed to verbally communicating with someone, and more specifically cataloging ideas and thoughts, is also an attempt to organize information.

[[Science book]]s are notable by their organization of a specific subject.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Encyclopedia]]s usually organize subjects into a single place, for faster [[index (publishing)|indexing]] and seeking of meanings.

== Characteristics ==
The following are the important characteristics of organization.

*'''Specialization and division of work.''' The entire philosophy of organization is centered on the concepts of [[specialization of work|specialization]] and [[division of work]]. The division of work is assigning responsibility for each organizational component to a specific individual or group thereof. It becomes specialization when the responsibility for a specific task lies with a designated expert in that field. The efforts of the operatives are coordinated to allow the process at hand to function correctly. Certain operatives occupy positions of [[management]] at various points in the process to ensure coordination.
*'''Orientation towards goals.''' Every organization has its own purposes and objectives. Organizing is the function employed to achieve the overall goals of the organization. Organization harmonizes the individual goals of the employees with overall objectives of the firm.
*'''Composition of individuals and groups.''' Individuals form a group and the groups form an organization. Thus, organization is the composition of individual and groups. Individuals are grouped into departments and their work is coordinated and directed towards organizational goals.
*'''Continuity.''' An organization is a group of people with a defined relationship in which they work together to achieve the goals of that organization. This relationship does not come to end after completing each task. Organization is a never ending process.
*'"FLEXIBILITY.'" The organising process should be flexible so that any change can be incorporated. It ensures the ability to adapt and adjust the activities in response to the change taking place in the external environment. The programmes, policies and strategies can be changed as and when required if the provision for flexibility is made in the organising process.

== Purpose ==

*'''Helps to achieve organizational goal.''' Organization is employed to achieve the overall objectives of business firms. Organization focuses attention of individuals objectives towards overall objectives.
*'''Optimum use of resources.''' To make optimum use of resources such as men, material, money, machine and method, it is necessary to design an organization properly. Work should be divided and right people should be given right jobs to reduce the wastage of resources in an organization.
*'''To perform managerial function.''' Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing and Controlling cannot be implemented without proper organization.
*'''Facilitates growth and diversification.''' A good organization structure is essential for expanding business activity. Organization structure determines the input resources needed for expansion of a business activity similarly organization is essential for product diversification such as establishing a new product line. it also stimulates creativity in managers by organizing.
*'''Humane treatment of employees.''' Organization has to operate for the betterment of employees and must not encourage monotony of work due to higher degree of specialization. Now, organization has adapted the modern concept of systems approach based on human relations and it discards the traditional productivity and specialization approach.

==Applications==
'''Organizing''', in [[company|companies]] point of view, is the management function that usually follows after planning. And it involves the assignment of tasks, the grouping of tasks into departments and the assignment of authority with adequate responsibility and allocation of resources across the organization to achieve common goals.

===Structure===

The framework in which the organization defines how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and departments are coordinated.

#A set of formal tasks assigned to individuals and departments.
#Formal reporting relationships, including lines of authority, decision responsibility, number of hierarchical levels and span of managers control.
#The design of systems to ensure effective coordination of employees across departments.

=== Work specialization===

Work specialization (also called [[division of labour]] or job specialization) is the degree to which organizational tasks are sub-divided into individual jobs. It may increase the efficiency of workers, but with too much specialization, employees may feel isolated and bored. Many organizations enlarge jobs or rotate assigned tasks to provide greater challenges.

===Chain of command===
[[Command hierarchy|Chain of command]] is the vertical lines of a command structure that is used for the purposes of overall responsibility and accountability in the achieving of stated goals and objectives through the use of orders one direction and reports of compliance in the other direction.  Chain of command differs from horizontal lines in an organization which are basically the communication and coordinating lines of the organization.
Chain of command(also referred to as 'scalar principle') states that a clear , unbroken chain of command should link every employee with someone at a higher level, all the way to the top of the organisation.

===Authority, responsibility, and accountability===

*'''Authority''' is a manager's formal and legitimate right to make decisions, issue orders, and allocate resources to achieve organizationally desired outcomes.
*'''Responsibility''' means an employee's duty to perform assigned task or activities.
*'''Accountability''' means that those with authority and responsibility must report and justify task outcomes to those above them in the chain of command.

===Delegation===

Delegation is the transfer of authority and/or responsibility to others, often lower in position. Delegation can improve flexibility to meet customers’ needs and adapt to competitive environments.
Possible reasons for delegation:
1. Efficiency - many people can complete a task faster than one/few
2. Specialization - delegating simple tasks allows more important/complex tasks to be completed by the most qualified
3. Training - delegating a task to a trainee so that they may learn from experience

===Types of authority (and responsibility)===

'''Line authority''' managers have the formal power to direct and control immediate subordinates. The superior issues orders and is responsible for the result and the subordinate obeys and is responsible only for executing the order according to instructions.

'''Functional authority''' is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is "advice" rather than "order".

'''Staff authority''' is granted to staff specialists in their areas of expertise. It is not a real authority in the sense that a staff manager does not order or instruct but simply advises,  recommends, and counsels in the staff specialists' area of expertise and is responsible only for the quality of the advice (to be in line with the respective professional standards etc.) It is a communication relationship with [[management]].  It has an influence that derives indirectly from line authority at a higher level.

''' Line and Staff Authority''' is the combination of Line organization and Staff organization.  Such organization follows both the principles of scalar chain of command and there is a provision for specialized activities  to be performed by staff officers who act in an advisory capacity

===Span of management===
Categories:
*Direct single relationship.
*Direct group relationships.
*Cross relationship.
Factors influencing larger span of management.
#Work performed by subordinates is stable and routine.
#Subordinates perform similar work tasks.
#Subordinates are concentrated in a single location.
#Subordinates are highly trained and need little direction in performing tasks.
#Rules and procedures defining task activities are available.
#Support systems and personnel are available for the managers.
#Little time is required in non-supervisory activities such as coordination with other departments or planning.
#Managers' personal preferences and styles favor a large span.

===Tall versus flat structure===

*'''Tall''' - A management structure characterized by an overall narrow span of management and a relatively large number of hierarchical levels. Tight control. [[Hierarchical organization|Reduced communication overhead]].
*'''Flat''' - A management structure characterized by a wide span of control and relatively few hierarchical levels. Loose control. Facilitates delegation.

===Centralization, decentralization, and formalization===

*'''Centralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near top organizational levels.
*'''Decentralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near lower organizational levels.
*'''Formalization''' - The written documentation used to direct and control employees.

===Departmentalization===

[[Departmentalization]] is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations. Approach options include:
#'''Functional''' - by common skills and work task
#'''Divisional''' - common product, program or geographical location
#'''Matrix'''     - combination of Functional and Divisional
#'''Team'''       - to accomplish specific tasks
#'''Network'''    - departments are independent providing functions for a central core breaker

===Importance of organizing===

*Organizations are often troubled by how to organize, particularly when a new strategy is developed
*Changing market conditions or new technology requires change
*Organizations seek efficiencies through improvements in organizing

'''Peer support''' occurs when people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or practical help to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Shery Mead, David Hilton, Laurie Curtis, [http://mentalhealthpeers.com/pdfs/peersupport.pdf "Peer Support: A Theoretical Perspective."]&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to an initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as [[peer mentoring]], reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or [[counseling]]. Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.

Peer support is distinct from other forms of [[social support]] in that the source of support is a ''peer'', a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has "been there, done that" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as [[peer support specialist]]s and [[Center for Victims of Torture#Training Peer Counselors|peer counselors]] receive special training and are required to obtain [[Continuing Education]] Units, like clinical staff. Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as [[emergency medical responders]].

==Underlying theory==

The effectiveness of peer support is believed to derive from a variety of [[psychosocial]] processes described best by Mark Salzer in 2002:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Salzer  | first = Mark | year = 2002 | title = Consumer-delivered services as a best practice in mental health care and the development of practice guidelines | journal = Psychiatric rehabilitation skills | volume = 6 | pages = 355–382 | doi=10.1080/10973430208408443}}.&lt;/ref&gt; social support, experiential knowledge, social learning theory, social comparison theory and the helper-therapy principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Peer_Support_What_Makes_It_Unique_Mead.html Mead S., &amp; MacNeil C,. (2006). "Peer Support: What Makes It Unique?"], ''International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation.'' 10 (2), 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Social support]] is the existence of positive psychosocial interactions with others with whom there is mutual trust and concern.&lt;ref&gt;Sarason, I., Levine, H., Basham, R., &amp; Sarason, B. (1983). "Assessing social support: The social support questionnaire."

*[[Experiential knowledge]] is specialized information and perspectives that people obtain from living through a particular experience such as [[substance abuse]], a physical [[disability]], chronic physical or mental illness, or a traumatic event such as [[military action|combat]], a [[natural disaster]], [[domestic violence]] or a [[violent crime]], [[sexual abuse]], or [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]. Experiential knowledge tends to be unique and pragmatic and when shared contributes to solving problems and improving [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Shubert, M., &amp; Borkman, T. (1994). "Identifying the experiential knowledge developed within a self-help group." In T. Powell (Ed.) ''Understanding the self-help organization.''

Consulting and Clinical Psychology'' 54: 454-460.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Social learning theory]] postulates that peers, because they have undergone and survived relevant experiences, are more credible [[role model]]s for others. Interactions with peers who are successfully coping with their experiences or illness are more likely to result in positive [[behavior|behavior change]].&lt;ref&gt;Salzer, M., &amp; Shear, S. L. (2002). "Identifying consumer-provider benefits in evaluations of consumer-delivered services." ''Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal,'' 25, 281–288.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Social comparison]] means that individuals are more comfortable interacting with others who share common characteristics with themselves, such as a [[psychiatric illness]], in order to establish a sense of normalcy. By interacting with others who are perceived to be better than them, peers are given a sense of [[optimism]] and something to strive toward.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). "A theory of social comparison processes." ''[[Human Relations]]'', 7, 117–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Counseling Psychologist,'' 43, 58-64&lt;/ref&gt; (a) increased sense of interpersonal competence as a result of making an impact on another person's life; (b) development of a sense of equality in giving and taking between himself or herself and others; (c) helper gains new personally-relevant knowledge while helping; and (d) the helper receives social approval from the person they help, and others.&lt;ref&gt;From Salzer and Shear, S. L. (2002), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In schools and education==

===Peer mentoring===
{{main article|Peer mentoring}}

Peer mentoring takes place in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Grbac, [http://www.theibsc.org/uploaded/IBSC/Conference_and_workshops/Toronto_Workshops/Grbac_Handout.pdf "How to implement a ‘Peer Support’ program in a P-6 School,” [[Scotch College Junior School, Melbourne]] Australia; International Boys' Schools Coalition 15th Annual Conference, Toronto, Canada, June 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Peer mentors appear mainly in [[secondary school]]s where students moving up from [[primary school]]s may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace as a means of orienting new employees. New employees who are paired with a peer mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Beverly |last2=Jordan-Evans |first2=Sharon| title = Love 'Em or Lose Em: Getting Good People to Stay| publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers| year = 2005 | location = San Francisco | page = 117 | isbn=978-1-57675-327-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer listening===
This form of peer support is widely used within schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Cowie]], Patti Wallace, ''Peer Support in Action: From Bystanding to Standing By,'' Sage Publications Ltd; 1st edition February 2001; {{ISBN|0-7619-6353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Hazouri, Miriam Smith McLaughlin, ''Peer listening in the middle school: training activities for students.'' Educational Media Corp., 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-932796-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer supporters are trained, normally from within schools or universities, or sometimes by outside organizations, such as [[Childline]]'s CHIPS (Childline In Partnership With Schools) program,&lt;ref&gt;Chrissan Moldrich and J.D. Carpentieri, [http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/EverySchoolPDF_wdf55391.pdf "Every school should have one: How peer support schemes make schools better"], [[ChildLine]], January 2008,  {{ISBN|0-9524948-8-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to be "[[active listening|active listeners]]".&lt;ref&gt;Joel H. Brown, Marianne D'Emidio-Caston, Bonnie Benard, ''Resilience Education,'' [[Corwin Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-7626-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within schools, peer supporters are normally available at break or lunch times.

===Peer mediation===
Peer mediation is a means of handling incidents of [[bullying]] by bringing the victim and the bully together under [[mediation]] by one of their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Sanders (Editor), Gary D. Phye (Editor), ''Bullying: Implications for the Classroom,'' Academic Press; 1st edition May 14, 2004; {{ISBN|0-12-617955-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~safeschl/PeerMediation.pdf "Creating a Positive Climate: Peer Mediation; What Works in Preventing School Violence."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cremin, Hilary, ''Peer Mediation: Citizenship and Social Inclusion in Action.''

''School Counselor,'' 1996, 44:151-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer helper in sports===
A peer helper in sports works with young adults in sports such as [[American football|football]], [[soccer]], [[Track and field|track]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], [[cheerleading]],  [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[basketball]]. They may provide help with game tactics (e.g. keeping your eye on the ball), emotional support, training support, and social support.&lt;ref&gt;John DeMarco, ''Peer helping skills: a leader's guide to training peer helpers and peer tutors for middle and high school.''	Hazelden Publishing, 1993. {{ISBN|978-1-56246-090-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, H. D. and J. A. Tindall (1985). ''Peer counseling: An in-depth look at training peer helpers.''

==In health==

===In mental health===
{{see also|Peer support specialist}}
Peer support can occur within, outside or around traditional mental health services and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is a key concept in the [[recovery approach]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/recovery/peer_workers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in consumer-operated services programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosp.mimhtraining.com/final-report-10-chapters-appendices/ Campbell, J. ''The Consumer-Operated Services Program (COSP) Multisite study,'' Missouri Institute of Mental Health, St. Louis, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychiatric survivors movement|Consumers/clients]] of mental health programs have also formed non-profit [[self-help groups|self-help]] organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Ochocka, J., Janzen, R., &amp; Nelson, G. (2002). "Sharing Power and Knowledge: Professional and Mental Health Consumer/Survivor Researchers Working Together in a Participatory Action Research Project." ''Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal'', 25(4), 379.&lt;/ref&gt; and serve to support each other and to challenge associated [[Social stigma|stigma]] and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalhealthpeers.com/pdfs/PeerSupportUnique.pdf Shery Mead and Cheryl MacNeil, "Peer Support: What Makes It Unique?", December 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson. I., Chinman. M. J.. Kloos. B., Weingarten, R., Stayner. D. A., &amp; Tebes. J. K. (1999). "Peer support among individuals with severe mental illness: A review of the evidence." ''Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice,'' 6(2), 165-187.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of peer workers in mental health services was the subject of a conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the [[Centre for Mental Health]] and the NHS Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhsconfed.org/Networks/MentalHealth/events/recent_events/Pages/mh-peer-support.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced [[self-esteem]] and social functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=research_advances "Peer Support Research: A Promising New Approach."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerstar.org/pubs/Emerging%20New%20Practices%20in%20Oraganized%20Peer%20Support.pdf Jean Campbell and Judy Leaver, "Emerging New Practices in Organized Peer Support," National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) and the National Technical Assistance Center for State Mental Health Planning (NTAC), March 2003, p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable variety in the ways that peer support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services.  In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by [[Psychiatric survivors movement|psychiatric survivors]], in peer support as an approach to building relationships that are genuine, mutual, and non-coercive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home Content|url = http://www.intentionalpeersupport.org|website = Intentional Peer Support|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====For anxiety and depression====
In [[Canada]], the [http://www.anxietybc.com/leaf.php LEAF ''(Living Effectively with Anxiety and Fear)'' Program] is a peer-led support group for [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] of persons with mild to moderate [[panic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/sites/default/files/visions_cognitivetherapy.pdf Shelley Jones, "The LEAF Program: Peer-led Group CBT"], ''Visions: BC's Mental Health and Addictions Journal,'' Vol 6, no. 1 2009, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 [[meta-analysis]] of seven [[randomized trial]]s that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from [[major depressive disorder|depression]], peer support interventions were found to improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be comparable to those of group cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings suggest that peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preparedpatientforum.org/research/support_021711.pdf Pfeiffer PN, Heisler M, Piette JD, Rogers MAM, Valenstein M. "Efficacy of peer support interventions for depression: a meta-analysis"]. ''General Hospital Psychiatry,'' 2011;2011(33):29-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have shown that peer support reduces fear during stressful situations such as [[combat]]&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Z., Mikulincer, M., and Hobfall, S. E. (1986). "Effects of social support and battle intensity on loneliness and breakdown during combat." ''J. Personal. Social Psychol.'' 51: 1269-1276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Z., and Oppenheimer, B. (1986). "Social network variables and stress-reaction lessons from the 1973 Yom-Kippur War." ''Milit. Med.'' 151; pp. 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[domestic violence]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, R. E., and Hodson, C. A. (1983). "Coping with domestic violence: Social support and psychological health among battered women." ''Am. J. Commun. Psychiatry,'' 11: 629-654.&lt;/ref&gt; and may mitigate [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/3822/07aj1016.PDF Jonathan I.

''Occup Med'' 2003; 53:469–475.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1982 Vietnam-Era Veterans Adjustment Survey showed that PTSD was highest in those men and women who lacked positive social support from family, friends, and society in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ccp/53/6/935.html Stretch, R.

A 1984 study on the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of domestic violence showed that 146 battered women found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments. The women in these groups appeared to give direct advice and to act as role models.&lt;ref&gt;Donato, K. M., and Bowker, L. H. (1984).

===In addiction===
[[Twelve-step programs]] for overcoming [[substance misuse]] and other [[addiction recovery groups]] are often based on peer support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA09-4454/SMA09-4454.pdf Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, "What are Peer Recovery Support Services?"

===In chronic illness===
Peer support has been beneficial for many people living with [[diabetes]]. Diabetes encompasses all aspects of people's lives, often for decades. Support from peers can offer emotional, social, and practical assistance that helps people do the things they need to do to stay healthy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/a/wkh/thepat/v2y2009i1p5-17.html Carol A.

===For people with disabilities===
Peer support is considered to be a key component of the [[independent living]] movement and has been widely used by organizations that work with people with disabilities, including the [[Amputee Coalition of America]] (ACA) and [[Survivor Corps]]. Since 1998 the ACA has operated a [http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/peer_network.html National Peer Network] for survivors of [[amputation|limb loss]]. The [[Blinded Veterans Association]] has recently launched [http://www.bva.org/peer.html Operation Peer Support (OPS)], a program designed to support men and women returning to the US blinded or experiencing significant [[visual impairment]] in connection with their military service. Peer support has also benefited survivors of [[traumatic brain injury]] and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/headtraumarehab/Abstract/2002/04000/Peer_Support_in_the_Community__Initial_Findings_of.4.aspx Hibbard MR, Cantor J, Charatz H, Rosenthal R, Ashman T, Gundersen N, et al.

===For veterans and their families===
Several programs exist that provide peer support for military [[veteran]]s in the US&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vets4vets.us/ Vets4Vets, a non-partisan organization dedicated to helping Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans to heal from the psychological injuries of war through the use of peer support.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=veteransterminal&amp;L=3&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Returning+Veterans&amp;L2=SAVE+Team&amp;sid=Eveterans&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=save_overview&amp;csid=Eveterans Statewide Advocacy for Veterans' Empowerment (SAVE)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/59/11/1307 Resnick, Sandra Gail; Rosenheck, Robert A: "Integrating peer-provided services: a quasi-experimental study of recovery orientation, confidence, and empowerment," ''Psychiatric Services,'' vol. 59, no. 11, pp. 1307-1314, November 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osiss.ca/engraph/index_e.asp The Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS) Program for Canadian Veterans.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192633/http://www.osiss.ca/engraph/index_e.asp |date=2011-07-06 }} See also [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/pdf/deptReports/OSISS-Eval-Final%20Rpt-Jan05%28Nov04-05%29-eng.pdf "Evaluation of the OSISS Peer Support Network," Dept. of National Defence and Veterans Affairs Canada, January 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA472725 Heber, A., Grenier, S., Richardson, D., Darte, K.

The [http://www.taps.org/ Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS)] provides peer support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources for families of members of the US military. [http://www.bva.org/peer.html Operation Peer Support (OPS)] is a program for US military veterans who were blinded or have significant visual impairment.

In January 2013 [[Senator Patty Murray]], Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs]], sponsored an amendment of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] (S.3254) that would require peer counseling as part of a comprehensive [[suicide prevention]] program for US veterans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ID=5473049d-09d6-41ac-a578-1304b9ce19d3 "MILITARY SUICIDE: Murray Effort to Create Standardized Suicide Prevention Program Signed into Law by President Obama."]&lt;/ref&gt;

====For veterans with PTSD====

Researchers at the [http://www.paloalto.va.gov Palo Alto VA] [http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/treatment/cope/peer_support_groups.asp National Center for PTSD] reviewed the literature on peer interventions for [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and found that studies fell into three broad categories, referred to as "peer outreach for those exposed to traumatic events;” “paraprofessional peer delivery of a trauma-focused intervention” and “peer support for recovery from PTSD".&lt;ref&gt;Jain S, McLean C, Adler EP, Lindley, SE, Ruzek, JI, Rosen CS. "Does the Integration of Peers into the Treatment of Adults with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Improve Access to Mental Health Care? A Literature Review and Conceptual Model." ''J Trauma Stress Disor Treat.'' 2013 Aug; 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; Peer support outreach for those exposed to traumatic events refers to programs that seek to identify and reach out to those suffering from or at risk for mental health problems following a traumatic event as a means of connecting those people to mental health services. Paraprofessional peers are defined as having a shared background as the target population and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team. These peers are trained in certain interventions (such as [[Psychological First Aid]]) and are closely supervised by professional mental healthcare personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCabe|first1=O. Lee|last2=Perry|first2=Charlene|last3=Azur|first3=Melissa|last4=Taylor|first4=Henry G.|last5=Bailey|first5=Mark|last6=Links|first6=Johnathan M.|title=Psychological first aid training for paraprofessionals: A systems-based model for enhancing capacity of rural emergency responses.|journal=Prehospital and Disaster Medicine|date=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=251–258|doi=10.1017/s1049023x11006297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer support for recovery from PTSD refers to programs in which someone with lived experience of PTSD, who experienced a significant reduction in symptoms, provides formal services to those who have not yet made significant steps in recovery from his or her condition. The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sledge|first1=W.

A further review of existing literature found that carefully recruited, trained, supervised, and supported paraprofessionals can deliver mental health interventions effectively, and may be valuable in communities with fewer resources for mental healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Jain S. "The role of paraprofessionals in providing treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder in low-resource communities." ''Journal of the American Medical Association.'' 2010 Aug; 304:5&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD also conducted [[focus groups]] at the [[VA Palo Alto Health Care System]] Trauma Recovery Programs, a PTSD Residential Rehabilitation Program, and a Women's Trauma Recovery Program to determine veteran and staff perceptions of informal peer support interventions already in place.&lt;ref&gt;Jain S, McLean C, &amp; Rosen C. "Is there a role for peer support delivered interventions in the treatment of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder?" ''Military Medicine.'' 2012; 177:5&lt;/ref&gt; Four themes were identified, including "peer support contributing to a feeling of social connectedness," "positive role modeling by the peer support provider," "peer support augmenting care offered by professional providers," and "peer supporter acting as a 'culture broker' and orienting recipients to mental health treatment."

These findings have been put into practice through a peer support program for veterans in the Sonora, Stockton, and Modesto VA outpatient clinics. The clinics are part of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that extend to more rural parts of northern California. The program is funded through grants in support of new treatment approaches to serve veterans in rural, traditionally underserved areas. Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of the Palo Alto VA system.

The peer support program has been operational since 2012 with over 268 unique veterans seen between 2012 and 2015. The two peer support providers involved in the program are veterans of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively, and after having recovered from their own mental health disorders utilize their experiences to help their fellow veterans. The two providers have been responsible for leading between 5 and 7 groups each week as well as conducting telephone outreach and one-on-one engagement visits &lt;ref&gt;Joseph, K. M., Hernandez, J. M., &amp; Jain, S. (2015). Peer support telephone outreach intervention for veterans with PTSD. Psychiatric Services, 66(9), 1001&lt;/ref&gt; These services have successfully helped to augment the often overburdened mental health treatment teams at the central valley outpatient VA clinics.

The peer support program has been described in several publications. A personal story of success was featured in [http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2014fall/the-buddy-system.html Stanford Medicine magazine] and the collaborative nature of the program was described in the recently published book, [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319188836 Partnerships for Mental Health].

===For sex workers===
Several peer based organisations exist for [[sex workers]]. The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the [[Sex Industry Network (SIN)]] when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.

==General Manager at VivaCell-MTS==

VivaCell grew quickly and, in 2007, the company’s only shareholder, Fattouch Group, agreed to sell 80% of its shares to Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS), the largest mobile operator in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russian Federation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MTS enters Armenia|url=http://www.mtsgsm.com/news/2007-09-14-26533/|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=14 September 2009|agency=[[mtsgsm.com/]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of today, VivaCell-MTS (MTS Armenia CJSC) shareholders are 80% MTS Russian MTS Group (Mobile TeleSystems PJSC) and 20% - Lebanese Fattouche Group. After acquisition by MTS also Ralph Yirikian stayed as the General Manager of VivaCell-MTS. Under his leadership, the Company continued striving and achieved new heights: first in Armenia 3G rollout based on UMTS/HSPA (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System / High Speed Packet Access) technology, launched on April 17, 2009, was a defining moment for the Armenian population. The introduction of 3G opened up new opportunities for the business and everyday life in the country &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS Announces The Commercial Launch Of 3G Network In Armenia|url=http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?166907-VivaCell-MTS-Announces-The-Commercial-Launch-Of-3G-Network-In-Armeni/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=17 April 2009|agency=[http://www.armeniandiaspora.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further, on the 20th of December, 2010, VivaCell-MTS launched the first 4G/LTE network in Armenia and the region &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS launches commercial test operation of first 4G network in region|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/58778/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 December 2010|agency=[http://Panarmenian.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“VivaCell-MTS’ LTE roll-out positions Armenia to be one of the selected global leaders in 4G deployment. In addition, the launch of 4G is expected to present Armenia as a country with attractive communication infrastructure,” commented VivaCell-MTS General Manager Ralph Yirikian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS Launches 4G Test Network in Armenia|url=https://ditord.com/2010/12/20/vivacell-mts-launches-4g-test-network-in-armenia/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 December 2010|agency=[[The Armenian Observer Blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Now, VivaCell-MTS’ 4G/LTE network, which is the largest in Armenia, covers 22 towns and is available to 52.5% of the population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Մինչև տարեվերջ Հայաստանի ամենաընդարձակ 4G ցանցը կընդգրկի 22 քաղաք|url=http://www.tert.am/am/news/2017/01/09/vivacell/2242762|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=9 January 2017|agency=[[Tert.am]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Introduction of the culture of corporate social responsibility in Armenia==

Helping the society is part of the mission of VivaCell-MTS. Due to having Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach institutionalized at the Company level, and ingrained in its daily operations, VivaCell-MTS has become the pioneer of the corporate sector in promoting the concept of Corporate Responsibility in Armenia. In doing this, VivaCell-MTS has adopted the slogan “VivaCell-MTS is leading by example”, by calling other business entities to make CSR an integral part of their activity also. Starting from the first day of its operation, the Company has been making considerable social investments into the implementation of innovative projects in the spheres of Information and Communication Technologies, healthcare, culture, science, children, environmental protection, sport, education, and rural infrastructure, with focus on borderland. 

՞Businesses don’t exist in a geographical or social vacuum; they are a part of society and located physically in particular communities and areas. This is in part a general civic and social responsibility towards the local communities in which business operates.

VivaCell-MTS is the first telecommunications operator in Armenia and the CIS that has successfully implemented ISO 26000 guidelines &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS awarded for the implementation of ISO 26000 international standard of CSR|url=http://www.itel.am/en/news/5777|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=7 June 2013|agency=[[Itel.am]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2016, VivaCell-MTS received a certificate of awarding for the widest and most developed network, efficient work with corporate customers, rendered innovative services and guidance by social responsibility from the National Association of Consumers. On February 28, 2017, the Company was recognized as “Accessible Mobile Operator” in the framework of “Accessible places” awards by the “Armenian Camp” NGO &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS awarded Accessible Mobile Operator prize|url=http://www.tert.am/en/news/2017/03/02/vivacell/2295373|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=2 March 2017|agency=[[Tert.am]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==New culture of management==

In the early days of VivaCell-MTS’ operation, Yirikian not only had to overcome the technical challenges of building a radio network, installing base stations in remote areas throughout the mountainous country, recruiting specialists, but he also had to battle with the remnants of Armenian business culture from the Soviet era. Yirikian explains that he urged his employees to take responsibility and make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptional, July–December 2010, Ernst and Young, Signaling Change, How Ralph Yirikian of VivaCell-MTS is transforming Armenia’s telecoms sector, p. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new culture of corporate management developed at VivaCell-MTS in the course of its activity gave birth to a lecture course called “Business with a Mission”, where the experience of more than 11 years of successful operation was summarized. At the beginning, the lecture was being delivered to university students who were hosted at VivaCell-MTS under the umbrella of Open Days at VivaCell-MTS frequently organized by the Company. Ralph Yirikian has been personally lecturing for senior school children and university students, by giving them an opportunity to physically get acquainted with how the Company operates, interacts with its customers and lives as a family.

Later on, as a visiting lecturer, Ralph Yirikian was invited to numerous higher educational institutions to speak on the “Business with a Mission.” Also, based on the request by higher educational institutions, he delivers lectures on the basics of telecommunications and corporate culture

'''Roger Lawrence Kerr''', [[New Zealand Order of Merit|CNZM]] (17 January 1945 – 28 October 2011), a public policy and business leader, was the executive director of the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]],&lt;ref name="NZHerald217959"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=217959|title=Roundtable chief honoured|date=20 September 2001|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/499215/detail|title=NEW ZEALAND BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE|year=2011|quote=KERR|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[free-market]] [[Think tank|think-tank]] based in [[Wellington]], New Zealand.

==Early Life==
Kerr grew up on a farm in Appleby on the South Island of New Zealand, near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]&lt;ref&gt;nkerr.com/a-tribute-to-roger/&lt;/ref&gt;. 13 years younger than his sister Barbara and 10 years younger than his brother Alan, an acclaimed pediatric heart surgeon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noted.co.nz/health/health/the-father-and-son-heroes-of-cardiac-care-in-new-zealand/&lt;/ref&gt;, his arrival was a surprise for the family&lt;ref&gt;nkerr.com/a-tribute-to-roger/&lt;/ref&gt;. He attended Appleby Primary and was one of the first students to attend [[Waimea College]] in Nelson&lt;ref&gt;nkerr.com/a-tribute-to-roger/&lt;/ref&gt;. He was a very able and hard working student, placing first in the country in [[School Certificate (New Zealand)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://nkerr.com/a-tribute-to-roger/&lt;/ref&gt;. He held an MA (Honours, First Class) (in his Arts degree he studied French) from the [[University of Canterbury]] and a [[Bachelor of Commerce and Administration|BCA]] from [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. Dr Sir [[Roderick Deane]], the senior government official and businessman, who lectured economics, said Kerr was "the most outstanding economics student I ever had when I was teaching".&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, M. Treasury - The New Zealand Treasury, 1840-2000, (2003). p 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kerr spent much of his career in the economic policy debate in New Zealand. He was hired by Sir [[Ronald Trotter]] and Sir [[Douglas Myers]], then chairman and vice chairman of the New Zealand Business Roundtable, in 1986 as the first executive director. Kerr was a vocal proponent of [[Rogernomics]] and of policies that can be broadly characterised as free market. Before leading the Business Roundtable, he joined the [[New Zealand Treasury]] at age 32. At the Treasury he served as Director of Economics II and was part of the team of economists that authored Economic Management, the briefing paper presented to the [[Fourth Labor Government of New Zealand]], which many regard as the blueprint for the economic reforms that followed. Kerr later became an assistant secretary.

He served as a director of the [[Electricity Corporation of New Zealand]] from 1986 to 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/327728/detail|title=ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF NEW ZEALAND LIMITED|work=business.govt.nz|year=2011|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a member of the Council of [[Victoria University of Wellington]] from 1995 to 1999, and as a member of the Group Board of [[Colonial Limited]] in Melbourne from 1996 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/852714/detail|title=COLONIAL LIMITED |work=business.govt.nz|year=2011|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Kerr's time at the Treasury he worked at [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] including as a diplomat in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10763949|title=Roger Kerr: Always a few steps ahead|first=John|last=Roughan|work=nzherald.co.nz|date=5 November 2011|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kerr was married to Margaret Northcroft for over 30 years with whom he had three sons, Bernard, Nicholas and Richard, two of whom live in the United States and one of whom lives in New Zealand. The marriage to Northcroft ended in divorce. He married [[Catherine Isaac]] in January 2010. Kerr died on 28 October 2011, after battling metastatic [[melanoma]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10762465|title='National treasure' Roger Kerr dies|work=nzherald.co.nz|quote=High-profile business leader Roger Kerr has died after a year-long battle with metastatic melanoma.|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/image.cfm?c_id=3&amp;gal_objectid=10762465&amp;gallery_id=122435#8219428|title=Roger Kerr: A life in pictures|work=nzherald.co.nz|year=2011|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/5875388/Business-leader-Roger-Kerr-dies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029131629/http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/5875388/Business-leader-Roger-Kerr-dies|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2011|title=Business leader Roger Kerr dies|work=stuff.co.nz|year=2011|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10762600|title=Kerr lauded as strong advocate|work=nzherald.co.nz|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romero Rodrigues Filho''' ([[São Paulo]], October 1, 1977) is a Brazilian businessman who studied Electric Engineering at the [[Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo]]. He was a founder and president of [[BuscaPé]] (www.buscape.com), a Group that also includes the companies [[Bondfaro]], Confiômetro, CortaContas, e-Behavior, [[e-bit]], Lomadee, Pagamento Digital, FControl, Pista Certa, [[QueBarato!]] and SaveMe. At the age of 21, Romero created BuscaPé with three partners also from the University: Ronaldo Takahashi, Rodrigo Borges and Mário Letelier.

In 2009, BuscaPé was sold to the South African company Naspers for US$ 342 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Career==
Rodrigues entered the Escola Politécnica of the Universidade de São Paulo in 1995, when he was 18 years old. After his primary and secondary studies at the Colégio Visconde de Porto Seguro, in Morumbi, São Paulo, he entered the Electric Engineering course. Between 1996 and 2000, Romero worked as a researcher, as part of professional practice at the “Laboratório de Arquitetura e Redes de Computadores” (LARC) of the Poli USP, taking part in projects such as the development of Internet 2 in Brazil (RMAV), Data Base, Security and Monitoring of links. In 1998, Romero and three friends from the University, Ronaldo Takahashi, Rodrigo Borges and Mário Letelier, founded BuscaPé.

==Leadership of BuscaPé==
The first idea of what became BuscaPé surged when Rodrigo Borges was looking for a printer model on the Internet. He could not find information on the price or technical specifications of the product online. Therefore, the four friends concluded that it was an opportunity to be explored and decided to create a business that could provide a solution for that need. With investments of R$ 100 from each monthly to pay for hosting, system development and layout, the four founded BuscaPé in the “garage company” style in 1998. Romero assumed leadership of the project from the beginning, acting as president of BuscaPé. The businessman also led the process of internationalization and expansion of BuscaPé, and its sale of the company to Naspers in 2009.

'''Seaport Centre''' is a [[high-tech]] [[business park]] located in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[California]], United States, and as of 2007 is one of the largest biotechnology research complexes in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

The property consists of {{convert|623000|sqft|m2|-2}} of developed building area, and is situated in proximity to the [[Port of Redwood City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutland|first1=Laura|title=Peninsula biotech gets a boost|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/07/11/story1.html|publisher=Silicon Valley Business Journal|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=7 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property is classified as [[Class A office space]] and is constructed as a series of separate buildings.  The original lands of the Seaport Centre were used as [[salt evaporation pond]]s on tidal lands of the [[San Francisco Bay]], a land use that started sometime prior to 1940. As of 2002 leasing rates at Seaport Centre were in the range of $27 per square foot  per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ginsberg|first1=Steve|title=Low-profile projects help Catellus in `lumpy' 2002|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/02/25/newscolumn5.html|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=San Francisco Business Times|date=24 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[Slough Estates]], a United Kingdom-based [[REIT]], purchased the entirety of Seaport Centre to develop it as a [[biotechnology]] research center to compete with the existing biotech hubs in [[Silicon Valley]] and [[South San Francisco]].

The Seaport Centre is located on generally level ground at approximately {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} above [[mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schemel|first1=Laurence E.|title=Supporting Data For Hydrologic Studies in San Francisco Bay|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/ofr02231/OFR95-327.pdf|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stormwater [[surface runoff]] is pumped from Seaport Centre to discharge into [[Redwood Creek, San Mateo County|Redwood Creek]]

==Aerial photographic history==
Due to the large scale of this area and its historical lack of accessibility, the area history can be revealed well with aerial photographic records. In 1989, the firm of Earth Metrics Incorporated conducted a review of historic aerial photographs dating back to 1956.(Earth Metrics, 1989)  The Seaport Centre site and its environs, as of the 1956 aerial stereo photo, were essentially undeveloped, although extensive [[salt evaporation pond]]s were evident on site.  Redwood City Planning Department records confirm that the site was used for salt evaporation since sometime prior to [[World War II]].

Analysis of five sets of time staged stereo pairs of aerial photos reveal that the Seaport Centre site remained undeveloped until 1982; up until that time, city records show that the site was zoned as "Tidal Plain", a designation not allowing urban development.  Area land use gradually changed from 1956 until 1982, in the form of gradual building development in the local area.  As early as 1956 a [[rail tracks|rail spur]] is evident, which served the loading of raw [[sea salt]] for export from the area.  No [[agriculture|agricultural]] history is associated with the site, other than the [[salt]] harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Conomos | first=T. John | title=San Francisco Bay : The Urbanized Estuary | publisher=The Division | location=San Francisco, Calif | year=1979 | isbn=0-934394-01-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Since development of Seaport Centre in the early 1980s there has been a consistent trend of the property's use as a research and development hub for the biotech industry. In a 1989 tenant survey, some of the principal tenants present were: Vascualar Interventions Inc., Genelabs Incorporated, Precision Images Inc., Invitron, Charles Evans Inc., ICT Corporation, Resound Incorporated, Ideon Corporation, [[Cygnus_Inc|Cygnus Research Corp]], Color Prep, Aurora Systems Inc., [[Ross_Video|Abekas Video Systems Inc.]], [[Personics|Personics Inc.]], Instor Corporation and Visucom, Inc.

A number of these early firms utilized a variety of [[hazardous material]]s in their normal processes.  These substances included a variety of toxic [[solvent]]s and other [[organic chemical]]s such as [[acetone]], [[benzene]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]] and [[toluene]].  Use of such chemicals on site is considered a risk, since the [[brackish]] groundwater at the Seaport Centre is shallow.

Current tenants still largely focus on the medical and health fields and include: AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, [[Bavarian Nordic]], [[Codexis]], [[Genomic Health]], Guardant Health, Gynesonics, Minerva Surgical, [[OncoMed]], [[Stem Cell Theranostics]], and [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]].

'''''The Science of Success: How Market-Based Management Built the World's Largest Private Company''''' is a book written by [[Charles Koch]] in which he delineates his philosophy of Market Based Management (MBM). Koch, the CEO of [[Koch Industries]], Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;By 2006, Koch Industries was listed as the largest [[privately held company]] in the United States in terms of revenue, {{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/21/biz_06privates_The-Largest-Private-Companies_land.html| title= Largest Private Companies in the US|publisher= Forbes|accessdate=1 December 2011|date=9 November 2006}}having experienced a 2,000-fold growth since 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote it in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koch |first=Charles |title=The Science of Success |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |date=2 March 2007|isbn = 978-0-470-13988-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many similarly-titled books by other authors exist, [[T. Boone Pickens]] argues that Koch's immense personal business success lends credibility to the book's concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schor|first=Elana|title=In Right's Energy-Subsidy Clash, Shades of Koch vs. Pickens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/05/16/16greenwire-in-rights-energy-subsidy-clash-shades-of-koch-94124.html|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2011|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Koch has said that he initially wrote the book after the 2004 acquisition of [[Invista]] with the intent of using it as a sort of training manual to give a comprehensive picture of Koch Industries' business philosophy and to explain the principles of MBM to the new employees; Koch had initially conducted much of the training of new employees, but as the company grew, it soon became an impossible task, and necessitated the implementation of some other training method.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions – The Science of Success|url=http://www.kochind.com/files/SOSFAQ.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was later convinced to expand the "training manual" to share his philosophies with a wider audience.&lt;ref name=Greik&gt;{{cite news |title=Charles Koch: His philosophy and his company |author=Phyllis Jacobs Griekspoor |newspaper=[[Wichita Eagle]] |date=4 March 2007 |url=http://www.charleskoch.com/newsroom/news_releases_details.aspx?id=904 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912054947/http://www.charleskoch.com/newsroom/news_releases_details.aspx?id=904 |archivedate=12 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch credits much of the success of Koch Industries to effective implementation of Market Based Management (MBM),&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Science of Success'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; but indicates that it still has not been fully implemented throughout all of the [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]'s subsidiaries.&lt;ref name=Greik /&gt; The book, however, will continue to serve as a means of spreading his philosophy within the company, and Koch's hope is that it will continue to improve business practices and create value for his companies, as well as for society at large.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt;

The principles of Koch's MBM are taught to students, educators, community leaders and government officials by the [[Market-Based Management Institute]], an educational non-profit, through their partnership with the [[Wichita State University]] (WSU).

==Influences==
Koch credits two books with helping his intellectual formation: [[F.A. Harper]]'s ''[[Why Wages Rise]]'' and [[Ludwig von Mises]]' ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Science of Success'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He also credits several thinkers in his book with influencing his own thinking; most notably: [[W. Edwards Deming]], [[Michael Polanyi]], and his father, [[Fred Koch]].

After being unable to find contracts in the U.S., his father had spent time developing [[Fluid catalytic cracking|petroleum cracking]] plants in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s under the [[communist]] regime of [[Joseph Stalin]].  He came back from his experience with great contempt for the totalitarian regime, having found the USSR to be "a land of hunger, misery, and terror."&lt;ref name="Look at Communism"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Business Man Looks at Communism |last=Koch |first=Fred . |coauthors= |year=1960 |publisher=self published |location=Wichita, Kansas |url=http://digilib.usm.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/manu&amp;CISOPTR=1420&amp;CISOSHOW=1401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in part, the horrors of the totalitarian, communist regime made Fred Koch a staunch anti-communist, and a true believer in the merits of a [[free market]].&lt;ref name=newsmax&gt;{{cite web|last=Leeds|first=Mark B.|title=Charles Koch Reveals the ‘Science of Success' |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/26/142550.shtml|publisher=Newsmax.com|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free and uninhibited flow of ideas between workers and management in a relatively flat hierarchical structure that is perhaps the most central trademark of MBM&lt;ref name="BizJournals"&gt;{{cite news|title=WSU class teaching Koch's market-based management system |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/2006/03/13/story4.html| author=Bill Wilson| publisher=Wichita Business Journal | accessdate=2011-11-18| date=12 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands in stark contrast to the innovation-stifling hierarchy of the USSR.

==Overview==
Koch describes himself as a scientist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koch|first1=Charles|title=The Science of Success Summary - The Investors Podcast|url=https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TheScienceofSuccess.pdf|website=The Investors Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and uses his self-proclaimed vast knowledge of wide-ranging topics such as [[history]], [[politics]], [[government]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[Praxeology|human action]] and [[technology]] by demonstrating the ways that each affects [[business management]], decision making, and [[Profit (economics)|profitability]].

===Principles of Market Management===
The publisher lists the five dimensions of MBM, each rooted in what it calls "the Science of Human Action":&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Science of Success'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vision – Determining where and how the organization can create the greatest long-term value
# Virtue and Talents – Helping ensure that people with the right values, skills and capabilities are hired, retained and developed
# Knowledge Processes – Creating, acquiring, sharing and applying relevant knowledge, and measuring and tracking profitability
# Decision Rights – Ensuring the right people are in the right roles with the right authority to make decisions and holding them accountable
# Incentives – Rewarding people according to the value they create for the organization

In addition to describing the principles of MBM, Koch also gives an inside look into some of the important decisions that Koch Industries has made, and analysis of its successes and failures.

The book itself is not so much a [[how-to]] on running a business, but rather a philosophical treatise on effective management practices; "a way of thinking—of looking at the world and making decisions based on specific principles."&lt;ref name=Greik /&gt; 
One Forbes magazine reviewer noted that, "Readers expecting a recipe book for business success will be disappointed, but those of a more philosophical bent will find Koch's observations fascinating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koch|first1=Charles|title=The Science of Success Summary - The Investors Podcast|url=https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TheScienceofSuccess.pdf|website=The Investors Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Robert|title=Toward Heroic Capitalism|url=http://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/3676-toward-heroic-capitalism|website=The Atlas Society|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ascential logo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Ascential]] is the parent company of WGSN]] 
'''WGSN ''' (formerly World Global Style Network)&lt;ref&gt;Avery Trufelman, [http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-trend-forecast/ The Trend Forecast] 09.20.2016 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Barnett, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/8482964/Trend-spotting-is-the-new-36bn-growth-business.html Trend-spotting is the new £36bn growth business: With fortunes to be made in fickle businesses like fashion, trend forecasting is becoming increasingly important for creative industries.] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[trend forecasting]] company of [[parent organisation]] [[Ascential]]. WGSN was founded in 1998 in [[West London (sub region)|West London]] by brothers Julian and [[Marc Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;marcworth.co.uk [http://marcworth.co.uk/about-me/ About Me]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pg/WGSNofficial/about/?ref=page_internal Facebook page]&lt;/ref&gt; Emap (now [[Ascential]]), a [[business-to-business]] publisher and exhibitions company, bought the company  in October 2005 for £140m.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Moules, [https://www.ft.com/content/b890964c-e39a-11e0-8990-00144feabdc0 My liquidity moment: Marc Worth] ''[[Financial Times]]'', SEPTEMBER 29, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
In 2013, WGSN merged with its biggest competitor, Stylesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.drapersonline.com/news/best-of-wgsn-and-stylesight-to-be-combined-in-new-wgsncom-service/5062136.article|title=Best of WGSN and Stylesight to be combined in new WGSN.com service|work=Drapers|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like WGSN, Stylesight had a vast library of [[fashion forecasting]], trend information, archival photos, and even sketches and patterns for [[designer]]s to use. Keeping the WGSN name, the new product has been designed around the technology developed by Stylesight and launched in 2014.

In February 2016, [[Ascential|Ascential plc]], an international media company that includes WGSN in its portfolio, was the subject of an £800m [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wgsn-appoints-kevin-silk-as-managing-director-300306886.html WGSN Appoints Kevin Silk As Managing Director] Aug 01, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, WGSN started a global series of summits known as WGSN Futures, with events in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[São Paulo]], [[Cape Town]], [[Melbourne]], [[Dubai]] and [[Hong Kong]].{{fact|date=March 2017}}

== Products ==
As an online service, the business derives its [[revenue]]s from six different product [[subscription]]s  (WGSN Insight, WGSN Fashion, WGSN Lifestyle &amp; Interiors, WGSN Barometer, WGSN Instock, WGSN Styletrial),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wgsn.com/en/products/insight/ WGSN Insight], [https://www.wgsn.com/en/products/fashion/ WGSN Fashion], [https://www.wgsn.com/en/products/lifestyle-interiors/ WGSN Lifestyle &amp; Interiors],
