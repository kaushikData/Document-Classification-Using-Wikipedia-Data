'''''Accolade's Comics''''' (or '''''Accolade Comics''''' in the game) is an [[adventure game]] released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. Published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] and developed by [[Distinctive Software]], the game intersperses arcade-style games into its plot. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' disliked the repetitive action sequences, but admired the game's satirical tone and writing.&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;{{citation | date = June–July 1987 | last = Sylvester | first = Jasper | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Accolade's Comics  | pages = 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game play==
The protagonist of the game is Steve Keene, a man fashioned as a wisecracking secret agent.  Game play involves multiple adventures in two arenas: panels of a comic book page where dialogue and actions are selected for Steve that may or may not determine what will happen on the next panel (similar to the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book format); and traditional scrolling action boards where Steve is a moving character doing the physical task necessary (e.g. swimming, jumping, shooting) to advance through the stage. Steve can lose a life inside the comic page portions as well as the motion portions.

'''Action Park''' was an [[amusement park|amusement]] and [[water park]] located in [[Vernon Township, New Jersey|Vernon, New Jersey]], on the grounds of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski resort. The park consisted primarily of water-based attractions and originally opened to the public in 1978 under the ownership of Great American Recreation (GAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterpark.mountaincreek.com/park/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601072125/http://waterpark.mountaincreek.com/park/about/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 1, 2012 |title=Action Park Waterpark, Vernon NJ |publisher=Mountain Creek |accessdate=April 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action Park featured three separate attraction areas: the Alpine Center, Motorworld, and Waterworld. The latter was one of the first modern American water parks.&lt;ref name="Action Park About.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Arthur Levine |publisher=About.com |url=http://themeparks.about.com/cs/waterparks/a/mountaincreek_2.htm |title=The Action is back at Mountain Creek |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its attractions were unique, attracting thrill-seekers from across the [[New York City|New York]] [[New York metropolitan area|metropolitan area]]. Action Park's popularity went hand-in-hand with a reputation for poorly designed rides, under-trained, under-aged staff,&lt;ref name="Traction Park"&gt;Austin, Joanne; "Revisiting Traction ... Er, ''Action'', Park," ''[[Weird NJ]]'', October 2005, pages 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; intoxicated guests and staff, and a consequently poor safety record. At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the park, and it was given nicknames such as "[[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] Park",&lt;ref name="Traction Park"/&gt; "Accident Park", and "[[Class action|Class Action]] Park".&lt;ref name="Jersey Ed"&gt;Jersey Ed; May 2006; "We Called it Accident Park" in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; ''Weird NJ'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Little effort was made by state regulators despite a history of repeat violations. In its later years, [[Tort|personal injury]] lawsuits led to the closure of more and more rides, and eventually the entire park in 1996. 

On February 9, 1998, resort developer [[Intrawest]] announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861 - Press release announcing Intrawest's purchase of Vernon Valley - Great Gorge's ski resort, Action Park, and GAR owned real estate&lt;/ref&gt; After a massive overhaul, which included revamping rides and removing attractions deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19980425131249/http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html - Internet archive copy of a press release on Mountain Creek's website announcing the waterpark's planned opening on June 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; the waterpark was reopened as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark]].

==History==
The idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined [[Mountain Creek|Vernon Valley/Great Gorge]] ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] down one of the steep ski trails.&lt;ref&gt;"So What If There's No Snow, Go Sliding Down Hill Anyway" - Ocala Star-Banner, November 5, 1976 - https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_o9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3698%2C1193697&lt;/ref&gt;  For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two [[water slide]]s and a [[Go-kart|go-kart track]], and named the collection of rides the "Vernon Valley Summer Park".&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/towntopicsprince3328unse/towntopicsprince3328unse_djvu.txt - Town Topics (Princeton, N.J), Sep. 13, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of "Action Park". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]]. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.&lt;ref name="Traction Park"/&gt;

Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

Action Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2014/02/07/there-was-nothing-in-the-world-like-action-park/|title=There was Nothing in the World Like Action park|website=Sometimes-Interesting|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized [[insurance]] company.&lt;ref name="NJ Herald"&gt;McKay, Martha; May 12, 2005; [http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy Ultimate wine snob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234456/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy |date=December 22, 2007 }}; ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', retrieved August 27, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five [[insurance fraud]]-related charges.&lt;ref name="state investigation"&gt;New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, date not given,  [http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/hist6.pdf#search=%22%22Eugene%20Mulvihill%22%22 ''Concrete Results: Ensuring Justice, Saving Taxpayers' Money''], 47, retrieved August 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper. 

The park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.&lt;ref name="Traction Park"/&gt; Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the [[emergency room]] at a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra [[ambulance]]s to keep up with the volume.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; In September 1989, GAR negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;"OWNER AGREES TO SELL ACTION PARK, SKI AREA" - The Record (New Jersey) - September 7, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties.&lt;ref&gt;"FIRM BREAKS OFF DEAL FOR VERNON VALLEY" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - September 27, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"GREAT GORGE DEAL ICED INT'L BROADCASTING AXES ITS PURCHASE OF SKI, ACTION AREAS" - The Record (New Jersey) - September 28, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, the Action Park was being advertised as the world's largest water park.&lt;ref&gt;Action Park commercial from 1994 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoqAmcgovZw&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MTV's Headbanger's Ball with [[Alice in Chains]] at Action Park, Vernon, NJ, July 1993 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdCGfaxl7w&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the park launched a website on which visitors could find information about rides, directions to the park, and lodging, and even enter a lottery for a chance to win park tickets.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19961227075424/http://www.actionpark.com/ - Internet Archive copy of actionpark.com from December 27th, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19970412161034/http://www.actionpark.com/ - Internet Archive copy of actionpark.com from April 12th, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1991, Great American Recreation attempted to petition the [[Vernon Township, New Jersey|Vernon Township]] Committee to put a referendum on the November ballot that, if passed, would have legalized the operation of [[Game of skill|games of skill]] and [[Game of chance|chance]] at Action Park.  On September 23, the petition was rejected by the committee because only 643 of the 937 signatures on the petition came from registered voters.
&lt;ref&gt;"VERNON REJECTS PETITION ON ACTION PARK GAMES" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - September 24, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

A few rides were closed and dismantled due to costly settlements and rising insurance premiums in the 1990s, and the park's attendance began to suffer as a [[recession]] early in that decade reduced the number of visitors. In early 1995, GAR operated Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and Action Park with no liability insurance.&lt;ref&gt;"N.J. SKI AREA HAS NO LIABILITY INSURANCE BIG ACCIDENT COULD BANKRUPT IT" - The Record (New Jersey) - February 14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  New Jersey did not require it, and GAR found it more economical to go to court than purchase liability insurance, since they relied on their own self-insurance.&lt;ref&gt;"LARGEST SKI RESORT IN N.J. HAS NO LIABILITY INSURANCE" - Press of Atlantic City, The (NJ) - February 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"VERNON VALLEY SKI RESORT RELIES ON OWN INSURANCE" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - February 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, they ultimately purchased liability insurance from Evanston Insurance Company in May of that year to cover Action Park and the skiing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;"ACTION PARK, SKI AREA BUY COVERAGE" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - May 19, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; As 1995 progressed, GAR's financial woes continued to accumulate. [[First Fidelity Bank]], who lent $19 million to GAR and some 15 other connected corporations, filed suit against them in an effort to begin the process of foreclosing on the debt owed to them.&lt;ref&gt;"SUSSEX RESORTS SUED IN STEP TO FORECLOSURE" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - May 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Law firms owed money for services rendered between 1991 and 1993 also began filing suit.&lt;ref&gt;"TROUBLES MOUNT FOR VERNON RESORTS AS LAWYERS SUE FOR $175,000 IN FEES" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - May 24, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  As November approached, GAR negotiated a deal with Noramco Capital Corp. and the Praedium Fund of [[CS First Boston]], in which they would purchase the debt owed to First Fidelity, temporarily fending off an impending foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;"VERNON RESORT GETS BAILED OUT, MULVIHILL BOWS OUT" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - November 14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1996, the creditors who had taken on GAR's debt petitioned to force GAR into bankruptcy over the $14 million owed by the struggling company.&lt;ref&gt;"Debt avalanche threatens to bury ski resort Court petition seeks involuntary bankruptcy of Great American Recreation in Sussex" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - February 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; GAR filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] protection that following March, but remained optimistic that they could regain their financial footing "within a year."&lt;ref&gt;"Action Park, Vernon Valley seek court protection from creditors" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - April 3, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Action Park closed at the end of the season as usual on [[Labor Day]], September 2, 1996.  As the 1997 summer season approached, GAR remained optimistic that Action Park would open as expected on June 14, in spite of massive layoffs that occurred at the end of the prior ski season.&lt;ref&gt;"Great Gorge issues host of pink slips" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - April 19, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening date was pushed back to June 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/story-archives/june-25-1997-vernon-s-action-park-closed-for-good-1.438497|title=North Jersey|website=North Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; then mid July.&lt;ref&gt;"SEASON OF DISCONTENT Bankrupt Action Park remains out of action Great American exec cautiously optimistic on opening by July" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - June 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 1997, GAR announced the cessation of all its operations, including Action Park.&lt;ref&gt;"For Action Park, the summer's over" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - June 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of GAR in 1997, Praedium Recovery Fund purchased the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge resort, including Action Park, for $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Court accepts bid for ski area" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - September 12, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The investment group put Angel Projects in charge of managing the resort, and aimed to spend $20 million to upgrade the ski resort's equipment and trails and to remodel the water park.&lt;ref&gt;"New owner to reopen Vernon Valley slopes" - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - October 18, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian resort developer [[Intrawest]], however, purchased the park and surrounding ski area in February 1998. The company revamped the Waterworld section of Action Park and reopened it for the 1998 season as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark]], while the Motorworld and Alpine Center sections were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;"Days of beer and bungees end as Action Park goes `family' - Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - April 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alpine Center ==

===Action Park Gladiator Challenge===

The Gladiator Challenge attraction, loosely based on the television series ''[[American Gladiators]]'', opened in 1992.  It allowed guests to compete against other guests in an obstacle course, and against park-employed "Gladiators" in jousting matches.  Former bodybuilders Michael and Vince Mancuso designed the attraction, and the employees that guests would compete against in the jousting matches were found by scouting local gyms.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1147,6299177&amp;dq=action-park&amp;hl=en|title='Action' fitting name for Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|author=Rice, Bill|date=July 26, 1992|work=The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of a day, there were 3 shows, with the guests that ran the fastest obstacle course times in the earlier shows brought back to compete against each other later in the day.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt; By 1995 the attraction was removed and replaced with a beach volleyball court.

===Alpine slide===

Action Park's {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] descended the mountain beneath one of the ski area's [[chairlift]]s, which provided guests access to the top of the slide. Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as "death awaits".&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; The chutes the sleds travelled in were made of [[concrete]], [[fiberglass]], and [[asbestos]], which led to serious [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in [[bathing suit]]s made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and [[expectoration|spitting]] from passengers going up for their turn.&lt;ref name="Gethard"&gt;Gethard, Chris; October 2005, "Brothers in Wounded Arms (And Legs) Serving Together at Action Park," ''Weird NJ'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slide led to the first fatality at the park, a [[head injury]] suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a large embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him. [[Hay bale]]s at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 [[Bone fracture|fracture]]s and 26 [[head injury|head injuries]].&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; 

When [[Intrawest]] reopened the water park as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark|Mountain Creek]] in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear [[helmet]]s and [[kneepad]]s. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's [[Labor Day]] was rainy and the slide had to be closed.

The chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the [[gondola lift|gondola]] that replaced the chairlift.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;  The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an [[alpine coaster]], which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster.

===Snapple Snap-Up Whipper Snapper Ride===
In 1991, Action Park opened up a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, two-station [[bungee jumping]] tower near the alpine slide.  The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19920726&amp;id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1147,6299177 - "'Action' Fitting Name For Northern New Jersey Amusement Park" - The Daily Gazette - July 26, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996.

===Skateboard park===
A [[skatepark]] briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine ''[[Weird NJ]]'' as saying that the "skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed".&lt;ref name="Tom Fergus"&gt;Fergus, Tom; May 2006; "Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts", in [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"]; ''Weird NJ'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmobile===
The Transmobile was a [[monorail]] that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff, and riders who either did not understand—-or did not want to follow the rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecenteroftheaction.blogspot.com/2010/05/showdown-at-transmobile.html "Showdown at the Transmobile" post at The Center of the Action blog&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's [[Miniature golf|mini golf]] course.&lt;ref&gt;http://abnf.co/NJ-action_park.htm Abandoned But Not Forgotten's Action Park page&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motorworld ==
Action Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]], opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a [[condominium]] development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the [[Mountain Creek]] ski resort.
=== Land rides ===
*'''Super Go Karts''': The Super [[Go-kart|Go Karts]] allowed guests to drive around a small loop [[Race track|track]] at a speed of about 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h), controlled by the [[governor (device)|governor devices]] on the karts. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging [[tennis ball]]s into them, and they were known to do so for guests. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine kart ride became an opportunity to play [[bumper cars]] at 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h), and many injuries resulted from [[head-on collision]]s.&lt;ref name="Traction Park"/&gt; Also, the kart's engines were poorly maintained and some riders were overcome by [[gasoline]] fumes as they drove.&lt;ref name="Traction Park"/&gt;
*'''LOLA Cars''': The LOLA Cars were miniature [[Open wheel car|open-cockpit race cars]] on a longer track. Extra money was charged to drive them, and they, too, could be adjusted for speed by park employees, with similarly harmful consequences to riders.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; Former employees have said that, after park management briefly set up a [[microbrewery]] nearby, employees would break into the brewery, steal the beer, and then take the cars out and ride them on Route 94.&lt;ref name="Tom Fergus" /&gt;
*'''Battle Action Tanks''': Battle Action Tanks was one of the most popular rides in Motorworld, and it was featured prominently in television ads. For an additional fee, guests could enter a [[chainlink]] fence-enclosed area and operate small tanks for five minutes at a time. The tanks were equipped with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a [[sensor]] prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other guests often took advantage of the delay to hit the disabled vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also utilize less-costly cannons mounted on the perimeter fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which often happened several times a day, they were commonly pelted with tennis balls, despite prohibitions against such behavior. This gave the ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the guests,&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; making it one of the least popular places to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2018, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.

=== Watercraft rides ===
*'''Super Speedboats''': The Super Speedboats were set up in a small pond, known by park staff to be heavily infested with [[snake]]s.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; They could be driven around a small island at 35-40&amp;nbsp;mph (56–64&amp;nbsp;km/h). While, unlike the land vehicles, there was no way to tamper and increase their speed, many riders nonetheless used them to play bumper boats, and one seriously inebriated rider had to be rescued by the attendant [[lifeguard]] after his boat [[capsize]]d following a collision.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;
*'''Bumper Boats''': Bumper Boats was a supposedly safer ride than the Super Speedboats, but the [[engine]]s often leaked [[gasoline]], at least once requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much of it on his [[skin]]. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, resulting in them hanging off of the sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

=== Air rides ===
* '''Space Shot''': The Space Shot attraction was a tower [[Drop tower|drop ride]], common in many amusement parks. This ride was opened for the park's final season in 1996, and again under [[Mountain Creek]] management in 1998. In July 1998 the ride was purchased by the [[Six Flags]]-owned [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] theme park in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;"CATAPULTED INTO AMUSEMENT PARK HISTORY" - The Record (New Jersey) - July 24, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sling Shot''': Sling Shot was a [[Funtime (manufacturer)|bungee cord ride]] in which two riders sat in a seat and were strapped in while the ride was shot up in the air and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many [[Six Flags]] parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. "We often wondered how many [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] cases came out of that ride", one former employee recalled.&lt;ref name="Jersey Ed" /&gt;

== Waterworld ==

Water-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] count.  Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions.

=== Cannonball Loop ===
[[Image:Action Park looping water slide.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Cannonball Loop'', the infamous looping water slide, was only opened for brief periods in Action Park's existence.]]
In the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a [[Loop (roller coaster)|complete vertical loop]] at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster.&lt;ref name="Looping water slide picture"&gt;See picture on [http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/forums/cgi/forum1.cgi?read=153156 this discussion thread]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting slide, called the ''Cannonball Loop'', was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|a hundred dollars]] to test it. Fergus, who described himself as "one of the idiots" who took the offer, said, "$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory."&lt;ref name="Tom Fergus" /&gt;

The slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; One worker told a local newspaper that "there were too many bloody noses and back injuries" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in ''Weird NJ'', that some of the [[crash test dummy|test dummies]] sent down before it opened had been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[decapitation|decapitated]].&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a [[Trapdoor|hatch]] had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

The ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown.

Those who rode the ''Cannonball Loop'' have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.&lt;ref name="Steve Braybrook"&gt;Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ "A Survivor from Action Park Writes In"], in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the remainder of the park's existence, ''Cannonball Loop'' remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed.

In 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the ''Cannonball Loop'' was unearthed and published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rare-video-of-people-actually-riding-action-parks-infam-1563953390 |title=Rare Video Of People Actually Riding Action Park's Infamous Water Slide |author=Barry Petchesky |work=The Concourse |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other notable water attractions ===
*'''The Tidal Wave Pool''': The first patron death occurred here in 1982; another visitor [[drowning|drowned]] in this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, the number of people the [[lifeguard]]s saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, "The Grave Pool".&lt;ref name="Traction Park"/&gt; It was {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|250|ft|m}} long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as 40&amp;nbsp;inches (102&amp;nbsp;cm) in height.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not [[human swimming|swim]] when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim sometimes exhausted themselves, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a [[swimming pool|pool]] or [[lake]].&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the "High Tide Wavepool" but made the pool much shallower.
*'''Aqua Skoot''': Invented by Ken Bailey in the early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/amusementrides/amusement-rides-by-bailey - Amusements by Bailey slideshow&lt;/ref&gt; riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled up to the top of the ride, go down a slide consisting of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally.  At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was {{convert|30|ft}} long.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/2760035_1_water-rides-water-slides-water-park/2 - "Plunge, If You Dare, Into The Watery Fun At New Jersey Park", The Morning Call, July 29, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998; the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section.  The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.
*'''Kamikaze''': This was the more "tame" water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and featured several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a "chute" which pitched steeply at first and then went up and down several times before ending in a pool.  It survived the Mountain Creek redesign, but was removed and scrapped following the 2009 season.
*'''The Kayak Experience''': After the second visitor death in the park's history in 1982 occurred at this ride, it was closed permanently. It was an imitation [[whitewater]] course that used submerged electric [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to agitate the water above. Frequently the [[kayak]]s got stuck or tipped over, and people had to get out of them to remedy the situation.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;&lt;!---- Former park employee Chris Ish says this was in Waterworld; if his account gets published, this will be included here. -----&gt;
*'''The Tarzan Swing''': This was a steel arch hanging from a {{convert|20|ft|m|sing=on}}-long [[Wire rope|cable]] over a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines for the chance to hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; In 1984, one man died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after experiencing the swing.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;
*'''Roaring Rapids''': This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride. Reports that the park filed with the state in 1984 noted fractured [[femur]]s, [[collar bone]]s and [[Human nose|nose]]s, and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] [[knee]]s and [[shoulder]]s. This attraction is still open. The left side is known as The Gauley and riders use a single tube. The right side is known as Thunder Run and is a double tube rafting ride.
*'''Surf Hill''': This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the "back breaker", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby [[snack bar]] with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost [[bikini]] tops, or both.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.
*'''Super Speed Water Slides''': These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water—which made a large splash—and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;
*'''Diving cliffs''': The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of [[grotto]], with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving [[cliff]]s—one 23 feet (7 m), the other 18 feet (5.4 m)—above a 16-foot (5 m) deep pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them—or right on top of them.  The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.&lt;ref name="Gethard" /&gt; Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.&lt;ref name="Tom Fergus" /&gt; Still operating, known as Canyon Cliffs.
*'''Colorado River Ride''': The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 4-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes.  Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed.  After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork.
**'''The Main Fork''': Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks.  Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a foot-high (30&amp;nbsp;cm) jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.
**'''The Alternative Forks''': Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,&lt;ref&gt;1991 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xXcQdVr1Zg&lt;/ref&gt; and another fork.  One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end.  The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;Mountain Creek Colorado River Ride footage from 2013 showing both points where the alternative pathways reconnected with the main path of the ride. (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyiD_lk-4Fk&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;1987 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iJoL1Q9FY&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today.  Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;
: Originally, riders rode this attraction two at a time, in yellow inflatable [[dinghy|dinghies]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  This was later replaced with large circular four-person rafts.  In the [[Mountain Creek]] era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill.  Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough.  It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to ''[[Weird NJ]]'' how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.&lt;ref name="Greg Shpunder"&gt;Shpunder, Greg; May 2006; "Action Park Designed to Hurt People" in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; ''Weird NJ'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck – requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft – or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.&lt;ref&gt;More Action Park footage from 1991 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2gxQGF1Wc&lt;/ref&gt;  Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.

===The Aerodium===
The Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984.  In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium.  The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aerodium.com/general_information.htm - The Aerodium Story, Aero Interactive Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the [[bodyflight]] instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of 6 or 7 feet (2 m) above the ground, approximately a foot or two over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.

==Factors contributing to the park's safety record==

A range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.

===Ride design===

Action Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long.  Ride designers may have had insufficient training in [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. "They seemed to build rides," one attendee recalled, "not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them."&lt;ref name="Callan"&gt;Callan, Matthew; Nov. 22, 2000, [http://www.freezerbox.com/archive/article.php?id=235 In Memoriam: Action Park], ''Freezerbox''.&lt;/ref&gt;

GAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. (In the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain [[liability insurance]]).

===Employees===

The vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were [[teenager]]s. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.&lt;ref name="Jim DeSaye"&gt;DeSaye, Jim; May 2006; "From Former Vermin Valley Great Gorge Manager" in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Visitors===

Since it was closer and slightly cheaper than [[Six Flags Great Adventure]], Action Park attracted many visitors from [[Urban area|urban]] enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.&lt;ref name="Jim DeSaye" /&gt;

The staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

Since many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of [[profanity|foul language]] (not always planned) and [[exhibitionism]] as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.&lt;ref name="Gethard" /&gt;

=== Availability of alcohol on grounds ===

The park also sold beer in many [[kiosk]]s on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jim DeSaye" /&gt;

===Lax regulatory climate===

Despite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was [[fine (penalty)|fine]]d only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses—except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

Some of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

==Fatalities==
{{main article|Incidents at independent amusement parks}}
Six people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:

*July 8, 1980: A 19-year-old park employee was riding the Alpine Slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents"/&gt;
*July 24, 1982: A 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents"&gt;[http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html Water Ride Fatalities 1972-1997] at rideaccidents.com, retrieved January 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=New York Times |title=Brooklyn Man Drowns in Pool At a Jersey Amusement Park |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DE1038F934A1575BC0A962948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fA%2fAmusement%20and%20Theme%20Parks |accessdate=2006-08-26 |date=August 27, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old man from [[Long Island]] got out of his tipped [[kayak]] on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live [[wire|wiring]] for the underwater fans that somehow became exposed and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into [[cardiac arrest]]. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby [[Warwick (village), New York|Warwick, New York]] where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents" /&gt; The park at first disputed that the [[electric current]] caused his death, saying there were no [[burn (injury)|burns]] on his body, but the [[coroner]] responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based [[electrocution]].&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was "just a nick", while others argued it was closer to 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm). The state's [[New Jersey Department of Labor|Labor Department]] found that the fan was properly maintained and installed and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however, it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents" /&gt; The park claimed it had been vindicated, although it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;
*1984 (Date Unknown): A fatal heart attack suffered by one visitor was unofficially believed to have been triggered by the shock of the cold water in the pool beneath the Tarzan Swing. The water on the ride and in that swimming area was 50-60&amp;nbsp;°F (10-16&amp;nbsp;°C) while other water areas were in the 70-80&amp;nbsp;°F (21-27&amp;nbsp;°C) range more typical of swimming pools. The Tarzan Swing and the Cannonball ride in this area were operated by spring water.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Action Park was a cultural touchstone for many [[Generation X]]-ers who grew up in [[North Jersey|North]] and [[Central Jersey]], as well as nearby locales in New York and Connecticut. A popular list of "You Know You're from New Jersey When ..." that circulates in [[email]] begins with, "You've been seriously injured at Action Park."&lt;ref name="You know you're from NJ when ..."&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010211000238/http://soli.inav.net/~catalyst/Humor/jersey.htm "You Know You're from New Jersey When ..."] at inav.net, retrieved January 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some even credit the park for making them learn some difficult lessons. In 2000, one Matthew Callan recalled Action Park thus:

{{cquote|Action Park made adults of a generation of Tri-State Area kids who strolled through its blood-stained gates, by teaching us the truth about life: it is not safe, you will get hurt a lot, and you'll ride all the way home burnt beyond belief.&lt;ref name="Callan" /&gt;}}

[[Chris Gethard]], a writer for ''[[Weird NJ]]'' and the associated book series, concurs:

{{cquote|Action Park was a true [[rite of passage]] for any New Jerseyan of my generation. When I get to talking about it with other Jerseyans, we share stories as if we are veterans who served in combat together. I suspect that many of us may have come closest to death on some of those rides up in Vernon Valley. I consider it a true shame that future generations will never know the terror of proving their grit at New Jersey's most dangerous amusement park.&lt;ref name="Gethard" /&gt;}}

On August 1, 1993, MTV's ''[[Headbanger's Ball]]'' taped an episode at the park. The host, [[Riki Rachtman]], interviewed and went on the rides with the band [[Alice In Chains]].

Action Park was the topic of the first episode of the [[Relay FM]] podcast ''Ungeniused'' in June 2016, which explores the legacy of the park, how unsafe it was, and why people continued to visit it.

The original version of the park's notoriety for its unsafe reputation inspired a film by Jackass star [[Johnny Knoxville]]; filming started in March 2017 and wrapped in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nj1015.com/johnny-knoxville-is-done-shooting-the-action-park-movie/|title=Johnny Knoxville is done shooting the 'Action Park' movie!|website=New Jersey 101.5 – Proud to be New Jersey – New Jersey News Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pix11.com/2017/02/02/action-park-movie-will-star-johnny-knoxville-report/|title=Action Park movie will star Johnny Knoxville: report|date=2 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6495770/|title=Action Point|date=1 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released under the title ''[[Action Point]]'' by [[Paramount Pictures]] on June 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/03/21/johnny-knoxville-action-point-trailer/ |title=Johnny Knoxville runs a stunt-filled amusement park in Action Point trailer |last=Holub |first=Christian |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 21, 2018 |access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the whole Mountain Creek ski area and water park was sold&lt;ref name="Mulvihill repurchase"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/05/mountain_creek_resort_sold_to.html|title=Mountain Creek resort in N.J. sold to developer Gene Mulvihill|last=Perone|first=Joseph|date=May 27, 2010|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|accessdate=September 12, 2010|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=[[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Great American Recreation and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort; however, he died two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.njherald.com/story/19934115/visionary-developer-eugene-mulvihill-dies#|title=‘Visionary' developer Eugene Mulvihill dies|date=2012-10-27|work=New Jersey Herald|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150819/FREE/150819897/franklin-templeton-billionaire-escapes-contentious-lawsuit|title=Franklin Templeton billionaire escapes contentious lawsuit|last=Hunnicutt|first=Trevor|website=www.investmentnews.com|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new ownership the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park, starting with the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/28/the-return-of-the-worlds-most-dangerous-theme-park/|title=The dangerous return of the world’s most insane theme park - New York Post|work=New York Post|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Mountain Creek Waterpark name was restored to the park, thus retiring the Action Park name again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mcwaterpark.com/park-info|title=Park Info - Mountain Creek Water Park|work=Mountain Creek Water Park|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoff locations==

===Pocono Action Park and Motorworld===
On April 14, 1980, Pocono Action Park Inc. was formed by Great American Recreation, which later opened Pocono Action Park and Motorworld. Located in the town of [[Tannersville, Pennsylvania]], it had a Waterworld section with slides and tube rides, as well as a Motorworld section featuring many of the same racing themed attractions—including LOLA race cars and go-karts—as the Vernon park.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  By late 1991,&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.videoparadise-sanjose.com/1990arcades.htm" A listing of amusement park locations that had arcades as of January 1st, 1991, which lists Pocono Action Park of Tannersville, PA&lt;/ref&gt; the park was closed.  The rides were torn down in stages, and [[The Crossings Premium Outlets]] was built over the location. Even after the park closed, however, Pocono Action Park Inc. continues to exist, and is listed as an active business.&lt;ref&gt;"http:/t/www.bizapedia.com/pa/POCONO-ACTION-PARK-INC.html" Business information for Pocono Action Park, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action Mountain===
In June 1984, Stony Point Recreation, a subsidiary of GAR, opened Action Mountain in [[Pine Hill, New Jersey]]. The park offered an alpine slide, go-karts, LOLA race cars, bumper boats, speed slides, tube slides, swimming pools, as well as a diving platform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7IQMukct3E - WPHL 17 commercial block from the mid 80s with a commercial for Action Mountain&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1986, Stony Point Recreation had accumulated some $398,697 in back taxes owed to the town of Pine Hill, and in an effort to relieve the debt sold off the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-04-05/news/26142997_1_182-acre-site-single-family-home-or-townhouse-tax-rolls |title=Judge Approves Sale Of Action Mountain Site |date=Apr 5, 1989 |work=Philadelphia Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, the site was redeveloped into the Pine Hill Golf Course.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4282">'''Afro-Peruvian music''',  or '''Música negra''', is a type of [[Latin American music]] first developed by black slaves from West Africa in Peru, where it is known as ''música criolla''. The genre is a mix of West African  and [[Spanish music]].

==About==
Música Criolla includes flamenco-influenced guitar sounds, as well as percussion instruments, including [[cajon]], [[Cajita (instrument)|cajita]], cowbell and [[quijada]].

==History==
Much of the original music has been lost, but in the 1950s a revival was staged by [[José Durand]], a white Peruvian criollo who was a folklore professor, and Porfirio Vásquez.  Durand founded the Pancho Fierro Dance Company.  Drawing upon elderly members of the community for memories of musical traditions, Durand collaborated with Vásquez to revive various songs and dances to create the repertoire for the group.  One of the best known is his revival of the carnival dance “El Son de los Diablos.”  In colonial times, this dance was featured in parades with a fleet of austere, pure angels leading the way, followed by the mischievous devils.  In the revival of the dance, the angels were eliminated, and the crowds were entertained by rambunctious devils and their leader “el diablo mayor.”  The dance featured energetic [[zapateo]] tap-dancing. The group performed for about two years, including a concert for Peruvian composer [[Chabuca Granda]] and a tour through Chile.

Actually, poet Nicomendes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz (siblings) both created Cumanana (1957) an Afroperuvian ensemble that highlighted the rich West and Central African call and response poetry, music / dance traditions that were a staple of Peruvian culture and are essentially valued to this day.

One long lasting Afro-Peruvian dance company was [[Perú Negro]], which, incorporated more modern use of percussion combined with criollo music.  Perú Negro is also known for their use of [[blackface]], celebrating the mixture of African and Spanish heritage.  Two of their best known pieces are “Dance of the Laundresses,” which depicts historical hard working yet beautiful black women in Peru, and the “Canto a Elegua,” which shows tribal religion before the Spanish influence.

Lima and Chincha are two areas where there are many performers of this music, which is played in night clubs, dinner dances and festivals.&lt;ref name="MillerWilliams1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4781">'''Automavision''' is a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic technique]] invented by Danish director [[Lars von Trier]].

Developed with the intention of limiting human influence, in Automavision no [[cinematographer]] is actively operating the camera. The best possible [[Camera angle|fixed camera position]] is chosen and then a computer chooses [[Framing (visual arts)|framing]] by randomly [[Tilt (camera)|tilting]], [[Panning (camera)|panning]] or [[Zooming (filmmaking)|zooming]] the camera. In doing so it is not uncommon that the actors appear in the shots with a part of their face and head cut from the frame. With this technique then the blame for any "errors" are entirely attributable to a computer.&lt;ref name="Piil2008"&gt;{{cite book

Von Trier described Automavision as "a principle for shooting film developed with the intention of limiting human influence by inviting chance in from the cold (...) and thus giving the work an idea-less surface free of the force of habit and aesthetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle was used during filming of the movie ''[[The Boss of It All]]'' (2006). Interviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006, von Trier said, "For a long time, my films have been [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. That has to do with the fact that I am a [[control freak]]. With Automavision, the technique was that I would frame the picture first and then push a button on the computer. I was not in control&amp;nbsp;— the computer was in control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Story and episodes==
Depending on the season, the show either follows a man or a woman who is looking for the perfect mate from a pool of contestants, or has contestants living together in a mansion competing for a cash prize. Season one showcases fireman Mark Orlando ([[Ken Marino]]) as the bachelor. Season two of the series, which premiered in February 2013, stars [[June Diane Raphael]] reprising her role as season one contestant Julie, now the bachelorette given the chance to find the perfect man. Season three also premiered in 2013 and starred former contestants from seasons one and two competing for a $900 prize rather than for love (similar to ''Bachelor'' spin-off, ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'').&lt;ref name="popwatch1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stransky |first=Tanner |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/12/03/burning-love-ken-marino-seasons-2-and-3-exclusive/ |title=Ken Marino talks 'Burning Love' seasons 2 and 3 - EXCLUSIVE &amp;#124; PopWatch &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Popwatch.ew.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season chronology===
The seasons of the show as listed do not match the internally referenced season chronology because of two fictitious seasons. Internally season one references the Joe Rutherford (Ben Stiller) season, and seasons two and three reference the Annie (Abigail Spencer) season. Neither of these seasons actually occurred but are frequently mentioned during the course of various real episodes. Season three also announced a nonexistent season with superfan Hathwell Crisping.

'''''China Doll''''' is a two-act play by [[David Mamet]] about political corruption and brutal violence.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The play opened on Broadway at the end of 2015 with a short run scheduled to close at the end of January 2016.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The two-act play contains only two characters who appear on stage throughout the play, Mickey and Carson.

==Plot==
===Act One===
Mickey is an elderly retiring political operative and political fixer in the USA who is planning an elaborate May–December wedding to a young fiancé who is a British national citizen. Mickey is planning to retire in style with his great wealth by arranging for the purchase of a luxurious private jet made in Switzerland for himself and his soon-to-be wife. An entanglement arises when Mickey receives a telephone call in his office indicating that the $5 million tax-saving scheme he has planned for his private jet purchase has gone sour. The foreign Swiss jet was supposed to fully stay out of the USA for six months for the $5 million tax-saving scheme to succeed. An apparently trivial malfunction caused the jet to land temporarily on USA soil, thus seemingly invalidating Mickey's tax-saving scheme. Not only that, but after the jet finally arrives at its original destination in Toronto, its single passenger, his fiancé, is subjected to a full strip search while being refused entry into Canada. Mickey goes ballistic when he receives this telephone report in his office. He threatens to renege on delivery of the jet on which he still has not fully signed-off, and he suspects mischief from a new political candidate and contender in the USA with whom he has a history. Mickey begins to suspect that the new candidate, known to him as "the Kid", is the source of upsetting Mickey's $5 million tax saving scheme, and for causing the false report in Toronto which caused his fiancé to be denied entry in Canada and to be strip searched.

===Act Two===
By the next morning, Mickey realizes that he may have overplayed his hand in lashing out against the jet manufacturer, against his assistant Carson, and against the political operatives of "the Kid". "The Kid" is likely to be the next governor of his State, with many inside ties and favors coming his way from the Federal government by way of "the Kid's" inside government connections. Mickey's worst nightmare comes true when he receives a phone call in his office telling him that "the Kid" has pulled in his Federal government "favors" in order to get Mickey formally charged with a Federal indictment for violation and conspiracy against the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]], since the jet purchase he was arranging originated under Swiss manufacture from a Swiss contract. Mickey's only life-line is a dirty-secrets political file he has kept on "the Kid's" family of political office holders, and Mickey uses it to make a plea deal on the phone to "buy" himself out of the Federal Indictment on him against the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]. The deal requires his assistant, Carson, to play along, since Federal marshals have already been dispatched to arrest Mickey. Carson decides that Mickey is not to be trusted, and that Mickey will sell Carson out as part of Mickey's own plea deal. Carson resolves to abscond with Mickey's dirty-secrets political file right under Mickey's eyes, in order to let himself make his own exonerating plea deal for himself. Mickey gets the jump on Carson before Carson can get out the door and mortally bludgeons him with a heavy-gauge metallic scale model of the jet which he was about to purchase. As the dispatched federal marshalls are heard knocking at his office door, Mickey reverses his tactics once again and starts self-inflicting bloody wounds on his own body while shouting to the federal marshals standing outside his door, "Help me. Will... Will... Oh my God. Will no one help an old man...?", at the final curtain as the play ends.

==List of characters==
*'''Mickey''', a retiring elderly political operative and political fixer.
*'''Carson''', his in-office assistant and secretary.

Several off-stage characters are portrayed as participating in telephone conversation with Mickey while Mickey is in his private office whose voices are not heard during the play, but only inferred by Mickey's interaction with them while speaking into his telephone on stage.

==Production==
The play began previews on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre]] on October 21, 2015 with the official opening originally scheduled for November 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cox, Gordon|url=https://variety.com/2015/legit/news/al-pacino-china-doll-dates-broadway-1201465326/|title=Al Pacino in ‘China Doll’ Sets Dates for Broadway|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 9, 2015, the producers announced that the official opening was moved to December 4, 2015, stating "The move allows the creative team additional time to work on the play before its world premiere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Viagas, Robert|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/with-more-work-needed-david-mamet-drama-china-doll-starring-al-pacino-delays-opening-370849#|title=With More Work Needed, David Mamet Drama 'China Doll', Starring Al Pacino, Delays Opening|work=[[Playbill]]|date=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play opened on December 4, 2015 in a limited engagement for 97 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Viagas, Robert|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/david-mamet-drama-china-doll-starring-al-pacino-opens-on-broadway-374036#|title=David Mamet Drama 'China Doll', Starring Al Pacino, Opens on Broadway|work=[[Playbill]]|date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Pacino]] plays [[billionaire]] "Mickey Ross" and [[Christopher Denham]] plays his assistant "Carson" in the two-character play.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=David|title=Al Pacino will star in new David Mamet play|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-al-pacino-david-mamet-broadway-20141016-story.html|accessdate=28 July 2015|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APKranz&gt;{{cite news|title=David Mamet's 'China Doll' Adds Fran Kranz Opposite Pacino|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/04/02/arts/ap-us-theater-china-doll.html?_r=0|accessdate=28 July 2015|agency=AP|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=denham&gt;{{cite web|author=Gans, Andrew|author2=Viagas, Robert|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/christopher-denham-replaces-fran-kranz-in-china-doll-starring-al-pacino-david-mamet-play-extends-run-358394#|title=Christopher Denham Replaces Fran Kranz in 'China Doll', Starring Al Pacino; David Mamet Play Extends Run|work=[[Playbill]]|date=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play is directed by [[Pam MacKinnon]], with scenery by [[Derek McLane]], lighting by Russell H. Champa and costumes by [[Jess Goldstein]].&lt;ref name=denham/&gt;

Pacino said of his character and the play: "...'one of the most daunting and challenging roles I've been given to explore onstage. It's a special gift to originate a role in the theatre, especially written by such a formidable writer, and I haven't done that in a long, long time...' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gans, Andrew|author2=Viagas, Robert|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/tix-to-al-pacinos-broadway-return-in-david-mamets-china-doll-on-sale-today-350707#|title=Tix to Al Pacino's Broadway Return in David Mamet's 'China Doll' On Sale Today|work=[[Playbill]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2016, ''Playbill'' reported that the producer of the play Jeffrey Richards summarized the short-run on Broadway stating: "It’s been ultimately very rewarding because of the work that’s been done during the actual run of the play. The ending has been changed by the playwright, and the audiences have embraced it recently, which has been very encouraging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Mamet's China Doll, Starring Al Pacino, Turns a Profit|author=Viagas, Robert|date=January 21, 2016|work=[[Playbill]]|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/david-mamets-china-doll-starring-al-pacino-turns-a-profit-381355#sthash.MfuvFVXj.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''China Doll'' has been largely negative. [[Michael Riedel (journalist)|Michael Riedel]], theatre columnist for the ''[[New York Post]]'' called it a "terrible new play"... "Preview audiences are having none of it. The exodus at intermission is practically a stampede, and sources say some have angrily demanded refunds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riedel |first=Michael |url=https://nypost.com/2015/10/29/al-pacino-totally-lost-over-his-terrible-new-broadway-play/ |title=Al Pacino needs teleprompters for lines in terrible new Broadway play|work=[[New York Post]] |date=2015-10-29 |accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a retooling of the play, the December 2015 review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "One of the biggest problems (though not the only one) in comprehending ''China Doll'' is that Mr. Pacino's lurching, stammering performance is not easy to follow in terms of content, character or subtext. There has been more than enough evidence in the past to certify that Mr. Pacino is a bona fide genius, so let's assume that there are reasons for what he's doing here."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/theater/review-in-david-mamets-china-doll-al-pacino-as-an-urban-warrior-in-winter.html |title=Review: In David Mamet’s ‘China Doll,’ Al Pacino as an Urban Warrior in Winter|author=Brantley, Ben|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 review of the play, ''[[PopMatters]]'' magazine wrote "For all of its follies, ''China Doll'', which has a limited run at [[Manhattan]]'s Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, is unlike anything Mamet has written before", and "In the abstract ''China Doll'' sounds like a rigorous but doable challenge; in performance, the play outstays its welcome. This two scene and nearly two hour play has, at most, enough dramatic momentum for one act."&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=David Mamet and Al Pacino's 'China Doll' Rat-a-Tats Without the Tat|author=Ezell, Brice|date=26 January 2016|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/david-mamet-and-al-pacinos-china-doll-rat-a-tats-without-the-tat/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Variety'' magazine in May 2016 summarized ''China Doll'' as having suffered from "bad-buzz" media coverage once plans for Mamet's new 2017 play were announced stating: "David Mamet's first play following the bad-buzz magnet ''China Doll'' has been added to the 2016–17 season at the Atlantic Theater Company, the Off Broadway troupe that Mamet co-founded... Details are scarce on the latest from Mamet, whose Broadway outing ''China Doll'' stirred up controversy and crummy word of mouth earlier this season but still turned a profit. The untitled new play, to be directed by Atlantic artistic director Neil Pepe, is described as written 'specifically for Atlantic’s ensemble,' and will run February through April on the theater's mainstage, with exact dates to be set."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Cox.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">'''Continuará…''' was a [[fan convention]] for fans of [[comics]], [[anime]], [[role-playing games]], [[fantasy]] and [[strategy games]], among others.

The event took place in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and was usually held on the second week of November. The first one took place on 24 and 25 November 2007, and attracted more than 1,000 participants.&lt;ref name="elpais" /&gt;

==Activities==
The main focus of "Continuará..." were activities such as [[Quizzes]], a [[Cosplay]] contest, a [[Karaoke]] contest,  [[Paintball]] and a massive [[Twister (game)|Twister]] competition.

It is the reboot of the ''[[Dead to Rights]]'' franchise featuring Grant City police officer Jack Slate and his [[domestic dog|canine]] companion Shadow.  Developed by [[Volatile Games]] and published by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Namco Bandai Games]] under the Namco label for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], the game was released in April 2010 (or July in Japan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-to-rights-retribution-first-look/1100-6208757/ | title=Dead to Rights Retribution First Look | author=Brian Ekberg | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=April 28, 2009 | accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5160044/dead-to-rights-retribution-coming-this-year | title=Dead to Rights: Retribution Coming This Year | author=Brian Crecente | publisher=[[Kotaku]] | date=February 25, 2009 | accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins with Jack collapsing on a dock after disembarking from a tugboat, and is confronted by members of the Grant City Triad, who intend to kill him as revenge for earlier events. Shadow, Jack's dog, brutally kills all of the Triad members who try to attack Jack on his way to a bar where he meets his friend, an EMT named Faith Sands, and goes into the story of what happened in the game. He flashes back to a terrorist takeover of Temple Tower, where he disobeys orders from Captain Inness and charges in, killing members of the Union gang, saving hostages and pursuing Riggs, the leader of the gang, to the roof where he escapes via a futuristic helicopter. Jack believes Riggs has military training after seeing how the Union were armed and organized. Jack is saved from Inness firing him by SWAT Captain Redwater, who is a friend of Jack and his father, Frank Slate, who takes Jack and Shadow to investigate a lead on Riggs. They discover plans and simulated versions of the Temple Tower studio, and are drawn into a gunfight when Redwater arrives with the SWAT.

After holding out until more SWAT teams arrive, Frank and Jack pursue Riggs and a Triad member, splitting up to do so. Jack succeeds in arresting the Triad, but finds Frank mortally wounded nearby. Faith arrives and tries to save Frank, but fails, and Jack storms off after beating up the Triad brutally and goes to find out why his father was killed. He stops an attempted Triad bombing at Grant City Central, defeats their leader, Tseng, in hand-to-hand combat, and then returns to the area where his father was killed. He discovers that Riggs is a member of the newly formed GAC (Grant City Anti Crime Unit), which was formed by Julian Temple and now approved by the city to deal with crime in ways that go against standard ethics and protocol. Jack fights his way past GAC soldiers and destroys GAC dropships, but is knocked out by Redwater, who kills Riggs after hearing a recorded conversation between Temple and Riggs, who plot to kill Redwater. Jack manages to escape the slowly rising dropship he and Redwater are on, and Redwater's fate is left unknown when the C4 Jack attached to the ship detonates while being tossed away by Redwater.

The game picks up at the bar, where Jack reveals that he detects Faith has deceived him, and she admits she was persuaded by the GAC to help locate him. Faith is wounded by a sniper, and Jack manages to evacuate her on a helicopter she called before being shot, and is dropped off at Temple Tower, where he arrests Temple, who tries to bribe him into letting him go by revealing that Redwater killed Frank, choosing to follow his father's way instead of killing Temple in cold blood. He takes Temple to the precinct he and his father work at, and discovers all regular and SWAT officers have been imprisoned for resisting GAC control. Jack imprisons Temple and frees the officers, who help to free the precinct and call patrol officers back to fight off attacking GAC troops-with help from Captain Inness, who is now glad to work Jack's way and even sends out the transmission to call for backup. Jack takes a dead GAC soldier's armor and sneaks into the GAC Alpha Base in a rundown hospital on an island. He manages to make a distraction that lets the GCPD storm the base while Jack provides sniper cover for Inness, Shadow, and a SWAT team that manages to break into the main area. Jack helps to fight off multiple GAC troops and then pursues Redwater.

Jack takes control of a GAC Tank Armor and fights his way through dozens of GAC while furiously arguing with Redwater, offering him the chance to surrender like Frank would have done. Redwater refuses, stating that he did what he did for the good of the city and that Frank never would have understood, and Jack responds by fighting his way through a group of snipers as he chases Redwater on foot to a lighthouse. Redwater tries to kill Jack with a mounted machine gun, but Shadow bites Redwater's arm only to be wounded, forcing Jack to proceed alone and unarmed against Redwater, who cuts Jack across the eye with a knife and leaves a scar. Jack and Redwater fight, stealing the knife from each other repeatedly, until Jack stabs Redwater fatally, which results in him falling to his death. The game ends with Jack and Faith attending Frank's funeral, and Jack is left to look out at Grant City with Shadow next to him, promising his father he will be with him soon.

''Retribution'' received "mixed" reviews on both platforms according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mcps3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcx360"/&gt;  In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of one seven, one eight, and two sevens, for a total of 29 out of 40.&lt;ref name="fam"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6217">'''Face-ism''' or '''facial prominence''' is the relative prominence of the face in the portrayal of men and women; media tend to focus more on men's faces and women's bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Gary N., and Laura M. Graves (3rd Edition, SAGE 2003) ''Women and Men in Management'' (page 59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and evidence==

[[File:Face-ism Mona Lisa.svg|thumb|300px|Illustration of calculation of face-ism index on two crops of the Mona Lisa.]]

The term "face-ism" or "facial prominence" was initially defined in a 1983 study in which facial prominence was measured by a "Face-ism index", which is the ratio of two linear measurements, with the distance (in millimeters or any other unit) from the top of the head to the lowest visible point of the [[chin]] being the numerator and the distance from the top of the head to the lowest visible part of the subject's body the denominator. It was found that across societies and time, facial prominence of men has been much higher than that of women.&lt;ref name=archer1983&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.45.4.725 | issn=1939-1315 | volume=45 | issue=4 | pages=725–735 | last=Archer | first=Dane |author2=Iritani, Bonita |author3=Kimes, Debra D. |author4= Barrios, Michael  | title=Face-ism: Five studies of sex differences in facial prominence | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent studies have generated consistent findings and thus helped confirm the pervasive presence of face-ism. For instance, a prevalent face-ism phenomenon was observed in [[news magazine]]s and [[women's magazine]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1988.tb00938.x | issn=0361-6843 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=225–235 | last=Nigro | first=Georgia N. |author2=Hill, Dina E. |author3=Gelbein, Martha E. |author4= Clark, Catharine L.  | title=Changes in the Facial Prominence of Women and Men Over the Last Decade | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |date=1 June 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Face-ism has been documented in [[prime-time television]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/08838158909364075 | issn=1550-6878| volume=33 | issue=2 | pages=209–214 | last=Copeland | first=Gary A. | title=Face-ism and primetime television | journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | year= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has been shown that face-ism is still present in mainstream printed media from as recently as 2004, and showed that men in intellectually focused occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than women in similar professions, while women in physical occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than men in similar professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9276-3 | issn=0360-0025 | volume=57 | issue=7-8 | pages=515–525 | last=Matthews | first=Justin L. | title=Hidden Sexism: Facial Prominence and Its Connections to Gender and Occupational Status in Popular Print Media | journal=Sex Roles | date=17 August 2007 | url=https://www.academia.edu/353822/Hidden_Sexism_Facial_Prominence_and_Its_Connections_to_Gender_and_Occupational_Status_in_Popular_Print_Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-cultural study on face-ism found that face-ism in photographs of politicians is more pronounced in gender-egalitarian societies compared to gender-unequal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0361684312455317 | issn=0361-6843 | last=Konrath | first=Sara |author2=Au, Josephine |author3=Ramsey, Laura R.  | title=Cultural Differences in Face-ism: Male Politicians Have Bigger Heads in More Gender-Equal Cultures | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | date=8 August 2012 | url=http://www.sarakonrath.com/media/publications/konrath_au_ramsey_2012_in_press_faceism.pdf | volume=36 | pages=476–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no relation between face-ism and the perception of intellect.&lt;ref name=zuckerman1994 /&gt;

==Implications==

It was found that regardless of gender difference, news photographs featuring high face prominence tend to generate more positive ratings with regard to intelligence, ambition and physical appearance than those with low face prominence.&lt;ref name=archer1983 /&gt;

Similarly, another study argued that as a series of mental life dimensions including intelligence, personality, and character, are closely associated with the face and head; higher face-ism of men may convey impressions of greater intelligence, dominance, and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00987481 | issn=0191-5886 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=215–229 | last=Zuckerman | first= Miron | title=On the meaning and implications of facial prominence | journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior | date=1 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the greater body-ism of women (analyzed in [[Alcohol advertising|television beer commercials]]) serves to reinforce the stereotypical images of women as trophies or [[sex object]]s without personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF01544592 | issn=0360-0025 | volume=31 | issue=5-6 | pages=329–337 | last=Hall | first=Christine C. Iijima |author2=Crum, Matthew J. | title=Women and "body-isms" in television beer commercials | journal=Sex Roles | date=1 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face-ism may not be merely restricted to gender difference but can apply to racial difference as well. For instance, the study revealed that Caucasians have higher face-ism than blacks across different media types.&lt;ref name=zuckerman1994&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.86 | issn=1939-1315 | volume=66 | issue=1 | pages=86–92 | last=Zuckerman | first=Miron |author2=Kieffer, Suzanne C. | title=Race differences in face-ism: Does facial prominence imply dominance? | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film locations in Sonoma County, California''' are a diverse set of sites throughout this [[California]] county, where all or parts of notable [[motion picture]]s have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Directors Who Filmed in Small Sonoma County Towns|url = http://www.sonomamag.com/movies/|website = Sonoma Magazine|accessdate = January 9, 2016|language = en-US|date = January 2016|last = Daly|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Due to the scenic and varied aspects of [[Sonoma County]], a large number of films have been made within this County.  Some of the earliest U.S. filmmaking occurred in Sonoma County such as the 1914 production 1914 ''Salomy Jane'' and ''[[Bronco Billy Anderson]]'' produced in 1915.  Many of these films are classics in American [[cinematography]] such as the 1947 film ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'', starring [[Joseph Cotten]] and [[Loretta Young]], and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' produced in 1963, which was also partially filmed in adjacent [[Marin County]].  Many other more modern classics have used Sonoma County as a filming venue, including the 1990 production of the ''[[Flatliners]]'' and the 1992 film ''[[Basic Instinct]]''.  A few of the other representative films produced partially in Sonoma County are:

'''Footwork''' refers to [[dance]] technique aspects related to feet: '''foot position''' and '''foot action'''.

The following aspects of footwork may be considered:
*Dance technique: a proper footwork may be vital for proper posture and movement of a dancer.
*[[Aesthetic]] value: some foot positions and actions are traditionally considered appealing, while other ones are ugly, although this depends on the culture.
*Artistic expression: a sophisticated footwork may in itself be the goal of the dance expression.

Different dances place different emphasis on the above aspects.

==Ballroom dancing==
In a narrow sense, e.g., in descriptions of [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]] [[dance figure]]s, the term refers to the behavior of the foot when it meets the floor. In particular, it describes which part of the foot is in contact with the floor: ball, heel, flat, toe, high toe, inside/outside edge, etc.

==B-boying==
In [[breakdance]], moves performed on one's hands and feet may be referred to as ''[[downrock]]'' or (especially in the southern United States) as ''footwork''.  Typical moves in this type of dance include the "6-step", "2-step", "3-step", "5-step", "coffee grinders", "Valdez", "C-C's", and "front C-C's". Additionally in breakdancing there exists moves specifically known as footwork which place emphasis on one's foot movement. Examples of such moves include the Indian step, Salsa step, and Crossovers.

Ganja State Drama Theater ({{lang-az|Gəncə Dövlət Dram Teatrı}}) was built by the German entrepreneur Christopher Forer in the 80's of the 19th century. In 1899, the building called "Theater" was given to amateur actors. In 1899, a building was given to amateur actors which they called “Theater”. In 1906 a theater troupe "Ganja Muslim Drama Assembly" was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azteatr.musigi-dunya.az/file?id=88&amp;dt=48|title=Gəncə Dövlət Dram Teatrı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater`s first building belongs to the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.  First Ganja State Drama Theater was established on November 13, 1921 in Baku. The Theater operated with the name “Tənqid-təbliğ” (Criticism-propaganda) as of 1925. But then the name of the Theatre was changed into “Bakı-işçi-kəndli” (Baku-worker-villager). In December 1932, the Theater moved to Ganja with all its staff and continued its activities here. Among the actors who came to Ganja were Ismail Talibli, Alasgar Alekperov, [[Aghasadyg Garaybeyli|Aghasadig Garaybeyly]], Aghahuseyn Javadov, Mehdi Mammadov, Kazim Ziya, [[Fatma Gadri]], Amir Dadashli and Razmiya Veysalova. In 1933 an actor studio was created at the Theater.

== Music and lyrics ==
Although they share the same name, ''Hard Core 2K14'' was never intended to serve as a part two to her debut album, ''[[Hard Core (Lil' Kim album)|Hard Core]]''. Kim only wanted to give listeners a "taste" of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanders|first=Shamika|title=Lil' Kim Talks Biggie Writing Her Rhymes &amp; Says She Still Feels His Spirit In The Studio [EXCLUSIVE]|url=http://hellobeautiful.com/2014/09/23/lil-kim-talks-biggie-new-mixtape-exclusive/|work=Hello Beautiful|date=September 23, 2014 |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was more to do with recapturing the feeling that you got when you listened to her debut, a feeling Kim called "cocaine raps".&lt;ref name="stacks" /&gt; Kim felt that the lyrical content also had a common feel with that of her debut,&lt;ref name="stacks" /&gt; describing it as "heavy" and "sexual".&lt;ref name="bossip" /&gt;

== Promotion ==
On September 20, 2014, Kim performed at [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'s first annual ''SOURCE360'' concert at [[Barclays Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Steven J|title=Wu-Tang Clan &amp; Lil' Kim Reign in Brooklyn: Live Review|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6259175/wu-tang-clan-lil-kim-reign-in-brooklyn-live-review|work=Billboard|date=September 20, 2014 |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''Hard Core'' received negative reviews from critics. A writer for ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' wrote "With the original [[Hard Core (Lil' Kim album)|Hard Core]] ranking with the best in the mafioso genre, ''Hard Core 2k14'' plays more of a reminder of who Lil Kim once was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2014/09/lil-kim-hardcore-2k14-mixtape-review/|title=Lil Kim Can't Recapture Her Glory Days On 'Hard Core 2k14' Mixtape|work=XXL|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harringay}}
'''Harringay Arena''' was a sporting and events venue on [[Green Lanes (London)|Green Lanes]] in [[Harringay]], North London, England. Built in 1936, it lasted as a venue until 1958.

==Construction==
Harringay Arena was built and owned by Brigadier-General [[Alfred Critchley]] under the auspices of his private company, the ''[[Greyhound Racing Association|Greyhound Racing Association Trust Ltd]]'' (GRA). A new company, ''Harringay Arena Limited'', whose directors were also directors of the GRA, was incorporated in 1929 to build and manage the venue. The company raised funds for the venture via a stock and share issue in January 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 January 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by Dr. Oscar Faber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = T. F. T. Baker &amp; C. R. Elrington (Editors) |title=A History of the County of Middlesex, Volume 5: Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham |pages=339–342 |publisher=Accessed online at British History Online|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; the arena was a stark [[modernist]] octagonal-shaped building which borrowed heavily from the [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto. It was erected adjacent to the [[Harringay Stadium]] in just eight months between February and October 1936. Its vast steel roof was constructed by [[Dorman Long]] &amp; Co, who had recently been responsible for the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and completed the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2007.

It had a seating capacity of almost 10,000 for [[ice hockey]] and slightly more for [[boxing]]. The actual arena was {{convert|198|ft|m}} long by {{convert|88|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;''Horse of the Year Show'' Programme, 1957, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A removable maple floor could be laid over the ice for non-sporting events. This arrangement clearly proved troublesome. At an event shortly after its opening the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that "claims that Harringay had solved its cold-feet problem were not quite substantiated. Cold air from the ice below the boards filtered through".&lt;ref name=Ticher&gt;{{cite book |last=Ticher |first=Mike |title=''The Story of Harringay Stadium and Arena'' |publisher=Hornsey Historical Society |year=2002 |isbn=0-905794-29-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports venue==
Specifically designed as an [[ice hockey]] venue, it quickly became famous as a venue for both [[ice hockey]] and [[boxing]].

Up to the [[Second World War]], ice hockey enjoyed its most popular era in the UK until a revival in the 1990s. Two local teams were formed for the Arena's opening, [[Harringay Racers]] and [[Harringay Greyhounds]]. On 26 October 1938, the first ice hockey game to be televised anywhere in the world was played at Harringay between the Racers and Streatham. A year later, WWII started and ice hockey matches were suspended. This interruption proved very damaging to the sport's popularity and post-war audiences remained thin for the remainder of the Arena's life.

Boxing became firmly established at the Arena prior to the war. On 7 April 1938 Harringay was the venue for the first boxing match to be televised live when the full 15 rounds between [[Len Harvey]] v [[Jock McAvoy]] were broadcast. Following the war Harringay was a very successful boxing venue. During its 22-year life, it was home to five world title fights, a record for any British venue by the time the Arena ceased operating as a venue in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxrec.com/location.php?country_code=UK&amp;region_name=LON&amp;towncity_name=&amp;towncity_id=15994&amp;venue_name=&amp;venue_id=26011&amp;yyyy=&amp;select_action=Go A list of all fights held at Harringay from BoxerRec.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

However famous the Arena became for boxing, commercial necessity led to a diversification into a wider range of events including:

*The [[Basketball at the 1948 Summer Olympics|basketball]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/Statistics/arenaharringay.html Kentucky's Harringay Arena Record]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scarboroughseahawks.co.uk/zonepress/Ed40.pdf Malcolm Finlay (1919–2007), Great Britain’s First Basketball Captain]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wrestling at the 1948 Summer Olympics|wrestling]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OuPUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=harringay&amp;dq=harringay&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gSEnTNj9HsL_OamexK8C&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAThk Official 1948 Olympic Souvenir Booklet]&lt;/ref&gt; events for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 42, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Home of the [[Horse of the Year Show]] for its first ten years, from 1949 to 1958. In its final year at Harringay, the show featured in the first broadcast of the BBC's new Saturday afternoon sports programme ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]''.
*[[History of roller derby#Jam On, Jam Off|Roller Speedway]] from 1939 until 1952, with a break during the [[Second World War|War]]. In 1953, with the demise of roller speedway, the Arena hosted a [[Roller Derby]] match.
*[[Wrestling]].
*[[Five-a-side football]].

==Entertainment venue==
The Arena's diversification went beyond sports and included a variety of entertainment events including:

===Classical music and ballet===
In the 1940s the arena hosted ground breaking classical music events popularising classical music for the first time including the ''London Music Festival'' in 1947 and 1948. The '48 festival included the hugely popular London debut of Pierino Gamba.&lt;ref&gt;This [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1iga_QVlCQ YouTube Video] shows Gamba conducting an orchestra in Paris in the same year as he came to Harringay&lt;/ref&gt; 10,000 people watched this ten-year-old boy conduct the [[Liverpool Philharmonic]] Orchestra playing [[Beethoven]] and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. The festival also featured the world-famous Manuel Rosenthal, who brought his [[Orchestre National de France]] to join [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic]] in a concert that filled the Harringay Arena with 13,500 listeners

A report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on a classical music event in June of the following year said:

{{bq|text=Harringay Arena as a concert Hall is staggering. The finicky hate it. That is an initial point in its favour. For those whose hearts are liberal and [[Walt Whitman|Whitmanesque]], the current London Music Festival is moving as well as mammoth. Never before have I seen a multitude lie so quiescently in the hollow of a composer's hand. The [[Albert Hall]] is a restless and limited thing by comparison.}}

{{bq|text=I passed turnstiles, barking stewards, ice-cream hawkers and bars stacked with sixpenny slices of pie. These are the things which make the finicky rear and paw&amp;nbsp;... At the end of the first movement 9,000 pairs of hands clapped uncontrollably. This was the only indiscretion of an intent and almost coughless evening.}}

{{bq|text=Occasionally a locomotive on the nearby line to Southend hissed uncritically or improved the orchestration with a hoot.}}

{{bq|text=Where did the thousands come from? I have never seen their like in any concert hall before. There was so little dimness among the elderly. There were so few corduroys, beards and bandanna headsquares among the young. These Harringaieties are, take them all in all, quite a phenomenon. Some sociologist should put them under his spy-glass.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Classical music events also figured large in the 1949 calendar.

In April, famed black singer [[Paul Robeson]] appeared at Harringay as part of his European concert tour. Sell-out audiences, including one of 10,000 at the arena, led him to describe the tour as "the most successful concert tour of my career"&lt;ref&gt;Address by Robeson at Welcome Home Rally, [[Rockland Palace]], New York City, 19 June 1949, under the auspices of the Council on African Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Saturday, 16 April 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, there was a short season of classical music events including a two-week stay by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. The event was part of their hyped European tour. They were the first American orchestra to visit the UK since 1929. Financed by British theatrical impresario Harold Fielding, the tour was a critical success, but high ticket prices kept the post-war audiences away.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Finkleman, Philadelphia Story, The Double Reed (The journal of the International Double Reed Society), Vol. 26, No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

From 27 August to 1 September, along with [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Empress Hall, Earl's Court]], Harringay Arena was the venue for a series of five gala performances by [[Alicia Markova]], [[Anton Dolin]] and the [[Ballet Rambert]]. The success of these performances led to the formation of the [[English National Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishnationalballet.com/reference_complete_history1.htm English National Ballet history on the English National Ballet website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballet.co.uk/nov97/year_1949.htm Excerpts from Ballet Magazine on line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808015910/http://ballet.co.uk/nov97/year_1949.htm |date=8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circuses===
The arena was well known as a venue for [[circus]]es. It was home to [[Tom Arnold (theatre impresario)|Tom Arnold's]] annual Harringay Circus for eleven seasons from Christmas 1947 to Christmas 1957. For the first circus show in 1947 Arnold hired twenty baby elephants specially imported from Ceylon by the Chipperfield family. They arrived at the George V Dock in London's Docklands in October 1947 on SS Arbratus.

[[Billy Smart, Jr|Billy Smart]] occasionally appeared in these shows. At one of the ''Mammoth Christmas Circuses'', he spray-painted five of his elephants white, yellow, blue, cream and pink.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Smart Junior – Obituary, [[The Independent]], 24 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1952 circus included an elephant act with [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], the young Indian actor made famous by his appearance in films such as ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Baghdad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sabu''', Philip Leibfried, Films in Review, October 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The resident band for the circuses was led by Charles Shadwell; the signature tune "Down with the Curtain" always introduced the proceedings.

The arena also hosted a number of other circus shows. In 1956 the Moscow State Circus came to Harringay, the first occasion on which a state circus from the [[Soviet Union]] had visited Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Moscow State Circus. Official Programme, Harringay Arena, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Other events included a handful of western cowboy shows in the 1950s, including the 1952 ''Texas Western Spectacle'', starring the famous cowboy singer/actor [[Tex Ritter]].

===Other events===
*There were ice skating shows including the huge production of ''Rose Marie on Ice'' in July 1950 starring the 1948 Olympic Champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]]. The Arena was also open as an [[Ice skating]] venue for the public.
*Harringay was the venue for the first ''National Colliery Music Festival'' in 1948. The festival included eight [[Brass band (British style)|brass bands]], three [[pipe band]]s and nine [[male voice choir]]s, all from collieries around the UK. There were also displays of [[clogging|clog dancing]] and [[sword dancing]] by colliery groups. The finale was a performance by a 700-strong choir accompanied by a massed brass band and conducted by [[Sir Adrian Boult]].
*American [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Billy Graham]] held his first 'Crusade' in the UK at the Arena from 1 March – 12 May 1954. Audiences could hear Graham event Sunday during the three-month crusade. It was the first of 23 'crusades' and 'missions' that he held in the UK between 1954 and 1991. His visit was started off with a gala event at the stadium which included a visit by [[Roy Rogers]] and his famous horse Trigger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royrogersfestival.org/view/?pageID=321100 Roy Rogers Festival Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706023319/http://www.royrogersfestival.org/view/?pageID=321100 |date=6 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Daily Worker]]'' used Harringay as a venue for its rallies in 1954 and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=394-cp_3&amp;cid=-1&amp;Gsm=2008-06-18 National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Ford Motor Company used the venue to launch the 1957 range of Ford cars namely the Consul, Zephyr and Zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR7TKrfD7EM&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the early summer of 1958, a music event was held at the Arena when people flocked to see the top artists of the day including [[Vera Lynn]], James Kenny, [[Matt Monro]], [[Petula Clark]], Dennis Lotis, [[Marion Ryan]] and [[Laurie London]]. The concert was called the ''Starlight Dance'' and it has been referred to as the start of what is thought of today as the full-scale arena concert.&lt;ref&gt;''Disc'' Magazine, Issue 18, 7 June 1958&lt;/ref&gt;
*In April 1949, [[Paul Robeson]] gave a short series of concerts at the Arena. He returned the following year to sing at the 20th Daily Worker rally.

==Decline and fall==
Despite running an impressive and broad ranging calendar of events from 1947 to 1958, the change in the fortunes of ice hockey in the UK and the straitened post-war circumstances meant limited commercial success for the Arena after the Second World War. The arena hosted its final event on Tuesday, 28 October 1958. It was a sentimental occasion and promoter [[Jack Solomons]] headlined with a world-class lightweight fight between [[Dave Charnley]] and [[Carlos Ortiz]] (who was to go on to become world champion). ''The Times'' quoted part of the speech at that event in its paper the following day:
{{bq|text=After 22 years Harringay Arena is closing. This evening we shall hear this great hall echo to cheers and see cigarette smoke swirl around the ring for the last time. The most important chapter in the history of British professional boxing is over.&lt;ref name=Times2910/&gt;}}

Behind the scenes moves for the Arena's disposal had been going on for some time. International food retailer and manufacturer, [[Home and Colonial|Home &amp; Colonial Stores Ltd]] were offered the site in 1957. They took possession of the building and the adjacent market hall in 1958. Works to convert the Arena to its new use were complete by February 1960.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, ''The Home &amp; Colonial Stores Ltd'', 11 May 1960&lt;/ref&gt; It was henceforth put to use as a food storage facility for the next 20 years until its demolition in 1978.

Through the early 1980s an open air Sunday market was held on the site up until the site was developed for shopping. The initial development included principally warehouse style shopping including DIY, bathroom and food wholesale outlets. A [[Royal Mail]] sorting facility was also built which survived the later redevelopment.

Early in the 21st century the whole site was redeveloped for retail shopping as the Arena Shopping Park, hosting mid-market brands such as ''[[Next (clothing)|Next]]'', ''[[Carphone Warehouse]]'', ''[[Homebase]]'' and a ''[[Fitness First]]'' gym.

'''Ida Barr''' (17 January 1882 – 17 December 1967) was an English [[music hall]] singer.

==Life and career==
Barr was born at [[Regent's Park Barracks]], London on 17 January 1882. Her father was a soldier.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Richard Anthony |date=2014 |title=British Music Hall: An Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtKwBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=%22ida+barr%22+and+%22music+hall%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yBJmimSGSF&amp;sig=L4DExgwaTi49v0BmVkR3-zqtRHs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirqIDDy6TcAhUqI8AKHdMfB6g4RhDoAQhRMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ida%20barr%22%20and%20%22music%20hall%22&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] |page=255 |isbn=1783831189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her stage debut in 1898 as a [[Chorus line|chorus girl]] at the Theatre Royal, Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/BelfastTheatres.htm#royal |title=The Theatre Royal, Arthur Square, Belfast |date=2018 |work= |publisher=[[Arthur Lloyd (musician)|Arthur Lloyd]] website |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially calling herself ''Maud Laverne'', she first used the stage-name Ida Barr in 1908 at London's Bedford Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Bedford.htm |title=The Bedford Theatre, 93 - 95 Camden High Street, Camden Town |date=2018 |work= |publisher=[[Arthur Lloyd (musician)|Arthur Lloyd]] website |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr married comedian Gus Harris (billed as "the only Yiddisher Scotsman in the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers|Irish Fusiliers]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monologues.co.uk/musichall/Songs-S/Sergeant-Solomon-Isaacstein.htm |title=Sergeant Solomon Isaacstein |date=2018 |work= |publisher=Monologues.co.uk website |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but left him in 1910, sailing to New York.&lt;ref name="WordPress"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nigelthedame.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/saturday-23rd-jan-carry-on-eastenders/ |title=Saturday 23rd Jan: Carry On Eastenders! |date=2016 |work= |publisher=[[WordPress]] |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving some success in America, Barr returned to England a premier singer of [[ragtime]] songs, popularising in Britain the songs "[[Oh, You Beautiful Doll]]" ([[Nat Ayer|Ayer]] &amp; Brown; 1910) and "[[That Mysterious Rag|Everybody's Doing It]]" ([[Irving Berlin|Berlin]]; 1911).

She [[Concert tour|toured]] worldwide, earning good money, but was over-generous and failed to [[Saving|save]]. She became in her old age reliant on [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare benefit]]s, living in a small flat off the [[Charing Cross Road]] in London. Writer and broadcaster [[Daniel Farson]], a music hall enthusiast, took it upon himself to extend a helping hand, bringing Barr to a new (or [[Nostalgia|nostalgic]]) audience on record and television. It was through Farson, too, that variety entertainer [[Danny La Rue]] arranged a [[benefit concert]] for Barr.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

Ida Barr died on 17 December 1967 in London.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

'''Jatra''' ({{lang-bn|যাত্রা}}, origin: ''[[Yatra]]'' meaning procession or journey in [[Sanskrit]])&lt;ref name=jat/&gt; is a popular folk-theatre form of [[Bengali theatre]], spread throughout most of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] speaking areas of the [[Indian subcontinent]], including [[Bangladesh]] and Indian states of [[West Bengal]], Bihar, [[Assam]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Tripura]]&lt;ref name=jat/&gt;&lt;ref name=came/&gt;&lt;ref name=con/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301606/Jatra Jatra] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, there were some 55 troupes based in [[Calcutta]]'s old jatra district, [[Chitpur#Chitpur Road|Chitpur Road]], and all together, jatra is a $21m-a-year industry, performed on nearly 4,000 stages in West Bengal alone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/05/south_asia_india0s_changing_folk_theatre/html/2.stm Jatra 2] ''[[BBC News]]'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; where in 2001, over 300 companies employed over 20,000 people, more than the local film industry and urban theatre.&lt;ref name=ro/&gt;

The word ''jatra'' means journey or going. The origin of jatra intrinsically a musical theatre form, is traditionally credited to the rise of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Sri Chaitanya]]'s Bhakti movement, wherein Chaitanya himself played [[Rukmini]] in the performance of ''Rukmini Haran'' ("The abduction of the Charming Rukmini") from [[Krishna]]'s life story, a first definite presentation of this theatrical spectacle. The performance, which lasted through the night in 1507 AD.,&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; has been described in ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]'', Chaitanya's [[hagiography]] by a disciple [[Vrindavana Dasa Thakura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yakshagana.com/re-apr02-2.htm JATRA – Folk Theater Of India By Balwant Gargi]&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are evidences of existence of a form of singing called the 'Carya', which was popular between the 9th and the 12th centuries in Bengal, which existed in Orissa simultaneously as the popular 'Carya Padas' form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/knowindia/jatra.php Jatra] ''National Portal of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jatra performances resemble the [[Nautanki]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], the [[Tamasha]] of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Bhavai]] of [[Gujarat]].

Though its birthplace lies in the religious landscape, replete with various [[Bhakti]] movements of [[Hinduism]], by the end of the 19th century it was replaced by morally didactic content, and eventually became secular, when it gained entry into urban [[Proscenium|proscenium theatre]]s during [[Bengal Renaissance]]. The survival of the form over such a vast period of rapidly changing social milieu, while catering to a heterogeneous audience, has been credited to its innate malleability and ways of adapting to changing social dynamics, and thus staying not just relevant and alive, but also thriving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA488&amp;vq=jatra&amp;dq=Jatra+bengal&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0#PRA2-PA488,M1 Jatra] ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'', by Alison Arnold.

==Jatra performances==
[[File:Jatra Posters.jpg|thumb|Posters of Jatra in [[Kolkata]], a unique example of local pop art]]
Jatras are usually epic four-hour-long plays, preceded by a musical concert often lasting an hour, used to attract audiences. The dramatic performance itself is liberally interspersed dramatic monologues, songs and duet dance routines on the folk tunes, which often serve as scene transitions and sometimes mark the end of an act. Jatra plays are usually performed on stages that are [[Theatre in the round|open on all sides]] in open-air arenas. The stage often had minimal or no furniture or props, it was rather seen as a neutral space, free to be given a meaning befitting the scene, this technique continued even when jatra started getting performed in [[proscenium theatre]]s. Sets, props and lighting came in much later, when its started interacting with Western theatre in the late 19th century, as urban educated youth started joining the jatra tradition.&lt;ref name=came/&gt;

The cast is predominantly male, whose members also play the female parts, though since the 19th century, female actors started joining the cast. Actors often joined the troupes at a young age, and worked their way up the hierarchy of roles, and strive for virtuoso acting and are judged on their vocal prowess, as this determines their ability to capture a large audience with thundering dialogue deliveries and improvised dialogues. The modern version of jatra, features loud music, harsh lighting and dramatic props played on giant outdoor stages, and actors are hired for a season under written contracts. Sometimes ramps are built around the stage and used for dramatic effects as in [[Kabuki]] plays.
Jatras are often very melodramatic with highly stylised delivery and exaggerated gestures and orations. Music being the key element of the jatra, much attention is placed on its selection, popular tunes are created and incorporated. Musicians sit on two sides of the stage, carrying [[Dholak]], [[pakhawaj]], harmonium, [[tabla]], flute, cymbals, trumpets, behala (violin) and clarinet, all used to heighten the overall dramatic effect of performances that are already frenzied, plus most of the singing is done by the actors themselves. Many of the songs were based on classical [[Ragas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EGUpX1O0hoC&amp;pg=RA3-PA79&amp;lpg=RA3-PA79&amp;dq=The+Yatras:+or+popular+drama+of+Bengal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sWzAKNqIX5&amp;sig=tGHNHIo8XjjdKuTnZw5ORmqODuM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QDvDSbP3J5SIkQXZ1ZTEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Dance Drama – Yatra] ''Arts of India: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Music, Dance and Handicraft'', by Krishna Chaitanya.

''pp. 79''.&lt;/ref&gt; A generic character, unique to jatra and part of most jatra performances even today, is the [[allegorical]] figure called ''Bibek'' or Vivek (Conscience); it performs the function of a moral guardian, commenting on actions of actors and their consequences, sometimes it elaborates on the feelings of different characters, and often steps into a scene unannounced and presents an alternate or philosophical point of view, and all done through singing, something which is done by the chorus in a [[Greek tragedy]]. Like Conscience, a character called niyati (Fate) often played by a woman, while commenting on the scene, foretells or warns the actors of impending dangers. Another distinct feature of jatra is that the plays begin with the climax, a device used to captivate the attention of the audience.&lt;ref name=came/&gt;&lt;ref name=wor&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=COkXM9n7KUcC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Jatra+bengal&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA134,M1 India – Jatra] ''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific'', by Don Rubin.

The Jatra season begins in the autumn, around September, around [[Durga Puja]] the beginning of harvest season, when the travelling troupe head out to interior rural regions, and ends before the [[Monsoon]] sets in, and the beginning of the planting season, around June. Performances of Jatras are commonplace after festivities and religious functions, ceremonies in traditional households, and fairs, throughout the region, where these troupes get invited in advance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccrtindia.gov.in/theatreforms.htm Theatre Forms of India – Jatra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515113554/http://ccrtindia.gov.in/theatreforms.htm |date=15 May 2013 }} ''Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, [[Govt.]] of [[India]]''.(CCRT).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The recent origins of the Jatra can be traced back to rise of [[Vaishnavism]], and the [[Bhakti movement]] especially in [[Krishnaism]], in the 16th century, propelled by the advent of mystic [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. The ''Krishna Jatra'', evolved through the devotional singing and dancing of the followers of the Krishna Bhakti movement, inspired by [[Raslila]] and dramatic poetry like, ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' written by [[Jayadeva]] in the 12th century and ''[[Chandidas#The Srikrishna Kirtan|Srikrishna Kirtan]]'' by [[Chandidas]] in the 15th century. Historians also mention, the existence of ''Nata Gita'', an [[operatic]] folk drama for in medieval Bengal, filled with singing, dancing and music sans dialogue, which provided an early model for the ''Krishna Jatra''.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

In an era, when there were no theatre houses or fixed stages in Bengal, jatra evolved its idiom in actual jatras or religious processions (yatra) of devotees that moved from one place to another singing and dancing to the tunes of [[kirtan]] or religious songs, often amongst them were artists, adept in singing and dancing, who would often enact scenes from mythology. Later these troupes found place on moving [[Tableau vivant|tableaux]], which became part of the processions organised on special occasions such [[Rath Yatra]]. Gradually these small plays started being performed also at the end of the processions, and on open arenas, known as ''asar'' in Bengali, surrounded by people on all sides. In time, these open-air stages became the mainstay of these plays, though the name stuck with the genre; and as it evolved it absorbed all the prevalent folk traditions of music, dance and singing, be it Jhumur, Gambhira, Gajangan, or Panchali into its folds, to create a new template for folk theatre in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4634&amp;lpg=PA4634&amp;dq=The+Yatras:+or+popular+drama+of+Bengal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5JDC2gDy3&amp;sig=QiH0Jrk4GAjCNWesFpw4cmg5YW0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zxPDSa-fIdKCkQXWyp3EDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result Yatra] ''Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature'', by Mohan Lal, various.

[[File:A jatra actor prepares before the performance, Sunderbans.jpg|thumb|A ''jatra'' actor prepares before the performance, [[Sunderbans]].]]
After Chaitanya, his followers like [[Sri Ramananda Raya|Ramananda Rai]] and [[Rupa Goswami]] wrote plays based on the life of Sri Krishna, and many received royal patronage as well, like from the King of [[Puri]], Prataprudradeva, which helped this form evolve further. Gradually this evolved into performances of traditional mythological plays with stories of Rama (Ram jatra), Sita, Krishna and Shiva (Shiv jatra), taken from the [[Ramayan]], [[Mahabharat]], [[Puranas]], various historical tales and folklore. Soon the form was adopted by devotees of other Bhakti cults, like [[Chandi]] devotees brought in ''[[Mangal-Kāvya|Chandi Mangal]]'', a narrative poem by Mukunda Chakravarti, to start ''Chandi Jatra'', the [[Behula]] myth gave rise to ''Bhasan Jatra'', while a [[Manasa]] serpent myth took form of the ''Bisahara Yatra''&lt;ref name=pano&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Jatra+bengal&amp;as_brr=0#PPA198,M1 Jatra] ''History of Indian Theatre: Loka Ranya Panorama of Indian Folk Theatre'', by Manohar Laxman Varadpande.

''pp. 10''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jatra movement gradually moved to the urban areas, and even brought literary works to the rural masses which were predominantly illiterate at the time, this meant that the plot, storyline and narrative remained simple, and often [[didactic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bengalonline.sitemarvel.com/bengali-folklore.asp?art=jatra Folk Theatre: Jatra]&lt;/ref&gt; Another development that occurred in the 19th century was its departure from the ''Krishna Jatra'' format of musical, as dances were introduce which were to become staple in the coming years, and prose dialogues and free verse speech soon made inroads into this traditional theatre format, giving rise to ''Natun Jatra'', or the New Jatra.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Jatra+bengal&amp;as_brr=0#PPA198,M1 Jatra] ''History of Indian Theatre: Loka Ranya Panorama of Indian Folk Theatre'', by Manohar Laxman Varadpande.

''Page 198''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaprofile.com/religion-culture/jatras.htm Jatras – Fiery Dramas Mesmerizing Dialogues] ''indiaprofile.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another new trend in jatra during this period was introduction of secular themes, in what was traditionally a religious theatre.

In the early 20th century, at the onset of the [[Indian independence movement]], jatra which had already experienced its artistic and popularity peak in the previous century, now evolved yet again, with the changing tide of Indian milieu. It took on political themes and became a vehicle of political satire and protest, and was called ''swadesi jatra''. It began to reflect the rise current of social and political awareness, and depicted far ranging social themes from Mahatama Gandhi's anti-untouchability movement to the [[nonviolence|non-violence movement]] in the coming decades, many of the jatra plays opposing colonialist ideologies, oppression and eulogising patriots were even banned by the British.&lt;ref name=wor/&gt; This was also the time, when Communism was taking roots in Bengal, and jatras increasingly saw dramatisation of the life of [[Lenin]], and portrayal communist ideologies and thought.&lt;ref name=ro&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sNuFKx8r9H4C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Jatra+bengal&amp;as_brr=0#PPA84,M1 Yatra] ''Indian theatre: theatre of origin, theatre of freedom'', by Ralph Yarrow. Published by Routledge, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7007-1412-X}}.''Page 84''.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA) used jatra, to garner support of [[Communist Party of India|Communist Party]] amongst the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], when Germany invaded Russia. Even after the war, noted directors like [[Utpal Dutt]] continued to use the jatra element in urban theatre of IPTA, as did [[Sombhu Mitra]] with his [[Bohurupee]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv7Uk0UcdM8C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Jatra+bengal&amp;as_brr=0 Jatra] ''Pop Culture India!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle'', by Asha Kasbekar.

''Page 44''.&lt;/ref&gt; When the art form travelled to the [[Tripura]] region, with its performers, it gave birth to the [[Kokborok drama]], amongst the [[Kokborok]] speaking population of the region.

With the rise of Western theatre in [[Bengal]] it acquired the themes of political protest and social radicalism, and finally fell into disrepute in the post War era, and especially after the entry of Radio and television and the rise of upmarket theatre industry, though it continued to exist in the rural areas. Jatra remained a living tradition of musical theatre, and some of the popular jatra songs got recorded and became popular Bengali songs, once more ever widening audience base, also scripts of old jatras found their way into books, and newspapers started reserving space for jatra discussion.&lt;ref&gt;''Music of eastern India: vocal music in Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, and Manipuri, with special emphasis on Bengali'', by Sukumara Rai, Published by Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1973. ''Page 58''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This revival seen in the recent decades, started in the early 1960s, with various theatre groups experimenting with the Jatra form, and started attracting serious theatre patrons along with official recognition. 1961, saw the first Jatra festival organised in Kolkata and every year since, and in 1968, Phanibhusan Bidyabinod became the first jatra artist to receive the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]]. Earlier most jatra companies were owned by actor-managers or singers, today most are owned by businesses and are more prone to commercialisation, both in the content as well as in presentation. Even today, in majority the presentation style still is inspired by cinemas of the regions and television soaps, many a times reflected in the risque content.&lt;ref name=jat&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=au_Vk2VYyrkC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=Jatra&amp;as_brr=0 Jatra] ''South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka'', by Peter J.

Several jatras today pick contemporary news events like the London bombings, 9/11 or the war in Iraq, and highlight local issues as well. Further as productions are often put up within a month, a clear advantage over theatre and film, jatras remain topical by drawing upon current imagery of the populace, like when [[Phoolan Devi]] became notorious the 80s, a play staged by the same name gained immense popularity not to mention big revenue.&lt;ref name=pano/&gt;

'''''Joe Pera Talks with You''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[live-action]] [[comedy television series]] that first premiered on [[Adult Swim]] on May 20, 2018. The series was created by [[Joe Pera]] and produced by Factual Productions, Inc., in association with Pera's [[Joe Pera|Chestnut Walnut Unlimited]]. It entered development following the success of the 2016 non-canonical [[Television special|specials]] ''Joe Pera Talks You to Sleep'' and ''Joe Pera Helps You Find the Perfect Christmas Tree'', of which the first was [[Animation|animated]], airing as part of ''[[Infomercials (TV specials)|Infomercials]]''.

==Summary==
The series stars comedian [[Joe Pera]] as a fictionalized version of himself, living in [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] and teaching choir at a local school. Pera attempts to talk directly to the audience about mundane subject matter such as iron, Sunday breakfast, fall drives, dancing, sleeping, and music.

==Characters==
* [[Joe Pera]] as a fictionalized version of himself, a self-proclaimed "soft-handed choir teacher" from [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]]. Though he is very introspective, with a vast knowledge of specific concepts, he expresses naivety in his social interactions. He has a pet dog named Gus.
*Connor O'Malley as Mike Melsky, Joe's neighbor. The two meet in the events of the show's first episode, when Mike attempts to buy Joe's house due to a misunderstanding with where the sign is placed. He is generally sarcastic, short-tempered, and incredulous towards Joe.
*Gene Kelly as Gene, Joe's best friend. He likes to help Joe teach his lessons, and often ends up giving Joe advice in the process.
*[[Jo Firestone]] as Sarah, a new band teacher working at the same school as Joe. Many of her beliefs are rooted in conspiracies and fears for the future, as evidenced by her construction of a fortified basement below her house. She becomes Joe's love interest over the course of the first season.
*Nancy Cornell as Joe's Nana.
*Jo Scott as Sue Melsky, Mike's wife.

'''Karl Farkas''' (28 October 1893 – 16 May 1971) was an Austrian actor and [[cabaret]] performer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/29891561/_Celebrating_Democracy_The_U._S._in_the_Works_of_Austrian_Refugees_from_Totalitarianism_ ''Celebrating Democracy?: The U. S. in the Writings of Austrian Refugees from Totalitarianism.''] Article by Walter Hölbling. (English)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

In accordance with the wishes of his parents, he was to study law, but decided to follow the call of the stage. After attending the Academy of Music and Acting Arts in Vienna, he debuted in [[Olomouc|Olmütz]] as [[Tsarevich]], in a play by [[Gabryela Zapolska]].

After various stage appearances in [[Austria]] and [[Moravia]], he returned to Vienna in 1921, where he was engaged by [[Egon Dorn]], the director of the Kabarett ''Simpl''. There he worked as a 'Blitzdichter' (nickname: the [[Tick]]), and performed together with [[Fritz Grünbaum]] in a ''Doppelconférence'', a cabaret number created in [[Budapest]] and consisting of a dialogue between two actors, one of whom plays a clever and educated interlocutor while the other has the role of a blunderer.

He married [[Anny Hán]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viennatouristguide.at/Friedhoefe/Zentralfriedhof/Index_32C_Bild/32C_farkas_34.htm Biography of Karl Farkas] on the website of Vienna Tourist Guide. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in 1938, he was forced to become a [[refugee]] because of his [[Jews|Jewish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.virtualvienna.net/the-city-its-people/jewish-vienna/jewish-intellectuals-artists/ Jewish intellectuals and artists.] Article by Alfred Stalzer, Vienna Tourist Board. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; going first to [[Brno]], then Paris and ending up in New York. There he performed for other exiles and wrote his book of poems ''Farkas entdeckt Amerika'' (Farkas discovers America). Moreover, he wrote the libretto to [[Emmerich Kálmán|Kálmán's]] operetta [[Marinka (operetta)|''Marinka'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Larisch-Wallersee%2C_Marie_Louise_Gr%C3%A4fin/Larisch-Wallersee%2C_Marie_Louise_Gr%C3%A4fin_english ''Larisch-Wallersee, Marie Louise Gräfin.''] Article on the website Austria Forum. (English).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, he returned to Vienna, and from 1950 on, he performed at the ''Simpl'' again, now as its director, a role in which he remained until his death.

He also worked as a writer and director, contributing the program of all the [[revue]]s together with [[Ernst Waldbrunn]] and {{ill|Hugo Wiener|de}}, who in his turn also wrote his ''[[Doppelconférence]]n''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mediathek.at/portaltreffer/atom/14789DF8-205-003BE-00000588-1477ECB5/pool/BWEB/ ''Zwei alte Wiener als Gondoliere. (Two old Viennese as gondoliers.)''] Excerpt of a Doppelconférence with Karl Farkas and Ernst Waldbrunn on the website of Österreischische Mediathek. (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1957 onward, he appeared on a regular basis in broadcasting and later on the Austrian TV channel, [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. Very popular were his ''Balances'', e.g. balance of the year, balance of the month, etc.

Farkas also is the main character in the Austrian revue [[comic book]] ''Der Bloede und der Gscheite'' (engl.: ''The Stupid and the Smart One''), released in 2014, drawn by illustrator Reinhard Trinkler and based on the classic 'Doppelconférences' by Hugo Wiener.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amalthea.at/index.php?id=10&amp;showBookNr=8512&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albania]] has submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] on an irregular basis since 1996. The award is handed out annually by the [[United States]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to a [[feature length|feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-[[English language|English]] dialogue.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not created until the [[29th Academy Awards|1956 Academy Awards]], in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.&lt;ref name="HistPg2"&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Academy Awards - Page 2| publisher = [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | url = http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html | accessdate = 2008-08-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622191328/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania's first three films were historical tales set against the backdrop of the [[Enver Hoxha]] [[dictatorship]] which ruled Albania for over forty years. ''Bunker'' and ''Slogans'' take place in Albania in the late 1970s while ''Sadness'' takes place in 1961 [[Czechoslovakia]]. ''Colonel Bunker'' is a drama about a soldier tasked by Hoxha to build a network of impossibly elaborate structures ('bunkers') designed to resist a potential foreign invasion. ''Slogans'' is a lighter film satirizing the ideological obsessions of the Hoxha regime, and their suffocating influence over the life of a small, rural school. Both films are among the few Albanian films to win awards at international Film Festivals- ''Bunker'' won an award at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and ''Slogans'' was the very first Albanian film to play at Cannes. ''The Sadness of Mrs. Schneider'', a Czech co-production, tells the story of a multi-ethnic group of friends studying cinema in Prague in the 1960s, and their travels around the Czechoslovak countryside.

In 2009, the selection committee originally considered three films.&lt;ref name="Gjalle ne Oscar Skishte tjeter!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Runners-up: ''A Provincial Chronicle'' and ''Lenin and Us''. http://www.albaniasite.net/kultura/gjalle-ne-oscar-skishte-tjeter.html {{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these films were directed by Artan Minarolli. Albania ended up choosing a film set in the post-Communist era for the first time- Minarolli's ''Alive!''- about a modern, young Albanian student who becomes involved with an ancient [[blood feud]] after returning to his home village for the funeral of his father.

Although, Albania itself has maintained a low profile in this category, four other countries in the region- Greece, Italy, Macedonia and Switzerland- have each submitted films about Albania and the Albanian diaspora to the Oscars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">The '''[[Lord Chamberlain]]'s requirements''' were a set of four prerequisites for a licence for a production in British theatres. These were printed in theatre programmes so the audience could be aware of them. The [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] had control of theatres until 1968, including [[censorship]] of the production content as well as for logistical matters. In the 1980s, they were replaced by similar requirements applied by a local licensing authority.

The original regulations were officially known as the Lord Chamberlain's Regulations, but as they were printed in every programme as "The Lord Chamberlain's Requirements", this became their accepted name.

The requirements cover:
# Leaving the theatre at the end of the performance.
# Freedom of gangways and passages from obstruction.
# Limitations on standees.
# Operation of the [[safety curtain]] during each performance.

Three of the requirements (leaving the theatre, freedom of the gangways and the operation of the safety curtain) were set to music by [[Donald Swann]] for the revue [[Fresh Airs]] and were later used as encores for the [[Flanders and Swann]] [[revue]] ''[[At the Drop of a Hat]]''.

[[File:Mga logo.png|thumb|Malta Gaming Authority Logo]]
{{Politics of Malta}}
{{primary sources|date=June 2018}}

The '''Malta Gaming Authority''' ('''MGA''') (formerly the '''Lotteries and Gaming Authority''') ('''LGA''') is the [[gaming control board]] of [[Malta]]. It regulates most forms of gambling in its territory, including both land-based ([[casino]], amusement and [[slot machines]], betting offices, fantasy sports, and [[lotteries]]) and [[online gambling]] services including B2C and B2B services.

==History==
The MGA was established in 2001 to regulate the various sectors of the gaming industry that fall under the MGA's authority, by ensuring fairness transparency to players using gaming services, preventing crime, corruption and money laundering and to protect minor and vulnerable players. 

The MGA was one of the first regulators to offer legislation that regulates the activity of [[online gambling]] companies and create a secure atmosphere for players. A comprehensive set of legislation, regulations and directives regulate the industry, starting with Lotteries and Other Games Act, 2001, and Chapters 438 and 400 of the Laws of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mga.org.mt/legislations-regulations/ MGA Gaming Sector Legislation and Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[online gambling]] sector in [[Malta]] has grown tremendously since 2001, with the industry generating over 12% of the country's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stradbrooke |first1=Steven|title=Malta gambling biz represents over 12% of national economy |url=https://calvinayre.com/2017/11/22/business/malta-gambling-biz-12-percent-economy/ |publisher=Calvin Ayre |accessdate=22 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mifsud |first1=Russell|title=Heightened demand for talent in Malta's booming Gaming industry |url=https://home.kpmg.com/mt/en/home/insights/2017/10/heightened-demand-for-talent-in-maltas-booming-gaming-industry.html |publisher=KPMG |accessdate=29 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

The MGA deals with:

*Protection of minors and vulnerable persons, while promoting responsible gaming in a safe environment.
*Licensing and regulation of the gaming operators.
*Guidance and cooperation at all stages of the application process.
*Protection of player funds, ensuring that all deposits and withdrawals are secure and enforceable.
*Ensure the integrity of games and gaming devices, via audits and independent testing facilities to ensure the randomness of results of all games of chance.
*Monitoring of licensee activities to ensure compliance.
*Safeguarding of player rights, via investigation of complaints concerning the licensees on behalf of the players.
*Monitoring of activities to keep gaming free from criminal activities.

The MGA cannot enforce any operator to return stakes that have been voluntary placed and lost in a fair game, but it can provide advice and assistance in enforcing the deposited money and the actual winnings and aids in dispute resolution with players and its licencees when necessary.

The MGA licences several well-known online gambling companies. The list of current MGA licence holders is provided at the {{cite web |title=MGA Licensee Register |url=https://www.mga.org.mt/mgalicenseeregister/}}.

==Structure==

The MGA is composed of the following main entities:

*Non-Executive Board of Directors, primarily responsible for overseeing the strategic development of the Authority and ensuring that the set policy and strategic objectives are achieved. The Board is also responsible for policy development and overall risk management. Headed by an independent Chairman who may or may not be the CEO of the MGA.
*CEO, who is responsible for the overall execution and performance of the MGA functions.
*Executive Management Committee, who are delegated tasks by the CEO and are responsible for major functions of the MGA.
*Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors in ensuring good corporate governance, risk management, oversight of audit/accounting issues and internal controls, while overseeing the accounting and reporting processes and audits.
*Supervisory Council, which supervises and reviews the regulatory objectives of the MGA, and is responsible for ensuring the integrity, consistency and development of the regulatory functions of the MGA, while providing oversight and guidance in relation to ongoing regulatory issues, strategic regulation and act as an advisory committee to the Authority’s Board and management.
*Fit and Proper Committee, which assesses and determines whether applicants for an MGA Licence are fit and proper persons, especially from a criminal probity aspect, to be granted a gaming licence and be authorised to conduct gaming business activities.

==Chief Executives==

*Heathcliff Farrugia, CEO, 2018 - present
*Joseph Cuschieri, CEO, 2013 - 2018
*Reuben Portanier, CEO, 2009 - 2013

'''Michele LaFong''' (born August 4, 1961) is a [[comedian]], [[ventriloquist]], and official protégé of the late [[Señor Wences]].

==Early life==
Born and raised in [[Queens, New York]], Michele has been making headlines in the United States and abroad. When asked when she first realized she was funny, Michele answers "I've been clowning around since day one. I've been thrown out of every school I ever went to. I just wasn't student material and could never conform as an adult. I lost lots of jobs too, as a rock-n-roll drummer, a bartender, and a hair dresser. I lost jobs I didn't even have!"

==Career==
A highlight of her career was to perform for renowned ventriloquist [[Senor Wences]]. In 1996, LaFong performed at his 100th birthday celebration at the [[New York Friars' Club]]. The centenarian was so impressed that he befriended LaFong and gave her his famous puppets Johnny and Pedro, plus taught her how to perform his classic routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/01/07/1998-01-07_wences__puppets__gotta_hand_.html |title=Wences' Puppets: Gotta Hand It to 'Em |first=Scott |last=Williams |date=1998-01-07 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=2010-04-06 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaFong is the only ventriloquist authorized by the Wences estate to perform Johnny and Pedro, as well as Wences' routines.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Sadly, while driving on a highway and in a hurry, Michelle foolishly tried to pass a transport truck and struck a car coming the other way resulting in the death of the other car's driver back on Sept. 6, 2003 per Sin City ER episode air date 09-AUG-16.

'''Misha Defonseca''' (born '''Monique de Wael'''; 12 May 1937 in [[Etterbeek]]) is a Belgian-born writer and the author of a fictitious [[Holocaust]] memoir titled ''[[Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years]]'', first published in 1997 and at that time professed to be a true [[memoir]]. It became an instant success in [[Europe]] and was translated into 18 languages.&lt;ref name="den"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mehegan|first=David|title=Faked Holocaust memoir: Den of lies | publisher =''The Boston Globe''|date =2008-03-01|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/03/01/den_of_lies|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of the book&lt;ref&gt;In her [http://www.bestsellerthebook.blogspot.com/ blog], Jane Daniel explains the differences between the original English (''[[Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years]]'') and the French edition.&lt;/ref&gt; was a derivative work based on the original with the title ''Survivre avec les loups'' that was published in 1997 by the [[Éditions Robert Laffont]]; this second version was adapted into the [[France|French]] film ''Survivre avec les loups'' (''Surviving with Wolves'').

On 29 February 2008, the author as well as her lawyers admitted that the bestselling book was a hoax, despite its having been presented as [[Autobiography|autobiographical]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waterfield |first=Bruno |title='Wolf woman' invents Holocaust survival tale |publisher=''The Telegraph'' |date=2008-03-01 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/29/wwolf129.xml |accessdate=2008-03-01 |format=Internet Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302184438/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2008%2F02%2F29%2Fwwolf129.xml |archivedate=2 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Monique De Wael was four when her parents were arrested by the Nazis on September 23, 1941, for resistance to the occupier. According to sources, Robert De Wael, her father, a municipal employee in Schaerbeek, would have accepted the deal proposed by the Nazis: in order to be able to see his daughter Monique De Wael, he had to deliver the names of the members of his group. He even took part in interrogations of his fellow soldiers and thus helped dismantle the "Grenadiers Group", the resistance network he had founded in November 1940. He was then sent to Cologne and imprisoned in various places before being transferred to Sonnenburg on the German-Polish border where he died of exhaustion. Joséphine Donvil, his wife, was also transported from prison to prison before being deported to Ravensbruck where she died in February 1945

After the liberation, her father's name was erased from the stone plaque in honor of the local Nazi-victim employees on the walls of the Schaerbeek municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Survivre avec les loups : la véritable histoire de Misha Defonseca, de Lionel Duroy, XO, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After her parents' arrest, little Monique was sent to live with her grandparents, then her uncle. In the local community, she was known as the "daughter of the traitor".

Defonseca and her husband, Maurice, moved to the [[United States]] from [[Paris]] in 1988 and bought a house in [[Millis, Massachusetts]]. He was unemployed by the mid-1990s. Misha began to fantasize a vivid story about her childhood; suggesting to have wandering across Europe at the age of six after her parents were deported in 1941, being sheltered by friendly packs of [[gray wolf|wolves]], killing a German soldier in self-defence, sneaking into and out of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], and finally supposedly finding her way home at the end of the war.&lt;ref name="den"/&gt; [[Jane Daniel]], a local book publisher, convinced Defonseca to write a memoir about her alleged past after she heard the writer tell the story in a Massachusetts synagogue.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trujillo|first=Melissa|title=Writer Admits Holocaust Book Is Not True|publisher =Newsday|date=2008-02-29|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-holocaust-book-hoax,0,7989045.story|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel published ''Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years'' in 1997 through her "one woman operation", Mt. Ivy Press.&lt;ref name="den"/&gt;

Prior to the uncovering of the hoax, the book had spawned a multimillion-dollar legal battle between Defonseca and the book's [[ghostwriter]], Vera Lee, against Jane Daniel and her small publishing company, Mt. Ivy Press. Daniel and Defonseca fell out over profits received from the best-selling book, which led to a lawsuit. In 2005, a Boston court ordered Daniel to pay Defonseca and Lee $22.5 million. Defonseca's lawyers said Daniel has not paid the court-ordered sum.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; Following her admission, a court in 2014 ordered Defonseca to repay the full amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lizzie Dearden |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/author-who-made-up-bestselling-holocaust-memoir-ordered-to-repay-133m-9353897.html |title=Misha Defonseca: Author who made up Holocaust memoir ordered to repay £13.3m - News - Books |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its followers, the book also had many critics who pointed to passages that were logically or historically implausible. The first person who publicly doubted the authenticity of the story was [[Henryk M. Broder]], who wrote an article about Defonseca in 1996 for the German newspaper ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9133130.html Verliebt in eine tote Kobra], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 50/1996, 09 Dec. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In late February 2008, a baptismal certificate from a Brussels church for a Monique De Wael and a register from an elementary school near the De Waels' home that shows Monique enrolled there in September 1943—two years after Misha claimed to have left Brussels—, were posted by Jane Daniel on her blog.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eskin|first=Blake|title=Crying Wolf: Why did it take so long for a far-fetched Holocaust memoir to be debunked?|publisher=Slate|date=2008-02-29|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2185493|accessdate =2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian national newspaper ''Le Soir'' soon reported on these findings.&lt;ref name="lesoir"&gt;{{cite news |last=Metdepenningen |first=Marc |title=Le vrai dossier de " Misha " |language=French |publisher=''Le Soir'' |date=2008-02-23 |url=http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/cinema-ses-parents-etaient-2008-02-23-579622.shtml |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228004201/http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/cinema-ses-parents-etaient-2008-02-23-579622.shtml |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the leading historian of the [[Shoah]] in Belgium, the late Dr. Maxime Steinberg, pointed out the historic anomalies and errors in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximesteinberg.org/references.html Maxime Steinberg: Homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2008, Defonseca admitted to ''[[Le Soir]]'' that she had fabricated the tale, after having been presented with what the paper described as "irrefutable" evidence that her story was false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Pack of ... ? | doi=10.1126/science.319.5869.1467a |last=Bhattacharjee |first=Yudhiijit |date=13 March 2008 |journal=Science |volume=319 |page=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The book is a story, it's my story", said the writer in a statement issued under her real name. "It's not the true reality, but it is my reality. There are times when I find it difficult to differentiate between reality and my inner world."&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shields|first=Rachel|title=Adopted by wolves?

[[Forensic]] [[genealogist]]s [[Sharon Sergeant]] and [[Colleen M.

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}
The '''''Phaedrus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|r|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Φαῖδρος||Phaidros}}), written by [[Plato]], is a dialogue between Plato's [[protagonist]], [[Socrates]], and [[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]], an interlocutor in [[Plato#Unity and diversity of the dialogues|several dialogues]]. The ''Phaedrus'' was presumably composed around 370 BC, about the same time as Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato dialogue)|Symposium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cooper (Stuart Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University c.1997), D. S. Hutchinson - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=Plato+works+groupings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-waVd_NKJPWasapgpAI&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works%20groupings&amp;f=false Complete Works - xii] Hackett Publishing, 1997 [Retrieved 2015-3-31](ed. this source was 1st source for criticism of &lt; chronological order &gt;)&lt;/ref&gt; Although ostensibly about the topic of [[love]], the discussion in the dialogue revolves around the art of [[rhetoric]] and how it should be practiced, and dwells on subjects as diverse as [[metempsychosis]] (the Greek tradition of [[reincarnation]]) and [[erotic love]].

==Setting==
Socrates runs into [[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]] on the outskirts of Athens. Phaedrus has just come from the home of [[Epicrates of Athens]], where [[Lysias]], son of [[Cephalus]], has given a speech on love. Socrates, stating that he is "sick with passion for hearing speeches",{{r|group=Note|plato}} walks into the countryside with Phaedrus hoping that Phaedrus will repeat the speech.  They sit by a stream under a [[Oriental Plane|plane tree]] and a [[Vitex agnus-castus|chaste tree]], and the rest of the dialogue consists of oration and discussion.

The dialogue, somewhat unusually, does not set itself as a re-telling of the day's events. The dialogue is given unmediated, in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story or give it to us; it comes first hand, as if we are witnessing the events themselves. This is in contrast to such dialogues as the ''Symposium'', in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato-dialogues.org/tetra_4/phaedrus/plan_sp3.htm|title=Plato's Phaedrus - Plan of dialogue on rhetoric|last=SUZANNE|first=Bernard F.|website=plato-dialogues.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatis personæ==
* Socrates
* Phaedrus
* Lysias (in absentia)

Lysias was one of the three sons of Cephalus, the patriarch whose home is the setting for Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. Lysias was perhaps the most famous ''logographos'' (λογογράφος, lit. "argument writer") in Athens during the time of Plato. Lysias was a rhetorician and a sophist whose best-known extant work is a defense speech, "[[On the Murder of Eratosthenes]]."  The speech is a masterpiece in which a man who murdered his wife's lover claims that the laws of Athens required him to do it. The outcome of this speech is unknown.

==Summary==
The dialogue consists of a series of three speeches on the topic of love that serves as the subject to construct a discussion on the proper use of rhetoric. They encompass discussions of the [[soul]], [[insanity|madness]], [[divinity|divine]] inspiration, and the practice and mastery of an [[art]].

As they walk out into the countryside, Socrates tries to convince Phaedrus to repeat the speech of Lysias which he has just heard. Phaedrus makes several excuses, but Socrates suspects strongly that Phaedrus has a copy of the speech with him. Saying that while Lysias is present, he would never allow himself to be used as a training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak. Phaedrus gives in and agrees to perform Lysias' speech.{{r|group=Note|plato2}}

===Lysias' speech (230e–235e)===
Phaedrus and Socrates walk through a stream and find a seat in the shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with "You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out",{{r|group=Note|plato3}} the speech proceeds to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is "more sick than sound in the head" and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.

Socrates, attempting to flatter Phaedrus, responds that he is in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his [[Bacchanalia|Bacchic frenzy]]. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.{{r|group=Note|plato5}}

Socrates retorts that he is still in awe, and claims to be able to make an even better speech than Lysias on the same subject.{{r|group=Note|plato6}}

Phaedrus and Socrates both note how anyone would consider Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to his love of learning which "trees and open country won't teach," while "men in the town" will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading him out of his native land: "Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out (''dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai''). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (''en bibliois'') I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please."{{r|group=Note|plato3}}

===First speech of Socrates (237a–241d)===
When Phaedrus begs to hear it however, Socrates refuses to give the speech. Phaedrus warns him that he is younger and stronger, and Socrates should "take his meaning" and "stop playing hard to get".{{r|group=Note|plato7}} Finally, after Phaedrus swears on the plane tree that he will never recite another speech for Socrates if Socrates refuses, Socrates, covering his head, consents.{{r|group=Note|plato8}}

Socrates, rather than simply listing reasons as Lysias had done, begins by explaining that while all men desire beauty, some are in love and some are not. We are all ruled, he says, by two principles: one is our inborn desire for pleasure, and the other is our acquired judgment that pursues what is best (237d). Following your judgment is "being in your right mind", while following desire towards pleasure without reason is "outrage" (''[[hubris]]'').{{r|group=Note|plato9}}

Following different desires leads to different things; one who follows his desire for food is a glutton, and so on. The desire to take pleasure in beauty, reinforced by the kindred beauty in human bodies, is called ''Eros''.{{r|group=Note|plato10}}

Remarking that he is in the grip of something divine, and may soon be overtaken by the madness of the [[nymph]]s in this place,{{r|group=Note|plato11}} he goes on.

The problem, he explains, is that one overcome with this desire will want to turn his boy into whatever is most pleasing to himself, rather than what is best for the boy.{{r|group=Note|plato12}}  The boy's intellectual progress will be stifled, his physical condition will suffer,{{r|group=Note|plato14}} the lover will not wish the boy to mature and take a family,{{r|group=Note|plato15}} all because the lover is shaping him out of desire for pleasure rather than what is best. At some point, "right-minded reason" will take the place of "the madness of love",{{r|group=Note|plato16}} and the lover's oaths and promises to his boy will be broken.

Phaedrus believes that one of the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.

The non-lover, he concludes, will do none of this, always ruled by judgment rather than desire for pleasure. Socrates, fearing that the nymphs will take complete control of him if he continues, states that he is going to leave before Phaedrus makes him "do something even worse".{{r|group=Note|plato17}}

However, just before Socrates is about to leave, he is stopped by the "familiar divine sign", his [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]], which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do something he should not. A voice "from this very spot" forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, and seemed to be showing off. Socrates states that he is a "seer". While he is not very good at it, he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him.{{r|group=Note|plato18}} Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the [[Muse]]s, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.{{r|group=Note|plato19}}

===Second speech of Socrates (244a–257b)===

====Madness (244a–245c)====
Socrates begins by discussing madness. If madness is all bad, then the preceding speeches would have been correct, but in actuality, madness given as a gift of the gods provides us with some of the best things we have.{{r|group=Note|plato20}} There are, in fact, several kinds of divine madness (''[[theia mania]]''), of which he cites four examples:&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, N., [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/plato-aesthetics/#Pha "Plato's Aesthetics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]  "Madness comes in two general forms: the diseased state of mental dysfunction, and a divergence from ordinary rationality that a god sometimes brings (see 265a–b). Divine madness in turn takes different forms: love, Dionysian frenzy, oracular prophecy, and poetic composition (244b–245a). In all four cases the possessed or inspired person (enthousiazôn: 241e, 249e, 253a, 263d) can accomplish what is impossible for someone in a sane state"&lt;/ref&gt;
#From [[Apollo]], the gift of prophecy;
#From [[Dionysus]], the mystic rites and relief from present hardship;
#From the Muses, poetry;
#From [[Aphrodite]], love.

As they must show that the madness of love is, indeed, sent by a god to benefit the lover and beloved in order to disprove the preceding speeches, Socrates embarks on a proof of the divine origin of this fourth sort of madness. It is a proof, he says, that will convince "the wise if not the clever".{{r|group=Note|plato21}}

====The soul (245c–249d)====
He begins by briefly proving the immortality of the soul. A soul is always in motion and as a [[self-mover]] has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.{{r|group=Note|plato22}}

Then begins the famous [[Chariot Allegory|chariot allegory]], called by R. Hackworth the "centrepiece" of ''Phaedrus'', and "the famous and moving account of the vision, fall and incarnation of the soul."{{fact|date=October 2017}}  A soul, says Socrates, is like the "natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer". While the gods have two good horses, everyone else has a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.{{r|group=Note|plato24}}

As souls are immortal, those lacking bodies patrol all of heaven so long as their wings are in perfect condition. When a soul sheds its wings, it comes to earth and takes on an earthly body that then seems to move itself.{{r|group=Note|plato25}} These wings lift up heavy things to where the gods dwell and are nourished and grow in the presence of the wisdom, goodness, and beauty of the divine. However, foulness and ugliness make the wings shrink and disappear.{{r|group=Note|plato26}}

In heaven, he explains, there is a procession led by [[Zeus]], who looks after everything and puts things in order. All the gods, except for [[Hestia]], follow Zeus in this procession. While the chariots of the gods are balanced and easier to control, other charioteers must struggle with their bad horse, which will drag them down to earth if it has not been properly trained.{{r|group=Note|plato27}}  As the procession works its way upward, it eventually makes it up to the high ridge of heaven where the gods take their stands and are taken in a circular motion to gaze at all that is beyond heaven.{{r|group=Note|plato28}}

What is outside of heaven, says Socrates, is quite difficult to describe, lacking color, shape, or solidity, as it is the subject of all true knowledge, visible only to intelligence.{{r|group=Note|plato29}}  The gods delight in these things and are nourished. Feeling wonderful, they are taken around until they make a complete circle. On the way they are able to see Justice, Self-control, Knowledge, and other things as they are in themselves, unchanging. When they have seen all things and feasted on them, coming all the way around, they sink back down inside heaven.{{r|group=Note|plato30}}

The immortal souls that follow the gods most closely are able to just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, having to deal with their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while straining to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, [[sophist]]s, and tyrants follow respectively.{{r|group=Note|plato31}}

Souls then begin cycles of [[reincarnation]]. It generally takes 10,000 years for a soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life three times in a row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.{{r|group=Note|plato32}}

====The madness of love (249d–257b)====
One comes to manifest this sort of love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay no attention to what goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.{{r|group=Note|plato33}}

When one is reminded of true beauty by the sight of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.{{r|group=Note|plato34}}

Beauty, he states, was among the most radiant things to see beyond heaven, and on earth it sparkles through vision, the clearest of our senses. Some have not been recently initiated, and mistake this reminder for beauty itself and only pursue desires of the flesh. This pursuit of pleasure, then, even when manifested in the love of beautiful bodies, is not "divine" madness, but rather just having lost one's head. The recent initiates, on the other hand, are overcome when they see a bodily form that has captured true beauty well, and their wings begin to grow. When this soul looks upon the beautiful boy it experiences the utmost joy; when separated from the boy, intense pain and longing occur, and the wings begin to harden. Caught between these two feelings, the lover is in utmost anguish, with the boy the only doctor for the pain.{{r|group=Note|plato35}}

Socrates then returns to the myth of the chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is controlled by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can to go up to the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of [[sex]]. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the [[Theory of forms|forms]] of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.{{r|group=Note|plato36}}

The lover now pursues the boy. As he gets closer to his quarry, and the love is reciprocated, the opportunity for sexual contact again presents itself. If the lover and beloved surpass this desire they have won the "true [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Contests]]"; it is the perfect combination of human self-control and divine madness, and after death, their souls return to heaven.{{r|group=Note|plato37}} Those who give in do not become weightless, but they are spared any punishment after their death, and will eventually grow wings together when the time comes.{{r|group=Note|plato38}}

A lover's friendship is divine, Socrates concludes, while that of a non-lover offers only cheap, human dividends, and tosses the soul about on earth for 9,000 years. He apologizes to the gods for the previous speeches, and Phaedrus joins him in the prayer.{{r|group=Note|plato39}}

===Discussion of rhetoric and writing (257c–279c)===
[[File:Papyrus of Plato Phaedrus.jpg|thumb|Fragments of a papyrus roll of the ''Phaedrus'' from the 2nd century AD]]
After Phaedrus concedes that this speech was certainly better than any Lysias could compose, they begin a discussion of the nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing that speech making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.{{r|group=Note|plato40}}

Phaedrus claims that to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what he is speaking on, but rather how to properly persuade,{{r|group=Note|plato41}} persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus's words, harvest "a crop of really poor quality". Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion;{{r|group=Note|plato43}} on the other hand, "As the Spartan said, there is no genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be".{{r|group=Note|plato44}}

To acquire the art of rhetoric, then, one must make systematic [[diairesis|divisions]] between two different kinds of things: one sort, like "iron" and "silver", suggests the same to all listeners; the other sort, such as "good" or "justice", lead people in different directions.{{r|group=Note|plato47}} Lysias failed to make this distinction, and accordingly, failed to even define what "love" itself is in the beginning; the rest of his speech appears thrown together at random, and is, on the whole, very poorly constructed.{{r|group=Note|plato48}} Socrates then goes on to say,
:''Every speech must be put together like a living creature, with a body of its own; it must be neither without head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and extremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole work.''{{r|group=Note|plato49}}

Socrates's speech, on the other hand, starts with a thesis and proceeds to make divisions accordingly, finding divine love, and setting it out as the greatest of goods. And yet, they agree, the art of making these divisions is [[dialectic]], not rhetoric, and it must be seen what part of rhetoric may have been left out.{{r|group=Note|plato50}}

When Socrates and Phaedrus proceed to recount the various tools of speechmaking as written down by the great orators of the past, starting with the "Preamble" and the "Statement Facts" and concluding with the "Recapitulation", Socrates states that the fabric seems a little threadbare.{{r|group=Note|plato51}} He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor who knows how to raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or came across some potions knows nothing of the art.{{r|group=Note|plato52}} One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing [[tragedy|tragedies]]; if one were to claim to have mastered [[harmony]] after learning the lowest and highest notes on the [[lyre]], a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, but it is not the knowledge of harmony itself.{{r|group=Note|plato53}} This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through "Preambles" and "Recapitulations"; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.{{r|group=Note|plato54}}

They go on to discuss what is good or bad in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, critically commenting on the gift of writing from the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Thoth|Theuth]] to King [[Amun|Thamus]], who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.{{r|group=Note|plato57}}

No written instructions for an art can yield results clear or certain, Socrates states, but rather can only remind those that already know what writing is about.{{r|group=Note|plato58}}  Furthermore, writings are silent; they cannot speak, answer questions, or come to their own defense.{{r|group=Note|plato59}}

Accordingly, the legitimate sister of this is, in fact, dialectic; it is the living, breathing discourse of one who knows, of which the written word can only be called an image.{{r|group=Note|plato60}} The one who knows uses the art of dialectic rather than writing:
:''The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge—discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it happy as any human being can be.''{{r|group=Note|plato61}}

==Interpretations and themes==

===Madness and divine inspiration===

In the ''Phaedrus'', Socrates makes the rather bold claim that some of life's greatest blessings flow from madness; and he clarifies this later by noting that he is referring specifically to madness inspired by the gods. It should be noted that Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue that shows Socrates outside the city of Athens, out in the country. It was believed that spirits and nymphs inhabited the country, and Socrates specifically points this out after the long [[palinode]] with his comment about listening to the [[cicada]]s. After originally remarking that "landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me, only people do",{{r|group=Note|plato64}} Socrates goes on to make constant remarks concerning the presence and action of the gods in general, nature gods such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the nymphs, and the Muses, in addition to the unusually explicit characterization of his own daemon. The importance of divine inspiration is demonstrated in its connection with and the importance of religion, poetry and art, and above all else, love. Eros, much like in the ''[[Symposium (Plato dialogue)|Symposium]]'', is contrasted from mere desire of the pleasurable and given a higher, heavenly function. Unlike in the ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', a dialogue dealing with madness and divine inspiration in poetry and [[literary criticism]], madness here must go firmly hand in hand with reason, learning, and self-control in both love and art. This rather bold claim has puzzled readers and scholars of Plato's work for centuries because it clearly shows that Socrates saw genuine value in the irrational elements of human life, despite many other dialogues that show him arguing that one should pursue beauty and that wisdom is the most beautiful thing of all.

===Derrida on 'pharmakon'===

[[Jacques Derrida]] makes an extensive study on the untranslatable concept of what is at once a "'remedy, 'recipe,' 'drug,' 'philter,' etc.", namely, the ''[[pharmakos|pharmakon]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida, Jacques]]. (1972). "La Pharmacie de Platon." ''La dissémination.'' Éditions du Seuil. {{ISBN|2-02-020623-4}}. pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; During this study, Derrida not only divulges the exact instances Socrates or his interlocutors make use of this concept, but he also reveals the relationship between Plato and Socrates, which scholars have kept in secret by questioning the validity of authorship in Plato's letters, where in the [[Second Letter (Plato)|Second Letter]], Socrates writes: "Consider these facts and take care lest you sometimes come to repent of having now unwisely published your views. It is a very great safeguard to learn by heart instead of writing. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed (''to me graphein all' ekmanthanein'').&lt;!--314b--&gt;  That is the reason why I have never written anything about these things, and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own (''oud' estin sungramma Platonos ouden oud' estai''). What are now called his are the work of a Socrates embellished and modernized (''Sokratous estin kalou kai neou gegonotos'').&lt;!--314c--&gt;  Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it." (''Letter II'', 314)&lt;ref&gt;Derrida 1972, pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesacc.edu/~davpy35701/text/platosoc.html ''Letter II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pederasty===
The [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationships common to ancient Greek life are also at the fore of this dialogue.  In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming [[double entendre]]s and sexual innuendo is abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates as Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is "straight-up, as they say,"&lt;!--{{rf|65|plato65}}--&gt; Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on.  The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic.  And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the ''Symposium''.  Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as "friends"–equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty.  In the beginning, they sit themselves under a [[vitex|chaste tree]], which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as "monk's pepper", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an [[antaphrodisiac]].  Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.

===Rhetoric, philosophy, and art===
The ''Phaedrus'' also gives us much in the way of explaining how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a "[[midwife]] of the soul" in the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is ''for'' and what it can help one achieve.

The role of divine inspiration in philosophy must also be considered; the philosopher is struck with the fourth kind of madness, that of love, and it is this divine inspiration that leads him and his beloved towards the good—but only when tempered with self-control.

Writing, examined separately but ultimately equated with philosophy and rhetoric, is somewhat deprecated; it is stated that writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot be tailored to specific situations or students; the writer does not have the luxury of examining his reader's soul in order to determine the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism. As such, the philosopher uses writing "for the sake of amusing himself" and other similar things rather than for teaching others. A writer, then, is only a philosopher when he can himself argue that his writing is of little worth, among other requirements.

This final critique of writing with which the dialogue concludes seems to be one of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.

There is an echo of this point of view in Plato's [[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Epistle (Letter)]], wherein Plato says not to write down things of importance. {{r|group=Note|Plato66}}

A '''Portapak''' is a battery-powered, self-contained [[video tape]] [[analog recording]] system. Introduced to the market in 1967, it could be carried and operated by one person.

Earlier television cameras were large and heavy, required a specialized [[outside broadcasting|vehicle]] for transportation, and were mounted on a pedestal. The Portapak made it possible to shoot and record video easily outside of the studio without requiring a crew. Although it recorded at a lower quality than television studio cameras, the Portapak was adopted by both professionals and amateurs as a new method of video recording.  Before Portapak cameras, remote television news footage was routinely photographed on [[16mm film]] and [[telecine]]d for broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/vid_guide/|title= The Video Guide |last1= Bensinger|first1=Charles |last2= |first2= |date= |work=1981 |publisher=Video-Info Publications |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first portapak system, the [[Sony]] DV-2400 Video Rover, was a two-piece set consisting of a [[black-and-white]] [[composite video]] [[video camera]] and a separate record-only [[helical scan]] ½" [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) unit. It required a Sony [[CV series]] VTR (such as the CV-2000) to play back the video. Following Sony’s introduction of the Video Rover, numerous other manufacturers sold their own versions of Portapak technology. Although it was light enough for a single person to carry and use, it was usually operated by a crew of two: one carrying and controlling the camera, and one carrying and operating the VTR.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web

This model was followed up by the AV-3400/AVC-3400, which used the [[EIAJ-1]] format, and had 30-minute capacity, as well as playback capability. Later Portapaks by Sony, [[JVC]], and others used such formats as [[U-Matic]] [[videocassette]]s (with reduced-size 20-minute "U-Matic S" cassettes) and [[Betacam SP]] (for which a Portapak, unlike a camera-mounted deck, allowed the use of the larger "L" cassettes, for up to 90-minute recording time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/sony-av-3400-porta-pak |title= Sony AV-3400 Portapak|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011|work= |publisher= Experimental Television Center|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the Portapak had a great influence on the development of [[video art]], [[guerrilla television]], and [[activism]]. Video collectives such as [[TVTV (video collective)|TVTV]] and the [[Videofreex]] utilized Portapak technology to document countercultural movements apart from the [[Big Three television networks]]. The Portapak was also a crucial technology for the [[Raindance Foundation]], a collective consisting of artists, academics, and scientists, motivated by the potential of the Portapak and video to develop alternative forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radicalsoftware.org/e/index.html |title= Radical Software|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its relative affordability and immediate playback capability, the Portapak provided artists, experimenters, and social commentators the ability to make and distribute videos apart from well-funded production companies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A generation whose childhood had been dominated by broadcast television was now able to get its hands on a means of TV production. The machine was relatively inexpensive ($1,500), light- weight, easy to use and reliable, and it produced a decent black-and-white image with acceptable audio. Tape was reusable and inexpensive. The video portapak helped trigger a range of activity linking video with social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ryan |first1= Paul |last2= |first2= |year= |title= Genealogy of Video |journal= Leonardo |volume= 21|issue=1 |pages=39–44 |publisher= The MIT Press |doi= 10.2307/1578414|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Portapak would seem to have been invented specifically for use by artists. Just when pure formalism had run its course; just when it became politically embarrassing to make objects, but ludicrous to make nothing; just when many artists were doing performance works but had nowhere to perform, or felt the need to keep a record of their performances; just when it began to seem silly to ask the same old Berkleean question, ‘If you build a sculpture in the desert where no one can see it, does it exist?’; just when it became clear that TV communicates more information to more people than large walls do; just when we understood that in order to define space it is necessary to encompass time; just when many established ideas in other disciplines were being questioned and new models were proposed — just then the Portapak became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Special make up artist.jpg|thumb|200px|Example from work of a Special [[Make-up artist]]]]

'''Prosthetic makeup''' (also called '''Special make-up effects''' and '''FX prosthesis''') is the process of using [[prosthetic]] sculpting, molding and casting techniques to create advanced cosmetic [[special effects|effects]]. Prosthetic makeup was revolutionized by [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]] in such films as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]] in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]''.

==Technique==
The process of creating a prosthetic appliance begins with [[lifecasting]], the process of taking a mold of a body part (often the face) to use as a base for sculpting the prosthetic. Lifecast molds are made from prosthetic [[alginate]] or more recently, from skin-safe [[silicone]] rubber. This initial mold is relatively weak and flexible. A hard mother mold, typically made of plaster or fiberglass bandages is created overtop the initial mold to provide support.

Once a negative mold has been created, it is promptly filled with [[gypsum]] cement, most commonly a brand called "Ultracal-30", to make a "positive" mold. The form of the prosthetic is sculpted in clay on top of the positive. The edges of the clay should be made as thin as possible, for the clay is a stand-in for what will eventually be the prosthetic piece. Along the edges of the mold, "keys" or mold points are sculpted or carved into the lifecast, to make sure that the two pieces of the mold will fit together correctly. Once sculpting is completed, a second mold is made. This gives two or more pieces of a mold - a positive of the face, and one or more negative mold pieces of the face with prosthetic sculpted in. All clay is carefully removed and the prosthetic material is cast into the mold cavity. The prosthetic material can be foam [[latex]], [[gelatin]], silicone or other similar materials. The prosthetic is cured within the two part mold - thus creating the beginning of a makeup effect.

One of the hardest parts of prosthetic make-up is keeping the edges as thin as possible. They should be tissue thin so they are easy to blend and cover giving a flawless look.

== Conflict with CGI ==
As the film/television industry continues to grow, so do the capabilities of the technologies behind it. Since the debut of newer technologies, many have feared that CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) will put practical SFX makeup out of business. More can be done with CGI than can be done with makeup as some things simply aren't possible when working in reality. Many views circulate on the subject.

[[Tom Woodruff, Jr.|Tom Woodruff Jr.]] and [[Alec Gillis]], two experienced SFX artists from [[Amalgamated Dynamics]] near L.A., share what they see as the middle ground on the subject. In an interview, they explain that most movies use (out of necessity) a combination of practical effects and CGI. They see CGI as a tool that can be utilized in a good way or a bad way, just like practical effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2014/12/sfx-vfx-two-effects-artists-discuss-differences-between-practical-cgi|title=SFX vs. VFX: Two Effects Artists Discuss the Differences Between Practical &amp; CGI|date=2014-12-03|work=No Film School|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Savini]] (an SFX artist known for his work in ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' and ''Creepshow'') states: "They still use the make-up guys to design the creatures and that’s what they work from. I don’t think you’ll see make-up effects guys hanging out on corners with signs that say: ''WILL DO EFFECTS FOR FOOD''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/makers/459394-practical-effects-masters-pros-and-cons-cgi/|title=Practical Effects Masters on the Pros and Cons of CGI - Tested.com|website=Tested|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real-World Use ==
Special Effects Makeup isn't only used in films. A branch of SFX called [[Moulage]] is the process in which makeup is used to simulate different wounds and trauma in order to prepare medical, emergency, and military personnel for what they could experience in the field and lessen psychological trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthysimulation.com/28/moulage-bridging-the-gap-in-simulation/|title=Moulage – Bridging the Gap in Simulation {{!}} Healthy Simulation|website=www.healthysimulation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120303203142/http://www.kurdistanjournalists.com/default.aspx Kurdistan Journalists Syndicate] (KJS) said Mama Hama had received a threatening message from an unidentified person on May 15.&lt;ref name=cpjBio /&gt;

Hama was shot and died in front of his home in Kirkuk.&lt;ref name="kirkuknow" /&gt; In the mobile phone Hama was using, there were messages discovered to be from a [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] politician who had threatened him with death prior to assassination.

==Other types of prostitution==
In some cases, Iraqi teenage boys and young men are the prostitutes.  In these cases the prostitutes are typically motivated by poverty and are mostly heterosexual.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Iraq}}
Iraq is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. The violent conflict with [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] exacerbated the population’s vulnerability to trafficking, in particular women and children. Refugees and [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]] face heightened risk of trafficking due to their economic and social vulnerability and lack of security and protections. NGOs report trafficking networks in the [[Kurdistan Province|IKR]] target refugees and IDPs, operating with assistance from local officials, including judges, officials from the [[Asayish (Kurdistan Regional Government)|Asayish]] forces, and border agents. In 2015, members of the IKR Parliament and NGOs reported some personnel from the Asayish forces facilitated the sex trafficking of women and girls in [[Syria]]n refugee camps in the IKR, primarily in Domiz refugee camp, as well as sex trafficking of girls outside of the camps. In 2016, NGOs reported Asayish guards not only allowed men to enter a camp to solicit commercial sex with refugee girls, but the guards also solicited sex from the refugee girls, including granting them permission to leave the camp in exchange for sex. Reports from 2015 indicated IDPs and some Syrian refugee women were forced into prostitution by a trafficking network in hotels and brothels in [[Baghdad]], [[Basrah]], and other cities in southern Iraq after agents of the network promised to resettle them from the IKR.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282675.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports continue to suggest some Iraqi law enforcement officials have allegedly frequented brothels known for sex trafficking or accepted bribes to allow sex trafficking. Media and other observers reported in 2015 that an Iranian sex trafficking network operated brothels in [[Erbil]] where Iranian girls were exploited in commercial sex; the media reported a KRG official allegedly paid $3,000 for an Iranian sex trafficking victim. There were anecdotal reports, including from a June 2016 local television station, of child sex trafficking of girls primarily from Iran and Syria, as well as some from the IKR, in [[Sulaymaniyah]]. NGOs also report cases in which girls who have run away from their families out of fear of honor killings are exploited in commercial sex by criminal networks.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Iraq as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

'''Psycho-biddy''' is a colloquial term for a subgenre of the [[horror film|horror]]/[[thriller film|thriller movie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://flavorwire.com/335871/the-scariest-psycho-biddies-in-cinema] ''Nastasi, Alison. "The Scariest Psycho Biddies in Cinema." Flavorwire. Oct. 9, 2012.''&lt;/ref&gt; that features a formerly-glamorous older woman who has become mentally unbalanced and terrorizes those around her. The genre officially began in 1962 with the film ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (though it had some antecedents) and lasted through the mid-1970s. It has also been referred to by the terms '''Grande Dame Guignol''', '''hagsploitation''' and '''hag horror'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelley |first=Peter |date=September 15, 2009 |title=Grande Dame Guignol Cinema: A History of Hag Horror from "Baby Jane" to "Mother" |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Grande_Dame_Guignol_Cinema.html?id=HKYqAQAAIAAJ |location=Jefferson, North Carolina and London |publisher=McFarland and Company, Inc. |page= |isbn=978-0786445691 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renata Adler]], in her ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review for the 1968 film ''[[The Anniversary (1968 film)|The Anniversary]]'', referred to the genre as "the Terrifying Older Actress Filicidal Mummy genre."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E0DE1131E034BC4951DFB5668383679EDE ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition, themes and influences==
The subgenre features a mentally unstable, dangerous, or insane woman of advanced years with a somewhat glamorous past, living a life of relative wealth. In some cases, the woman may be in jeopardy of some sort, with another party attempting to drive her to mental instability. Often (but not always), there are two older women pitted against one another in a life-or-death struggle, usually the result of bitter hatreds, jealousies, or rivalries that have percolated over the course of, not years, but decades. These combatants are often blood-relatives. The character is often brought to life in an over-the-top, grotesque fashion, emphasizing the unglamorous process of aging and eventual death. Characters are often seen pining for lost youth and glory, trapped by their idealized memories of their childhood, or younger days, and the trauma of a past episode that haunts them.

This subgenre includes elements of many other genres, including [[gothic fiction|gothic]], [[Grand Guignol]], [[black comedy]], [[psychodrama]], [[melodrama]], [[revenge]], [[camp (style)|camp]] and even the [[musical film|musical]]. [[Science fiction]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] films have also been part of the genre.

==History==
{{Section OR|date=December 2010}}
The genre began in [[1962 in film|1962]] with ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' directed by [[Robert Aldrich]]. ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' bolstered the flagging careers of its [[movie star|stars]], [[Bette Davis]] as [[Baby Jane Hudson]] and [[Joan Crawford]] as [[Blanche Hudson]]. The [[1950 in film|1950]] [[Billy Wilder]] classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' shares thematic similarities (their respective central characters both psychotically deranged formerly-glamorous older women) with ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' and can be seen as a precursor to the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Peter (2009) ''Grande Dame Guignol Cinema'' McFarland and Company, Inc. Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina and London&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baby Jane'' set many trends and more-or-less defined the genre: the theatrical performance, the trappings of wealth and Hollywood, and psychologically complex melodrama. Jane goes quite insane over the course of the movie, torturing her crippled sister and venting long-pent up hostilities and guilt. At the end of the film, Blanche makes a confession which details and admits of her own complicity in the whole affair. The film was quite successful, garnering [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including one for Davis.

Crawford then starred in director and producer [[William Castle]]'s ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]) as Lucy Harbin, the accused axe-murderer of her husband and his mistress, who is released from the [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] for the [[criminally insane]] after 20 years to be reunited with her beloved daughter and other friends. When a new string of axe-murders begins, it is naturally assumed that it is Lucy committing them.

The two actresses were reunited again with director Robert Aldrich for a ''Baby Jane'' "follow-up", ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964), despite a hyped, somewhat exaggerated feud. But genuine mutual dislike between the two actresses led to Crawford bowing out. She was replaced by [[Olivia de Havilland]], who knew how to get along with Davis. Veteran actresses [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Mary Astor]] also appeared in the film.

In ''Charlotte'', Davis was not only the one going insane, but was the "officially" sympathetic character, who is [[gaslighting|gaslit]] by her cousin (De Havilland) and her doctor, the cousin's lover ([[Joseph Cotten]]). In this movie, Davis' character is again haunted by guilt, though this time the ante is upped: instead of believing herself responsible for a crippling, she believes she is responsible for the murder of her lover. ''Charlotte'' is one of the most successful examples of the genre, and is noted for using [[Southern Gothic]] atmosphere.

[[Mad Magazine|''Mad'' Magazine]] poked fun at the genre in 1966 with a movie musical satire entitled "Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been-or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?"&lt;ref&gt;''"Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been -or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?"'' Written by Mort Drucker, Illustrated by Larry Siegel. ''MAD'' Magazine, Issue No. 100, January 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable films==
[[File:What's the Matter With Helen Shelley Winters 1971.jpg|thumb|Shelley Winters in ''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]'' (1971)]]
Wealth is a more prominent theme than revenge in ''[[What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]). Claire Marrable ([[Geraldine Page]]), a socialite, finds herself (apparently) penniless when her husband dies. She then begins hiring financially independent older cleaning women, murdering them, taking their savings and planting the corpses in her garden. The corpses apparently make the ground quite fertile, and it's not until the third cleaning woman drops out of sight that someone ([[Ruth Gordon]]) begins to suspect something is amiss. Gordon applies to be Page's maid to figure out what happened to her friend, the third maid. The movie has a certain status as a [[cult film|cult classic]], and is fairly well-regarded.

''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) features two older women, Helen Hill ([[Shelley Winters]]) and Adelle Bruckner ([[Debbie Reynolds]]), who move out to Hollywood during the heyday of [[Shirley Temple]]. Their sons have gone to prison for a [[Leopold and Loeb]]-like murder and the two mothers are on the run from a man who threatens to kill them for revenge. Helen, an increasingly unstable and violent religious [[religious fanaticism|fanatic]] and repressed [[Lesbianism|lesbian]], may have murdered her husband years before (and possibly led to her son's criminal behavior). Helen's increasing obsession with Adelle, her roommate, leads to a graphically violent climax, which would recur in future excursions into the genre.

''[[Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?]]'' (1971) has only one older woman, Mrs. Rosie Forrest, a.k.a. Auntie Roo (Shelley Winters), featured prominently in the cast. A young orphan becomes a surrogate in the troubled woman's mind for her own long-dead daughter. Roo visits the mummified remains in her daughter's bedroom. The themes of deep-seated past guilt and youth are explored. The story is a variant of the [[Hansel and Gretel]] theme; however, unlike the witch in the story, Roo is seriously unstable, as well as subject to con-artist clairvoyants and blackmailing servants. She tries to keep the young orphan girl with her, as the girl reminds her of her daughter, but the girl and her brother fight back, and are quite cunning, having stolen, by the film's end, the woman's valuable jewelry. Roo dies in a fire the children set while trying to escape.

Other examples of the genre are the 1965 UK films ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]] in the lead role as the said nanny, and ''[[Fanatic (film)|Fanatic]]'' with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], released in the US as ''Die! Die! My Darling''.

Later films like ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981) and ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' (2000) also contain elements of the psycho-biddy genre in their respective portrayals of aged women who descend into mental instability.

[[File:Simon Says (6101891636).jpg|thumb|Children playing Simon Says with "Simon" (the controller) in the foreground]] 
'''Simon Says''' (or '''[[Simple Simon (nursery rhyme)|Simple Simon]] Says''') is a game for 3 or more players where 1 player takes the role of "Simon" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as "jump in the air" or "stick out your tongue") to the other players, which should only be followed if prefaced with the phrase "Simon says". Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase "Simon says". It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted.

The object for the player acting as Simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands.  Occasionally however, 2 or more of the last players may all be eliminated at the same time, thus resulting in Simon winning the game.

The game is well embedded in popular culture, with numerous references in films, music and literature.

==History==
The tradition behind the use of 'Simon' as the controller of the game may trace back to the year 1264, when at the [[Battle of Lewes]], [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] captured King Henry III and his son, the future King Edward I.  For the next year, any order Henry III gave could have been countermanded by de Montfort, until his defeat at the [[Battle of Evesham]].&lt;ref name=yahooblog&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Mike |title=Origin of Simon Says |url=http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/simon-story-behind-playground-favorite-070108628.html |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924033632/http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/simon-story-behind-playground-favorite-070108628.html |archivedate=24 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This game has translated across multiple cultures from seemingly common routes and some international versions also use the name Simon such as:
* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: for example, "الجنرال عمل كده" ("The general commanded", [[Egypt]]) or "قال المعلّم" ("The teacher says", [[Lebanon]]) and "سلمان يقول" ("Salman says", [[Iraq]])
* [[Basque language|Basque]]: "Buruak dio" or "Buruzagiak dio" (The leader says), or "Unaik dio" (Unai says)
* [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: "নেতা বলেছেন" (The leader says)
* [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]: "老師話" ("The teacher says")
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]：“老师说”（"The teacher says"）
* [[Danish language|Danish]]: "Simon siger"
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: "Commando" (the Dutch noun for "command"), or "Jantje zegt" ("Johnny says") in Flemish parts of [[Belgium]]
* [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: "Kapteeni käskee" ("The captain commands")
* [[French language|French]]: "Jacques a dit" ("[[Jacques|James]] said"), or "Jean dit" ("John says") in Québec

A version also exists in India, Pakistan, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary where an analogy to what can fly and what cannot is emphasized instead of Simon saying or not, i.e. "[[Chidiya ud]]" ([[Hindi]]) which translates to ''Bird fly'' or "Alle Vögel fliegen hoch" (German) which is "All birds fly high". The term 'bird' can then be replaced with a thing that cannot fly. These games are usually played more with gestures than actual jumping.

In a Swedish version, '''Gör si, gör så''' ("Do this, do thus"), the leader says either "do this" or "do thus" while performing an action. For failing to follow the correct command, "do this", or following the wrong command, "do thus", a child must sit down until a new leader is chosen.

In the late 1930s in New Zealand, non commissioned officers were leading troops in a brain stimulation game as part of training classed as informal activities called, 'do this, do that.'

==Game play==
A command starting with "Simon says" means that the players must obey that command. A command ''without'' the beginning "Simon says" means  do '''not''' do this action. Anyone who breaks one of these two rules is eliminated from the remainder of the game. Often, anyone who speaks is also eliminated.

There can be very complex and difficult command chains, such as "Simon says: Arms up. Simon says: Arms down. Arms up." Anyone ending with their arms up is eliminated, because a command that doesn't begin with "Simon says" cannot be obeyed.

A variation on the instruction phrases is used. "Simon says" is said once at the start of a series of instructions, and an action along with the phrase "do ''this''" must be obeyed while an action with the phrase "do ''that''" must not be obeyed. Obeying a "do that" command or not obeying a "do this" command will eliminate a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do This.  Do That. {{!}} Elementary PE Games|url=http://www.pegames.org/classroom/do-this-do-that|website=www.pegames.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered cheating to give impossible commands ("Simon says, lift both of your legs up and keep them there!") or phrase the commands in such a way that the other player has no option but to 'go out' ("Simon says, jump up. Come down."). However, at least in some versions, it is allowed for Simon to eliminate players by asking them to do something seemingly unrelated to the game (example: "Anyone remaining join me up here.").

== Cultural references ==
*Various musical artists have produced songs with the title "Simon Says" including the [[1910 Fruitgum Company]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Clawfinger]], [[Drain STH]], [[Kidsongs]], [[Judy &amp; David]], [[The Wiggles]], [[Laleh Pourkarim|Laleh]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Clyde McKnight]], [[Krizz Kaliko]], and [[NCT 127]].
*The phrase has been used multiple times as a plot device in films and television dramas including ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', ''[[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', ''[[The Gift (2015 film)|The Gift]]'' and the TV series ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' as well as being played in television game shows including 1970s show ''[[Superstars]]'' and ''[[Battle of the Network Reality Stars]]''.
*The phrase occurs twice in ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' for comic effect: "Simon says everybody lay down on the floor." First the outlaw on the run character J.D. ([[Brad Pitt]]) tells how he usually sets off to do an armed robbery. Later on we find out in the only flashback scene of the movie that Thelma ([[Geena Davis]]) uses exactly the same phrase when robbing a store.
*In an episode of the [[Cartoon Network]] show ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', the title character (disguised as an eggplant) gives commands to the other eggplants after saying "The Great Eggplant says".
*The ''[[Peanuts]]'' special ''[[It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown]]'' includes a song/dance number called "Lucy Says" where Lucy plays the role of Simon, but uses "Lucy Says" instead of "Simon Says".
*In the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode, "King Yakko", Yakko, as king of Anvilania gets his men to take their seats, but when they were about to do so, Yakko stops them saying, "I didn't say 'Simon Says'!"  Then he tells them, "Simon says take your seats!" which they follow.
*A stunt played on the game show ''[[Fun House (U.S. game show)|Fun House]]'' also played Simon Says, but was changed to "Tiny Says" to match the name of the show's announcer giving the commands.
*The electronic game ''[[Simon (game)|Simon]]'' is named for Simon Says.&lt;ref name=yahooblog /&gt;
*''[[Jim Henson's Pajanimals]]'' has the Pajanimals play a similar game called "Cowbella Says." Similar to the ''[[Peanuts]]'' example above, Cowbella, one of the Pajanimals, plays the role of Simon and uses "Cowbella Says" instead of "Simon Says". Before they play, there is a short song that has the lyrics "If Cowbella says, 'Cowbella Says,' you must do what Cowbella says; and if she doesn't say 'Cowbella Says,' you must not do what Cowbella says!"
*[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse|Mickey Mouskersize]], a short in Disney Junior has a game called '''Mickey Says'''. Mickey plays the role of Simon, once in the middle of the game, Goofy and Minnie did what Mickey said when he did not say "Mickey Says".
*In ''[[Let's Go Pocoyo]]'', there is a game in some episodes called '''Fred Says'''. This is a simple game. Fred plays the role of Simon, however, the narrator always says "Fred Says" in each phrase. At the end, the narrator says "Fred Says: That's all."
*In ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies]]'', the game's main prosecutor is Simon Blackquill, likely named after the game. He's a master of [[psychological manipulation]], and his acts of manipulating the minds of others is compared to as Simon Says by other characters.
*In an episode of ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'', Cody uses the game to teach the Bots about obeying commands. He uses basic instructions such as "Turn right" and "raise your left arm". When he issues a command without stating "Simon says", Chase responds by stating "Simon did not authorize that last movement".
*A literal arcade-based smartphone adaptation of "Simon Says" was released exclusively on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on July 11, 2016, titled ''Simon Says Mobile''.  In this version, bodily gestures are replaced with mobile gestures, namely [[Touchscreen|tapping, swiping]] and [[Gyroscope|tilting]].  It is free-to-play with [[Microtransaction|in-app purchases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Play Store listing for ''Simon Says Mobile'' |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stalwartphoenix.simonsaysmobile |website=Google Play Store |date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In a ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'' episode, "Hop to It!", Barney and the kids play Simon Says. Two of them, Luci and Min, are out after touching their chins but the other two, Michael and Tina, remain. Another episode, "All Mixed Up", also has Barney and the kids play Simon Says in which the educational theme of this episode is about following directions.
*In the 2015 novel ''[[Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda]]'' (and its 2018 film adaptation ''[[Love, Simon]]''), protagonist Simon Spier's online pseudonym Jacques derived the French version of Simon Says, "Jacques a dit".

It was established on June 24, 1941, shortly after the opening of the [[Eastern Front of World War II]] by a directive of [[Sovnarkom]] and the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] "to bring into the limelight international events, military developments, and day-to-day life through printed and broadcast media."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform_war/m9005510 Sovinformburo during WWII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013010807/http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform_war/m9005510 |date=2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, Sovinformburo directed the activity of the [[All-Slavonic Committee]], [[Anti-Fascist Committee of Soviet Women]], [[Anti-Fascist Committee of the Soviet Youth]], [[Anti-Fascist Committee of Soviet Scientists]] and the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] (JAC).

The radio announcements were performed on [[Radio Moscow]] (known for its [[Wide is My Motherland]] beeping) by [[Yuri Levitan]]. While Radio Moscow always started its announcements with the words "Moscow is speaking" (Govorit Moskva), during the German aggression against the Soviet Union in [[World War II]] the broadcasting was conducting from Sverdlovsk (today [[Yekaterinburg]]) until 1943 when it was moved to Kuibyshev (today [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]) until 1945.

The [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|fall of Kiev]] was never announced by the Soviet Information Bureau.

'''''Starpoint Gemini''''' is a real-time, simulation, role-playing game focused on the control and strengths of individual vessels and their command crews. The game is set in a science-fiction universe where various thriving technological directions exist side by side. Players will freely traverse the rich and filled vastness of the Gemini star system, fight skirmishes with rogue ships, [[trade]] commodities, mine ore from asteroids, research anomalies, buy new vessels, enlarge their fleet, upgrade their ships with state-of-the-art technology, increase their experience and rank to learn more powerful maneuvers and ultimately use all that in large scale engagements against other fleets and battlestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacesimcentral.com/starpoint-gemini-f32/with-lgm-games-starpoint-gemini-t723.html|title=Q&amp;A for Starpoint Gemini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The player navigates a large and powerful spaceship. Every vessel in the game can be controlled and upgraded with over 300 ship systems ranging from Shield emitters and Grappling beams to Plasma cannons and Shockwave generators, to better suit the player. In addition, the player can create their "captain avatar" in the beginning of the game with some starting maneuvers (skills) which they then later upgrade during the game. He can also add new maneuvers by spending maneuver points he gained with experience levels.

Starpoint Gemini features a combination of tactical combat and extensive role-playing features that support a wide variety of overall strategy. The player is able to undertake any of the game’s possible career paths, such as trade, repair, piracy, research, salvaging, mining, or a mixture. While most games of the space adventure ilk offer the same possibilities, Starpoint Gemini offers up to thirty-eight skills and eighteen perks earned through experience (and officers the player can hire for additional skills), along with twenty-one special abilities spread across fifty ships. The game has a large amount of variety, allowing the player to forge any path of your liking. Missions are also varied, providing your primary source of income in the game since the trade interface leaves room for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outofeight.info/2010/12/starpoint-gemini-review.html|title=Starpoint Gemini Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starpoint Gemini offers the main storyline of some thirty missions, but also leaves a free choice to every individual player, whether they will actually follow the main plot or roam around at their own leisure. The entire Gemini star system is a living universe where commerce, mining, talking and fighting happens all around you. It is up to the player to survey the Gemini world, and choose their [[career]]. Since, in a way, your main character in a game is a large starship, the game offers many ways to customize it and adjust to your way of doing things. The captain can be a specialist in some technical field or warfare area, and he gains levels and perks in time. The ships themselves have unique abilities, and can also be customized with large numbers of weapons, shields, power cores and science equipment. In addition, a player can also employ several crew members, each with his own bonuses and abilities, depending on their position and who is currently available. Once that is done, one can travel around Gemini sectors in search of wealth,(trading, mining), glory,(fighting,taking up freelance missions), or investigate anomalies. One can use everything from small gunships to large battlecruisers. The player has many tactics: frontal assault, cloaking approach, subtargeting enemy ship's subsystems, boarding the enemy vessel, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgwatch.com/show/article?articleid=167&amp;ref=0&amp;id=451|title=Starpoint Gemini Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
'''''[[Starpoint Gemini 2]]''''' is the sequel to original PC game released in 2010. Players will once again be offered a chance to experience unrestricted life in Gemini starsystem. Most of the game elements are unchanged, but on the technical side game is greatly improved. Movement is now in full 3D universe, combat controls are more direct and action based, while most significant changes are visible in graphics features aimed at keeping the game up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpointgemini.com/|title=Starpoint Gemini 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">[[Image:TV-B-Gone complete.jpg|right|thumb|A TV-B-Gone]]
'''TV-B-Gone''' is a [[universal remote]] control device for turning off a large majority — about 85% — of the currently{{when|date=March 2018}} available brands of [[television set]]s. It was created to allow people in a public place to turn off nearby television sets. Its inventor has referred to it as "an environmental management device". The device is part of a [[Keychain|key-chain]], and, like other remote devices, is [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered. Although it can require up to 72 seconds for the device to find the proper code for a particular [[television receiver]], the most popular televisions turn off in the first few seconds.

== History ==
TV-B-Gone was invented by [[Mitch Altman]] and is sold by his company Cornfield Electronics. Altman was one of the pioneers of [[Virtual Reality]], working with [[Jaron Lanier]] at VPL Research, and it was during his research in this field that he started to believe in the hypnotic power of [[television program]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The standard model TV-B-Gone consists of an infra-red LED, two [[CR2032]] cells and an integrated circuit containing the television power code database, all in a plastic case. The original case aesthetics and design were created by Robert Ellis.

== Models ==

=== TV-B-Gone Pro SHP ===
The TV-B-Gone Pro SHP (Super High Power) is the latest TV-B-Gone to be announced. It is considerably more powerful than the standard model, using eight infra-red LEDs to allow TVs to be turned off from distances of up to 100 meters (300&amp;nbsp;feet). TV-B-Gone Pro SHP is switchable between its North American and European databases of POWER codes. Later, in 2009, Mitch Altman
made a new kind of TV-B-Gone Pro SHP. Instead of disguising it as an [[iPhone]], Mitch Altman has made the new and improved TV-B-Gone look like an [[iPod Nano]] and go ten more yards than the old one.

The recent{{when|date=March 2018}} invention of &gt;1W 850 and 970&amp;nbsp;nm IREDs makes a miniature long range version of the TV-B-Gone feasible.

=== TV-B-Gone Kit ===
At several hacker conventions Mitch Altman has run workshops that allow participants to build their own TV-B-Gones using [[Adafruit Industries]]' [[micro controller]]-based mini-POV kit. Around January 2008, Adafruit Industries released a kit to build an open source TV-B-Gone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://learn.adafruit.com/tv-b-gone-kit TV-B-Gone Kit] Adafruit Learning System&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer Electronics Show controversy ==
During the 2008 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], an individual associated with [[Gizmodo]] brought a TV-B-Gone remote control and shut off many display monitors at booths and during demos affecting several companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/343348/confessions-the-meanest-thing-gizmodo-did-at-ces Confessions: The Meanest Thing Gizmodo Did at CES&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These actions caused the individual to be banned for life from future CES events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9849168-2.html CEA's take on CES Gizmodo prank: Banned!]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivative works ==
Since December 2007 the open source project "unzap"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lochraster.org/unzap/?en unzap project page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; offers free TV-b-gone-alike hardware, including a [[USB]]-port and a learning function for new codes.

==Synopsis==
"The Land" follows the life of Paul-Edward Logan.  Paul is the child of a white man and a black/Native American woman.  Paul has three entries from Paul's journal, after the main story ends. The dialogue uses the Southern dialect from the 1870s and 1880s.

===Childhood===
The novel begins with Paul-Edward, as a nine-year-old. "The Land" describes how Paul's life has been different from that of most freed slaves.  The book is narrated from Paul's perspective, and quickly introduces his three brothers, his sister, and Mitchell Thomas, a black boy whose father works for Paul's father and who becomes a vital member of the story-line. In the beginning, Mitchell continually bullies Paul for being multiracial. Paul's father and brothers' only advice for Paul is to "use his head," and come up with a solution by himself. In "Childhood," Paul's parents are constant reminders of the trials and tribulations of being born biracial. After several months of incessant bullying, Paul strikes a deal with Mitchell. Their deal states that if Paul teaches Mitchell to "read English, write English, and figure," then Mitchell will teach Paul how to fight and to fend for himself; but as he reminded Paul, Mitchell "can't teach him how to win."

Paul and Mitchell soon grow tired of obeying Edward Logan (Paul's Father). Paul comes across the opportunity to race another man's horse. Edward Logan forbids it, saying that it would be unwise of Paul to ride, let alone race, a horse with whom he is not acquainted. Paul wins the race but has trouble collecting his pay. The owner of the horse will not give Paul his pay. Due to Paul being of mixed heritage, the owner of the horse doesn't even have to give Paul his earned money. If Mitchell hadn't used violent force to ensure that the white man kept his word by paying Paul his money, Paul would have never seen any dime of "four times a rider's pay."  After this incident, the two flee aboard a train.

===Manhood===
Paul and Mitchell are working in a lumber camp and wish to escape. The pair start their journey together, but they decide to separate to avoid drawing attention to themselves. While they are separated, Mitchell goes to more lumber camps, and Paul's eyes land upon J.T. Hollenbeck's land. Upon seeing this land, Paul knows that this is 'The Land.'  His land. The book then goes on to describe life in different types of work camps. The story follows Paul as he works at a general store owned by Luke Sawyer, and as a woodworker in a small town called Vicksburg.

Eventually, Paul and Mitchell meet a man by the name of Filmore Granger and make a deal to work for the possession of 40 acres. Although it is not The Land, clearing the forty will help Paul obtain the money needed for J.T. Hollenbeck's land.  A deal was struck between Paul and Mr. Granger that stated, if Paul could clear the forty within about two years, Paul and Mitchell would own the forty.

After a few months of working hard at the forty, Paul realizes that he needs the help of some hired hands.  Mitchell suggests Tom Bee, with whom he had worked a lumber camp.  A white boy Paul had met before, and a young black boy named Nathan Perry, who later becomes Paul's brother-in-law are also hired hands. For a while, a white boy by the name of Wade Jamison helps Paul clear the forty.

Mitchell marries Caroline, who soon becomes pregnant, while Paul continues to work for his land. To disrupt this happiness, Digger Wallace fulfills his promise to get Mitchell back for embarrassing him. One day while Mitchell is working on Filmore Granger's land, the drunken Digger shoots Mitchell from behind. Mitchell was in the middle of felling a tree when shot. Being paralyzed with searing pain, Mitchell is crushed by the tree. When Paul gets back from The Land, he arrives on the scene; Mitchell is almost dead. Mitchell's last request of Paul is that he marry Caroline and take care of their unborn child. After Mitchell dies, Paul tries to hunt down Digger, but is unsuccessful.  Later, Digger is found dead, face down in a river, with a bottle of moonshine floating next to him.

Later that year, their work of clearing the forty is almost completed and should soon be in Paul's possession, even with all of the extra conditions that Granger adds to the deal in a last-ditch attempt to keep his land. When Granger claims that they cut trees outside of the perimeter, he declares that he wants Paul off of the land; unless he wishes to sharecrop. Cassie, Paul's sister, sends their brother Robert up to deliver an envelope with the money he needs to purchase J.T. Hollenbeck's land. His brother tells Paul of the family's condition and gives Paul the envelope. Enclosed is the money and two letters. Paul's sister explains in her letter that their mother owned the patch of land that they lived on as children, and that ten years after their mother's death, she sold the land to their father for $500, much more than it was worth. This combined with his sister's savings made more than enough money to pay for the land. After burying Mitchell's body, Paul asks Caroline to marry him, and confessing that she too, loves him, Caroline says yes. From this point in the story, Paul purchases the land, moves onto it, and lives the life he wants.

===Legacy===
In Legacy, Paul's father was sick when Paul takes his boys back to see his family. He saw Robert, Hammond, Cassie, and Cassie's husband Howard. Though Paul had visited Hammond in his store several times over the years, Paul had never heard from brothers Robert and George. No one had heard from George in years. The day after Paul arrived home, his father died.  Paul then bought the other 200 acres of Hollenbeck land, from Wade Jamison.

== Autobiographical elements ==

Mildred D. Taylor's novels are often based on stories that she read, heard, or was told about her family's history. "I remember my grandparents' house, the house my great-grandfather had built at the turn of the century, and I remember the adults talking about the past. As they talked, I began to visualize all the family who had once known ''The Land'' and I felt as if I knew them too,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachervision.fen.com/reading/multicultural-literature/31177.html?page=2&amp;detoured=1 "The Land and Other Books by Mildred Taylor"], TeacherVision. Retrieved April 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor explained.

'''''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' [[cult following]] ''' is the cultural phenomenon surrounding the large fan base of enthusiastic participants of the movie ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', generally credited as being the best-known cinematic "[[midnight movie]]", if not the first.&lt;ref&gt;Macor, Alison. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101035 "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"] ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture'' 2 Mar, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The film ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' came about due to the tremendous success of the stage musical ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' and opened in the [[United States]] at the United Artists Theater in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]], on September 26, 1975. Although the theater was selling out every night, it was noted that many of the same people were returning to see the movie. This turned out to be an exception, not the rule as it was not doing well elsewhere in the US.&lt;ref name="Henkin"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | author= Henkin, Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | isbn=978-0-8015-6436-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

The film was then re-launched as a [[midnight movie]], beginning its run at the [[Waverly Theatre]] in New York City on April 1, 1976.&lt;ref name="Henkin"/&gt;{{rp|26}} The Riverside Twin in Austin, Texas, became the second location to run the film as a midnighter. Over time, people began shouting responses to the [[fictional character|characters]]' statements on the screen. Schoolteacher Louis Farese, Jr., Theresa Krakauskas and Amy Lazarus, who attended together at the Waverly, are credited with having started the convention of talking back to the screen, bringing props and making up one-liners. The purpose of which was basically to make one another laugh. They had no idea that in doing so, they'd create something that would last decades. As Amy Lazarus once said, "we just trying to have a good time." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Midnight Movies |author1=Hoberman, J. |author2=Jonathan Rosenbaum  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Da Capo |year = 1983 | page = 176 | isbn=978-0-306-80433-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These mostly included [[pun]]s, or [[pop culture]] references.) A showing of the film at [[34th World Science Fiction Convention|the 1976]] [[World Science Fiction Convention]] spread its fame to a new cadre of enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysteryone.com/interview.php?ID=648|title=Mystery One Bookstore - Interview with Gene DeWeese|work=mysteryone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A part of audience reception can be recreating the art. This is how the fandom of ''Rocky Horror'' developed into a standardized ritual. The performances of the audience was scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters.&lt;ref name="MathijsSexton2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Mathijs|author2=Jamie Sexton|title=Cult Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&amp;pg=PA101|date=30 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rocky Horror'' helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to grind-house style.&lt;ref name="ErnestXavier2007" /&gt; Early participation with the film took place at the original Westwood location of the film's first run with fans heard singing along. Waverly Theatre fans in New York are credited with the call back lines.&lt;ref name="Henkin2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Henkin|author2=Bill Henkin|title=The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-yrnAEACAAJ|date=1 August 1979|publisher=PENGUIN Group (USA) Incorporated|isbn=978-0-452-26654-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|104}} Performance groups became a staple at ''Rocky Horror'' screenings due in large part to the prominent New York City fan cast. The cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic [[Sal Piro]] and by Dori Hartley, one of several performers in a flexible, rotating cast to portray the character of Frank N. Furter, [[File shadowing|shadowing]] the film above.&lt;ref name="Henkin2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitchcock2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Tyler Hitchcock|title=Frankenstein: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDyFqIFmfwAC&amp;pg=PA251|year=2007|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-06144-4|pages=251–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to J. Hoberman, author of ''Midnight Movies'', it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be yelled by the audience.&lt;ref name="Dika2003" /&gt; The first person to yell out an audience participation line during a screening was Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher who, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, ''"Buy an umbrella you cheap bitch"''. This self-proclaimed "counter point dialogue" was soon helped into standardization by Piro and repeated nearly verbatim at each screening.&lt;ref name="Dika2003" /&gt; By that Halloween, people were attending in costume and talking back to the screen. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres.&lt;ref name="Samuels_MidMov"&gt;[[#Samuels|Samuels (1983)]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garrett3.jpg|thumb|left|D. Garrett Gafford and Terri Hardin, Tiffany Theater Hollywood, 1978]]

The National Fan Club began in 1977 and would merge with the International Fan Club; the fan publication ''The Transylvanian'' printed a number of issues. A semi-regular poster magazine was published as well as an official magazine.&lt;ref name="ErnestXavier2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mathijs, Ernest|author2=Mendik, Xavier|title=The Cult Film Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395|date=1 December 2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|pages=395–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles area performance groups originated in 1977 at the Fox Theatre, where Michael Wolfson, portraying Frank, won a look-alike contest, as well as another at the [[Tiffany Theater]] on [[Sunset Blvd]]. Wolfson's group would perform in all of the LA area theaters screening ''Rocky Horror'', including the Balboa Theater in [[Balboa Peninsula, Newport Beach|Balboa]], The Cove at [[Hermosa Beach]] and The Sands in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], and was invited to perform at the Sombrero Playhouse in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. At the Tiffany Theatre, the audience performance cast had the theater's full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge. The Frank N. Furter for this theatre was performed by a transgender performer.&lt;ref name="Henkin2"/&gt;{{rp|104–119}} D. Garret Gafford, was out of work in 1978, trying to raise enough funds for a sex change operation while spending the weekends performing at the Tiffany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overand|first=William|title=Saturday Night Fervor at the Tiffany Theater&lt;!--|accessdate=25 March 2014--&gt;|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 19, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strand Theater Rocky Horror.jpg|thumb|San Francisco's Strand Theatre, 1979. Linda Woods, Marni Scofidio, Denise Erickson and Tim Curry]]

In [[San Francisco]] ''Rocky Horror'' would move from one location to the Strand Theatre located near the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] on [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]].&lt;ref name="Stewart2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Stewart|title=Folsom Street Blues: A Memoir of 1970s SoMa and Leatherfolk in Gay San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anV4X3D8K04C&amp;pg=PA109|year=2011|publisher=Palm Drive Publishing|isbn=978-1-890834-03-6|pages=109–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance group there would act out and perform almost the entire film, unlike the New York cast at that time. The Strand cast was put together from former members of the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] group, disbanded due to less than enthusiastic management. Their Frank N. Furter was portrayed by Marni Scofidio who, in 1979, got many of the older group from Berkeley over to San Francisco. Other members included Mishell Erickson and her twin sister Denise Erickson, who portrayed Columbia and Magenta, Kathy Dolan playing Janet and Linda Woods as Riff Raff. The Strand group had performed at two large science fiction conventions, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and were offered a spot at The [[Mabuhay Gardens|Mabuhay]], a local punk club; and even performed for children's television in Argentina.&lt;ref name="Henkin2"/&gt;{{rp|109–114}}

Annual ''Rocky Horror'' conventions are held in varying locations lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has hosted a few times including 1999 with “El Fishnet Fiesta”, and “Queens of the Desert” held in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gay|first=Gerald M.|title='Rocky Horror' shines at El Fishnet Fiesta|url=http://azstarnet.com/entertainment/movies/rocky-horror-shines-at-el-fishnet-fiesta/article_d7ea0288-3d24-5d22-8dc8-ff86b61f93ff.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|date=March 13, 2014 &lt;!-- 12:00 am --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the fans, ''Rocky Horror'' is a repeated cycle, of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend, making the practice a ritual of compulsive, re-affirmation of community that has been compared to a "religious event".&lt;ref name="Dika2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vera Dika|title=Recycled Culture in Contemporary Art and Film: The Uses of Nostalgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opah6_oJqPYC&amp;pg=PA112|date=9 June 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-01631-5|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience call backs are similar to responses in church during a mass.&lt;ref name="Dika2003"/&gt; ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' has a global following and remains popular well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Batchelor|title=Cult Pop Culture: How the Fringe Became Mainstream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAIMzLLh9nUC&amp;pg=PA52|date=December 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35780-0|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience participation==
[[File:RockyHorrorParaphernalia.JPG|thumb|Some Rocky Horror paraphernalia set out at a [[Boise, Idaho]] showing in early 2011]]

The film gained popularity because of fan participation as much as anything else.&lt;ref name="Henkin"/&gt;{{rp|36}} "Shadow Casts" of fans acting out the entire movie below, or in some cases directly in front of the screen, are almost always present at showings. At the Strand Theatre in San Francisco, fans came to see a well-organized group coordinated by Grady Broyles, performing with sets and props like a professional theatre troupe. At the [[Tiffany Theater]] on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, fans included a transsexual individual performing as Frank N. Furter, just a few blocks away from the Roxy Theatre where ''The Rocky Horror Show'' made its American debut.&lt;ref name="Henkin"/&gt;{{rp|126–127}}

[[Audience participation]] also includes dancing the [[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]] along with the film, and throwing [[toast]], [[water]], [[toilet paper]], [[hot dogs]], and [[rice]] at appropriate points in the movie. Many [[theatre]]s forbid throwing items that are difficult to clean up. In many cases, a total ban on throwing objects has been instituted due to severe damage to movie screens. Fans often attend shows in costume as the characters. At a now-defunct theater in [[New Orleans]], the local "Eddie" would ride his motorcycle down the aisle during Meat Loaf's/Eddie's song, "Hot Patootie."&lt;ref name="Henkin"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

==Call backs==
During a showing of ''Rocky Horror'', ad-lib responses, more commonly known as ''call backs'', are lines the audience may shout out in response to events occurring on screen, as a form of audience participation. In some venues, audience members who provide incorrect or poorly timed responses may find themselves angrily shouted down just as if they were being disruptive in a normal movie. However, creative new lines are usually applauded and even added to the local repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Drake |last=Lucas|title=Rocky Horror Rolls On |url=http://ledger.southofboston.com/articles/2005/10/20/life/life01.txt|publisher=The Patriot Ledger|date=2005-10-20 |accessdate= 2007-06-13}}{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been audience participation [[album]]s recorded and scripts published. However, most fans feel that it is preferable for responses to grow organically from the local culture.&lt;ref name="Henkin"/&gt;{{rp|102}}

[[The Tote]] is a [[bookmaker]] in Britain which offers [[parimutuel betting]] on British horse racing in Britain. Until July 2018 the Tote was the only bookmaker in Britain allowed to offer parimutuel betting on horse racing, although as of July 13th 2018 the existing monopoly protection the Tote ceased, and a number of other tote or parimutuel suppliers entered the British market. Other bookmakers offer a Tote service through syndication, while other bookmakers will accept a Tote bet and pay out on exactly the same terms as the Tote.

The pooled bets offered by The UK Tote are:

Win, Place, Exacta, Trifecta, Quadpot, Placepot, Jackpot, Scoop6 and Swinger.

== Terminology ==
As other bookmakers can offer similar gambling services it is necessary to disambiguate the bets. A bookmaker win-only bet (on-the-nose) isn't the same as a Tote Win bet, as the bookmaker is offering fixed odds for that particular outcome, while the Tote is a dividend paid out from the [[betting pool]]. The betting pool is generated from individuals placing money on a Tote bet.

A price quote for a horse on the Tote is the current dividend payout on the event of that outcome happening. This tends to be similar to normal bookmaker odds, and tracks the market in a similar way, but at any given time may be better or worse than a bookmaker's quoted odds. However, since all bets are pooled, all bets are essentially "starting price" (SP), that is, until the race has started (and all betting finished) one cannot calculate what the final payout will be; whereas bookmakers can offer either SP or a "board price", that is, a guaranteed payout at a given price for a winning bet. (The SP for horse races is the average price offered by bookmakers when the race starts, as inspected by employees of the [[Jockey Club]]).

It is sometimes suggested that Tote odds are generally less favourable than bookmakers' SPs. This claim is controversial, some assert they vary little from bookmakers' odds.

== Tote Win ==

The minimum stake for this bet is £2. One selects a horse from the field. This can be on any horse at any race meeting. The betting slip can be denoted with the horse's race card number, or the horses name (and if at another course, the name of the course), or it can be marked as the 'favourite', where the horse is not nominated but the bet is placed on whichever horse is favourite (has the largest amount of money put into the pool) at the start of the race. This will, obviously, have the lowest payout (since the pool will be shared with the largest number of winners) but the assumption is that if others have bet on it, it must have a good chance of winning.

== Tote Place ==

A Tote Place bet is still on one, but the horse may come second, third or even fourth for the bet to win. Not every race qualifies for this type of bet. There must be a minimum of 5 horses in the field, the minimum stake is £2 and  the following rules apply:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number of runners
! Dividend places
|-
| Up to 4 runners
| Unavailable
|-
| 5, 6 or 7 runners
| 1 - 2
|-
| 8 - 15 runners in handicaps
8+ runners in non-handicaps
| 1 - 2 - 3
|-
| 16+ runners handicaps
| 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
|}

== Each-Way ==

It is also possible to have an each-way ("e/w") bet, which is simply a combination of a Tote Win with a Tote Place bet. A £1 e/w bet is a total of £2, £1 for the Tote Win and the other £1 is for the Tote Place, and the money is split between the two separate pools (the Win pool and the Place pool).

Bookmakers other than the Tote do not generally offer a place-only bet, but only an each-way bet. This can be seen as a waste by bettors who believe their selection will finish 2nd or 3rd but will not come 1st; since half the money falls on the "win" it is wasted. A non-Tote bookmaker will offer a quarter or a fifth for the e/w component, whereas the Tote place payout, and as such the e/w payout, is as always the betting pool dividend. With the advent of the exchanges, more and more bookmakers are beginning to offer 'place only' markets in an attempt to rival the exchanges. However, there is not a set in stone way for a punter to calculate the place odds as there is with an each-way bet, and the special place only odds offered by bookmakers can vary quite a bit, both bigger and smaller, from the place odds you would receive if betting each-way. This is particularly true in "bad each-way" races, where the place odds are much less generous than if you bet each-way. The upside to this however goes back to what was said above; since the punter does not have to "waste" half their stake on the win part of the bet.

== Tote Exacta ==

The Tote Exacta operates in the same way as a normal bookmaker's straight forecast. As always the Tote price for the forecast is always based on the betting pool dividend. A forecast is to predict the correct order of the horses finishing first and second. The minimum bet is £2 and the multiples of 10 pence over this, multiples can also be used to reach the initial minimum of £2. If the bet contains a non-runner the bet becomes void and unnamed favourites are not allowed.

There are three Exacta bets:

Single Exacta (straight forecast). Pick in the correct order the horses which will finish first and second.

Combination Exacta (reverse forecast). Pick in either order the horses which will finish first and second. This bet is actually two bets in one, it is exactly equivalent to two straight forecasts, the first of which you select horse A to beat horse B, and then the second is for horse B to beat horse A. It's possible to specify more than two horses, at which point the bet becomes more complex, for example with three horses the individual bets are now a-b, a-c, b-a, b-c, c-a, c-b.

Banker Exacta (banker forecast). Pick a horse which you think is going to finish first, and then any number of horses to finish second. For instances, with a banker horse a, and with three additional horses, the bets are a-b, a-c, a-d.

Bookmakers that are not Tote-syndicated will offer their own forecast prices based on their own odds that they are quoting. However bookmakers will normally allow you to place a 'Tote forecast' and will pay out  whatever the Tote dividend payout was.

== Tote Trifecta ==

Also known as a Trifecta: pick the first three horses in the right order. This is generally really difficult to do and the dividend for getting it right is correspondingly better. The Tote can nominate races containing more than 8 runners as Trifecta races. There are three types of Trifecta, the Single, Combination and Banker and they work the same way as Exacta bets, only with three horses instead of two. The minimum stake is £2.

== Tote Quadpot ==

A Quadpot is operated on one race at every meeting in the UK and it takes place on the third to sixth races on the card. The aim is to pick a horse that will be placed in each one of these races, according to the placing rules stated in the Tote Place section above. The minimum bet is 10p. The dividend is declared after the result of the last race is known and thus the betting pool divided by the remaining stakes which are left. One may select the favourite instead of naming a specific horse.

== Tote Placepot ==

The Placepot is identical to the Quadpot except it operates over the first six races of a race card. All UK race meetings have six races as a minimum, occasionally seven and rarely eight, but the Placepot is always operated on the first six. This bet is very popular as it has the potential to allow a gambler involvement in the whole of the race card. The minimum bet is 5p.
Here is a worked example:

The first race the gambler has opted to choose two horses. Maybe the gambler isn't confident of his abilities or maybe it is a large field and the gambler feels unable to just place one horse. On race two the gambler has elected to roll with the favourite, whatever it may be. In the final race the gambler has chosen three selections. This is often driven by the motive that if the gambler reaches the last race and still has a bet on, he doesn't want to lose out in the last race by only having one selection. The number of combinations in this bet is therefore 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 × 1 × 3 = 12. The gambler has decided to risk 20p per bet, so the total cost of this bet is £2.40.

If after the first race the gambler has failed to pick a selection which was placed then the bet is over. If a selection is placed, then the bet continues, and the winnings are transferred as the stake on the second race. In this example, horse 2 may be placed and horse 7 unplaced, which means the bet continues – but there are now only 6 valid combinations for winning left.

If the gambler is lucky and managed to get through to the end, then the Tote will calculate the dividend for a £1 unit stake. In this example the Tote is going to declare the dividend as £30, and the lucky gambler has 2 winning combinations. Two combinations at a stake level of 20p is 40p, so 40% of £30 is £12, a profit of £9.60.

If a favourite is placed in every single race the Placepot payout is typically as low as it can get, and it could be anywhere from £3 to £15, although anything less than £6–£7 is quite unusual. If favourites fail to finish in the places for half of the races then something around the £40–£200 could be anticipated, placepots of over £25,000 have been known but they are extremely uncommon. However, there isn't a science to guessing what the placepot might be, the placepot dividend is the calculation of the number of tickets left divided by the pool money.

There are a couple of additional rules which affect the operation of the Placepot (and indeed the Quadpot/Jackpot/Scoop6). If a selection becomes a non-runner it will be replaced by the Starting Price favourite. Where there are joint favourites and the gambler has selected to roll on the Favourite, then the horse with the lowest race card number will be taken. If the favourite withdraws (for instance, the horse refuses to enter its starting gate) and the market has no time to select a new favourite the horse with the next shortest odds will become the favourite. It's rare for a race card to progress without a couple of non-runners so a gambler will be affected by these rules from time to time.

== Tote Jackpot ==

The Tote Jackpot is a bet where you have to pick the first 6 winners at a meeting nominated by The Tote. The bet is available every day of the week. The minimum stake is £1 and multiples are in multiples of 50p. Typically the payouts are very good for the Jackpot as it is very difficult to pick six winners in a row. The betting pool will roll into the next Jackpot event if there is no dividend to pay.

== Tote Scoop6 ==

Similar to the Tote Jackpot, Tote Scoop6 is run on Saturdays and occasionally on other days such as Boxing Day, and has been branded this way for television audiences, generally Scoop6 races are shown on [[terrestrial television]] in the UK. The stake for one line is £2, as opposed to a minimum 50p in the case of the Jackpot. As the pool will roll-over in the event of there being no dividends to pay the pool can become very large and wins in excess of £500,000 have been known. There is also a bonus fund whereby the winner of a Scoop6 event can attempt to pick the winner of the most difficult race in next week's Scoop6. This bet is also a Placepot bet, as the Tote also payout a dividend for selecting a horse to be placed in each race. According to the Tote, the average dividend is over £500 for a winning place line.

There is a major operational difference to this bet as compared to the Jackpot/Placepot/Quadpot: the six races on the Scoop6 card are nominated by the Tote from any of the race meetings on that day, typically the Scoop6 card will have a number of very difficult races such as handicap races with over 20 horses running, and races with 2- or 3-year-olds where many horses have no track record, making it difficult to select a winner. It  is also the reason why the placepot payouts are correspondingly higher than a normal placepot as well. The televised coverage usually announces how many Scoop6 tickets are left after each Scoop6 race, and it is quite common to be left with only three or four tickets after the first four races.

As with other Tote bets, non-syndicated bookmakers will normally accept a Tote bet and pay out in line with the Tote dividend.

== Toteswinger ==

This is a single-race exotic bet available on all races of six or more runners at every meeting, every day, players have to pick two horses to finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd in any order.

Each bet offers three chances to win as follows:
* Picking the horses that finish first and second in any order
* Picking the horses that finish first and third in any order
* Picking the horses that finish second and third in any order

A different dividend is declared for each outcome.

The minimum unit stake for a toteswinger bet is 10p (shops and online). Minimum unit stake on-course is 50p with minimum total spend £2 as per all totepool on-course bets. Toteswinger is unique to the tote; there is no other equivalent fixed odds or SP bet.

This is an extremely popular bet in overseas racing markets, particularly South Africa where it accounts for 40% of pool turnover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20613">The '''Turnip Prize''' is a spoof UK award satirising the [[Tate Gallery]]'s [[Turner Prize]] by rewarding deliberately bad modern art. It was started as a joke in 1999, but gained national media attention and inspired similar prizes. Credit is given for entries containing bad puns as titles, displaying "lack of effort" or "is it shit?". Conversely, entries with "too much effort" or "not shit enough" are immediately disqualified. The first prize is a [[turnip]] nailed to a block of wood.

==History==
The prize (now awarded in the New Inn) was conceived in 1999 by management and regulars of The George Hotel, [[Wedmore]], [[Somerset]], after the exhibition of [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''[[My Bed]]'' was shortlisted for the [[Turner Prize]]. It is organised by Trevor Prideaux and was announced thus: "The Turnip Prize is a crap art competition ... You can enter anything you like, but it must be rubbish." The competition is based on the supposition, "We know it's rubbish, but is it art?". Competitors submitted entries of ridiculous objects posing as contemporary art, mostly made from junk titled with spoofs or puns. The prize is a turnip impaled on a rusty six-inch nail.

In May 2000, the nominees appeared on the [[BBC]] TV ''[[Esther (TV series)|Esther]]'' show, presented by [[Esther Rantzen]] and featured by national and international media.

In 2001, the competition was held in the public conveniences in Wedmore.

In 2002, the "Monster Raving Loony Party" attempted to hijack the competition at The Trotter, Crickham, Wedmore.

In 2003, the winner was James Timms with ''Take a Leaf out of My Chook'', an exhibit of a raw chicken stuffed with leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/3253406.stm |title=Chicken sculpture scoops 'Turnip Prize |publisher=BBC News |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ananova |url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-12-2003_pg9_2 |title=Unicyclist wins Turnip Prize for rubbish art |newspaper=Daily Times (Pakistan) |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=9 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182833/http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-12-2003_pg9_2 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Timms subsequently appeared on BBC Radio Scotland's ''[[Fred MacAulay]] Show'' with [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 2005, Ian Osenthroat, a 69-year-old former photocopier salesman, won with the exhibit ''Birds Flew'', a bird's nest with a flu remedy box. He commented satirically, "I have entered this most coveted art award on several occasions and I really feel that the lack of effort this year has really paid off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4502954.stm |title=Bird's nest awarded Turnip Prize |publisher=BBC News |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winner in 2006 was Ian Lewis with the exhibit ''Torn Beef'', an empty [[corned beef]] can. He stated, "The work took no time at all to create." Trevor Prideaux commented, "I believe that over the last seven years the bad artists of Wedmore and surrounding areas have created far better works than [[Nicholas Serota]] and The [[Tate Britain]] Gallery could ever wish to exhibit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/content/twm/news/story.aspx?brand=Westonmercury&amp;category=news&amp;tBrand=westonmercury&amp;tCategory=znews&amp;itemid=WeED11%20Dec%202006%2010%3A54%3A04%3A960 |title=And this year's prize turnip is ...

In 2007, the competition gained more publicity with the entry of artwork with the title ''By the Banksea''. The painting bears a striking resemblance to work by the famous Bristol graffiti artist [[Banksy]], and its origins are likewise a closely guarded secret. ''By the Banksea'' portrays a seaside [[Aunt Sally]] in the form of a stencil of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', but in true Banksy style, Mona Lisa is depicted holding a rocket launcher firing a turnip over the wreckage of a seaside pier and an emergency exit sign. Competition organiser Trevor Prideaux commented: "It does seem to be in Banksy's style. But someone has thought too much about this one and tried too hard. So for that reason it's not likely to win." The piece was duly disqualified for "too much effort, and not shit enough." The 2007 competition was won by Bracey Vermin with ''Tea P'', a group of used tea bags in the shape of a letter P.

Competition entries for 2010 included "Ivor Crush"{{'}}s clothes hanger linking the letter U in "Crush", entitled ''Hung up on You'', and an entry by Banksy, which focused on the recent student protests of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-11847516 |title=Turnip Prize entries compete for top bad art accolade |publisher=BBC News Somerset |date=26 November 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entries for 2011 included a piece of cheese carved into the letter E, entitled ''CheeseE'', ''A fish full of dollars'', and an exhibit of an Action Man toy – called ''First Class Mail'' – with a carefully placed stamp, and a coloured rock called ''Half a Stone Lighter''. This year's prize featured on the BBC's ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' for two weeks running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-15902670 |title=Turnip Prize bad art contest finalists are revealed |publisher=BBC News Somerset |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other competitions==

Many independent "Turnip Prize" competitions are now held around the world, with differing rules made up by those who are running the competitions. Competitions generally aspire to concept, "We know it's rubbish, but is it art?" and competitors submit entries made from junk with titles that are nonsensical or puns. Marks are awarded for amusement and lack of effort, and  competitors are frequently disqualified for applying too much effort. In  2001,  ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid newspaper featured its own Turnip Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spanton |first=Tim |date=2001 |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2001390088_1,00.html |title=It's the Turnip Prize |newspaper=The Sun |accessdate=8 January 2007}}{{dead link |date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 "The Turnip Award" was opened annually for students at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] to "carve or design something out of the humble vegetable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuco.org/news.asp?month=11&amp;year=2004 |title=Edinburgh College of Art Turnip Prize |archivedate= 29 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929002900/http://www.tuco.org/news.asp?month=11&amp;year=2004 |date=November 2004|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 prize was a mountain bike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?|title=Artists turnip in their droves |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=28 October 2005 |archivedate=28 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604230030/http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Artists-turnip-in-their-droves.2673358.jp |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 a Turnip Prize was staged at St Paul's Gallery in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], London, for local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/templates/news/detail.cfm?newsid=6242 |title=Turnip heads the art world |work=East End Life |date=15 August 2006 |archivedate=21 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821181553/https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/templates/news/detail.cfm?newsid=6242 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was previously used in 1998 by [[YBA]] Jake Chapman of the [[Chapman Brothers]] (2003 Turner Prize nominees): "We thought if we couldn't get the Turner Prize we should get the Turnip Prize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barker |first=Godfrey  |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_19980708/ai_n11871702 |title=Back to school, and no virgins |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=8 July 1998 |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK B-Boy Championships''' is a [[hip-hop dance]] competition held annually in the United Kingdom. UK B-Boy Championships, alongside [[Battle of the Year]] and [[R-16 Korea]], is regarded to be one of the main [[International B-Boy Championships]] held every year. There are national qualifiers worldwide where dancers compete for the opportunity to represent their country at the international final held in London. The event features solo breakers, poppers, hip-hop dancers and [[b-boy]] crews from across the globe. It also host DJs and graffiti artists from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bboychampionships.com/history] Retrieved 8 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Championships brings together dancers from around the globe—including the US, Japan, Korea, Russia, China, Holland and Scandinavia—who've won the preliminary tournaments. After a five-month search, staging eight international eliminations, the winners all converge at the Brixton Academy every year to take part in the international final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bboychampionships.com/world-series-2/about B-Boy Championships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821020535/http://bboychampionships.com/world-series-2/about |date=21 August 2013 }} Retrieved 18 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, UK B-boy Championships partnered up with the [[World BBoy Series]] and helped create [[International B-Boy Championships#Undisputed|Undisputed]], an event to crown the solo world bboy champion. In 2015, UK B-boy Championships was not held.

'''William Saurin Lyster''' (21 March 1828 – 27 November 1880) was an [[impresario]], active in Australia.

== Early life ==
Lyster was born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], the third son of Chaworth Lyster, a captain in the army, and his wife Anne, ''née'' Keightly. His uncle was [[William Saurin]], [[Attorney-General for Ireland]].  The  Saurin family  was partly of French [[Hugenot]]   extraction. Another of his uncles was  [[James Saurin]], [[Bishop of Dromore]]. At the age of 13, Lyster, after an illness, was sent on a voyage round the world and visited [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] in 1842. After his return to England he went to India, intending to become a planter, but, the climate not suiting him, he again returned to England. In 1847 he was in South Africa and fought in the [[Xhosa Wars|7th Cape Frontier War]], and a year later was in the United States where he tried his fortunes as an actor with little success.

== Impresario career ==
In 1855 Lyster was a member of [[William Walker (filibuster)|General Walker]]'s expedition to [[Nicaragua]] with the rank of captain. About two years later he formed an [[opera]] company which included Madame Lucy Escott, Henry Squires, and Miss Georgia Hodson whom he married. This company had some success in the western states of America, and in 1861 Lyster brought it to Australia. For about seven years it gave performances of the operas of Italian, German, French and English composers, including ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' in 1861, and the ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' in 1862. Other companies were brought out in later years, and at times [[comic opera]] was alternated with [[grand opera]]. His opera company gave 1,459 performances between 1861 and 1869.

Classic operas like ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', opened 18 August 1877, and ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' in 1878, were box office failures, although the company had included a distinguished singer, Antoinetta Link. Lyster, however, made the lighter operas bear the cost of others which were artistic successes only. Among other singers brought out by Lyster were Signor Pietro Paladini and Madame {{Interlanguage link multi|Fanny Simonsen|de}}, grandmother of [[Frances Alda]]. The Australian tenor, [[Armes Beaumont]] joined his company in 1870. Among concert artists introduced to Australia were pianists [[Arabella Goddard]] and Henry Ketten, and [[Jules Levy (musician)|Jules Levy]], a well-known English [[cornet]] player of the period. Lyster's companies toured the principal cities of Australia and New Zealand, but for the last seven years of his life he made the [[Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne]] his headquarters. Though most renowned for his productions of operas, he was interested also in the drama, and seasons were played at the opera house by the distinguished actress [[Adelaide Ristori|Madame Ristori]], and by good comedy companies.

== Death ==
Lyster fell into bad health about 1877 and never fully recovered. He died in Melbourne on 27 November 1880 and was survived by his wife, there were no children. Lyster was buried in the [[Anglican]] section of the [[Melbourne General Cemetery]].

The '''Yaogu''' is a traditional instrument in China. it is known as the symbolic of Chinese musical drums. It has unique performing forms as well as traditional customs, and it contributes to Chinese culture since it was created.

== Basic Introduction of the Yaogu ==

The Yaogu is a traditional instrument in China. In Chinese, the word “yao” means the waist of a human and “gu” refers to the drum. Different from other [[percussion instrument]]s, especially other [[drum]]s, the Yaogu is not only played using hands and arms, but is played using the whole body, driven by specific dance movements. Just as its name implies, the Yaogu is a type of Chinese musical drum, which is played on people’s waists, using hands or by holding two wood-made sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The silk road encyclopedia|last=Su-Il,|first=Jeong|date=2016|publisher=Seoul Selection|isbn=978-1624120763|edition=  English|location=Irvine, CA|oclc=955004028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yaogu is tied by a piece of long red silk ribbon which wraps around one side of the shoulders and waist. It is in the shape of a short cylinder and it looks like a hourglass, and the ends of the two sides are slightly smaller than the middle section. In general, the drum is approximately 34&amp;nbsp;cm in length.

== History of the Yaogu ==

According to relevant data records, in ancient times, in the Yellow River valley, the male in every tribe used the sheepskins to wrap around the trunk of a tree and carried around the waist, in order to threaten the beasts and drive them away from the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Xi bu zhi lian.|date=2008|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/771858552|others=Yang, Shulin., Lu, Yuan.|publisher=Guangzhou Shi xin shi dai|isbn=9787885256180|oclc=771858552|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first percussion instrument originated four thousand years ago in China. It was in Shang Dynasty, which was defined by a neolithic time. During this period, percussion instruments including drums were widely used in celebration of Dynasty and the conflicts between vibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/671710042|title=Chinese music|last=scholar)|first=Jin, Jie (Music|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Wang, Li., Li, Rong.|isbn=9780521186919|edition=  Updated |location=Cambridge|oclc=671710042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drums are the symbol of spirit and power, represent the universe, which are the materials to show authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895731298|title=Asian American religious cultures|others=Lee, Jonathan H. X.,, Matsuoka, Fumitaka,, Yee, Edmond, 1938-, Nakasone, Ronald Y.,|isbn=9781598843309|location=Santa Barbara|oclc=895731298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known waist drum around world is the culture of the Ansai Yaogu in northern Shanxi province, northwest China. Ansai is known as "the hometown of drums". The historical reason for the origin of the name of "Ansai' in Chinese is its meaning of the ambition to settle the frontier and remain stable and safe. Therefore, the  Ansai Yaogu is an auspicious sign to Shanxi citizens.

Dating back to [[Qing dynasty|'''Qing''']] and [[Han dynasty|'''Han''']] Dynasties, the Yaogu was a significant tool to send signals for frontier guards, in order to inform their leaders that the foreign enemies were approaching towards the edge of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sports Engineering and Computer Science : proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Sport Science and Computer Science (SSCS 2014), Singapore, 16-17 September 2014 &amp; the 2014 International Conference on Biomechanics and Sports Engineering (BSE 2014), Riga, Latvia, 24-25 October, 2014|others=Luo, Qi,, International Conference on Sport Science and Computer Science (2014 : Singapore), International Conference on Biomechanics and Sports Engineering (2014 : Riga, Latvia)|isbn=9781315755717|location=Boca Raton, FL|oclc=910237206|last1 = Luo|first1 = Qi|date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the leaders heard the sound of the Yaogu from the frontier, it was the time to prepare weapons for the coming battle. Moreover, once the war began and two armies fought against each other, the Yaogu played the role of encouraging soldiers to keep up high morale. Besides the warning and encouraging roles, the Yaogu was also played to celebrate the victory when soldiers won the war. With the passage of time, the Yaogu became a type of instrument with the folk customs and popularity among plain citizens. People played the Yaogu if there was a great harvest of crops and festival celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dZpDAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Harvest+and+waist+drums+in+china&amp;dq=Harvest+and+waist+drums+in+china&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ_JH90K3eAhVGyLwKHduMCWAQ6AEILzAB|title=Survey of China Mainland Press|date=September 1971|publisher=American Consulate General|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the sound of the Yaogu brings luck to local areas when they were praying.
[[File:Binus Operet 24-10-2009 Yangge.JPG|thumb|287x287px|Yangko (Yangge): Traditional Chinese dance performance]]
At the beginning of 20 century, the yaogu was combined with dance when the peasants were working in the fields. For the original motivation, in order to recover from fatigue as well as boredom, peasants in northwest of China developed a dance named "Yangko" from the fieldwork. Yangko, named '''[[Yangge]]''' as well, is a popular rural folk dance today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mao's cultural army : drama troupes in China's rural revolution|last=James,|first=DeMare, Brian|isbn=9781107076327|location=Cambridge|oclc=897510462|date = 2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the peasants noticed that they were just simply dancing without sounds, thus, they played the Yaogu together with Yangko. This mode of dancing and the combination of the Yaogu was made for entertaining the peasants and praying for the harvest of crops.

== Contemporary Development of the  Yaogu ==

* The Yaogu and its dance become increasingly popular within northwest China. The Ansai Yaogu has won a large amount of national and international prizes from 1986. It contributed to the performances on the opening ceremony of the 11th Asian Sports Games, Hongkong handover celebration, 2009 National Day ceremony and other large-scale activities. In the meantime, the Yaogu performs worldwide and goes global. It successively performed in other countries such as Japan and Germany.
* As the consequence of the social significance of the Yaogu in local areas, some children who have passion on the Yaogu learned the way of performing it in their young ages. Nowadays, it is said by Jijiang Feng, the deputy mayor of Yan'an City that there are more than 40,000 out of 160,000 citizens are able to play the Yaogu in the town of Ansai. The Yaogu education has been considered to be compulsory in many Shanxi families.
* Furthermore, as working pressure rises, the Yaogu has become a bodybuilding exercise in part of China. They have to sit in front of their computer and stay in the office for a whole day. As a result, a large number of office workers have the problem of a backache. Therefore,  the bodybuilding exercise is designed easily for the office worker for them to release the stress as well as to alleviate the symptoms.

== Traditional Customs of the Yaogu ==
The Yaogu is widely used in Chinese traditional sacrificial ceremony. Especially peasants pray to the gods for protection and rains. Once it is approaching to Autumn, the local percussion team usually start to prepare for the event of blessing a good harvest. Two head leaders guide the whole team towards the blessing destination, dancing with the dance movements and the roll of drums. Identically, when the new year begins, the Yaogu teams contribute their performance to pray for world peace and prosperity. In local traditions in, the family hosts in Shanxi believe that the drumbeats given out by the team emblems the elimination of disasters and unfortunates. If two Yaogu team meets on the road, the thing happens more often is that two teams will intend to start a battle. The battle is made up of singing in antiphonal style part and playing drumbeats in improvisation. The way to determine a win or a loss of this battle is to look at who is the first one to stop singing or whose drum team is in disarray. The team which lose the battle will show their respect and leave the road for the winner. The existence of battle aims to raise the culmination of their performing atmosphere by competing skills, which reflects the sprits of competition for Shanxi people.

== Yaogu Dance Movements==
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043052885|title=Revolutionary bodies : Chinese dance and the socialist legacy|last=1981-|first=Wilcox, Emily,|isbn=9780520971905|location=Oakland, California|oclc=1043052885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Yaogu performers are usually required to be full of energy when then are dancing. They move their bodies naturally with the beats of drums and musical rhythm to express passions. Performers shook their heads slightly and waved their shoulders strongly in order to combine Yaogu dancing movements with personal emotions, under the rendering of music. They need to make appropriate expressions and body movements with the drum beats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visiontimes.com/2016/07/01/the-joy-of-the-chinese-waist-drum-dance.html|title=The Joy of the Chinese Waist Drum Dance - Vision Times|website=www.visiontimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As for the power and sound of the drums, performers are taught to hit the drumheads on two sides and the middle part of the Yaogu with great force when appropriate as they made different sounds. The sound of drum head is strong and deep, which expresses strength and power; on the contrary, the sound of drumbody is clear and crisp, which expresses soft and delicacy. Therefore, the Yaogu dance requires performers to be capable of rigorous control of the force, so as to achieve the combination of music, dance and human.
* For body movements, dancers move according to the rhythm of drumbeats and other instrument. Dancers jump, kick, twist, squat down and stand up. The requirement for dancers is that all the turns in Yaogu dance have to be strong, in order to connect with next movement compactly without stop and hesitation.
* The most famous movement of the Yaogu performance is called "drumming turn". As its name implies, performers need to complete the drumming and dance performance at the same time. Drums are on waists tightly, next, dancers jump as high as they can to make turns in the air.
* 
* The movements of the waist drum are tight and strong, so the performers need to arm with sufficient physical strength and energy to complete the drumming and dancing in the meantime.

== Performing Forms ==
There are two main types of performing strategies of the Yaogu: one is "Wengu", which means that the performers twist theirselves heavily and hit lightly; on the contrary, another one is "Wugu", performers hit heavily and twist lightly. "Wengu" trends to show the vivacity of the Yaogu and it is similar to "'''Yangko'''". Inversely, "Wugu" focus on power and the integration with Chinese acrobatic fighting movements, which preaches passion. The Yaogu has organically formed a mixture of waist drum, dance, percussion music, folk song and Wushu (martial arts in China, such as shadow-boxing, swordplay etc.). The combination of Chinese traditional features impels the influence of the Yaogu to spread it culture worldwide.

In adddition, the Yaogu has two performing forms including "Lugu (road drum)" and "Changdigu (court drum)". "Lugu" is a form that a long team of players walk and  do the hitting in the street. The team has two head leaders in the front to navigate the passing road, following a major director who controls the rhythm and speed of the whole group and make sure the quality of this show. Performers ususally have their own characters to set the personal dance movement and the Yaogu actions. For "Court Drum", it refers to a form that performance begins in a specific place. To begin with, two head leaders give out "starting" commands when they are ready. Dancers move with the Yaogu, and the movements are aiming to warm up the court in order to attract audience's attention. Moving to the second part, folk music and percussion actions are to connect while others dancing and singing beside the group. This part is large-scale for that performers are doing more complex steps than that in first part before. Once the sound of the Yaogu and music stops, participants will call out words of blessing for health, family and crops. After that, the Yaogu activity moves to the final part, which is the most challenging section for the performers. They have to do as many as they can to show the charm of waist drum and their individual talent. It is the most difficult but would reaches the climax of the whole show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.godpp.gov.cn/wmzh/2007-07/11/content_10545381.htm|title=安塞腰鼓|website=big5.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Yaogu can also play a leading part in a performance by standing in front of an orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chime : newsletter of the European Foundation for Chinese Music Research|last=|first=|publisher=European Foundation for Chinese Music Research|year=1990|location=Shanghai|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waist drums in Ansai.jpg|thumb|Waist drums in Ansai, Shanxi, China|304x304px]]

As its performance indicates, the Yaogu has a strong artistic shock with its unique style, moving charm, colourful movements and strong image. It is said that the Yaogu makes people feel passionate and looks refreshed. The artistic image of "beauty" and "power" reflected by it fully reproduces the spirit of the times and the image of the nation, and is an indispensable part of the culture of the Yellow River Basin.

Generally, the Yaogu not only can be performed by less than ten people, but also sometimes played by a large number of hundreds of people. Waist drum pays attention to collective, grand and magnificent momentum. Individuals in the Yaogu team has their own characters during the performance.

== Cultural value and significance of the Yaogu ==
The Yaogu opened a channel for traditional Chinese percussion instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/955004028|title=The silk road encyclopedia|last=Su-Il,|first=Jeong|date=2016|publisher=Seoul Selection|isbn=1624120768|edition=  English |location=Irvine, CA|oclc=955004028}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time ago, the Yaogu has been integrated into Shaanxi local culture and Chinese national culture and it has become the benchmark and symbol in the history of Chinese music culture.

From the personal and local aspects, the Yaogu illustrates the simple and unconstrained character of the farmers in the northwest loess plateau and the unique artistic personality.
