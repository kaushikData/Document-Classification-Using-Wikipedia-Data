'''Ben Wizner''' (born 1971) is an American lawyer, writer, and [[civil liberty|civil liberties]] advocate with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref name="Lawfare"/&gt; Since July 2013, he has been the lead attorney of [[National Security Agency|NSA]] [[whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

==Education and personal life==
Wizner was born in 1971 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and grew up on the campus of [[Yale University]], where his father, [[Stephen Wizner]], is a professor of law at [[Yale Law School]] and his mother is a dean.&lt;ref name=tagesspiegel/&gt; He has described being drawn to [[social justice]] work from at least as early as high school; after graduating [[Harvard College]] in 1993, he worked for an organization that provided legal assistance to [[homeless]] and near-homeless people.&lt;ref name="Schneiderman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; At [[New York University School of Law]], he planned to work in legal services for impoverished communities, and on [[capital punishment]] cases.&lt;ref name="Schneiderman"/&gt; After graduating, he [[court clerk|clerked]] for judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref name="Lawfare"/&gt;

==Career==
Wizner began working for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] in Los Angeles in August 2001, initially focusing on [[prison reform]].&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneiderman"/&gt; Following the [[September 11 attacks]], Wizner's focus shifted to civil liberties issues relating to U.S. [[national security]].&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt; Around 2004, he moved to the ACLU's headquarters in New York City.&lt;ref name="Schneiderman"/&gt; There, he argued legal cases relating to [[airport security]], government [[Terrorist Screening Database|watchlist]]s, [[surveillance]] practices, [[targeted killing]], [[extraordinary rendition]], and [[torture]].&lt;ref name="Lawfare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt; He made several trips to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].&lt;ref name="Schneiderman"/&gt; Many of the cases Wizner took were dismissed; he later commented that "on the worst days, I believed that what we were doing ... wasn't litigation in the traditional sense. It wasn't trying to get a court to do something, it was creating a record so that ... people would be able to look back and decide whether it had been the right decision or a disastrous decision."&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;

Starting in 2005, Wizner represented [[Khalid El-Masri]], a German citizen arrested while travelling in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] on suspicion of links to [[Al Qaeda]], who was held by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] at a [[black site]] in Afghanistan for five months, despite evidence that he was the wrong person. El-Masri's suit was dismissed in the U.S. on grounds of state secrecy, though the CIA ultimately admitted to making a mistake, in a report released by the U.S. Senate. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled against Macedonia in the case.&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;

In 2011, Wizner became director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.&lt;ref name="Lawfare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;

Wizner is an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law.&lt;ref name="ACLU"/&gt; He is a contributor to the website ''[[Lawfare (blog)|Lawfare]]'', has written for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]], and several other media outlets, and has testified before the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="Lawfare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wizner-Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACLU"/&gt; He has regularly appeared on television news and analysis programs, including ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'', and ''[[Politicking with Larry King]]''.

===Work with Snowden===
In 2013, Edward Snowden contacted journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] and filmmaker [[Laura Poitras]], longtime acquaintances of Wizner, about releasing classified information on NSA programs.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; Poitras consulted with Wizner before travelling to meet Snowden in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Greenwald later put Wizner into contact with Snowden in July 2013, when Snowden was stranded in the [[transit zone]] in Moscow, his passport having been revoked by the U.S. Government.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Wizner and Snowden exchanged encrypted communications during this time.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

Snowden's legal team also includes [[Jesselyn Radack]], an advocate for whistleblowers; [[Wolfgang Kaleck]], a European attorney; and attorneys with expertise in criminal and [[right of asylum|asylum]] law.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; The team works ''[[pro bono]]''&lt;ref name=Paley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Patheos/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorker22Feb2015/&gt; to ensure Snowden's continued freedom and ability to contribute to the public conversation he began with his disclosures.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Wizner describes being a "gatekeeper" of media requests for Snowden.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; He has said that be believes Snowden will return to the U.S. eventually.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

Wizner has called the Snowden case "the work of a lifetime" and "not traditional legal work, by any means".&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt; He had previously spent a decade trying to bring cases against U.S. intelligence agencies, with these cases often dismissed for lack of [[standing (law)|standing]].&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; With Snowden's revelations about [[Verizon]] delivering [[metadata]] to the U.S. government, the ACLU had standing to sue.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

==Public comments==
Wizner has defended a right to privacy, and has been critical of the use of extensive surveillance to enforce law. He has highlighted the role of lawbreaking in positive social change, pointing to the [[LGBT]] civil rights movement and [[drug prohibition]] as areas where illegal activities have contributed to positive changes in the law and public opinion.&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt; In speaking on the U.S. intelligence apparatus, he has said that "the NSA is not uniquely evil, it's uniquely capable."&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;

Wizner has forcefully defended Snowden against calls for his punishment, stating that he broke the law for the public good, and noting that no elected officials have been held criminally liable for torture and other human rights violations since 9/11.&lt;ref name="Agarwal"/&gt;

The '''Bergamo Lions''' is an [[American football]] team from [[Bergamo]], [[Italy]]. They won the [[Eurobowl]] in 2000, 2001 and 2002, while losing to the [[Vikings Vienna|Chrysler Vikings]] in the finals of 2004 and 2005. In Italy they have been unbeaten since 1998. In 1995, the Lions were a part of the [[Football League of Europe]].

They have paid for [[Canadian football]] and [[American football]] players to play for the team but most Italian-born players are unpaid. One example is former [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Toronto Argonauts]] [[wide receiver]] [[Jeris McIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/feature-football-agros.html|title=Playing for Pizza: How two Canadian brothers lived out their dreams of playing pro football in Italy|last=Molinaro|first=John F|date=2008-05-05|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lions have also recruited American coaches, including former NFL offensive lineman [[Brian Baldinger]] as their offensive line coach.&lt;ref&gt;

The municipal '''coat of arms of [[Hammerfest]]''' was approved by Royal Resolution in 1938 and adopted on 25 March 1939. It was created by the local teacher Ole Valle.

Hammerfest received town status in 1789 but a coat of arms was not made at that time. In 1936 the issue was addressed to the municipal council by local historian Jørgen Sivertsen and work towards creating one was initiated. Several designs were considered but the decision fell on a polar bear on red. The [[polar bear]] is not indigenous to mainland [[Norway]], but symbolises the town's status as an important port in the polar region of the [[Norwegian Sea]].

The design has been revised several times, most recently in 2001 by the artist Arvid Sveen.

'''Cyprus–Sweden relations''' are foreign relations between [[Cyprus]] and [[Sweden]].  The two countries share membership of the [[European Union]], [[Council of Europe]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]] and the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].
Cyprus is represented to Sweden through its embassy in [[Stockholm]].  Sweden has an embassy in [[Nicosia]] ([[Cyprus]]).

==History==
Diplomatic relations between Sweden and Cyprus were established in 1960, when Cyprus became an independent state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/embassies/embassy_stockholm.nsf/ecsw27_en/ecsw27_en?OpenDocument|title=EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS IN STOCKHOLM - Embassy|website=www.mfa.gov.cy|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Cyprus opened an embassy in Stockholm,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while Sweden opened an embassy in Nicosia in 2004.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/embassies/embassy_stockholm.nsf/ecsw23_en/ecsw23_en?OpenDocument|title=EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS IN STOCKHOLM - Bilateral Agreements|website=www.mfa.gov.cy|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighth bilateral agreements have been concluded between Cyprus and Sweden.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Swedish archaeologists in Cyprus==
{{Main|Swedish Cyprus Expedition}}

Swedish archeologists and historians visit the island systematically. The most significant project was called [[Swedish Cyprus Expedition]] that took place between September 1927 and March 1931 and was led by three archaeologists: Einar Gjerstad, Erik Sjöqvist and Alfred Westholm together with architect John Lindros.

The '''Estación Científica Antártica Ruperto Elichiribehety''' (English: '''Ruperto Elichiribehety Antarctic Scientific Station'''; better known in English by its Spanish [[acronym]] '''ECARE''') is an [[Uruguay]] summer [[Research stations in Antarctica|research station]] in [[Antarctica]], established by the [[Uruguayan Antarctic Institute]] on December 22, 1997 on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

ECARE is located in [[Hut Cove]], southeast of [[Hope Bay]] in the northeastern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, next to the [[Instituto Antártico Argentino|Argentinian]] [[Esperanza Base]].
The Station can accommodate seven people, and it is dedicated to support scientific projects in the surrounding area. It was formerly the British [[Hope Bay#Station D|Station D]], known as Trinity House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/about-bas/our-history/british-research-stations-and-refuges/hope-bay-d/|title=Hope Bay Station D|website=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station is named in honour of Ruperto Elichiribehety, a [[National Navy of Uruguay|Uruguayan Navy]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] who, in 1916, led the Uruguayan Expedition attempting to rescue the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]]{{fact|date=November 2012}} that was lost on [[Elephant Island]].

The '''''Government Gazette''''' was the [[government gazette]] for the British colony of [[Lagos Colony|Lagos]]. It was published between 1887 and April 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crl.edu/collections/topics/official-gazettes/search?countryID=LAGOS+%28BRITISH+COLONY+AND+PROTECTORATE%29&amp;instID=&amp;pc=1 LAGOS (BRITISH COLONY AND PROTECTORATE)] CRL Foreign Official Gazette Database, 2014.

It was continued by the ''[[Government Gazette of the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]]'' after Lagos was incorporated into the already existing [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] in February 1906.

'''Intelsat IV F-4''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-312]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IV F-4 was part of the Intelsat IV series which consisted of eight communications satellites, launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] during the early 1970s, marked the fifth generation of geostationary communications satellites developed by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] since 1963 with the launch of Syncom II, the world's first synchronous satellite. The [[Syncom]] II was 15&amp;nbsp;cm high and 28 inches in diameter, weighing 78 pounds in orbit. In contrast, the Intelsat IVs weighed more than [[Pound (mass)|£]] 1,300 (595&amp;nbsp;kg) into orbit and were more than 17 feet (5.31 meters) in diameter. All seven satellites exceeded their projected life expectancies and were withdrawn from active duty, the last of which, the [[Intelsat IV F-1]] was retired in October 1987.

The satellite was equipped with 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponders. It had 6,000 two-way [[relay]] phone calls or broadcast 12 concurrent color television programs or mixed combinations of communications traffic including data and fax.

The satellite had 12 channels of broadband communication. Each channel had a bandwidth of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz and provided about 500 communication circuits.

== Release ==
The satellite was successfully launched into space on January 23, 1972, at 00:12:04 UTC, by means of an Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,414&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ljubljana: Založba ZRC, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Slovene dialects|Slovene dialect]] in the [[Littoral dialect group]]. It is spoken in [[Slovenian Istria]] in most of the rural areas of the municipalities of [[Koper]], [[Izola]] and [[Piran]], as well as by the Slovenes living in the [[Italy|Italian]] municipalities of [[Muggia]] and [[San Dorligo della Valle]], as well as in the southern suburbs of [[Trieste]] ([[Servola]], [[Cattinara]]).&lt;ref name="Toporisic"&gt;Toporišič, Jože. 1992. ''Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika''. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, pp. 63, 257, 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonological and morphological characteristics==
The Istrian dialect does not have [[pitch accent]] and is non-diphthongal. Long ''a'' is rounded to ''ɔ'', fronted ''a'' is common, including as a reflex of ''e'' and original ''ə'', and syllabic ''l'' has developed into ''u''. The dialect has soft ''ľ'', soft ''ń'', ''ć'', and ''šć''. The dialect has lost the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] morphologically. The conditional is made with the auxiliary ''bin''. The dialect has been influenced by [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as spoken in [[Buzet]] and [[Ćićarija]]. The dialect is further subdivided into the [[Rižana subdialect|Rižana]] and [[Šavrini Hills subdialect]]s.&lt;ref name="Toporisic"/&gt;

The '''Lefkaritis Tomb''' is a [[hypogeum]]—a type of tomb—in [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]].

It was discovered in 1998 in an "un-looted [[burial chamber|chamber]] that had been sealed nearly 2800 years ago"  in the [[Kition|city-kingdom of Kition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjisavvas|first=Sophocles|title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume II|year=2013|publisher=[[Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications]]|url=|pages=1, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This tomb was found within the [[city wall]]s of [[Kition]], as opposed to the [[necropolis]] on the outside.)

To create a final report on the [[archaeological excavation]]s of "two important [[Hypogeum|built tombs]], namely the [[Ikarou Street Tomb]] and the '''Lefkaritis Tomb'''" were the primary reasons for the authoring of ''The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition'' Volume II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjisavvas|first=Sophocles|title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume II|year=2013|publisher=[[Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications]]|url=|page=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The author participated in the excavations.)

==Excavation==
The street address where the tomb was unearthed, is Vasileos Konstantinou 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjisavvas|first=Sophocles|title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume II|year=2013|publisher=[[Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications]]|url=|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the "few objects found", were "Extraordinary gold ornaments", which were moved to [[Cyprus Museum]] for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjisavvas|first=Sophocles|title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume II|year=2013|publisher=[[Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The tomb was discovered in the vicinity of the residence of Dino '''Lefkaritis''' (a known businessman in the [[petroleum industry]]), hence the name ''Lefkaritis Tomb''.

This is a '''list of Ecuadorian dishes and foods'''. [[Ecuadorian cuisine]], the cuisine of [[Ecuador]], is diverse, varying with altitude, and associated agricultural conditions. [[Pork]], [[chicken]], [[beef]], and ''cuy'' ([[guinea pig]]) are popular in the mountainous regions, and are served with a variety of carbohydrate-rich foods, especially [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[potato]]es. A popular [[street food]] in mountainous regions is ''[[hornado]]'' (roasted pig), which is often served with ''[[llapingacho]]'' (a pan seared potato ball). Some examples of Ecuadorian cuisine in general include ''patacones'' (unripe [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]] fried in [[Cooking oil|oil]], mashed up, and then refried), ''llapingachos'', and ''[[seco de chivo]]'' (a type of stew made from [[goat]]). A wide variety of fresh fruit is available, particularly at lower altitudes, including [[Sweet granadilla|granadilla]], [[passionfruit]], ''[[naranjilla]]'', several types of [[bananas]], [[Physalis peruviana|uvilla]], [[taxo]], and [[tree tomato]] finally a drink made from fruits known as the colada or even the [[colada morada]]

'''MNC Vision''' (formerly known as '''Indovision''') is an Indonesian [[subscription]]-based [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) or ''direct-to-home'' [[satellite television]] and [[satellite radio|radio]] service initially in [[Indonesia]]. MNC Vision is currently owned by PT MNC Skyvision Tbk ({{idx|MSKY}}).

==History==
MNC Vision began operations in January 1994 as Indovision.&lt;ref name="About Indovision" /&gt;

Indovision started its service with five-channel C-Band Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) analog service. Using Palapa C-2 satellite for its transponder and broadcasting system, the C-Band DBS service features programming from international suppliers, such as HBO Asia, Star TV, Discovery, as well as local programming. Following in 1997, [[IndoStar-1]] which also known as Cakrawarta-1 was launched as the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80 cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. Similar performance is not economically feasible with comparable Ku- or C-band DTH satellite systems since more power is required in these bands to penetrate the moist atmosphere.

This satellite uses S-Band frequency, which are less vulnerable to atmospheric interference than C-Band frequency, and are well suited to the tropical climate such as Indonesia. Cakrawarta-1 is managed and operated by PT Media Citra Indostar (MCI), a subsidiary of [[Indosat|PT Indosat Tbk]] which was established on 22 July 1991.&lt;ref name="About Indovision" /&gt;

The S-Band DBS service substantially has increased programming line-up and has expanded the company's subscriber base using smaller and less expensive satellite dishes with only 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. Then, by the end of 1997, the company anticipated terminating its analog service and encouraged its subscribers to switch to its new digital DBS service. This digital system allows Indovision to deliver superior audio and video quality to its subscribers.&lt;ref name="About Indovision" /&gt;

In May 2009, Indovision launched a new satellite named Indostar-2/Cakrawarata-2/ProtoSar-2. It was  later renamed to SES-7 in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/indostar-2_protostar-2.htm | title=The Indostar-2 Satellite |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lyngsat.com/ses7.html | title=The Indostar-2 Satellite at Lyngsat|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/601/indostar2/indostar2.html | title=The Indostar-2 Satellite at Boeing Website | accessdate=2011-02-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628202033/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/601/indostar2/indostar2.html | archivedate=2011-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, MNC Vision has 5 channels in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], including [[HBO (Asia)|HBO HD]], [[Fox Movies Premium|Fox Movies Premium HD]], [[National Geographic Channel (Asia)|National Geographic Channel HD]], [[Disney XD (Southeast Asia)|Disney XD HD]], &amp; [[Fox Sports Asia|Fox Sports 3 HD]].

On 12 December 2017, Indovision was rebranded as MNC Vision.

The '''Montenegrin Mountain Hound''' is a rare [[dog]] [[dog breed|breed]] from the mountain regions across the [[Balkans]]. Black and tan, with a smooth coat, the Montenegrin Mountain Hound was called ''Black Hound'' in the past. The breed is of the same origin as the other Balkan hounds. He stands {{convert|18|to|22|in|cm}} high and weighs {{convert|44|to|55|lb|kg}}. The breed is used to hunt [[fox]], [[hare]], and small game, occasionally hunting larger animals such as [[deer]] or even [[wild boar]].

The breed was formerly known as the '''Yugoslavian Mountain Hound'''; the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] changed the name on July 15, 1997. The first standard dates back to 1924. The breed bears strong resemblance to the [[Austrian Black and Tan Hound]].&lt;ref&gt;Pugnetti, Gino. ''Sve o psima'' [translated by baroness Turković, Ksenija], Mladinska knjiga (Ljubljana) and Mladost (Zagreb), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The breed was first officially recognized on May 8, 1969 in [[Warsaw]]. [[American Rare Breed Association]] considers the breed endangered.

Perhaps the most memorable popular depiction of the Montenegrin Mountain Hound (then called Yugoslavian Mountain Hound) had been as the [[hand puppet]] "[[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]]", regularly appearing on the NBC television show ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Although the puppet displays physical characteristics of the breed, and was identified as such during many appearances, the caption identifying Triumph as a Yugoslavian Mountain Hound was promptly removed after [[NATO]] military attack ensued against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]].

'''Participatory [[evaluation]]''' is an approach to [[program evaluation]].  It provides for the active involvement of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] in the program: providers, partners, beneficiaries, and any other interested parties.  All involved decide how to frame the questions used to evaluate the program, and all decide how to measure outcomes and [[Impact evaluation|impact]].  It is often used in [[international development]].&lt;ref name=ccph&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/ccph/pdf_files/Evaluation.pdf Community-based public health policy &amp; practice, Issue #5, April 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS539.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participatory evaluation in international development ==

Participatory evaluation in development, is part of the new wave of grassroots development in which local stakeholders have a more valuable role in the development process. Participatory evaluation methods, in comparison to more mainstream evaluation practices, make space for input from locals who have a specialized and more personal set of knowledge on the community's needs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge Shared: Participatory Evaluation in Development Cooperation|last=Edward T. Jackson|first=Yusuf Kassam|publisher=Kumarian Press Inc.|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term "locals" can include local governments, local non-governmental organizations, local civil society organizations, and local citizens, among various other actors. In the past, evaluation methods in development have been more quantitative in nature, placing more importance on donor-needs and measurable indicators, but participatory evaluation creates more room for multiple stakeholders to provide much needed input.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This strategy can increase the overall accuracy and complexity of monitoring and evaluation in development projects, generating more sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The key idea is that stakeholders, meaning all groups with both an interest and that are affected by the project, are given an opportunity to provide feedback.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makgamatha|first=Matthews Matome|date=July 2009|title=Challenges in implementing a participatory evaluation approach: A case study of the Limpopo Literacy Teaching Evaluation Project|url=|journal=Education as Change|volume=13|issue=1|pages=91-103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hope is then that the feedback will be implemented in good faith. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Participatory evaluation is an extension of participatory development theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Participatory evaluation methods have been used at all scales of development projects, including in small-scale businesses as well as large-scale projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oviedo|first=Antonio F.P.|last2=Bursztyn|first2=Marcel|date=2016|title=The Fortune of the Commons: Participatory Evaluation of Small-Scale Fisheries in the Brazilian Amazon|url=|journal=Environmental Management|volume=57|pages=1009-1023|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these contexts, stakeholders are involved at all levels of the development process, including planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empowerment and Participatory Evaluation of Community Interventions: Multiple Benefits|last=Suarez-Balcazar|first=Yolanda|publisher=The Haworth Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits to applying participatory evaluation to international development include an increase in local ownership, higher empowerment rates for all involved parties, more diverse analysis methods, increase in accuracy to local realities, improvements in impacts of development efforts. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Participatory evaluation has also been applied beyond international development aid, and having been involved in humanitarian intervention and aid efforts thus increasing the transparancy, accountability, and opportunities to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossignoli|first=Cristiano M.|last2=Giani|first2=Alberto|last3=Di lacovo|first3=Francesco|last4=Moruzzo|first4=Roberta|last5=Scarpellini|first5=Paola|date=|title=Enhancing particpatory evaluation in a humanitarian aid project|url=|journal=Evaluation|volume=23|pages=134-151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on contexts, participatory evaluation methodologies can vary. Projects can involve active stakeholder participation at every step of the evaluation process; they can control the evaluation process while keeping stakeholders informed and discussing when needed; or projects can train and prep stakeholders to take on development initiatives by learning throughout the evaluation process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Within the international development context, participatory evaluation is not without challenges. Since stakeholders are such a crucial element to participatory evaluation, a major challenge to this method is ensuring that the right groups have been included in evaluation methods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further still, the challenge is identifying what practices and data collection methods work best when collaborating with stakeholders, especially when working with multiple stakeholder groups that have clashing values and objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another challenge to implementing participatory evaluation methods is maintaining the balance in power dynamics between different stakeholders of the development project, including the evaluation team itself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As part of project teams, evaluation teams hold an authoritative position and these evaluators have the potential to hold more power than local stakeholders&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Ultimately, this power balance can be reflected by skewed results.   

==Advantages==
* Identify locally relevant questions.
* Improve program performance
* Empower participants
* Build capacity
* Develop leaders and build teams
* Sustain organizational learning and growth&lt;ref name = ccph /&gt;&lt;ref name = usaid /&gt;

==Disadvantages ==
* Time and commitment of all involved
* Resource-intensive during evaluation
* Conflict resolution may be needed&lt;ref name = ccph /&gt;&lt;ref name = usaid /&gt;

==Characteristics==
* Participant focus and ownership
* Negotiation
* Learning
* Flexibility&lt;ref name = ccph /&gt;&lt;ref name = usaid /&gt;

==Applications==
It is a form of [[community-based participatory research]] and [[participatory action research]]. The evaluation is designed for the people involved in a program as well as its funders, with the hope that results of the evaluation get used rather than sitting on a program funder's shelf.

Tools for monitoring and evaluation in program development, including international development, such as creating a [[logic model]] or [[outcome mapping]], can be forms of participatory evaluation if stakeholders are involved.

This method is endorsed by the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/SG/approach.htm |title=Participatory approach |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/evaluation/documents/who.htm |title=Who are the question-makers? |publisher=Undp.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013142621/http://www.undp.org/evaluation/documents/who.htm |archivedate=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/education/aladin/paldin/pdf/course01/unit_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in the development programs of many countries including Canada,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/3/35135226.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the US&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt; and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://nzaidtools.nzaid.govt.nz/participatory-evaluation&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of participatory evaluation in academia include [[Clemencia Rodriguez]] and [[Barry Checkoway]].

'''''Saba senegalensis''''' ({{lang-bm|Nsaban}} or ''Zaban''; [[French language|French]] (from a [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]] bastardization): ''liane saba''; [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: ''mad'' or ''madd'' or "kabaa" in Gambian Wolof; [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]]: ''laare'')  is a fruit producing plant of the [[Apocynaceae]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=SASE15|title=Plants Profile for Saba senegalensis (Senegal saba)|date=|publisher=Plants.usda.gov|accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; family, native to the [[Sahel]] region of [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  It has several common names in various West African Languages. The tree grows predominantly on riverbanks and in woodlands in Burkina Faso,Senegal, and Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=17999|title=A tree species reference and selection guide|last=Burkill|first=HM|publisher=PROSEA|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been observed growing as vine up trees, as a small erect shrub, and oftentimes growing to the size of a large tree. 

[[ICRISAT]] has cited ''S. senegalensis'' as a useful food crop plant and as a tool to combat [[soil degradation]] in rural Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrisat.org/who-we-are/investors-partners/donor-flyers/126_Tree-Crop-Livestock_Systems_scr.pdf|title=Transforming Agriculture in the Sahel Through Tree-Crop-Livestock Systems|publisher=Icrisat.org|accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Fruit ==
The fruit of ''Saba senegalensis'' has a hard yellow peel. The fruit is filled with seed pods that are meant to be sucked on, similar to the consumption of [[Tamarind|tamarind.]] It is describes as having a tart and sour flavor like that of a mango or lemon.

== Drink ==
Natives of the [[Sahel|Sahel region]] often use the fruit to make a juice. 

== Propagation ==
''Saba senegalensis'' is most easily propagated through seeds. Once you acquire seeds, soak them in warm water for 24 hours. Then,start seeds directly in cactus soil mix. '''Do not overwater'''. The seeds should sprout within 2-4 weeks. Alternatively, if you have access to a live plant, it can by propagated by use of cuttings. Simply cut a 6-12 inch branch from the plant, and start directly in soil. The plant should fruit within 2-5 years of being planted.

== Growing ==
''Saba senegalensis'' will grow best outdoors in USDA zones 10 and warmer. If you live in a colder zone, you may have success growing it in a pot and bringing it indoors for winter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''Taiwan McDonald's bombings''' ({{zh|c=麥當勞爆炸案|p=màidāngláo bàozhà àn|l=McDonald's bombing incidents}}) occurred on April 28 and 29, 1992, in which bombs were planted in or near seven [[McDonald's]] restaurant franchises in [[Taiwan]].

In response to the bombings, McDonald's temporarily closed all 57 restaurants in Taiwan. One policeman was killed and four civilians were injured in the attacks. The police officer was killed when the bomb he was defusing exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zxEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SgMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4554,8030420&amp;dq=taipei%20bomb&amp;hl=en|title=Toledo Blade - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another bomb detonated in the [[Taipei]] suburb of [[Yonghe District|Yonghe]] and caused injuries to two young children and two McDonald's employees who were investigating a ticking sound. Five other small explosive devices were found in [[Kaohsiung]] and Taipei on April 28 and 29, four of them inside or near McDonald's restaurants. One exploded but caused no injuries.

An anonymous telephone caller demanded US$240,000 from Quanti Foods, which operates the McDonald's chain in Taiwan. The company refused to negotiate or pay the ransom and closed all its restaurants island-wide while police conducted their search. A reward of US$20,000 was offered for information on the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=McDonald's Closes in Taiwan After String of Bomb Attacks|first=|last=Reuters|date=30 April 1992|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen Hsi-Hsieh, a plumber, was convicted of murder and extortion for his responsibility of the McDonald's bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=74465&amp;CtNode=103|title=McDonald's bomber guilty of murder - Taiwan Today|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921001150/http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=74465&amp;CtNode=103|archivedate=21 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to life in prison by a Taipei District Court on 25 November 1992. His accomplice, Pan Che-Ming, was sentenced to 15 years and 6 months for providing the explosives and harboring Chen. The bombs were detonated by use of a [[Tilt fuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6LgSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9vkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7050,4118922&amp;dq=taipei%20bomb%20mcdonalds&amp;hl=en|title=Spokane Chronicle - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1658">This article concerns the systems of '''communications in Liechtenstein'''.  [[Liechtenstein]] possesses a number of modern communications systems, some of which are shared with the neighbouring country of [[Switzerland]].  The country code and top-level domain for Liechtenstein is [[.li]].

==Telephone and internet==
Liechtenstein's automatic telephone system is connected to the [[Communications in Switzerland|Swiss]] telephone networks via cable and microwave radio relay systems.  There are 20,072 main line telephones in the country served by the network.  In April 1999, Liechtenstein ceased to be a part of the [[Telephone numbers in Switzerland|Swiss telephone numbering plan]], in which the country used the Swiss area code "075", opting instead to have a unique [[country calling code]], "[[+423]]".  There are 44 [[internet service providers]] in Liechtenstein and Switzerland combined.

==Radio and television==
There are four [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio broadcast stations in Liechtenstein serving 21,000 [[radio]]s.  The television broadcast system is linked to the [[Television in Switzerland|Swiss networks]], with the Swiss services serving 12,000 televisions in Liechtenstein.

'''[[Trunk Prefix]]: 0'''

On February 1, 2004 [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]] introduced a new closed telephone numbering plan with an open dialing plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anrceti.md telephone numbering plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of international telephone numbers==

International telephone numbers consist of the country code "373", and 8 national significant numbers (N(S)N). 

The National Significant Number consists of 2-3 digits for the National Destination Code and 5-6 digits for the Subscriber Number (SN).

'''Voice of America''' ('''VOA''') is a U.S. government-funded international radio broadcast source which serves as the United States federal government's official institution for non-military, external broadcasting, the largest U.S. international broadcaster. VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in more than 40 languages which it distributes to affiliate stations around the globe. It is primarily viewed by foreign audiences, so VOA programming has an influence on public opinion abroad regarding the United States and its leaders.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

VOA was established in 1942,&lt;ref name="VOA Mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/p/5831.html|title=Mission and Values|website=InsideVOA.com|author=VOA Public Relations|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the VOA charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg823.pdf 90 Stat. 823], [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-108/pdf/STATUTE-108-Pg4299.pdf 108 Stat. 4299]&lt;/ref&gt; was signed into law in 1976 by [[President Gerald Ford]]. The charter contains its mission "to broadcast accurate, balanced, and comprehensive news and information to an international audience", and it defines the legally mandated standards in the VOA journalistic code.&lt;ref name=VOANews2016/&gt;

VOA is headquartered in Washington, DC and overseen by the [[U.S. Agency for Global Media]], an independent agency of the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="VOA Charter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidevoa.com/p/5728.html|title=VOA Charter|website=InsideVOA.com|author=VOA Public Relations|publisher=Voice of America|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161120165209/http://www.insidevoa.com/p/5728.html|archivedate=November 20, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds are appropriated annually by Congress under the budget for embassies and consulates. In 2016, VOA broadcast an estimated 1,800 hours of radio and TV programming each week to approximately 236.6 million people worldwide with about 1,050 employees and a taxpayer-funded annual budget of {{usd|218.5 million}}.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borchers|first1=Callum|title=Voice of America says it won’t become Trump TV|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/26/voice-of-america-says-it-wont-become-trump-tv/|accessdate=August 11, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOANews2016&gt;{{cite web|author1=VOA Public Relations|title=The Largest U.S. International Broadcaster|url=https://docs.voanews.eu/en-US-INSIDE/2016/12/05/5d1e6a53-3ed2-4c3e-b043-ecae12d9eed8.pdf|website=VOANews.com|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=August 11, 2017|date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American private shortwave broadcasting before World War II===
Before World War II, all American shortwave stations were in private hands.&lt;ref name="Berg, Jerome S. 1999, page 105"&gt;Berg, Jerome S. ''On the Short Waves, 1923–1945: Broadcast Listening in the Pioneer Days of Radio.'' 1999, McFarland. {{ISBN|0-7864-0506-6}}, 105&lt;/ref&gt; Privately controlled shortwave networks included the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]]'s International Network (or White Network), which broadcast in six languages,&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. "NBC Resources Held by the Recorded Sound Section." [https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/recnbc.html Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]]'s Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 different countries,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, A.B. "CBS International Broadcast Facilities". Proceedings of the IRE, Volume 30, Issue 3, March 1942 pp. 118–29, abstract at [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/10933/35681/01694449.pdf IEEE]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] in Cincinnati, Ohio, all of which had shortwave transmitters. Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.&lt;ref name="Dizard_24"&gt;{{harvp|Dizard|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the Federal Communications Commission set the following policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Cornelia Bruère. ''National Policy for Radio Broadcasting.'' 1971, Ayer Publishing. {{ISBN|0-405-03580-2}}. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This policy was intended to enforce the State Department's [[Good Neighbor Policy]], but some broadcasters felt that it was an attempt to direct censorship.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine. "NABusiness." Monday, July 24, 1939. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771673-1,00.html Time.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda around 1940.&lt;ref name="Dizard_24"/&gt; Initially, the Office of Coordination of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news.&lt;ref name="Berg, Jerome S. 1999, page 105" /&gt; The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was [[Edmund A. Chester]], and he supervised the development of CBS's extensive "La Cadena de las Americas" radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=Eva+Garza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Edmund%20Chester&amp;f=false ''Dissonant Divas In Chicana Music: The Limits of La Onda'' Deborah R.

Also included among the cultural diplomacy programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show ''[[Viva America]]'' (1942-1949) which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including [[Alfredo Antonini]], [[Juan Arvizu]], [[Eva Garza]], [[Elsa Miranda]], [[Nestor Mesta Chayres|Nestor Mesta Chaires]], [[Miguel Sandoval (composer)|Miguel Sandoval]], [[John Serry Sr.]], and [[Terig Tucci]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Pictorial History of Radio'', Settel Irving Grosset &amp; Dunlap Publishers, New York, 1960 &amp; 1967, Pg. 146, Library of Congress #67-23789&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Media Sound &amp; Culture in Latin America.

These broadcasts proved to be highly successful in supporting President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s policy of [[Pan-Americanism]] throughout South America during World War II. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=Eva+Garza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=snippet&amp;q=ociaa&amp;f=false ''Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of La Onda'' Deborah R.

===World War II===
Even before the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government’s [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]] (COI, in Washington) had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis through its Foreign Information Service (FIS, in New York) headed by playwright [[Robert E. Sherwood]], the playwright who served as president [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]’s speech writer and information advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html |title=The Voice of America: Origins and Recollections |last=Roberts |first=Walter R. |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via a leased [[General Electric]]’s transmitter to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). Next step was the live broadcast to [[Germany]], which was called ''Stimmen aus Amerika'' ("Voices from America") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and included the pledge: "Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Walter R. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html UNC.edu] See also: {{cite web |url=http://www.chriskern.net/essay/voaFirstBroadcast.html |title=A Belated Correction: The ''Real'' First Broadcast of the Voice of America |last=Kern |first=Chris |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel [[William J. Donovan]] (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term "The Voice of America" to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City.

The [[Office of War Information]], when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA's operations. VOA reached an agreement with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] to share medium-wave transmitters in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and expanded into [[Tunis]] in North Africa and [[Palermo]] and [[Bari, Italy]] as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dizard|2004|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Asia]]n transmissions started with one transmitter in [[California]] in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in [[Hawaii]] and, after recapture, the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Dizard_25"&gt;{{harvp|Dizard|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.&lt;ref name="Dizard_25"/&gt; Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and [[San Francisco]], with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sterling |first1=Christopher H. |first2=John Michael |last2=Kittross |year=2001 |title=Stay Tuned: a History of American Broadcasting |series=LEA's Communication Series |publisher=Lawernce Erlbaum Associates |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-8058-2624-1 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of VOA's services, including the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] service, were discontinued in 1945.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2006, 13"&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the Department of State.

===Cold War===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--many paragraphs without citations, especially at end of section--&gt;
In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering "more harmful instances of [[Soviet propaganda]] directed against American leaders and policies" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton's treatise, ''Cold War Propaganda''.&lt;ref name="whitton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=John B. Whitton |year=1951 |title=Cold War propaganda |journal=[[American Journal of International Law]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=151–53 |jstor=2194791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic [[radio jamming|jamming]] of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.&lt;ref name="whitton"/&gt;

[[Charles W. Thayer]] headed VOA in 1948–49.

Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of its [[foreign policy]] to fight the propaganda of the [[Soviet Union]] and other countries.

The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2006, 13"/&gt;

In 1952, Voice of America installed a studio and relay facility aboard a converted [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] renamed ''[[USCGC Courier (WAGR-410)|Courier]]'' whose [[target audience]] was Soviet Union and other members of [[Warsaw Pact]]. The ''Courier'' was originally intended to become the first in a fleet of mobile, radio broadcasting ships (see [[offshore radio]]) that built upon [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] experience during WWII in using warships as floating broadcasting stations. However, the ''Courier'' eventually dropped anchor off the island of [[Rhodes, Greece]] with permission of the [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] to avoid being branded as a [[pirate radio]] broadcasting ship. This VOA offshore station stayed on the air until the 1960s when facilities were eventually provided on land. The ''Courier'' supplied training to engineers who later worked on several of the European commercial offshore broadcasting stations of the 1950s and 1960s.

Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the [[U.S. Information Agency]] when the latter was established in 1953.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2006, 13"/&gt; to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People's Republic of China (PRC).

Starting in the 1950s, VOA [[Voice of America Jazz Hour|broadcast American jazz]],  with [[Willis Conover]] hosting a daily program from 1955 until 1996, which was highly popular worldwide drawing 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at [[South Africa]] in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as ''The [[Newport Jazz Festival]]'' were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Louis Armstrong]], and [[Duke Ellington]], sponsored by the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Appy, Christian G. Cold War Constructions: The Political Culture of United States Imperialism. 2000, [[University of Massachusetts Press]]; {{ISBN|1-55849-218-6}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Cold War]], many of the targeted countries' governments sponsored [[radio jamming|jamming]] of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, [[Polish People's Republic]] stopped jamming VOA transmissions {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, but [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. [[Chinese language]] VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Broadcasting Yearbook, 1976 and 1979 editions.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Conference Report, ''Cold War Impact of VOA Broadcasts,'' Hoover Institution and the Cold War International History Project of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Oct. 13–16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iarums-r1.org/iarums/prcdragon.pdf |title=Fighting the Chinese Government "Firedragon" – Music Jammer AND "Sound of Hope" Broadcasting (SOH), Taiwan |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |format=PDF |last=Bihlmayer |first=Ulrich |date=September 12, 2006 |publisher=IARU Region 1 Monitoring System}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuba]] has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to [[Iran]] from its Russian-built transmission site at [[Bejucal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc6.net/news/2334674/detail.html |title=U.S.: Cuba Jamming TV Signals To Iran – Local News Story – WTVJ |accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: "The [[North Korea]]n government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David. "The Future of Radio II." World Radio TV Handbook, 2007 edition. 2007, Billboard Books. {{ISBN|0-8230-5997-9}}. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era's most important news, including [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech and [[Neil Armstrong]]'s first walk on the moon. During the [[Cuban missile crisis]], VOA broadcast around-the-clock in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, [[Radio Martí]] and [[TV Martí]]. Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba.

In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to [[Afghanistan]] in [[Dari language|Dari]] and in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] in 1982. At the same time, VOA started to broadcast U.S. government editorials, clearly separated from the programming by audio cues.

In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live [[disc jockey]]s, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest (such as "EuroFax") 24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Bill|title=VOA Europe: A Victim of Bureaucracy?|journal=Billboard|date=March 8, 1997|volume=109|issue=10|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22voa+europe%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22voa%20europe%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999 revamped into VOA Music Mix. Since November 1, 2014 stations are offered VOA1 (which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix).

In 1989, Voice of America expanded its [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese Chinese|Cantonese]] programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country, accurately about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square.

Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.

===Post–Cold War===
With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of Tibetan, Kurdish (to Iran and Iraq), Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, and [[Rwanda-Rundi]] language services.

In 1993, the [[Clinton administration]] advised cutting funding for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] as it was felt post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and he then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act. The [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] was established and took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously oversaw funding for RFE/RL.&lt;ref name="Raghavan" /&gt;

In 1994, President Clinton signed the International Broadcasting Act into law. This law established the International Broadcasting Bureau as a part of the U.S. Information Agency and created the Broadcasting Board of Governors with oversight authority. In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law and mandated that BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the U.S.I.A. and merged most of its functions with those of the State Department.

In 1994, Voice of America became the first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html |title=The Voice of America: First on the Internet |last=Kern |first=Chris |accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.

=== Cuts in services ===
The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or [[Radio Sawa]], with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins.

In May 16, 2004; [[Worldnet Television and Film Service|Worldnet]], a satellite television service, was merged into the VOA network.

Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; In September 2008, VOA eliminated the Hindi language service after 53 years.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091103305.html|title=India Set to Lose Voice of America|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=September 12, 2008|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|first=Rama|last=Lakshmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Broadcasts in Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian and Bosnian also ended.&lt;ref name="publica"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/voice-of-america-to-cut-language-services-709|title=Voice of America to Cut Language Services|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=July 3, 2008|publisher=propublica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reductions were part of American efforts to concentrate more resources to broadcast to the Muslim world.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="publica"/&gt;

In September 2010, VOA started radio broadcasts in Sudan. As U.S. interests in [[South Sudan]] have grown, there is a desire to provide people with free information.&lt;ref&gt;Abedje, Ashenafi. "Voice of America Expands its Sudan Programming," Voice of America News, September 17, 2010. Retrieved on March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, VOA finished foreign language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran and Latin America; as well as English language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidevoa.com/content/voa-reducing-radio-frequencies/1629194.html|title=VOA Reducing Radio Frequencies|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=March 26, 2013|publisher=insidevoa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was done due to budget cuts.&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt;

On July 1, 2014, VOA cut most of its shortwave transmissions in English to Asia.&lt;ref name="arrl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/voice-of-america-makes-more-cuts-to-international-shortwave-broadcast-schedule|title=Voice of America Makes More Cuts to International Shortwave Broadcast Schedule|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=July 1, 2014|publisher=arrl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortwave broadcasts in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek were dropped too.&lt;ref name="arrl"/&gt; On August 11, 2014, the Greek service ended after 72 years on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov/blog/2014/08/11/voice-of-america-ends-greek-broadcasts/|title=Voice of America Ends Greek Broadcasts|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=August 11, 2014|publisher=bbg.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite6_1_12/08/2014_542099|title=After 72 years on air, VOA's Greek Service goes silent|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=August 12, 2014|publisher=[[Kathimerini]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agencies==
Voice of America has been a part of several agencies. From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the [[Office of War Information]], and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the [[U.S. Information Agency]] in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], or BBG, which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) that oversaw the funding and operation of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], a branch of VOA.&lt;ref name="Raghavan"&gt;Raghavan, Sudarsan V., Stephen S. Johnson, and Kristi K. Bahrenburg. "Sending cross-border static: on the fate of Radio Free Europe and the influence of international broadcasting," Journal of International Affairs, Vol. 47, 1993, access on March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==

===Smith–Mundt Act===
From 1948 until its repeal in 2013, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens under § 501 of the [[Smith–Mundt Act]].&lt;ref name=chuck_nbc_2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/20/19502580-taxpayer-money-at-work-us-funded-foreign-broadcasts-finally-available-in-the-us|title=Taxpayer money at work: US-funded foreign broadcasts finally available in the US|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|publisher=NBC News|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was repealed as a result of the passing of the ''Smith-Mundt Modernization Act'' provision of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013|National Defense Authorization Act for 2013]].&lt;ref name="smma"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=John|title=U.S. Repeals Propaganda Ban, Spreads Government-Made News to Americans|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/12/us_backs_off_propaganda_ban_spreads_government_made_news_to_americans|accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the legislation in 1948 was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by their own government.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, James F., and Darren W. Miller. ''Consider the Source: A Critical Guide to 100 prominent news and information sites on the Web.'' Medford, NJ: Information Today, 2007. {{ISBN|0-910965-77-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-910965-77-4}}, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal policies===

====VOA charter====
Under the Eisenhower administration in 1959, VOA Director [[Henry Loomis]] commissioned a formal statement of principles to protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the organization's mission, and was issued by Director [[George V. Allen]] as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director [[Edward R. Murrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|2006|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles were signed into law on July 12, 1976, by President [[Gerald Ford]]. It reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.&lt;ref name="VOA Charter" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===="Two-source rule"====
According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent actually witness an event.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/publicity/heilinterview.html Interview with Alan Heil, author of ''Voice of America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706051252/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/publicity/heilinterview.html |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newsroom==
Voice of America's central newsroom has hundreds of journalists and dozens of full-time domestic and overseas correspondents, who are employees of the U.S. government or paid contractors. They are augmented by hundreds of contract correspondents and [[stringer (journalism)|stringers]] throughout the world, who file in English or in one of VOA's other radio and television broadcast languages.

In late 2005, VOA shifted some of its central-news operation to Hong Kong where contracted writers worked from a "virtual" office with counterparts on the overnight shift in Washington, D.C., but this operation was shut down in early 2008.

==Shortwave frequencies==
By December 2014, the number of transmitters and frequencies used by VOA had been greatly reduced. VOA still uses shortwave transmissions to cover some areas of Africa and Asia. Shortwave broadcasts still take place in these languages: Afaan Oromoo, Amharic, Bambara, Cantonese, Chinese, English, Indonesian, Korean and Swahili.

==VOA Radiogram==
[http://voaradiogram.net/ VOA Radiogram] was an experimental Voice of America program starting in March 2013 which transmitted digital text and images via [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] [[Radiogram (message)|radiograms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voaradiogram.net/ |title=VOA Radiogram |publisher=VOA Radiogram |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30 minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[shortwave receiver]] with freely downloadable software of the [[Fldigi]] family. This software is available for [[Windows]], [[Apple Computers|Apple]] ([[OSX]]), [[Linux]], and [[FreeBSD]] systems.

Broadcasts can also be decoded using the free [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Tivar&amp;hl=en TIVAR app from the Google Play store] using any [[Android (operating system)|Android]] device.

The mode used most often on VOA Radiogram, for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted.

The final edition of VOA Radiogram was transmitted during the weekend of June 17–18, 2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voaradiogram.net/post/160839098787/voa-radiogram-20-21-may-2017-special-doomed|title=VOA Radiogram, 20–21 May 2017: Special doomed edition|website=VOA Radiogram|access-date=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a follow-on show called Shortwave Radiogram began transmission on June 25, 2017 from the [[WRMI]] transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swradiogram.net/post/162168963047/shortwave-radiogram-25-june-2017-first-show Shortwave Radiogram, 25 June 2017: First show.

==Transmission facilities==
One of VOA's radio transmitter facilities was originally based on a {{convert|625|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|Union Township]] (now West Chester Township) in [[Butler County, Ohio]], near [[Cincinnati]]. The site is now a recreational park with a lake, lodge, dog park, and Voice of America museum. The [[Voice of America Bethany Relay Station|Bethany Relay Station]] operated from 1944 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Voice_of_America|title=Voice of America - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other former sites include California ([[Dixon, California|Dixon]], [[Delano, California|Delano]]), Hawaii, [[Okinawa]], (Monrovia) Liberia, Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana, Morocco, Thailand, Kuwait, and Sao Tome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/a/3794247.html|title=VOA Through the Years|work=VOA|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, VOA and the IBB continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at [[International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station]] in the United States, close to [[Greenville, North Carolina]], "Site B."  They do not use FCC-issued callsigns, since they are overseen by the [[NTIA]], which is the Federal Government equivalent of the FCC (which regulates state government and public &amp; private communications) and they operate under different rules. The IBB also operates a transmission facility on [[São Tomé]] and (Tinang) [[Concepcion, Tarlac]], Philippines for VOA.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Comparing VOA-RFE-RL-RM to other broadcasters==
In 1996, the U.S.'s international radio output consisted of 992 hours per week by VOA, 667 by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and 162 by Radio Marti.

In late September 2001, VOA aired a report that contained brief excerpts of an interview with then [[Taliban]] leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar Mohammad]], along with segments from President Bush's post-9/11 speech to Congress, an expert in Islam from Georgetown University, and comments by the foreign minister of Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. State Department officials including [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In response, reporters and editors argued for the VOA's [[editorial independence]] from its governors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the University of Oregon's [[Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Abdul Malik Rigi interview===
On April 2, 2007, [[Abdul Malik Rigi]], the leader of [[Jundallah (Iran)|Jundullah]], a terrorist militant group with possible links to [[al-Qaeda]], appeared on Voice of America's Persian service. VOA introduced Rigi as "the leader of popular Iranian resistance movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/4710.html |title=VoA interviews Iranian terrorist culprit in a sign of backing |publisher=PressTV |date=April 2, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021055147/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/4710.html |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2015}}{{verification needed|date=May 2015}} The interview resulted in public condemnation by the [[Iranian-American]] community, as well as the [[Iranian government]].&lt;ref name="swissinfo.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Iranian_speaker_says_U_S_supports_terrorists.html?siteSect=143&amp;sid=7692846&amp;cKey=1175790190000 |title=Iranian speaker says U.S. supports "terrorists" |publisher=swissinfo |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071205232531/http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Iranian_speaker_says_U_S_supports_terrorists.html?siteSect=143&amp;sid=7692846&amp;cKey=1175790190000 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baztab.com/news/63969.php |script-title=fa:گفتوگوي صداي آمريکا با قاتل مردم بلوچستان! |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |language=Persian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410034234/http://baztab.com/news/63969.php |archivedate=April 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jundullah is a [[Sunni]] Islamist militant organization that has been linked to numerous attacks on civilians, such as the [[2009 Zahedan explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/07/080707fa_fact_hersh?printable=true|title=Preparing the Battlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washt400killed"&gt;{{cite news

===Tibetan protester interview===
In February 2013, a documentary released by [[China Central Television]] interviewed a [[self-immolation protests by Tibetans in China|Tibetan self-immolator]] who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America's broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation. VOA denied any allegations of instigating self-immolations and demanded that the Chinese station retract its report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://behindthewall.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/07/16878280-chinese-documentary-alleges-us-broadcaster-incites-tibetan-self-immolations|title=Chinese documentary alleges US broadcaster incites Tibetan self-immolations|first=Ed|last=Flanagan|date=February 7, 2013|work=Behind the Wall|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump presidency concerns===
After the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]], several tweets by Voice of America (one of which was later removed) seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary [[Sean Spicer]] about the crowd size and biased media coverage. This first raised concerns over possible attempts by Trump to politicize the state-funded agency.&lt;ref name=TrumpTV&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/26/voice-of-america-says-it-wont-become-trump-tv/ Voice of America says it won’t become Trump TV], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stamp&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-voice-america-234078 Trump moves to put his own stamp on Voice of America], ''Politico''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=megaphone&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-ol-voice-of-america-cold-war-bennett-20170215-htmlstory.html Can Donald Trump turn Voice of America into his own private megaphone?], ''LA Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon/01/24/2017"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2017/01/24/donald-trump-sends-two-aides-to-voice-of-america-studios-raising-fears-hes-going-to-politicize-the-outlet/ Donald Trump sends two aides to Voice of America studios, raising fears he’s going to politicize the outlet], ''Salon''&lt;/ref&gt; This amplified already growing [[propaganda]] concerns over the provisions in the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017]], signed into law by [[Barack Obama]], which replaced the board of the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] with a CEO appointed by the president and to allow the VOA to broadcast to American audiences. Trump sent two of his political aides, Matthew Ciepielowski and Matthew Schuck, to the agency to aid its current CEO in the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition to the Trump administration]]. Criticism was raised over Trump's choice of aides; Schuck was a staff writer for [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] website ''The Daily Surge'' until April 2015, while Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative advocacy group [[Americans for Prosperity]].&lt;ref name=TrumpTV/&gt; VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become "Trump TV".&lt;ref name=TrumpTV/&gt; BBG head John F. Lansing told [[NPR]] that it would be illegal for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast, while VOA director [[Amanda Bennett]] stressed that while "government-funded", the agency is not "government-run".&lt;ref name=megaphone/&gt;

===Guo Wengui interview===
On April 19, 2017, VOA interviewed the Chinese real estate tycoon [[Guo Wengui]] in a live broadcast. The whole interview was scheduled for 3 hours. After Guo Weigui alleged to own evidence of corruption among the members of [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|the Politburo Standing Committee of China]], the highest political authority of China, the interview was abruptly cut off, after only one hour and seventeen minutes of broadcasting. Guo's allegations involved Fu Zhenhua and Wang Qishan, the latter being a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the leader of the massive anti-graft movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://qz.com/968941/what-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-most-wanted-man/ China’s most wanted man is in the United States]. ''Quartz''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Beijing warned VOA's representatives not to interview Guo for his "unsubstantiated allegations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-interpol-notice-issued-billionaire-guo-wengui-095609234.html China says Interpol notice issued for outspoken tycoon Guo]. ''Associated Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Four members of the U.S. Congress requested the [[Office of Inspector General]] to conduct an investigation into this interruption on August 27, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbgwatch.com/bbgwatch/members-of-congress-request-oig-investigation-of-voa-and-bbg-handling-of-guo-wengui-interview-exclusive/ |title=Members of Congress request OIG investigation of VOA and BBG handling of Guo Wengui interview EXCLUSIVE |website=BBG Watch |date=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Weimar Republic''' ({{lang-de|Weimarer Republik}} {{IPA-de|ˈvaɪmaʁɐ ʁepuˈbliːk||De-WeimarRepublic.ogg}}) is an unofficial historical designation for the [[Germany|German state]] from 1918 to 1933. The name derives from the city of [[Weimar]], where its [[Constituent assembly|constitutional assembly]] first took place. The official name of the state remained ''[[Deutsches Reich]]'' unchanged from 1871. Although commonly translated as "German Empire", the word ''Reich'' here better translates as "realm",  in that the term does not in itself have monarchical connotations per se. In English, the country was usually known simply as Germany.

Germany became a ''de facto'' republic on 9 November 1918 when [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]], and became a ''de jure'' republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created. A [[Weimar National Assembly|national assembly]] was convened in Weimar, where [[Weimar constitution|a new constitution]] for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (with [[Weimar paramilitary groups|paramilitaries]]—both left- and right-wing) as well as contentious relationships with [[Allies of World War I|the victors]] of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Resentment in Germany towards the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed the Treaty and submitted to fulfill the terms of it. The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Sally, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918–1933'', St. Martin's, NY, 1976, pp.96–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Locarno Treaties]], Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims on France and Belgium, but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade German-speaking Austria to join Germany as one of Germany's states.

From 1930 onwards [[Paul von Hindenburg|President Hindenburg]] used [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency powers]] to back Chancellors [[Heinrich Brüning]], [[Franz von Papen]] and General [[Kurt von Schleicher]]. The [[Great Depression]], exacerbated by Brüning's policy of deflation, led to a surge in unemployment.&lt;ref name="Ursula Buettner 424"&gt;Büttner, Ursula ''Weimar: die überforderte Republik'', Klett-Cotta, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-608-94308-5}}, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Hindenburg appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor with the [[Nazi Party]] being part of a coalition government. The Nazis held two out of the remaining ten cabinet seats. Von Papen as Vice Chancellor was intended to be the "''[[éminence grise]]''" who would keep Hitler under control, using his close personal connection to Hindenburg. Within months, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] had brought about a state of emergency: it wiped out constitutional governance and civil liberties. Hitler's seizure of power (''[[Machtergreifung]]'') was permissive of government by decree without legislative participation. These events brought the republic to an end — as democracy collapsed, the founding of a single-party state began the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].

==Name==
The Weimar Republic is so called because [[Weimar National Assembly|the assembly]] that adopted its constitution met at Weimar, Germany from 6 February 1919 to 11 August 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639027/Weimar-Republic |title=Weimar Republic |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this name only became mainstream after 1933. Between 1919 and 1933 there was no single name for the new state that gained widespread acceptance, which is precisely why the old name {{lang|de|Deutsches Reich}} remained even though hardly anyone used it during the Weimar period.&lt;ref name=EvMaSchnurr&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eva-Maria Schnurr|title=Der Name des Feindes: Warum heißt der erste deutsche Demokratie eigentlich "Weimarer Republik?"|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|volume=5/2014|edition=Der Spiegel - Geschichte 3 Hausmitteilung 137 Impressum|page=20|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the right of the spectrum the politically engaged rejected the new democratic model and cringed to see the honour of the traditional word ''Reich'' associated with it.&lt;ref name=SebUlllautEMS&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[:de:Sebastian Ullrich (Historiker)|Sebastian Ullrich]] as quoted by Eva-Maria Schnurr|title=Der Name des Feindes: Warum heißt der erste deutsche Demokratie eigentlich "Weimarer Republik?"|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|volume=5/2014|edition=Der Spiegel - Geschichte 3 Hausmitteilung 137 Impressum|page=20|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Centre party, {{lang|de|Zentrum}} favoured the term {{lang|de|Deutscher Volksstaat}} ("German People's State") while on the moderate left [[Friedrich Ebert|the Chancellor's]] [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] preferred {{lang|de|Deutsche Republik}} ("German Republic").&lt;ref name=SebUlllautEMS/&gt; By 1925, {{lang|de|Deutsche Republik}} was used by most Germans, but for the anti-democratic right the word {{lang|de|Republik}} was, along with the relocation of the seat of power to Weimar, a painful reminder of a government structure that had been imposed by foreign statesmen, along with the expulsion of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] in the wake of massive national humiliation.&lt;ref name=SebUlllautEMS/&gt; The first recorded mention of the term {{lang|de|Republik von Weimar}} ("Republic of Weimar") came during a speech delivered by [[Adolf Hitler]] at a [[National Socialist German Worker's Party]] rally in Munich on 24 February 1929—it was a few weeks later that the term {{lang|de|Weimarer Republik}} was first used (again by Hitler) in a newspaper article.&lt;ref name=EvMaSchnurr/&gt; Only during the 1930s did the term become mainstream, both within and outside Germany.

According to historian [[Richard J. Evans]]:
:The continued use of the term 'German Empire', ''Deutsches Reich,'' by the Weimar Republic....conjured up an image among educated Germans that resonated far beyond the institutional structures Bismarck created: the successor to the Roman Empire; the vision of God's Empire here on earth;  the universality of its claim to suzerainty; and a more prosaic but no less powerful sense, the concept of a German state that would include all German speakers in central Europe--'one People, one Reich, one Leader', as the Nazi slogan was to put it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Evans|title=The Coming of the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmjBW3lsA84C&amp;pg=PT33|year=2005|publisher=Penguin|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of the republic, the flag and coat of arms of Germany were officially altered to reflect the political changes. The Weimar Republic retained the {{lang|de|[[Reichsadler]]}}, but without the symbols of the former Monarchy (Crown, Collar, Breast shield with the Prussian Arms). This left the black eagle with one head, facing to the right, with open wings but closed feathers, with a red beak, tongue and claws and white highlighting.
{{Quote|text=By reason of a decision of the Reich's Government I hereby announce, that the Imperial coat of arms on a gold-yellow shield shows the one headed black eagle, the head turned to the right, the wings open but with closed feathering, beak, tongue and claws in red color. If the Reich's Eagle is shown without a frame, the same charge and colors as those of the eagle of the Reich's coat of arms are to be used, but the tops of the feathers are directed outside. The patterns kept by the Federal Ministry of the Interior are decisive for the heraldic design. The artistic design may be varied for each special purpose.|sign=President Ebert; Minister of the Interior Koch|source=[http://www.documentarchiv.de/wr.html&amp;#124; ''Bekanntmachung betreffend das Reichswappen und den Reichsadler'' ("Announcement concerning the imperial coat of arms and the imperial eagle")], 11 November 1919}}The republican [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] is based on the flag that the [[Frankfurt Constitution|Paulskirche Constitution]] of 1849 introduced, which was decided upon by the [[Frankfurt National Assembly|German National Assembly]] in Frankfurt am Main, at the peak of the German civic movement that demanded parliamentary participation and unification of the German states.

The achievements and signs of this movement were mostly done away with after its downfall and the political reaction. Only the tiny German [[Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont]] upheld the tradition and continued to use the [[National colours of Germany|German colours]] called {{lang|de|[[Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]}} in German, ({{lang-en|[[Sable (heraldry)|Black]]-[[Gules|Red]]-[[Or (heraldry)|Gold]]}}) that had originated within a German-held state [[Principality of Reuss-Greiz|as early as 1778]].

These signs had remained symbols of the Paulskirche movement. Weimar wanted to express its origins in that political movement between 1849 and 1858; while anti-republicans opposed this flag. While the first German Confederal Navy ({{lang|de|[[Reichsflotte]]}}, 1848–1852) had proudly deployed a naval [[ensign]] based on {{lang|de|Schwarz-Rot-Gold}}, the Weimar republic navy, or {{lang|de|[[Reichsmarine]]}} (1918–1933) insisted on using the pre-1918 colours of the former {{lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}} (1871–1918), which were Black-White-Red, as did the German merchant marine.

The republicans took up the idea of the [[Coat of arms of Germany|German Coat of Arms]] established by the Paulskirche movement, using the same [[Heraldic animal|charge animal]], an eagle, in the same colours (black, red and gold), but modernising its form, including a reduction of the heads from two to one. [[Friedrich Ebert]] initially declared the official German coat of arms to be a design by [[Emil Doepler]] (shown in the first infobox above) as of 12 November 1919, following a decision of the German government.&lt;ref&gt;Jana Leichsenring, "Staatssymbole: Der Bundesadler", in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', [[Deutscher Bundestag]]—Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 83/08 (12 December 2008), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, however, the {{lang|de|Reichswappen}} (Reich coat of arms) designed by Tobias Schwab (1887–1967) in 1926 (or 1924&lt;ref&gt;According to sources of the German national football team Schwab created the emblem for the team in 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;) replaced it as the official emblem for the German Olympic team.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

After the dissolution of the army of the former German Empire, known as the [[German Army (German Empire)|''Deutsches Heer'' (simply "German Army") or the ''Reichsheer'']] (Army of the Realm) in 1918; Germany's military forces consisted of irregular paramilitaries, namely the various right-wing ''[[Freikorps]]'' ("Free Corps") groups composed of veterans from the war. The ''Freikorps'' units were formally disbanded in 1920 (although continued to exist in underground groups), and on 1 January 1921, a new ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (figuratively; ''Defence of the realm'') was created.

The Treaty of Versailles limited the size of the ''Reichswehr'' to 100,000 soldiers (consisting of seven infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions), 10 armoured cars and a navy (the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'') restricted to 36 ships in active service. No aircraft of any kind was allowed. The main advantage of this limitation, however, was that the ''Reichswehr'' could afford to pick the best recruits for service. However, with inefficient armour and no air support, the ''Reichswehr'' would have had limited combat abilities.
Privates were mainly recruited from the countryside, as it was believed that young men from cities were prone to socialist behaviour, which would fray the loyalty of the privates to their conservative officers.

Although technically in service of the republic, the army was predominantly officered by conservative reactionaries who were sympathetic to right-wing organisations. [[Hans von Seeckt]], the head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', declared that the army was not loyal to the democratic republic, and would only defend it if it were in their interests. During the [[Kapp Putsch]] for example, the army refused to fire upon the rebels. However, as right wing as the army was, it was reluctant to assist the Nazis, whom they mostly viewed as thugs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] was the ''Reichswehr's'' main opponent throughout its existence, as they saw them as a threat to their existence,{{dubious|date=August 2014}} and the army fired at them during the [[Beerhall Putsch]]. Upon the establishment{{dubious|reason=SS was "established" in 1920|date=August 2014}} of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], the ''Reichswehr'' took a softer line about the Nazis, since the SS seemed more respectable, and openly favoured order over anarchy. In 1935, two years after Hitler came to power, the ''Reichswehr'' was renamed the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.

==History==

===November Revolution (1918–1919)===
{{main|German Revolution of 1918–1919}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-067-10A, Matrosen-Aufstand.jpg|thumb|The rebellion, November 1918]]

In October 1918, the constitution of the German Empire was reformed to give more powers to the elected parliament. On 29 October, [[Kiel mutiny|rebellion]] broke out in [[Kiel]] among sailors. There, sailors, soldiers, and workers began electing [[Workers' and Soldiers' Council]]s (''Arbeiter und Soldatenräte'') modeled after the [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]s of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The revolution spread throughout Germany, and participants seized military and civil powers in individual cities. The power takeover was achieved everywhere without loss of life.

At the time, the Socialist movement which represented mostly laborers was split among two major left-wing parties: the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), which called for immediate peace [[negotiations]] and favored a soviet-style command economy, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) also known as "Majority" Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), which supported the war effort and favoured a [[parliamentary system]]. The rebellion caused great fear in the establishment and in the middle classes because of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet]]-style aspirations of the councils. To centrist and conservative citizens, the country looked to be on the verge of a communist revolution.

By 7 November, the revolution had reached [[Munich]], resulting in King [[Ludwig III of Bavaria]] fleeing. The MSPD decided to make use of their support at the grassroots and put themselves at the front of the movement, demanding that Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] abdicate. When he refused, [[Prince Max of Baden]] simply announced that he had done so and frantically attempted to establish a [[Regent|regency]] under another member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. [[Gustav Noske]], a self-appointed military expert in the MSPD, was sent to Kiel to prevent any further unrest and took on the task of controlling the mutinous sailors and their supporters in the Kiel barracks. The sailors and soldiers, inexperienced in matters of revolutionary combat, welcomed him as an experienced politician and allowed him to negotiate a settlement, thus defusing the initial anger of the revolutionaries in uniform.

On 9 November 1918, the "German Republic" was proclaimed by MSPD member [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|''Reichstag'' building]] in Berlin, to the fury of [[Friedrich Ebert]], the leader of the MSPD, who thought that the question of monarchy or republic should be answered by a national assembly. Two hours later, a "Free Socialist Republic" was proclaimed, {{convert |2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, at the ''[[Berliner Stadtschloss]]''. The proclamation was issued by [[Karl Liebknecht]], co-leader (with [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) of the communist [[Spartakusbund]] (Spartacist League), a group of a few hundred supporters of the Russian revolution that had allied itself with the USPD in 1917. In a legally questionable act, Imperial Chancellor (''Reichskanzler'') Prince Max of Baden transferred his powers to Friedrich Ebert, who, shattered by the monarchy's fall, reluctantly accepted. In view of the mass support for more radical reforms among the workers' councils, a [[coalition]] government called "[[Council of the People's Deputies]]" (''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'') was established, consisting of three MSPD and three USPD members. Led by Ebert for the MSPD and [[Hugo Haase]] for the USPD it sought to act as a provisional cabinet of ministers. But the power question was unanswered. Although the new government was confirmed by the Berlin worker and soldier council, it was opposed by the [[Spartacist League]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P011502, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] addresses a crowd from a window of the [[Reich Chancellery]], 9 November 1918]]

The Executive Council of the Workers’ and Soldiers’ Councils, a coalition that included Majority Socialists, Independent Socialists, workers, and soldiers, implemented a programme of progressive social change, introducing reforms such as the eight-hour workday, the releasing of political prisoners, the abolition of press censorship, increases in workers’ old-age, sick and unemployment benefits, and the bestowing upon labour the unrestricted right to organise into unions.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler by John Toland&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other reforms were carried out in Germany during the revolutionary period. It was made harder for estates to sack workers and prevent them from leaving when they wanted to; under the Provisional Act for Agricultural Labour of 23 November 1918 the normal period of notice for management, and for most resident labourers, was set at six weeks. In addition, a supplementary directive of December 1918 specified that female (and child) workers were entitled to a fifteen-minute break if they worked between four and six hours, thirty minutes for workdays lasting six to eight hours, and one hour for longer days.&lt;ref&gt;ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1091&amp;context=law_pubs&lt;/ref&gt; A decree on 23 December 1918 established committees (composed of workers' representatives "in their relation to the employer") to safeguard the rights of workers. The right to bargain collectively was also established, while it was made obligatory "to elect workers’ committees on estates and establish conciliation committees". A decree on 3 February 1919 removed the right of employers to acquire exemption for domestic servants and agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;Farm labor in Germany, 1810-1945; its historical development within the framework of agricultural and social policy by Frieda Wunderlich&lt;/ref&gt;

With the ''Verordnung'' of 3 February 1919, the Ebert government reintroduced the original structure of the health insurance boards according to an 1883 law, with one-third employers and two-thirds members (i.e. workers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64U_dlAI6g0C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Germany+compulsory+health+insurance+february+1919&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3emEU7eIJ4OuyASlg4KIBg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Germany%20compulsory%20health%20insurance%20february%201919&amp;f=false|title=Two Centuries of Solidarity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 28 June 1919 health insurance committees became elected by workers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCYCYfHdBFQC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=germany+law+1918+unfair+dismissal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KtNzU5GEOu_X7AaByIHIBQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=germany%20law%201918%20unfair%20dismissal&amp;f=false|title=Social Relations in the Estate Villages of Mecklenburg C.1880-1924|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Order of January 1919 concerning agricultural labour conditions fixed 2,900 hours as a maximum per year, distributed as eight, ten, and eleven hours per day in four-monthly periods.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial and Labour Information, Volume 20, International Labour Office, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; A code of January 1919 bestowed upon land-labourers the same legal rights that industrial workers enjoyed, while a bill ratified that same year obliged the States to set up agricultural settlement associations which, as noted by [[Volker Berghahn]], "were endowed with the priority right of purchase of farms beyond a specified size".&lt;ref&gt;Modern Germany: society, economy and politics in the twentieth century by Volker R. Berghahn&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, undemocratic public institutions were abolished, involving, as noted by one writer, the disappearance "of the Prussian Upper House, the former Prussian Lower House that had been elected in accordance with the three-class suffrage, and the municipal councils that were also elected on the class vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/rosenberg/history-weimar/ch02.htm|title=A History of the German Republic by Arthur Rosenberg 1936|author=Arthur Rosenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November, [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|an armistice was signed at Compiègne]] by German representatives. It effectively ended military operations between the Allies and Germany. It amounted to German capitulation, without any concessions by the Allies; the naval blockade would continue until complete peace terms were agreed.

A rift developed between the MSPD and USPD after Ebert called upon the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|OHL]] (Supreme Army Command) for troops to put down a [[Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss|mutiny]] by a leftist military unit on 23/24 December 1918, in which members of the ''Volksmarinedivision'' (People's Army Division) had captured the city's garrison commander [[Otto Wels]] and occupied the ''Reichskanzlei'' (Reich Chancellery) where the "Council of the People's Deputies" was situated. The ensuing street fighting left several dead and injured on both sides. The USPD leaders were outraged by what they believed was treachery by the MSPD, which, in their view, had joined with the anti-communist military to suppress the revolution. Thus, the USPD left the "Council of the People's Deputies" after only seven weeks. On 30 December, the split deepened when the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was formed out of a number of radical left-wing groups, including the left wing of the USPD and the "[[Spartacist League]]" group.

From November 1918 to January 1919, Germany was governed by the "Council of the People's Deputies", under the leadership of Ebert and Haase. The Council issued a large number of decrees that radically shifted German policies. It introduced the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], domestic labour reform, works councils, agricultural labour reform, right of civil-service associations, local municipality social welfare relief (split between ''Reich'' and States) and important national health insurance, re-instatement of demobilised workers, protection from arbitrary dismissal with appeal as a right, regulated wage agreement, and universal suffrage from 20 years of age in all types of elections—local and national. Ebert called for a "National Congress of Councils" (''Reichsrätekongress''), which took place from 16 to 20 December 1918, and in which the MSPD had the majority. Thus, Ebert was able to institute elections for a provisional National Assembly that would be given the task of writing a democratic constitution for parliamentary government, marginalizing the movement that called for a socialist republic.

To ensure his fledgling government maintained control over the country, Ebert made an agreement with the OHL, now led by Ludendorff's successor General [[Wilhelm Groener]]. The '[[Ebert–Groener pact]]' stipulated that the government would not attempt to reform the army so long as the army swore to protect the state. On the one hand, this agreement symbolised the acceptance of the new government by the military, assuaging concern among the middle classes; on the other hand, it was thought contrary to working-class interests by left wing social democrats and communists, and was also opposed by the far right who believed democracy would make Germany weaker. The new ''Reichswehr'' armed forces, limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to 100,000 army soldiers and 15,000 sailors, remained fully under the control of the German [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] class, despite their nominal re-organisation.

In January, the Spartacist League and others in the streets of Berlin made more armed attempts to establish communism, known as the [[Spartacist uprising]]. Those attempts were put down by paramilitary ''[[Freikorps]]'' units consisting of volunteer soldiers. Bloody street fights culminated in the beating and shooting deaths of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] after their arrests on 15 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vlzg_5WteHoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=William+Pelz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT_KmYguLYAhUJR6wKHSK2CSUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Pelz&amp;f=false|title=Against Capitalism: The European Left on the March|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], New York|author=William A. Pelz|pages=116–118|date=2007|ISBN=978-0-8204-6776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the affirmation of Ebert, those responsible were not tried before a [[court martial]], leading to lenient sentences, which made Ebert unpopular among radical leftists.

[[File:Offizielle Postkarte Weimarer Nationalkversammlung.jpg|thumb|left|Official postcard of the [[Weimar National Assembly|National Assembly]]]]
The National Assembly elections took place on 19 January 1919. In this time, the radical left-wing parties, including the USPD and KPD, were barely able to get themselves organised, leading to a solid majority of seats for the MSPD moderate forces. To avoid the ongoing fights in Berlin, the National Assembly convened in the city of [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]], giving the future Republic its unofficial name. The [[Weimar Constitution]] created a republic under a [[parliamentary republic|parliamentary republic system]] with the ''Reichstag'' elected by [[proportional representation]]. The democratic parties obtained a solid 80% of the vote.

During the debates in Weimar, fighting continued. A [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Soviet republic]] was declared in [[Munich]], but was quickly put down by ''Freikorps'' and remnants of the regular army. The fall of the [[Munich Soviet Republic]] to these units, many of which were situated on the extreme right, resulted in the growth of far-right movements and organisations in [[Bavaria]], including [[Organisation Consul]], the [[Nazi Party]], and societies of exiled Russian Monarchists. Sporadic fighting continued to flare up around the country. In eastern provinces, forces loyal to Germany's fallen Monarchy fought the republic, while militias of Polish nationalists fought for independence: [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Great Poland Uprising]] in [[Provinz Posen]] and three [[Silesian Uprisings]] in [[Upper Silesia]].

Germany lost the war because the country ran out of allies and its economic resources were running out; support among the population began to crumble in 1916 and by mid-1918 there was support for the war only among the die-hard monarchists and conservatives. The decisive blow came with the entry of the United States into the conflict, which made its vast industrial resources available to the beleaguered Allies. By late summer 1918 the German reserves were exhausted while fresh American troops arrived in France at the rate of 10,000 a day. Retreat and defeat were at hand, and the Army told the Kaiser to abdicate for it could no longer support him. Although in retreat, the German armies were still on French and Belgian territory when the war ended on 11 November. Ludendorf and Hindenburg soon proclaimed that it was the defeatism of the civilian population that had made defeat inevitable. The die-hard nationalists then blamed the civilians for betraying the army and the surrender. This was the "[[stab-in-the-back myth]]" that was unceasingly propagated by the right in the 1920s and ensured that many monarchists and conservatives would refuse to support the government of what they called the "November criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Wilhelm |last=Diest |first2=E.

===Years of crisis (1919–1923)===

====Burden from the First World War====
In the first four years following the First World War, the situation for German civilians remained dire. The severe food shortages improved little to none up until 1923. Many German civilians expected life to return to prewar normalcy following the removal of the naval blockade in June 1919. Instead, the struggles induced by the First World War persisted for the decade following. Throughout the war German officials made rash decisions to combat the growing hunger of the nation, most of which were highly unsuccessful. Examples include the nationwide pig slaughter, [[Schweinemord]], in 1915.  The German government's rationale behind exterminating the population of swine in Germany was to decrease the use of potatoes and turnips for animal consumption, transitioning all foods toward human consumption.  In 1922, now three years after the German signing of the Treaty of Versailles, meat consumption in the country had not increased since the war era. 22&amp;nbsp;kg per person per year was still less than half of the 52&amp;nbsp;kg statistic in 1913, before the onset of the war.  German citizens felt the food shortages even deeper than during the war, because the reality of the nation contrasted so significantly from their expectations of a postwar nation. The burdens of World War I saw little improvement in the immediate years following, and with the onset of the Treaty of Versailles, coupled by mass inflation, Germany still remained in a crisis. The continuity of pain introduced the Weimar authority in a negative light, having public opinion being one of the main sources behind its failure.&lt;ref&gt;Heinzelmann, Ursula. Beyond Bratwurst: A History of Food in Germany. London: Reaktion Books, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Treaty of Versailles=====
{{main|Treaty of Versailles}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

{{legend|#f6d3a9|Weimar Germany}}]]

The growing post-war economic crisis was a result of lost pre-war industrial exports, the loss of supplies in raw materials and foodstuffs due to the continental blockade, the loss of the colonies, and worsening debt balances, exacerbated by an exorbitant issue of promissory notes raising money to pay for the war. Military-industrial activity had almost ceased, although controlled demobilisation kept unemployment at around one million. In part, the economic losses can also be attributed to the Allied blockade of Germany until the Treaty of Versailles.

The Allies permitted only low import levels of goods that most Germans could not afford.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} After four years of war and famine, many German workers were exhausted, physically impaired and discouraged. Millions were disenchanted with capitalism and hoping for a new era. Meanwhile, the currency depreciated, and would continue to depreciate following the French invasion of the Ruhr.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The German peace delegation in France signed the Treaty of Versailles, accepting mass reductions of the German military, the prospect of substantial war reparations payments to the victorious allies, and the controversial "[[War Guilt Clause]]". Explaining the rise of extreme nationalist movements in Germany shortly after the war, British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] points to the "national disgrace" that was "felt throughout Germany at the humiliating terms imposed by the victorious Allies and reflected in the Versailles Treaty...with its confiscation of territory on the eastern border and even more so its 'guilt clause'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV-N10gyoFwC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] repeatedly blamed the republic and its democracy for accepting the oppressive terms of this treaty. The Republic's first ''[[Reichspräsident]]'' ("Reich President"), [[Friedrich Ebert]] of the SPD, signed the new German constitution into law on 11 August 1919.

The new post-World War I Germany, stripped of all colonies, became 13.3% smaller in its European territory than its imperial predecessor. Of these losses, a large proportion consisted of provinces that were originally Polish, and Alsace-Lorraine, seized by Germany in 1870, where Germans constituted only part or a minority of local populations despite nationalist outrage at the fragmentation of Germany.

=====Allied Rhineland occupation=====
{{main|Allied occupation of the Rhineland}}

The occupation of the [[Rhineland]] took place following the [[Armistice with Germany]] of 11 November 1918. The occupying armies consisted of [[National Army (USA)|American]], [[Belgian Army|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]] and [[French Army|French]] forces.

In 1920, under massive French pressure, the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was separated from the Rhine Province and administered by the [[League of Nations]] until a plebiscite in 1935, when the region was returned to the ''Deutsches Reich''. At the same time, in 1920, the districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were transferred to [[Belgium]] (see [[German-Speaking Community of Belgium]]). Shortly after, France completely occupied the Rhineland, strictly controlling all important industrial areas.

=====Reparations=====
The actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 billion marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in "C bonds" were entirely chimerical—a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion [[German gold mark]]s, worth about $5 billion US dollars or £1 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods such as coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicised rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US Treasury received $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Marks, "The Myths of Reparations", ''Central European History'' (1978) 11#3 pp 231-55 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545835 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Hyperinflation=====
{{further|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}
In the early post-war years, inflation was growing at an alarming rate, but the government simply printed more currency to pay debts. By 1923, the Republic claimed it could no longer afford the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments required by the Versailles Treaty, and the government defaulted on some payments. In response, French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr region]], Germany's most productive industrial region at the time, taking control of most mining and manufacturing companies in January 1923. Strikes were called, and passive resistance was encouraged. These strikes lasted eight months, further damaging both the economy and society.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

The strike prevented some goods from being produced, but one industrialist, [[Hugo Stinnes]], was able to create a vast empire out of bankrupt companies. Because the production costs in Germany were falling almost hourly, the prices for German products were unbeatable. Stinnes made sure that he was paid in dollars, which meant that by mid-1923, his industrial empire was worth more than the entire German economy. By the end of the year, over two hundred factories were working full-time to produce paper for the spiralling bank note production. Stinnes' empire collapsed when the government-sponsored inflation was stopped in November 1923.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1919, one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by 1923, the same loaf of bread cost 100 billion marks.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00193, Inflation, Ein-Millionen-Markschein.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|One-million mark notes used as notepaper, October 1923]]
Since striking workers were paid benefits by the state, much additional currency was printed, fuelling a period of [[hyperinflation]]. The [[1920s German inflation]] started when Germany had no goods to trade. The government printed money to deal with the crisis; this meant payments within Germany were made with worthless paper money, and helped formerly great industrialists to pay back their own loans. This also led to pay raises for workers and for businessmen who wanted to profit from it. Circulation of money rocketed, and soon banknotes were being overprinted to a thousand times their nominal value and every town produced its own promissory notes; many banks and industrial firms did the same.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

The value of the ''[[German papiermark|Papiermark]]'' had declined from 4.2 Marks per U.S. dollar in 1914 to one million per dollar by August 1923. This led to further criticism of the Republic. On 15 November 1923, a new currency, the ''[[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]'', was introduced at the rate of one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (1,000,000,000,000) ''Papiermark'' for one ''Rentenmark'', an action known as [[redenomination]]. At that time, one U.S. dollar was equal to 4.2 ''Rentenmark''. Reparation payments were resumed, and the Ruhr was returned to Germany under the [[Locarno Treaties]], which defined the borders between Germany, France, and Belgium.

====Political turmoil====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:50 millionen mark 1 september 1923.jpg|thumb|right|A 50 million mark banknote issued in 1923, worth approximately one U.S. dollar when issued, would have been worth approximately 12 million U.S. dollars nine years earlier, but within a few weeks inflation made the banknote practically worthless]]

The Republic was soon under attack from both [[Left-wing politics|left-]] and [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] sources. The radical left accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers' movement by preventing a communist revolution and sought to overthrow the Republic and do so themselves. Various right-wing sources opposed any democratic system, preferring an authoritarian, autocratic state like the 1871 Empire. To further undermine the Republic's credibility, some right-wingers (especially certain members of the former [[officer corps]]) also blamed an [[Stab-in-the-back myth|alleged conspiracy]] of Socialists and Jews for Germany's defeat in World War I.

In the next five years, the central government, assured of the support of the Reichswehr, dealt severely with the occasional outbreaks of violence in Germany's large cities. The left claimed that the Social Democrats had betrayed the ideals of the revolution, while the army and the government-financed ''Freikorps'' committed hundreds of acts of gratuitous violence against striking workers.

The first challenge to the Weimar Republic came when a group of communists and anarchists took over the [[Bavaria]]n government in [[Munich]] and declared the creation of the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. The uprising was brutally attacked by ''[[Freikorps]]'', which consisted mainly of ex-soldiers dismissed from the army and who were well-paid to put down forces of the Far Left. The ''Freikorps'' was an army outside the control of the government, but they were in close contact with their allies in the Reichswehr.

On 13 March 1920 during the [[Kapp Putsch]], 12,000 ''Freikorps'' soldiers occupied Berlin and installed [[Wolfgang Kapp]], a right-wing journalist, as chancellor. The national government fled to [[Stuttgart]] and called for a [[general strike]] against the putsch. The strike meant that no "official" pronouncements could be published, and with the civil service out on strike, the Kapp government collapsed after only four days on 17 March.

Inspired by the general strikes, a workers' [[Ruhr Uprising|uprising]] began in the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr region]] when 50,000 people formed a "Red Army" and took control of the province. The regular army and the ''Freikorps'' ended the uprising on their own authority. The rebels were campaigning for an extension of the plans to nationalise major industries and supported the national government, but the SPD leaders did not want to lend support to the growing USPD, who favoured the establishment of a socialist regime. The repression of an uprising of SPD supporters by the reactionary forces in the ''Freikorps'' on the instructions of the SPD ministers was to become a major source of conflict within the socialist movement and thus contributed to the weakening of the only group that could have withstood the National Socialist movement. Other rebellions were put down in March 1921 in [[Saxony]] and [[Hamburg]].

In 1922, Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]] with the Soviet Union, which allowed Germany to train military personnel in exchange for giving Russia military technology. This was against the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which limited Germany to 100,000 soldiers and no conscription, naval forces of 15,000 men, twelve destroyers, six battleships, and six cruisers, no [[submarine]]s or aircraft. However, Russia had pulled out of World War I against the Germans as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, and was excluded from the [[League of Nations]]. Thus, Germany seized the chance to make an ally. [[Walther Rathenau]], the Jewish [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] who signed the treaty, was assassinated two months later by two ultra-nationalist army officers.

Further pressure from the political right came in 1923 with the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], also called the Munich Putsch, staged by the [[Nazi Party]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] in Munich. In 1920, the [[German Workers' Party]] had become the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), or [[Nazi party]], and would become a driving force in the collapse of Weimar. Hitler named himself as chairman of the party in July 1921. On 8 November 1923, the ''[[Kampfbund]]'', in a pact with [[Erich Ludendorff]], took over a meeting by Bavarian prime minister [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]] at a beer hall in Munich.

Ludendorff and Hitler declared that the Weimar government was deposed and that they were planning to take control of Munich the following day. The 3,000 rebels were thwarted by the Bavarian authorities. Hitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for high [[treason]], a minimum sentence for the charge. Hitler served less than eight months in a comfortable cell, receiving a daily stream of visitors before his release on 20 December 1924. While in jail, Hitler dictated ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which laid out his ideas and future policies. Hitler now decided to focus on legal methods of gaining power.

===Golden Era (1924–1929)===
[[Gustav Stresemann]] was ''[[Chancellor of Germany|Reichskanzler]]'' for 100 days in 1923, and served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|foreign minister]] from 1923–1929, a period of relative stability for the Weimar Republic, known in Germany as ''Goldene Zwanziger'' ("[[Golden Twenties]]"). Prominent features of this period were a growing economy and a consequent decrease in civil unrest.

Once civil stability had been restored, Stresemann began stabilising the German currency, which promoted confidence in the German economy and helped the recovery that was so ardently needed for the German nation to keep up with their reparation repayments, while at the same time feeding and supplying the nation.

Once the economic situation had stabilised, Stresemann could begin putting a permanent currency in place, called the ''[[Rentenmark]]'' (October 1923), which again contributed to the growing level of international confidence in the German economy.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00231, Radioansprache von Kanzler Wilhelm Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Marx]]'s Christmas broadcast, December 1923]]
To help Germany meet reparation obligations, the [[Dawes Plan]] was created in 1924. This was an agreement between American banks and the German government in which the American banks lent money to German banks with German assets as collateral to help it pay reparations. The German railways, the National Bank and many industries were therefore mortgaged as securities for the stable currency and the loans.&lt;ref name=Kitchen-241&gt;Kitchen, ''Illustrated History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded it formal (''de jure'') recognition, and the two mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.  In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Elz, "Foreign policy" in Anthony McElligott, ed.,  ''Weimar Germany'' (2009)  pp. 50–77&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany signed arbitration conventions with France and Belgium and arbitration treaties with Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]], undertaking to refer any future disputes to an arbitration tribunal or to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].  Other foreign achievements were the evacuation of foreign troops from the Ruhr in 1925. In 1926, Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as a permanent member, improving her international standing and giving the right to vote on League matters.

Overall trade increased and unemployment fell. Stresemann's reforms did not relieve the underlying weaknesses of Weimar but gave the appearance of a stable democracy. Even Stresemann's 'German People's party' failed to gain nationwide recognition, and instead featured in the 'flip-flop' coalitions. The Grand Coalition headed by Muller inspired some faith in the government, but that didn't last. Governments frequently lasted only a year, much like the situation in 1940's France. The major weakness in constitutional terms was the inherent instability of the coalitions. The growing dependence on American finance was to prove fleeting, and Germany was one of the worst hit nations in the [[Great Depression]].

===Culture===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0623-0502-001, Berlin, Tanztee im "Esplanade".jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The "[[Golden Twenties]]" in Berlin: a jazz band plays for a tea dance at the hotel Esplanade, 1926]]
The 1920s saw a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany. During the worst phase of hyperinflation in 1923, the clubs and bars were full of speculators who spent their daily profits so they would not lose the value the following day. Berlin intellectuals responded by condemning the excesses of capitalism, and demanding revolutionary changes on the cultural scenery. Influenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema, theatre and musical works entered a phase of great creativity. Innovative street theatre brought plays to the public, and the [[cabaret]] scene and jazz band became very popular. According to the cliché, modern young women were Americanized, wearing makeup, short hair, smoking and breaking with traditional [[mores]]. The euphoria surrounding [[Josephine Baker]] in the metropolis of Berlin for instance, where she was declared an "erotic [[goddess]]" and in many ways admired and respected, kindled further "ultramodern" sensations in the minds of the German public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Josephine Baker in Berlin |url=http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=440 |work=Cabaret Berlin – Exploring the entertainment of the Weimar era |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art and a new type of architecture taught at "[[Bauhaus]]" schools reflected the new ideas of the time, with artists such as [[George Grosz]] being fined for defaming the military and for [[blasphemy]].

Artists in Berlin were influenced by other contemporary progressive cultural movements, such as the Impressionist and Expressionist painters in Paris, as well as the Cubists. Likewise, American progressive architects were admired. Many of the new buildings built during this era followed a straight-lined, geometrical style. Examples of the new architecture include the [[Bauhaus Dessau Foundation|Bauhaus Building]] by [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]], [[Großes Schauspielhaus|Grosses Schauspielhaus]], and the [[Einstein Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Delmer |first=Sefton |title=Weimar Germany: Democracy on Trial |year=1972 |publisher=Macdonald |location=London| pages=82–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone, however, was happy with the changes taking place in [[Weimar culture]]. Conservatives and reactionaries feared that Germany was betraying its traditional values by adopting popular styles from abroad, particularly those Hollywood was popularizing in American films, while New York became the global capital of fashion. Germany was more susceptible to Americanization, because of the close economic links brought about by the Dawes plan.

In 1929, three years after receiving the 1926 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], Stresemann died of a heart attack at age 51. When the New York Stock Exchange crashed in October, 1929, American loans dried up and the sharp decline of the German economy brought the "Golden Twenties" to an abrupt end.

===Social policy under Weimar===
A wide range of progressive social reforms were carried out during and after the revolutionary period. In 1919, legislation provided for a maximum working 48-hour workweek, restrictions on night work, a half-holiday on Saturday, and a break of thirty-six hours of continuous rest during the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/labourundernazir033210mbp/labourundernazir033210mbp_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Labour Under Nazi Rule"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, health insurance was extended to wives and daughters without their own income, people only partially capable of gainful employment, people employed in private cooperatives, and people employed in public cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ministerial-leadership.org"&gt;http://www.ministerial-leadership.org/sites/default/files/resources_and_tools/10%20german%20health%20insu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A series of progressive tax reforms were introduced under the auspices of Matthias Erzberger, including increases in taxes on capital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5x5Cu4zuaoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=erzberger+tax+reforms#v=onepage&amp;q=erzberger%20tax%20reforms&amp;f=false|title=Dying of Money|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in the highest income tax rate from 4% to 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hHIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=erzberger+inheritance+tax+1919#v=onepage&amp;q=erzberger%20inheritance%20tax%201919&amp;f=false|title=Decoding Modern Consumer Societies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a governmental decree of 3 February 1919, the German government met the demand of the veterans' associations that all aid for the disabled and their dependents be taken over by the central government&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Care for Cripples, Volume 8, Douglas C. McMurtrie, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; (thus assuming responsibility for this assistance) and extended into peacetime the nationwide network of state and district welfare bureaus that had been set up during the war to coordinate social services for war widows and orphans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMpmnE0ZFpQC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=germany+decree+of+February+8+1919+veterans#v=onepage&amp;q=germany%20decree%20of%20February%208%201919%20veterans&amp;f=false|title=Welfare, Modernity, and the Weimar State, 1919-1933|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Youth Welfare Act of 1922 obliged all municipalities and states to set up youth offices in charge of child protection, and also codified a right to education for all children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_pPBJWaRqKoC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Weimar+Republic+youth+welfare+act+1922#v=onepage&amp;q=Weimar%20Republic%20youth%20welfare%20act%201922&amp;f=false|title=The Provision of Public Services in Europe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while laws were passed to regulate rents and increase protection for tenants in 1922 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GaWtd5zJfB8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=weimar+republic+tenant+protection+1923#v=onepage&amp;q=weimar%20republic%20tenant%20protection%201923&amp;f=false|title=Growth to Limits: Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health insurance coverage was extended to other categories of the population during the existence of the Weimar Republic, including seamen, people employed in the educational and social welfare sectors, and all primary dependents.&lt;ref name="ministerial-leadership.org"/&gt; Various improvements were also made in unemployment benefits, although in June 1920 the maximum amount of unemployment benefit that a family of four could receive in Berlin, 90 marks, was well below the minimum cost of subsistence of 304 marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zH-I31gx7MMC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=germany+winter+grant+unemployed+1919#v=onepage&amp;q=germany%20winter%20grant%20unemployed%201919&amp;f=false|title=The Great Disorder|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, unemployment relief was consolidated into a regular programme of assistance following economic problems that year. In 1924, a modern public assistance programme was introduced, and in 1925 the accident insurance programme was reformed, allowing diseases that were linked to certain kinds of work to become insurable risks. In addition, a national unemployment insurance programme was introduced in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;AQA History: The Development of Germany, 1871–1925 by Sally Waller&lt;/ref&gt; Housing construction was also greatly accelerated during the Weimar period, with over 2 million new homes constructed between 1924 and 1931 and a further 195,000 modernised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=weimar+republic+2+million+homes+built+195,000+modernised#v=onepage&amp;q=weimar%20republic%202%20million%20homes%20built%20195%2C000%20modernised&amp;f=false|title=The Weimar Republic 1919-1933|author=Ruth Henig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the onset of the [[Great Depression in the United States|depression in the United States of America]] produced a severe shockwave in Germany. The economy was supported by the granting of loans through the [[Dawes Plan]] (1924) and the [[Young Plan]] (1929). When American banks withdrew their loans to German companies, the onset of severe unemployment could not be stopped by conventional economic measures. Unemployment grew rapidly, at 4 million in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/GERunemployment.htm|title=Unemployment in Nazi Germany|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 1930 a political earthquake shook the republic to its foundations. The [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) entered the Reichstag with 19% of the popular vote and made the fragile coalition system by which every chancellor had governed unworkable. The last years of the Weimar Republic were stamped by even more political instability than in the previous years. The administrations of Chancellors [[Heinrich Brüning|Brüning]], [[Franz von Papen|Papen]], [[Kurt von Schleicher|Schleicher]] and, from 30 January to 23 March 1933, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] governed through [[Decree|presidential decree]] rather than through [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliamentary]] consultation.

====Brüning's policy of deflation (1930–1932)====
On 29 March 1930, after months of lobbying by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] on behalf of the military, the finance expert [[Heinrich Brüning]] was appointed as Müller's successor by ''[[President of Germany (1919–1945)|Reichspräsident]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. The new government was expected to lead a political shift towards [[conservatism]].

As Brüning had no majority support in the ''Reichstag'', he became, through the use of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|the emergency powers granted to the ''Reichspräsident'' (Article 48)]] by [[Weimar Constitution|the constitution]], the first Weimar chancellor to operate independently of parliament. This made him dependent on the ''Reichspräsident'', Hindenburg.&lt;ref name="ThomasAdam"&gt;Thomas Adam, ''Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'', 2005, {{ISBN|1-85109-633-7}}, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; After a bill to reform the Reich's finances was opposed by the ''Reichstag'', it was made an emergency [[decree]] by Hindenburg. On 18 July, as a result of opposition from the SPD, [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]], [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] and the small contingent of [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] members, the ''Reichstag'' again rejected the bill by a slim margin. Immediately afterward, Brüning submitted the president's decree that the ''Reichstag'' be dissolved. The consequent [[German federal election, 1930|general election on 14 September]] resulted in an enormous political shift within the ''Reichstag'': 18.3% of the vote went to the NSDAP, five times the percentage won in 1928. As a result, it was no longer possible to form a pro-republican majority, not even with a [[grand coalition]] that excluded the KPD, DNVP and NSDAP. This encouraged an escalation in the number of public demonstrations and instances of paramilitary violence organised by the NSDAP.

Between 1930 and 1932, Brüning tried to reform the Weimar Republic without a parliamentary majority, governing, when necessary, through the President's emergency decrees. In line with the contemporary economic theory (subsequently termed "[[Causes of the Great Depression#Leave-it-alone liquidationism .281929.E2.80.9333.29|leave-it-alone liquidationism]]"), he enacted a draconian policy of [[deflation]] and [[Austerity|drastically cutting state expenditure]].&lt;ref name="ThomasAdam" /&gt; Among other measures, he completely halted all public grants to the obligatory unemployment insurance introduced in 1927, resulting in workers making higher contributions and fewer benefits for the unemployed. Benefits for the sick, invalid and pensioners were also reduced sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz-Helmut Wisch, Paul Martin and Marianne Martinson, ''European problems and Social Policies'', Frank &amp; Timme, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3865960313}}, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Additional difficulties were caused by the different deflationary policies pursued by Brüning and the ''[[Reichsbank]]'', Germany's [[central bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Georg Backhaus, ''The Beginnings of Scholarly Economic Journalism'', Springer 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-0078-3}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1931, the [[United Kingdom]] abandoned the [[gold standard]] and about 30 countries (the [[sterling bloc]]) [[Currency war#Currency War in the Great Depression|devalued their currencies]],&lt;ref name="Ursula Buettner 451"&gt;Ursula Büttner, Weimar: die überforderte Republik, Klett-Cotta, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-608-94308-5}}, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; making their goods around 20% cheaper than those produced by Germany.{{clarify|date=August 2018}} As the [[Young Plan]] did not allow a devaluation of the ''[[Reichsmark]]'', Brüning triggered a deflationary [[internal devaluation]] by forcing the economy to reduce prices, rents, salaries and wages by 20%.&lt;ref name="Ursula Buettner 424"/&gt; Debate continues as to whether this policy was without alternative: some argue that the Allies would not in any circumstances have allowed a devaluation of the ''Reichsmark'', while others point to the [[Hoover Moratorium]] as a sign that the Allies understood that the situation had changed fundamentally and further German reparation payments were impossible. &lt;!--They explain that contemporary economists like [[Joseph Schumpeter]] thought that deflation was a painful healing process.--&gt; Brüning expected that the policy of deflation would temporarily worsen the economic situation before it began to improve, quickly increasing the German economy's competitiveness and then restoring its creditworthiness. His long-term view was that deflation would, in any case, be the best way to help the economy. His primary goal was to remove Germany's reparation payments by convincing the Allies that they could no longer be paid.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Ulrich Wehler, Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Band 4, 1. Auflage, 2003, {{ISBN|3-406-32264-6}}, p. 526; Michael North, Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte, C. H. Bech, 2. Auflage 2005, {{ISBN|3-406-50266-0}}, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Anton Erkelenz, chairman of the [[German Democratic Party]] and a contemporary critic of Brüning, famously said that the policy of deflation is:

{{bquote|A rightful attempt to release Germany from the grip of reparation payments, but in reality it meant nothing else than committing suicide because of fearing death. The deflation policy causes much more damage than the reparation payments of 20 years ... Fighting against Hitler is fighting against deflation, the enormous destruction of production factors.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Georg Backhaus, ''The Beginnings of Scholarly Economic Journalism'', Springer 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-0078-3}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1933, the American economist Irving Fisher developed the theory of [[debt deflation]]. He explained that a deflation causes a decline of profits, asset prices and a still greater decline in the net worth of businesses. Even healthy companies, therefore, may appear over-indebted and facing bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Ursulattner"&gt;Ursula Büttner, Weimar: die überforderte Republik, Klett-Cotta, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-608-94308-5}}, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus today is that Brüning's policies exacerbated the German economic crisis and the population's growing frustration with democracy, contributing enormously to the increase in support for Hitler's NSDAP.&lt;ref name="ThomasAdam" /&gt;

Most German capitalists and landowners originally supported the conservative experiment more from the belief that conservatives would best serve their interests rather than any particular liking for Brüning. As more of the working and middle classes turned against Brüning, however, more of the capitalists and landowners declared themselves in favour of his opponents Hitler and [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg]]. By late 1931, the conservative movement was dead and Hindenburg and the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had begun to contemplate dropping Brüning in favour of accommodating Hugenberg and Hitler. Although Hindenburg disliked Hugenberg and despised Hitler, he was no less a supporter of the sort of anti-democratic counter-revolution that the DNVP and NSDAP represented.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Rosenberg |title=A History of The German Republic |publisher=Methuen |year=1936 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1932, Brüning had actively supported Hindenburg's successful campaign against Hitler for re-election as ''Reichspräsident'';&lt;ref&gt;Unlike the ''Reichskanzler'', the ''Reichspräsident'' was elected by a direct popular vote.&lt;/ref&gt; five weeks later, on 20 May 1932, he had lost Hindenburg's support and duly resigned as ''Reichskanzler''.

====The Papen deal====
Hindenburg then appointed [[Franz von Papen]] as new ''Reichskanzler''. Papen lifted the ban on the NSDAP's [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] paramilitary, imposed after the street riots, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the backing of Hitler.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Papen was closely associated with the industrialist and land-owning classes and pursued an extreme Conservative policy along Hindenburg's lines. He appointed as ''Reichswehr'' Minister [[Kurt von Schleicher]], and all the members of the new cabinet were of the same political opinion as Hindenburg. This government was expected to assure itself of the co-operation of Hitler. Since the Republicans were not yet ready to take action, the Communists did not want to support the republic, and the Conservatives had shot their political bolt, Hitler and Hugenberg were certain to achieve power.{{citation needed|reason=Who claims that it was certain?|date=May 2016}}

====Elections of July 1932====
Because most parties opposed the new government, Papen had the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' dissolved and called for new elections. [[German federal election, July 1932|The general elections on 31 July 1932]] yielded major gains for the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]], and for the Nazis, who won 37.3% of the vote – their [[Nazi Party#Federal election results|high-water mark in a free election]]. The Nazi party then supplanted the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] as the largest party in the ''Reichstag'', although it did not gain a majority.

The immediate question was what part the now large Nazi Party would play in the Government of the country. The party owed its huge increase to growing support from middle-class people, whose traditional parties were swallowed up by the Nazi Party. The millions of radical adherents at first forced the Party towards the Left. They wanted a renewed Germany and a new organisation of German society. The left of the Nazi party strove desperately against any drift into the train of such capitalist and feudal reactionaries. Therefore, Hitler refused ministry under Papen, and demanded the chancellorship for himself, but was rejected by Hindenburg on 13 August 1932. There was still no majority in the ''Reichstag'' for any government; as a result, the ''Reichstag'' was dissolved and elections took place once more in the hope that a stable majority would result. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Schleicher cabinet====
[[German federal election, November 1932|The 6 November 1932 elections]] yielded 33.1% for the Nazis,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |title=The Coming of the Third Reich |publisher=The Penguin Press |year=2004 |location=New York |page=446 |isbn=1-59420-004-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; two million voters fewer than in the previous election. Franz von Papen stepped down and was succeeded as Chancellor (''Reichskanzler'') by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] on 3 December. Schleicher, a retired army officer, had developed in an atmosphere of semi-obscurity and intrigue that encompassed the Republican military policy. He had for years been in the camp of those supporting the Conservative counter-revolution. Schleicher's bold and unsuccessful plan was to build a majority in the ''Reichstag'' by uniting the [[trade unionist]] left wings of the various parties, including that of the Nazis led by [[Gregor Strasser]]. This policy did not prove successful either.

[[File:Plakat Hugenberg Papen Seldte 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Poster for the nationalist "Black–White–Red" coalition of [[Alfred Hugenberg]] ([[German National People's Party|DNVP]] leader), [[Franz von Papen]] and [[Franz Seldte]]]]

In this brief Presidential Dictatorship intermission, Schleicher assumed the role of "Socialist General" and entered into relations with the Christian Trade Unions, the left-wing members of the Nazi party, and even with the Social Democrats. Schleicher planned for a sort of labour government under his Generalship. But the ''Reichswehr'' officers were not prepared for this, the working class had a natural distrust of their future allies, and the great capitalists and landowners also did not like the plans.

Hitler learned from Papen that the general had not received from Hindenburg the authority to abolish the ''Reichstag'' parliament, whereas any majority of seats did. The cabinet (under a previous interpretation of Article 48) ruled without a sitting ''Reichstag'', which could vote only for its own dissolution. Hitler also learned that all past crippling Nazi debts were to be relieved by German big business.

On 22 January, Hitler's efforts to persuade [[Oskar von Hindenburg]], the President's son and confidant, included threats to bring criminal charges over estate taxation irregularities at the President's Neudeck estate; although {{convert|5000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} extra were soon allotted to Hindenburg's property. Outmaneuvered by Papen and Hitler on plans for the new cabinet, and having lost Hindenburg's confidence, Schleicher asked for new elections. On 28 January, Papen described Hitler to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] as only a minority part of an alternative, Papen-arranged government. The four great political movements, the SPD, Communists, [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]], and the Nazis were in opposition.

On 29 January, Hitler and Papen thwarted a last-minute threat of an officially sanctioned ''Reichswehr'' takeover, and on 30 January 1933 Hindenburg accepted the new Papen-Nationalist-Hitler coalition, with the Nazis holding only three of eleven Cabinet seats: Hitler as Chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] as Minister of the Interior and [[Hermann Göring]] as Minister Without Portfolio. Later that day, the first cabinet meeting was attended by only two political parties, representing a minority in the ''Reichstag'': The Nazis and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]], with 196 and 52 seats respectively. Eyeing the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]'s 70 (plus 20 [[Bavarian People's Party|BVP]]) seats, Hitler refused their leader's demands for constitutional "concessions" (amounting to protection) and planned for dissolution of the ''Reichstag''.

Hindenburg, despite his misgivings about the Nazis' goals and about Hitler as a personality, reluctantly agreed to Papen's theory that, with Nazi popular support on the wane, Hitler could now be controlled as Chancellor. This date, dubbed by the Nazis as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (seizure of power), is commonly seen as the beginning of [[Nazi Germany]].

===End of the Weimar Republic===

====Hitler's chancellorship (1933)====
Hitler was sworn in as [[Chancellor]] on the morning of 30 January 1933 in what some observers later described as a brief and indifferent ceremony. By early February, a mere week after Hitler's assumption of the chancellorship, the government had begun to clamp down on the opposition. Meetings of the left-wing parties were banned and even some of the moderate parties found their members threatened and assaulted. Measures with an appearance of legality suppressed the Communist Party in mid-February and included the plainly illegal arrests of ''Reichstag'' deputies.

The [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February was blamed by Hitler's government on the Communists. Hitler used the ensuing state of emergency to obtain the presidential assent of Hindenburg to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day. The decree invoked [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]] and "indefinitely suspended" a number of constitutional protections of civil liberties, allowing the Nazi government to take swift action against political meetings, arresting and killing the Communists.

Hitler and the Nazis exploited the German state's broadcasting and aviation facilities in a massive attempt to sway the electorate, but this election yielded a scant majority of 16 seats for the coalition. At the [[German federal election, March 1933|''Reichstag'' elections]], which took place on 5 March 1933, the NSDAP obtained 17 million votes. The Communist, Social Democrat and Catholic Centre votes stood firm. This was the last multi-party election of the Weimar Republic and the last multi-party all-German election for 57 years.

Hitler addressed disparate interest groups, stressing the necessity for a definitive solution to the perpetual instability of the Weimar Republic. He now blamed Germany's problems on the Communists, even threatening their lives on 3 March. Former Chancellor [[Heinrich Brüning]] proclaimed that his Centre Party would resist any constitutional change and appealed to the President for an investigation of the ''Reichstag'' fire. Hitler's successful plan was to induce what remained of the now Communist-depleted Reichstag to grant him, and the Government, the authority to issue decrees with the force of law. The hitherto Presidential Dictatorship hereby was to give itself a new legal form.

On 15 March, the first [[cabinet meeting]] was attended by the two coalition parties, representing a minority in the ''Reichstag'': The Nazis and the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]] (288 + 52 seats). According to the [[Nuremberg Trials]], this cabinet meeting's first order of business was how at last to achieve the complete counter-revolution by means of the constitutionally allowed [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], requiring a 66% parliamentary majority. This Act would, and did, lead Hitler and the [[NSDAP]] toward his goal of unfettered dictatorial powers.&lt;ref&gt;As Kershaw notes (p. 468 {{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}), after the passage of the Act, "Hitler was still far from wielding absolute power. But vital steps toward consolidating his dictatorship now followed in quick succession."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hitler cabinet meeting in mid-March====
At the cabinet meeting on 15 March, Hitler introduced the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], which would have authorised the cabinet to enact legislation without the approval of the ''Reichstag''. Meanwhile, the only remaining question for the Nazis was whether the Catholic Centre Party (''Zentrum'') would support the Enabling Act in the ''Reichstag'', thereby providing the ⅔ majority required to ratify a law that amended the constitution. Hitler expressed his confidence to win over the Centre's votes. Hitler is recorded at the Nuremberg Trials as being sure of eventual Centre Party Germany capitulation and thus rejecting of the DNVP's suggestions to "balance" the majority through further arrests, this time of Social Democrats. Hitler, however, assured his coalition partners that arrests would resume after the elections and, in fact, some 26 SPD Social Democrats were physically removed. After meeting with Centre leader Monsignor [[Ludwig Kaas]] and other Centre Trade Union leaders daily and denying them a substantial participation in the government, negotiation succeeded in respect of guarantees towards Catholic civil-servants and education issues.

At the last internal Centre meeting prior to the debate on the Enabling Act, Kaas expressed no preference or suggestion on the vote, but as a way of mollifying opposition by Centre members to the granting of further powers to Hitler, Kaas somehow arranged for a letter of constitutional guarantee from Hitler himself prior to his voting with the centre ''en bloc'' in favour of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. This guarantee was not ultimately given. Kaas, the party's chairman since 1928, had strong connections to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Secretary of State, later [[Pope Pius XII]]. In return for pledging his support for the act, Kaas would use his connections with the Vatican to set in train and draft the [[Holy See]]'s long desired ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' with Germany (only possible with the co-operation of the Nazis).

Ludwig Kaas is considered along with Papen as being one of the two most important political figures in the creation of a [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] dictatorship.&lt;ref name="vKlemperer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klemperer|first=Klemens von|title=German Resistance Against Hitler:The Search for Allies Abroad 1938–1945|publisher= OUP / Clarendon Press|year=1992|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-821940-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enabling Act negotiations====
On 20 March, negotiation began between Hitler and Frick on one side and the Catholic Centre Party (''Zentrum'') leaders—Kaas, Stegerwald and Hackelsburger on the other. The aim was to settle on conditions under which Centre would vote in favour of the [[Enabling Act]]. Because of the Nazis' narrow majority in the ''Reichstag'', Centre's support was necessary to receive the required two-thirds majority vote. On 22 March, the negotiations concluded; Hitler promised to continue the existence of the German states, agreed not to use the new grant of power to change the constitution, and promised to retain ''Zentrum'' members in the civil service. Hitler also pledged to protect the Catholic confessional schools and to respect the concordats signed between the [[Holy See]] and [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden]] (1931). Hitler also agreed to mention these promises in his speech to the ''Reichstag'' before the vote on the Enabling Act.

The ceremonial opening of the ''Reichstag'' on 21 March was held at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]], a shrine of [[Prussia]]nism, in the presence of many [[Junker]] landowners and representatives of the imperial military caste. This impressive and often emotional spectacle—orchestrated by [[Joseph Goebbels]]—aimed to link Hitler's government with Germany's imperial past and portray National Socialism as a guarantor of the nation's future. The ceremony helped convince the "old guard" Prussian military elite of Hitler's homage to their long tradition and, in turn, produced the relatively convincing view that Hitler's government had the support of Germany's traditional protector—the Army. Such support would publicly signal a return to conservatism to curb the problems affecting the Weimar Republic, and that stability might be at hand. In a cynical and politically adroit move, Hitler bowed in apparently respectful humility before President and Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].

====Passage of the Enabling Act====
The ''Reichstag'' convened on 23 March 1933, and in the midday opening, Hitler made a historic speech, appearing outwardly calm and conciliatory. Hitler presented an appealing prospect of respect towards Christianity by paying tribute to the Christian faiths as "essential elements for safeguarding the soul of the German people". He promised to respect their rights and declared that his government's "ambition is a peaceful accord between [[Separation of church and state|Church and State]]" and that he hoped "to improve [their] friendly relations with the [[Holy See]]". This speech aimed especially at the future recognition by the named [[Holy See]] and therefore to the votes of the Centre Party addressing many concerns Kaas had voiced during the previous talks. Kaas is considered to have had a hand therefore in the drafting of the speech.&lt;ref name="vKlemperer"/&gt; Kaas is also reported as voicing the Holy See's desire for Hitler as bulwark against [[atheist]]ic Russian [[nihilism]] previously as early as May 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mowrer|first=Edgar Ansel|authorlink=Edgar Ansel Mowrer| title=Triumph and Turmoil|year=1970|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London|page=209|isbn= 0-04-920026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler promised that the Act did not threaten the existence of either the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' or the ''[[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]]'', that the authority of the President remained untouched and that the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' would not be abolished. During an adjournment, the other parties (notably the Centre) met to discuss their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw pp. 467–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate prior to the vote on the Enabling Act, Hitler orchestrated the full political menace of his paramilitary forces like the [[Sturmabteilung|storm division]] in the streets to intimidate reluctant ''Reichstag'' deputies into approving the Enabling Act. The Communists' 81 seats had been empty since the ''Reichstag'' Fire Decree and other lesser known procedural measures, thus excluding their anticipated "No" votes from the balloting. [[Otto Wels]], the leader of the Social Democrats, whose seats were similarly depleted from 120 to below 100, was the only speaker to defend democracy and in a futile but brave effort to deny Hitler the ⅔ majority, he made a speech critical of the abandonment of democracy to dictatorship. At this, Hitler could no longer restrain his wrath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]] |authorlink=William L. Shirer |last=Shirer |first=William L. |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location= New York |year=1960 |isbn=0-671-72868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his retort to Wels, Hitler abandoned earlier pretence at calm statesmanship and delivered a characteristic screaming diatribe, promising to exterminate all Communists in Germany and threatening Wels' Social Democrats as well. He did not even want their support for the bill. "Germany will become free, but not through you," he shouted.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hitler's promised written guarantee to Monsignor Kaas was being typed up, it was asserted to Kaas, and thereby Kaas was persuaded to silently deliver the Centre bloc's votes for the Enabling Act anyway. The Act—formally titled the "Act for the Removal of Distress from People and Reich"—was passed by a vote of 441 to 94. Only the SPD had voted against the Act. Every other member of the ''Reichstag'', whether from the largest or the smallest party, voted in favour of the Act. It went into effect the following day, 24 March.

====Consequences====
{{main|Nazi Germany}}
The passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] is widely considered to mark the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the Nazi era. It empowered the cabinet to legislate without the approval of the Reichstag or the President, and to enact laws that were contrary to the constitution. Before the March 1933 elections, Hitler had persuaded Hindenburg to promulgate the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] using [[Article 48]], which empowered the government to restrict "the rights of habeas corpus [...] freedom of the press, the freedom to organise and assemble, the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications" and legalised search warrants and confiscation "beyond legal limits otherwise prescribed". This was intended to forestall any action against the government by the Communists. Hitler used the provisions of the Enabling Act to pre-empt possible opposition to his dictatorship from other sources, in which he was mostly successful.

The Nazis in power brought almost all major organisations into line under Nazi control or direction, which was termed  ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''.

The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that it was a dead letter.  Those articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's relationship to various Christian churches) remain part of the German Basic Law.

==Reasons for failure==

The reasons for the Weimar Republic's collapse are the subject of continuing debate. It may have been doomed from the beginning since even moderates disliked it and extremists on both the left and right loathed it, a situation often referred to as a "democracy without democrats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Primoratz |first=Igor |date=2008-05-08 |title=Patriotism: Philosophical and Political Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob8oDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |page=98 |isbn=978-0754671220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany had limited democratic traditions, and Weimar democracy was widely seen as chaotic. Since Weimar politicians had been blamed for the ''Dolchstoß'' ("[[Stab-in-the-back myth|stab-in-the-back]]"), a widely believed theory that Germany's surrender in World War I had been the unnecessary act of traitors, the popular legitimacy of the government was on shaky ground. As normal parliamentary lawmaking broke down and was replaced around 1930 by a series of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency decrees]], the decreasing popular legitimacy of the government further drove voters to extremist parties.

No single reason can explain the failure of the Weimar Republic. The most commonly asserted causes can be grouped into three categories: economic problems, institutional problems and the roles of specific individuals.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Economic problems===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]--&gt;
{{main|Great Depression in Central Europe|Dawes Plan|Reichsbank}}
The Weimar Republic had some of the most serious economic problems ever experienced by any Western democracy in history. Rampant [[hyperinflation]], massive unemployment, and a large drop in living standards were primary factors. From 1923 to 1929, there was a short period of economic recovery, but the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s led to a worldwide recession. Germany was particularly affected because it depended heavily on American loans. In 1926, about 2 million Germans were unemployed, which rose to around 6 million in 1932. Many blamed the Weimar Republic. That was made apparent when political parties on both right and left wanting to disband the Republic altogether made any democratic majority in Parliament impossible.

The Weimar Republic was severely affected by the [[Great Depression]]. The economic stagnation led to increased demands on Germany to repay the debts owed to the United States. As the Weimar Republic was very fragile in all its existence, the depression was devastating, and played a major role in the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] takeover.

Most Germans thought the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was a punishing and degrading document because it forced them to surrender resource-rich areas and pay massive amounts of compensation. The punitive reparations caused consternation and resentment, but the actual economic damage resulting from the Treaty of Versailles is difficult to determine. While the official reparations were considerable, Germany ended up paying only a fraction of them. However, the reparations damaged Germany's economy by discouraging market loans, which forced the Weimar government to finance its deficit by printing more currency, causing rampant hyperinflation. In addition, the rapid disintegration of Germany in 1919 by the return of a disillusioned army, the rapid change from possible victory in 1918 to defeat in 1919, and the political chaos may have caused a psychological imprint on Germans that could lead to extreme nationalism, later epitomised and exploited by Hitler. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Princeton University|Princeton]] historian [[Harold James (historian)|Harold James]] argues that there was a clear link between economic decline and people turning to extremist politics.&lt;ref&gt;James, Harold, "Economic Reasons for the Collapse of the Weimar Republic", in ''Weimar: Why Did German Democracy Fail'', ed. Ian Kershaw, Widenfeld and Nicolson, (London: 1990), pp 30–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional problems===
It is widely believed that the [[Weimar Constitution|1919 constitution]] had several weaknesses, making the eventual establishment of a dictatorship likely, but it is unknown whether a different constitution could have prevented the rise of the Nazi party. However, the 1949 West German constitution (the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany]]) is generally viewed as a strong response to these flaws.

* The institution of the ''Reichspräsident'' was frequently considered as an ''Ersatzkaiser'' ("substitute emperor"), an attempt to replace the emperors with a similarly strong institution meant to diminish party politics. [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Constitution gave the President power to "take all necessary steps" if "public order and security are seriously disturbed or endangered". Although it was intended as an emergency clause, it was often used before 1933 to issue decrees without the support of Parliament (see above) and also made ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' easier.
* During the Weimar Republic, it was accepted that a law did not have to conform to the constitution as long as it had the support of two thirds of parliament, the same majority needed to change the constitution (''verfassungsdurchbrechende Gesetze''). That was a precedent for the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. The Basic Law of 1949 requires an explicit change of the wording, and it prohibits abolishing the basic rights or the federal structure of the republic.
* The use of a [[proportional representation]] without large [[election threshold|thresholds]] meant a party with a small amount of support could gain entry into the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]''. That led to many small parties, some extremist, building political bases within the system. To counter the problem, the modern German Bundestag introduced a 5% [[election threshold|threshold limit]] for a party to gain parliamentary representation. However, the Reichstag of the monarchy was fractioned to a similar degree even if it was elected by [[majoritarian system|majority vote]] (under a [[two-round system]]). The republic fell not by the small parties but by the strength of the communists, conservatives and ultimately the national socialists. 
* The ''Reichstag'' could remove the ''Reichskanzler'' from office even if it was unable to agree on a successor. The use of such a [[motion of no confidence]] meant that since 1932, that a government could not be held in office when the parliament came together. As a result, the 1949 ''Grundgesetz'' ("Basic Law") stipulates that a chancellor may not be removed by Parliament unless a successor is elected at the same time, known as a "[[constructive vote of no confidence]]".
* The political parties started to have a role in creating a government only in October 1918. They were massively inexperienced.

===Role of individuals===
Brüning's economic policy from 1930 to 1932 has been the subject of much debate. It caused many Germans to identify the Republic with cuts in social spending and extremely liberal economics. Whether there were alternatives to this policy during the [[Great Depression]] is an open question.

[[Paul von Hindenburg]] became ''Reichspräsident'' in 1925. As he was an old style monarchist conservative, he had little love lost for the Republic,{{cn|date=November 2018}} but for the most part, he formally acted within the bounds of the constitution;{{cn|date=November 2018}} however, he ultimately — on the advice of his son and others close to him — appointed Hitler chancellor, thereby effectively ending the Republic.

==Constituent states==
{{Main|States of the Weimar Republic}}

Prior to World War I, the [[States of the German Empire|constituent states of the German Empire]] were 22 smaller monarchies, three republican city-states and the Imperial territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. After the territorial losses of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the remaining states continued as republics. The former [[Ernestine duchies]] continued briefly as republics before merging to form the state of [[Thuringia]] in 1920, except for [[Saxe-Coburg]], which became part of [[Bavaria]].

{{Weimar Republic States|width=550|include_list=y}}
These states were gradually ''de facto'' abolished under the Nazi regime via the [[Gleichschaltung]] process, whereby they were effectively replaced by [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]]. However, the city-state of [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] was formally incorporated into Prussia in 1937 following the [[Greater Hamburg Act]], apparently motivated by Hitler's personal dislike for the city. Most of the remaining states were formally dissolved by the Allies at the end of World War II and ultimately reorganised into the modern [[states of Germany]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}
