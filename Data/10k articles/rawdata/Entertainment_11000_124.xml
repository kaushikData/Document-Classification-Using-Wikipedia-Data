'''Abbey Home Media''' is a British DVD distributor that releases content and other content aimed at a young audience.

The company has partnerships with the pre-school brands [[CBeebies]], [[LittleBe]] and [[Milkshake!]], and with companies like [[DHX Media]] to release their content on DVD in the United Kingdom. Abbey Home Media also are a producer of their own franchises, which includes the likes of ''[[Bump (TV series)|Bump the Elephant]]'', ''[[Fun Song Factory]]'' and ''Baby Bright''.

==History and Predecessors==
===Abbey Home Entertainment===
The precessor of Abbey Home Media was '''Abbey Home Entertainment Group Limited''' (AHE) Abbey Home Entertainment was founded in 1989 by Ian and Anne Miles. AHE would acquire the Tempo Video brand name from WM Collins Video in 1990 and also later introduced other brand names:

*'''Tempo Kids Club''' was used for re-releases of older Tempo Video releases which were previously distributed by their old owners MSD Video and Collins Video.
*'''Tempo Pre-School''' was used for releases aimed at very young children. The success of the releases released under the label made Abbey Home Entertainment the only video distributor who's releases were recommended and approved by the [[Pre-School Learning Alliance]]. The label remained after the Just Entertainment buyout (as a pre-school brand within Just) and was used into the Abbey Home Media era, before it was retired in favour of the regular Abbey Home Media brand in the mid 2000's.
*'''Abbey Freetime''' was used for documentary releases.
*'''Abbey Music''' was used for Music and Concert releases. 

A subsidiary called Abbey Broadcast Communications was also founded during this time, which produced original content for AHE. According to Companieshouse, ABC is still in operation, even though they haven't made anything since 1999.

In Early 2000, Abbey Home Entertainment was acquired by ''Just Group PLC''. [https://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=200007040700442726N] after a while, all of AHE's sub-brands except for Tempo Pre-School were folded into Just Group's home media subsidiary Just Entertainment. Newer releases would be released under ether 2 names.

===Tempo Video===
Another predecessor of Abbey Home Media was '''Tempo Video''', which was originally launched by video distributor MSD Video in 1987 as a kids-focused video label. After 2 years MSD transitioned the distribution of Tempo to Collins Video and then transitioned the label off to Abbey Home Entertainment within 1990, a year after the company was founded. The label was folded a short while after Abbey Home Entertainment was bought by Just Group in 2000.

===Abbey Home Media===
In 2002, co-founder Ian Miles resigned from Just Group PLC, and he formed a new company under the Abbey name called Abbey Home Media [https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/company/04386207-abbey-home-media-group-limited] Almost all of Just Group's properties were also taken by Abbey Home Media in the process. Abbey Home Media retained the Tempo Pre-School brand that Just Entertainment kept during their ownership of the Abbey brands and would later introduce the '''Tempo''' and '''Tempo TV Classics''' (Previously '''Tempo Classics''') brands. Nowadays all of the releases are released under the single Abbey Home Media brand name.

==Properties owned by Abbey Home Media==

*''[[Fun Song Factory]]''
*''Baby Bright''
*''[[SuperTed]]''

{{Philosophy sidebar |Branches}}

'''Aesthetics''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|s|ˈ|θ|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s|,_|i:|s|-}}) is a branch of [[philosophy]] that explores the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]], and [[taste (sociology)|taste]], with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more technical [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and [[senses|sensori-emotional values]], sometimes called [[judgement|judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "Aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030|title =  Review of ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AESTHETICS 4 vol.'' Michael Kelly|first = Tom|last = Riedel |journal = Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America |volume = 18|issue = 2 |date =Fall 1999|page =  48|doi = 10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[modern English]], the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aesthetic|title=aesthetic - Definition of aesthetic in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''aesthetic'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang |grc|αἰσθητικός}} (''aisthetikos'', meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to {{lang |grc|αἴσθησις}} (''aisthēsis'', "sensation").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD |aesthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in his dissertation ''Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus'' ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;&lt;ref name= "Guyer 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guyer |first =Paul |title= Values of Beauty: Historical Essays in Aesthetics |date= 13 June 2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-60669-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Bje-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = T. Dickie | title = aesthetics | work = Encyclopedia Americana | volume = 1 | editor1-first = Barbara | editor1-last = Letta Cole | editor2 = et. al. | place = Danbury | publisher = Grolier | year = 1993 | page = 234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his later definition in the fragment ''Aesthetica'' (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = N | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | page = 20 | publisher = Routledge | date = 31 Oct 2013 | ISBN = 1-136-78800-X | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{quotation|Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.|[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==

===Aesthetic judgment&lt;!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here--&gt;===

Aesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].

For [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me''," because "Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things." [[Roger Scruton]] has argued similarly.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Władysław|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Korsmeyer |editor-first = Carolyn |title =Aesthetics: The Big Questions|date = 1998|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0631205944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in "On Modernist Painting" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|last2=  Livingston|first2 = Paisley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7r27dci51FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =The Creation of Art| page = 3|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date =2003|isbn = 9780521812344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/|last = King|first = Alexandra|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&amp;q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος ''kallos'').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;24–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-23804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. [[Denis Dutton]] in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Sublime painting, unlike [[kitsch]] [[realism (visual arts)|realism]], "...&amp;nbsp;will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''What is Postmodernism?'', in ''The Postmodern Condition'', Minnesota and Manchester, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] inaugurated aesthetical thinking in [[Psychoanalysis]] mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, "The Uncanny" (1919). Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Work of Sigmund Freud, 17:234-36. London: The Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Freud and [[Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1964), "The Visible and the Invisible". Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-0457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan Book VII), NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation of [[Marxist aesthetics]] to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Recent aesthetics===
[[Guy Sircello]] has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty''. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; love&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism''
Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541–550&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of [[conceptual art]] aesthetics, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]], makes the point that "'[[post-conceptual art]]' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of [[contemporary art]] so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienation, and [[Louis Althusser]]'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, G. (2012) ''Aesthetics &amp; Alienation'', Zero Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Loewen]] has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&amp;nbsp;36–7, 157, 238)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and science===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]

The field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites. Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;287–302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p.&amp;nbsp;121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as [[information processing]]). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|3-211-81216-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithm]]ic theory of beauty which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1576418|title=Low-Complexity Art|first=Jürgen|last=Schmidhuber|date=22 October 1997|publisher=|journal=Leonardo|volume=30|issue=2|pages=97–103|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1576418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html|title=THEORY OF BEAUTY - FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS - LOW-COMPLEXITY ART|website=www.idsia.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber|first =Jürgen |last= Schmidhuber |title = Facial beauty and fractal geometry|website = Cogprint Archive|url =http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130215106/http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |date = 7 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) p.&amp;nbsp;26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arxiv|0709.0674}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: "Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: "The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment", ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174–1178&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===
In 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.&lt;ref name="Akiba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117–118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary aesthetics===
{{main|Evolutionary aesthetics}}
Evolutionary aesthetics refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimura|first1=Arthur P.|last2=Palmer|first2=Stephen E.|title=Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience|date=January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer [[landscape]]s which were good [[habitat]]s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of [[physical attractiveness]] which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Darwinian literary studies]], and the study of the [[evolution of emotion]].

===Applied aesthetics===
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7510314 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1993.tb03913.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], fashion and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html |title=Visual Aesthetics |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T. &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing dimensions of perceived visual aesthetics of web sites. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 60, 269–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;283–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alias''''' is a [[board game]], where the objective of the players is to explain words to each other. Hence, Alias is similar to [[Taboo (game)|Taboo]], but the only forbidden word in the explanations is the word to be explained. The game is played in teams of varying size, and fits well as a party game for larger crowds. The game is very competitive.

''Alias'' has been developed in [[Finland]] and is produced by Nelostuote Oy under the brand name Tactic. The game has been on the market since the early 1990s and is one of the most popular party games in Finland. Along the years, many different versions of the board game have appeared: As well as the ''New Alias'', the ''Alias'' family currently also includes the ''Junior Alias'' for children, the ''Alias'' travel game, and as the newest introduction, DVD ''Alias''.

==The name==
The name ''Alias'' comes from the word ''alias'', meaning ''also known as''.

==Basic ''Alias''==
The board in ''Alias'' is a "[[Course (navigation)|path]]" consisting of sequential curving numbers on a red background. The game contains 8 numbered groups. The game is divided into turns of about one minute of length. The teams play in turns, and on each team's turn, one of the team members has to explain words on word cards to the other team members. The other team members take guesses at the word, and words that have been correctly guessed earn the team one point per word. Explanation mistakes (meaning the explainer uses the word to be explained, part of it, or a derivative of it), and words passed over without being guessed take points away. The players move on the board as many places as they have earned points on their turn. If, for example, the team lands on the number 7, the word to be explained from the cards is word number 7. The first team to reach the goal wins. The game is recommended for players over 7 years.

==''New Alias''==
The ''New Alias'' is a version of ''Alias'', where the words are divided into 8 classes: 1. Things and Concepts, 2. People and Professions, 3. Adjectives, 4. Verbs. The numbered classes can include anything whatsoever. The game board's base colour is red and the squares of each category are played in turns.

==''Special Alias''==
On the flip side of the ''New Alias'' board is the ''Special Alias'' version of the board game: the rules are otherwise the same as in ''New Alias'', but the game has different classes: The world around us, Sports and exercise, Entertainment and culture, and Sayings and quotes. The classes Entertainment and culture and Sayings and quotes have special explanations, meaning that the first card contains a hint related to the word, and in the second card, the word to be explained is part of a saying or quote and the word to be explained is replaced, for example, with the word "beep". Both classes also contain normal explanations.

On the third game winner takes all on the party Alias version

==''Junior Alias''==
''Junior Alias'' is otherwise like the normal ''Alias'', except there are also pictures to be explained and the words have been chosen to fit for children. The red colour of the board has been replaced with yellow, and the appearance is more child-friendly. This game is recommended for players over 5 years.

==DVD ''Alias''==
The [[DVD]] version of ''Alias'' is hosted by [[Marco Bjurström]], and as well as word explanations, the game includes exercise. The game takes over an hour. A [[television]] and a [[DVD player]] are needed to play the DVD version of ''Alias''.

{{Nihongo|'''Aniplex Inc.'''|株式会社アニプレックス|Kabushiki-gaisha Anipurekkusu}} is a Japanese [[anime]] and [[music]] production company owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]] and established in September 1995. '''Aniplex''' has been involved in the planning, production and distribution of several anime series, such as ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[Blood: The Last Vampire]]'', ''[[Persona 4: The Animation]]'', ''[[Birdy the Mighty]]'', ''[[Angel Beats!]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', ''[[Charlotte (anime)|Charlotte]]'', and ''[[Black Butler]]''. Additionally, Aniplex produces and distributes [[music]] and [[soundtrack]] records, including the original soundtracks for all of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s computer and video games.

Aniplex is also involved in retail merchandising, producing toys, games, [[stationery]], food and other items featuring popular characters. In addition, Aniplex puts together events to promote their anime franchises. For example, in 2005 Aniplex held the Fullmetal Alchemist Festival which began with the Fullmetal Alchemist Tour at [[Universal Studios Japan]].

Originally known as Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) Visual Works Inc., it was established on September 1995 as a joint-venture between [[Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]], and changed its name in January 2001&lt;ref name="aniplex1"/&gt; to Sony Music Entertainment (SME) Visual Works Inc. after becoming a subsidiary completely owned by Sony Music Entertainment Japan. In April 2003, it changed its name to Aniplex Inc.&lt;ref name="aniplex1"/&gt;

In 2004, Aniplex launched the Sugi Label, which releases the works of [[Koichi Sugiyama]]—the composer of the music for ''[[Dragon Quest]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/eng/works.html Aniplex Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102051247/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/eng/works.html |date=November 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 2009 it was sold to [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]].

In March 2005, the company established its Santa Monica, California-based North American subsidiary [[Aniplex of America]],&lt;ref name="aniplex1"/&gt; and later that same year in May 2005, it established its own animation studio called [[A-1 Pictures]].&lt;ref name="aniplex1"/&gt;

The studio was founded on 16 April 1923 as a [[production unit]] of the Soviet State Cinema Organisation, with Daniel Dznuni as the first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollberg|first=Peter|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cuw1vHuxITYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA56,M1|date=2008|pages=56&amp;ndash;59|isbn=0-8108-6072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenfilm was sold by the state to private investors in 2005 with a long list of conditions to revitalize the studio's equipment and produce new content. It was renamed as CS Film Studios but failed to produce the required new feature films. In 2015, the Government of Armenia decided that the new management had failed to satisfy the conditions of the sale and moved to reclaim the studio's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azatutyun.am/a/27201990.html|title=Government To Renationalize Armenian Film Studio|website=«Ազատ Եվրոպա/Ազատություն» ռադիոկայան|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flying_Light_Effect.JPG|thumb|Long-time exposure of a balloon-carried light effect consisting of a bracelet equipped with red LEDs carried by multiple gas-filled balloons]]

A '''balloon-carried light effect''' is a [[special effect]] carried by a [[balloon]], which can be fixed with a rope to the ground or free-flying. They are commonly misidentified as "[[Unidentified Flying Object]]s" by members of public.

==Uses==
[[Image:Ballongetragener_Lichteffekt_19112009_1.JPG|thumb|Long-time exposure of a balloon-carried light effect consisting of a blue blinking LED carried by multiple balloons, Picture 1]]
Balloon-carried light effects can be used without safety concerns at events with a lot of people, because unlike [[fireworks]] they do not require the use of flammable substances. The brightness is much lower, when non-dangerous light sources such as [[lightstick]]s or battery-powered lamps are used.

Balloon-carried light effects cannot replace fireworks, but supplement them, because of their long lighting time (if lightsticks or battery powered lamps are used) and because of their inherent safety.
To realise a balloon-carried light effect, one or more balloons are used, capable of carrying a lightstick or a small battery powered lamp. Further it is possible to insert one or two small [[lightstick]]s into a transparent balloon.

It is also possible for larger balloon-carried light effects to use tethered balloons, which also can contain an [[electric]] cable power supply: these 'artificial moons' may be used for [[High-intensity discharge lamp|floodlight]]ing.

==Open-air concert use==
Balloon-carried light effects are sometimes used on open-air concerts and similar events. They were used at the [[Gabin Tower Memorial Festival]] in August 2006.

For film and event use balloons are offered as suspended air-filled or tethered floating helium-filled. The latter for outdoors uses a 2-meter diameter balloon and 4 1000 Watt halogen tungsten lights inside, rising up about 10 m and withstanding only calm winds.

Other uses included fixed or pole balloons, spread like an umbrella, the upper half reflective coated, the lower half semi-opaque, light construction sites on highways, or accident sites in case of emergency.

'''''Bengawan Solo''''' (Indonesian for ''Solo River'') is a now-[[lost film|lost]] 1949 film from what is now Indonesia. Directed by Jo An Djan, it starred [[Sofia WD]], [[Rd Mochtar]], and [[Mohamad Mochtar]].

== Plot ==
After falling for the false promises of the womanising nobleman Suprapto ([[Rd Mochtar]]), Wenangish (Sofia WD) commits suicide by throwing herself into the [[Solo River]], leaving only a letter for her two children, Sriwulan (Ratna Ruthinah) and Hindrawati (Churiani). The former is raised by the family of nobleman Widagdo (Rd Dadang Ismail), while the latter is raised by a poor man named Kromo ([[S Waldy]]), eventually becoming a servant at Widagdo's home. When they are adults, Sriwulan is engaged by her adoptive father to Suprapto's son, despite loving another man. When her hitherto unknown uncle, Prawoto ([[Mohamad Mochtar]]), returns from his job in [[Borneo]], he prevents the two from marrying, instead showing that they were both fathered by Suprapto. The marriage is cancelled, and Suprapto&amp;nbsp;– seeing a vision of Wenangish, beckoning him&amp;nbsp;– commits suicide by jumping into the river.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bengawan Solo}}

== Production ==
''Bengawan Solo'' was directed by Jo An Djan for Tan &amp; Wong Bros., a company established by the Tan brothers, Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian, and [[Wong brothers]], Joshua and Othniel, in 1948.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=367}} Jo had been a director for Populer Films before the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] essentially shut down film production.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=367}} The story was written by [[Tan Tjoei Hock]] and [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bengawan Solo}} Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that the film was meant to draw as many tears as possible, using a formula reminiscent of most domestic productions since ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' in 1937: action, love, music, and beautiful scenery.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=368}}

The [[black-and-white]] film starred Sofia WD, Rd Mochtar, Mohamad Mochtar, Dadang Ismail, [[S Waldy]], Ratna Ruthinah, Churiani, Sukarsih, Sadijah, and Komariah.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bengawan Solo}} The film's theme song was the 1940 composition by [[Gesang Martohartono]] of the same name, "[[Bengawan Solo (song)|Bengawan Solo]]".{{sfn|Abdullah|Biran|Ardan|1993|p=320}}

== Release ==
''Bengawan Solo'' was released by July 1949,{{sfn|Het Nieuwsblad voor Sumatra 1949, (untitled)}} one of eight domestic films produced that year.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=386}} The film is likely [[lost film|lost]], as are all Indonesian films from before 1950 according to American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]].{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

Two years later Young wrote another film regarding the Solo River, ''Ditepi Bengawan Solo''. This work had a different plot and different cast.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ditepi Bengawan Solo}} ''Bengawan Solo'' was remade in 1971, with Sofia WD, Willy Wilianto (Joshua Wong's son), and Bay Isbahi directing. In this remake, Wenangish (played by [[Rima Melati]]) died after being hit by a train.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bengawan Solo (1971)}}

'''The Bongy Westphall Universe''' is a fictional universe of 44 related films released by [[Full Moon Entertainment]]. Series creator [[Charles Band]] took inspiration from team up comics he read as a child.&lt;ref name=yell&gt;{{cite web|title=Band, Charles Band: Our Exclusive Interview Explores His Fears and Future with Full Moon|url=http://www.yellmagazine.com/charles-band-interview/25686/2/|publisher=Yell!|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is named after the [[Tommy Westphall Universe]] and also the film [[Evil Bong]] which presents the largest crossover in the fictional universe. The named was coined by film podcast [[Double Feature (podcast)|Double Feature]] during their "Killapalooza" episode highlighting the [[Puppet Master (series)|Puppet Master]] franchise.&lt;ref name="DF#1"&gt;{{cite podcast|title=Killapalooza 24: Puppet Master|publisher=Double Feature|url=https://doublefeature.fm/2014/killapalooza-24-puppet-master|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Crossovers ==

=== Evil Bong ===

Evil Bong represents the largest overall crossover in the Bongy Westphall universe. Ooga Booga ([[Blood Dolls]]), Ivan Burroughs ([[Decadent Evil]]), [[Gingerdead Man]], Jack Attack ([[Demonic Toys]]), and Jack Deth ([[Trancers]]) are all featured.

=== Decadent Evil ===

Footage from [[Subspecies (film series)|Vampire Journals]] is used at the beginning of the movie which ties the [[Subspecies (film series)|Subspecies]] series to the Bongy Westphall Universe.

=== Dollman vs. Demonic Toys ===

Jack Attack's appearance in Evil Bong brings Demonic Toys into the Bongy Westphall Universe. The Dollman crossover also incorporates [[Bad Channels]] due to a small Dollman cameo.

=== Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys ===

By crossing over with Demonic Toys, all ten other [[Puppet Master (film series)|Puppet Master films]] are entered into the Bongy Westphall Universe although Puppet Master never crosses over directly with Evil Bong.

=== miscellaneous ===

[[Zombies Vs. Strippers]] (2012): The character Hambo (played by [[Chance A. Rearden]]) later appears in Ooga Booga and several Gingerdead Man films.

[[Crash and Burn (1990 film)|Crash and Burn]] (1990): The character Quinn (played by [[Bill Moseley]]) later appears in Evil Bong (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''Circus Redickuless''' was a traveling [[circus]] created by punk-rock impresario [[Chicken John|Chicken John Rinaldi]] in 1995 in association with Michael Gump.

==History==
Formed in Los Angeles, largely with members of the LA and San Francisco [[Cacophony Society]], the circus was formed on the premise of being completely without talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stark |first=Jeff |title=The One ... the Only ... Circus Redickuless |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1998-07-08/news/the-one-the-only-circus-redickuless/full/ |newspaper=SF Weekly |date=July 8, 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EBiJ0Mpk?url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1998-07-08/news/the-one-the-only-circus-redickuless/full/ |archivedate=February 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No actual performers were allowed, only non-performers without any experience or desire to create professional acts. Original line up included the Amazing Jarico Reese (now of [[Cyclecide|Cyclecide Bike Rodeo]]) the talentless magician, Speed Metal tap dance: two girls barely tap dancing to heavy metal, Dammit the Amazing Wonder Dog: Chicken John's pet dog that couldn't jump through a hoop, The Vegan Geek, Tall Pall (who's amazing skill was being tall), The Talking Mime, The Mad Cow (an angry Punk in a cow suit), The Flaming Vomiteer (developed by Steve Wilkerson ['96], wherein he would vomit on stage and set it on fire)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freaks and Fire: The Underground Reinvention of Circus Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr80p8R-qRwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=chicken+john+vomit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OxJ8UZSLOoXs2AXi3YCACQ&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=chicken%20john%20vomit&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other equally talentless acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circus of the Damned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R7GZ8ghL8wC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22Circus+Redickuless%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PhYQUfWUDcK6yAH89IDYAw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Circus%20Redickuless%22&amp;f=false|work=Spin|pages=123-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Circus Redickuless toured for four years in various forms with a revolving cast of troupe members.

The 1995 tour was documented in Phillip Glau's film called ''Circus Redickuless''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circus Redickuless|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJzWbnQdJFo}}&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently won "Best Documentary" at the [[1998 New York  Underground Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="IMDB: New York Underground Film Festival: 1998"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/New_York_Underground_Film_Festival/1998|title=IMDB entry for 1998 New York Underground Film Festival|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Andean country took part in the contest util the last edition in 2000 which was held again in Acapulco.

== History ==
Ecuador's history in the Latin American song contest did not yield any victories. Teleamazonas and Ecuavisa, however, achieved a number of top 5 finishes.

The [[Ecuadorians|Ecuatorian]] debut in the OTI Festival was successful because of Hilda Murillo's fifth place. After that, the country didn't repeat that success, and in the following two years, the delegation ended in the bottom five of the scoreboard. However, in 1977 the female singer Marielisa with her song "Sonreir cuando quiero llorar" (To smile when I want to cry) took the Ecuadorian broadcasters back to fifth place. In contrast, in 1978, 1979 and 1980, Ecuador registered its worst placings ever with two last places with zero points.

After some unsuccessful participations, in 1985 in [[Seville]], the indigenous [[Quechua people|Quechua]] singer Jesús Fichamba recorded a second-place finish for Ecuador for the first time with his song "La pinta, la niña y la Santa María" in a reference to the three boats led by Christopher Colombus, who discovered America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vistazo.com/tags/jesus-fichamba|title=Jesús Fichamba|work=Vistazo|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer, who appeared on stage with the traditional Quechua suit, was acclaimed.

Two years later in [[Lisbon]], the Andean country repeated the success with another indigenous singer, Gustavo Velázquez, and his ethnic pop song "Mi amigo el condor" (My friend the Condor).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1000012571/-1/Personajes%3A_Gustavo_Vel%C3%A1squez,_rom%C3%A1ntico_y_tropical.html#.WUGZD5Dyg2w|title=1987 después de ganar nuevamente la OTI de Ecuador, viaja a Lisboa, Portugal representando a nuestro país en la OTI Internacional|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Final ==
Ecuavisa and Teleamazonas also organised an annual national contest in order to select the Ecuatorian participant in the OTI Festival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As in the other participating countries who opted for this way of selecting their entrants, the winner was selected by a professional jury.

It is written, directed, edited, and scored by [[Jerrold Tarog]], and is a sequel to the critically and commercially successful 2015 film ''[[Heneral Luna]]'', which chronicled [[Antonio Luna]]'s life.&lt;ref name="pepcast"/&gt; Additional members of the ensemble cast include [[Carlo Aquino]], Mon Confiado, [[Epy Quizon]], [[Gwen Zamora]], [[Empress Schuck]], [[Alvin Anson]], and Rafa Siguion-Reyna. It was released on September 5, 2018.

==Plot==
Following the assassination of General [[Antonio Luna]], the task of purging Luna's loyalists in the Philippine Army falls to General [[Gregorio del Pilar|Gregorio "Goyo" del Pilar]], a young, brash general and a favorite of President [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. During a five-month break from combat, del Pilar and his unit, including his older brother Julian and his best friend Vicente Enriquez, capture Angel Bernal, the younger brother of Luna's former aides-de-camp, Manuel and José. They soon locate Manuel hiding with merchant Don Mariano Nable José and torture him into joining del Pilar's military personnel. When Manuel refuses, they kill him. Meanwhile, Joven Hernando, who now works for his uncle, is assigned to be del Pilar's photographer. 

While the Philippine Army relaxes and the American forces prepare for a second attack, General [[Jose Alejandrino|José Alejandrino]], a Luna ally spared from the purge, meets with [[Apolinario Mabini]], who has since resigned from Aguinaldo's cabinet after the death of Luna. Mabini implores Alejandrino to find out the real cause of Luna's death. Meanwhile, Aguinaldo joins del Pilar in [[Bulacan]] and promotes him to Major-General of [[Pangasinan]], while del Pilar begins to court Remedios, the elusive daughter of Don Mariano. During his time, Aguinaldo meets Mabini and offers him the post of Chief Justice, to which Mabini reluctantly accepts. 

Alejandrino travels to Manila to negotiate with General [[Elwell Otis]] and General [[Arthur MacArthur Jr.]], who reject his proposal. Soon after, hostilities resume and the Filipino side is caught off-guard. Aguinaldo orders the march of the Army to [[Pozorrubio, Pangasinan|Pozorrubio]] to meet with General [[Manuel Tinio]] and organize a fighting force. However, Tinio was defeated by the Americans, forcing Aguinaldo to retreat further north. The hard march, coupled with daily American attacks, the pressure of having to escort Aguinaldo's family and tensions between soldiers of Luna's old unit take a toll on del Pilar, leading him to ignore an American attack that wipes out their [[rearguard]] and captures Aguinaldo's mother and son. 

The group soon arrive at [[Mount Tirad]], where del Pilar [[Battle of Tirad Pass|devises a delaying strategy]] to buy Aguinaldo time to escape. Together with former [[Luna Sharpshooters|Luna Sharpshooter]] Lieutenant García, fortified trenches were dug along the route of the mountain. The following day, the Americans quickly capture a town at the foot of the mountain but are initially unable to penetrate the defenses. They soon find a route around the mountain, appearing behind the trenches, and the Filipinos are quickly overrun. Del Pilar, inspired by a vision induced by his [[PTSD]], resolves to finish the fight, but is shot and killed by an American sniper. As a result, his army's morale breaks and the defenders quickly surrender, with Aguinaldo being forced to flee. Joven and Kiko, Garcia's son, also flee, but Joven falls off a cliff after an encounter with an American soldier. The Americans strip del Pilar of his uniform and belongings and crudely bury him at Mount Tirad. 

Aguinaldo is captured by the Americans in [[Palanan, Isabela]] on March 23, 1901, effectively ending the war. Held as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Malacañang Palace]], he  is visited by his former aide-de-camp [[Manuel Quezon]]. Quezon surrendered to the Americans upon orders of his superior, General [[Tomás Mascardo]], to be able to visit Aguinaldo to verify his capture and consult whether Mascardo should surrender. Aguinaldo instructed Quezon that the decision for Mascardo to surrender is up to Mascardo himself.

Mabini is also captured by the Americans and exiled to [[Guam]] where he pens his own narrative of the war entitled ''La Revolución Filipina'' (The Philippine Revolution). General Alejandrino's position is also overrun. Remedios receives a letter from del Pilar.  

In a series of mid-credit scenes, Joven is rescued by Kiko and Eduardo Rusca, Luna's former aide; Aguinaldo in 1935 and his running mate, Raymundo Melliza, watch as his [[Philippine presidential election, 1935|presidential campaign]] posters are replaced by those of Quezon.

==Production==
Plans for a sequel to [[Jerrold Tarog]]'s ''[[Heneral Luna]]'' went underway after its critical and commercial success.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; Tarog envisioned the sequel as being about [[Gregorio del Pilar]], a young General who, like ''Heneral Luna''{{'}}s titular protagonist [[Antonio Luna]], was among the Filipino historical figures during the [[Philippine–American War]]. Accordingly, [[Paulo Avelino]], who played Del Pilar in ''Luna'', came aboard to reprise his role.&lt;ref name="luna"&gt;{{cite news|title=Watch: After ''Heneral Luna'', a movie on Gregorio del Pilar is in the works, Paulo Avelino to star|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/111127-heneral-luna-gregorio-del-pilar-movie-paulo-avelino|accessdate=August 22, 2017|work=[[Rappler]]|date=October 29, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916040832/http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/111127-heneral-luna-gregorio-del-pilar-movie-paulo-avelino|archivedate=September 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tarog's research for ''Goyo'' involved studying biographies authored by [[Teodoro Kalaw]] as well as crossing the [[Tirad Pass]].&lt;ref name="begins"&gt;{{cite news|last1=San Diego Jr.|first1=Bayani|title=''Goyo'' begins|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/233852/goyo-begins|accessdate=August 22, 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 11, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822154940/http://entertainment.inquirer.net/233852/goyo-begins|archivedate=August 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarog again incorporated several prominent Filipino figures including the likes of [[Apolinario Mabini]] and [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], aiming for a scope larger than what was present in ''Heneral Luna''. Tarog co-wrote the film's screenplay with Rody Vera, who has said he had thoroughly studied ''Luna'' "to understand the flow of the conversations and other details unique to each character".&lt;ref name="begins"/&gt;

''Goyo'' entered [[pre-production]] in January 2017.&lt;ref name=wethepvblic&gt;{{cite news|title=Look: ''Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral'' is in pre-production |url=http://wethepvblic.com/look-goyo-ang-batang-heneral-pre-production/#.WOsTKzuGOHs |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=We The Pvblic |date=January 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410133054/http://wethepvblic.com/look-goyo-ang-batang-heneral-pre-production/ |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare his scenes, Avelino underwent [[horseback riding]] lessons in March 2017.&lt;ref name="begins"/&gt; Tarog projected a 50-day film shoot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabato |first1=Regine |title=''Bliss'' director hopes audiences reflect on abuse |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2017/05/11/jerrold-tarog-bliss-abuse.html |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |date=May 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512170556/http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2017/05/11/jerrold-tarog-bliss-abuse.html |archivedate=May 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Jerrold Tarog|Tarog, Jerrold]] |user= JerroldTarog |number=884614889918021632 |date= July 10, 2017 |title='Goyo' begins http://entertainment.inquirer.net/233852/goyo-begins … @inquirerdotnet (Technically, we've been shooting since May but okay) |access-date=August 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete [[ensemble cast]] was also revealed in a photo taken during the May shoot, including the likes of Mon Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo, [[Epy Quizon]] as Apolinario Mabini, [[Benjamin Alves]] as [[Manuel L.

The main cast also includes [[Ashley Tisdale]], [[Robbie Jones (actor)|Robbie Jones]], [[Heather Hemmens]], [[Matt Barr]], [[Gail O'Grady]], and [[Sharon Leal]].

In May 2010, ''Hellcats'' had been picked by [[The CW]] for the fall 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwtvpr.com/the-cw/releases/view?id=39346 THE CW ANNOUNCES 2010-2011 SCHEDULE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tv by the numbers press release"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Life Unexpected, One Tree Hill Renewed; Nikita, Hellcats Picked Up By CW |last=Gorman |first=Bill |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/05/18/life-unexpected-one-tree-hill-renewed-nikita-hellcats-picked-up-by-cw/51741 |date=May 18, 2010 |work=TV by the Numbers |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521030419/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/05/18/life-unexpected-one-tree-hill-renewed-nikita-hellcats-picked-up-by-cw/51741 |archivedate=May 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="press release futoncritic"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The CW Announces 2010-2011 Schedule |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/05/20/the-cw-announces-2010-2011-schedule/20100520cw01/ |date=April 14, 2010 |work=[[The CW Television Network]]|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially with a 13-episode order, The CW aired the series after ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' on Wednesday nights.

==Series overview==
''Hellcats'' follows Marti Perkins, a pre-law college student at Lancer University, who lost her scholarship and has no other choice but to join the college's cheer squad, the Hellcats, in order to obtain a new one. There she meets her new roommate and team captain Savannah Monroe, the injured flyer Alice Verdura, her new partner Lewis Flynn and the Hellcats coach Vanessa Lodge who hopes to win nationals, otherwise the cheer leading program will be cut. All the while, Marti also has to deal with her financially unstable and sometimes irresponsible mother, Wanda Perkins, whom she often has to bail out of difficult situations, and her best friend Dan Patch.

==Cast and characters==
[[File:Hellcats.PNG|thumb|left|The main cast of ''Hellcats''; from left to right: Heather Hemmens, Matt Barr, Aly Michalka, Robbie Jones, and Ashley Tisdale]]
*Marti Perkins ([[Aly Michalka]]) is the protagonist of the series and a townie from Memphis, Tennessee. Described as "wicked smart", she is a pre-law student at Lancer University. Her mother, Wanda Perkins ([[Gail O'Grady]]), works at the university pub and is a party girl who never grew up. Her mother's behavior is, for the most part, an embarrassment to Marti. When Lancer's administrative department cuts scholarships for Lancer employees and families, Marti learns she can get a new one by choosing one of Lancer's programs. She then auditions for a position on Lancer's cheerleading team, the Hellcats.

*Savannah Monroe ([[Ashley Tisdale]]), the captain of the Hellcats, is described as "peppy and petite" with a "fierce intensity". She initially clashes with Marti, but realizes she is the godsend that the Hellcats need to win the championship. She votes for Marti when the team has auditions for a new flyer. Savannah is from a very religious, upper-middle class southern family. After a fight with her family, she left the university she was attending, Memphis Christian, and transferred to secular Lancer. Her sister Charlotte, a recurring role played by [[Emma Lahana]], is the captain of the Cyclones, the cheerleading team at Savannah's old school and a Hellcats' rival.

*Alice ([[Heather Hemmens]]) is dangerously [[narcissistic]] and after she injures her wrist, she dislikes the idea of Marti replacing her on the squad, or the attention Marti receives from Alice's ex-boyfriend, Lewis Flynn.

*Lewis ([[Robbie Jones (actor)|Robbie Jones]]) is one of the Hellcats' bases and is an easy-going guy who has a love for action. He was once a star on the Lancer football team but quit when he discovered a scandal of players being paid by the college. He tried out for the Hellcats team when his then-girlfriend Alice encouraged him to do so in order to gain scholarship money after the football scandal, and instantly became hooked. He has an instant attraction to Marti. They later start dating.

*Dan Patch ([[Matt Barr]]) is a townie who is Marti's friend. He had an unspoken crush on her but now is dating Savannah, Marti's new friend on the team. He's of Irish descent with at least six siblings. 

*Vanessa Lodge ([[Sharon Leal]]) is a former Hellcat cheerleader who is now the team's coach. Her job is threatened if the Hellcats do not place at the national competition.

*Supporting cast includes Red Raymond ([[Jeff Hephner]]), the Lancer's football coach who shares a romantic past with Vanessa, and Derrick Altman ([[D. B. Woodside]]), a doctor who works at Lancer University and is now Vanessa's boyfriend. Bill Marsh ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) is the college's athletic director who is still involved in a "pay for play" scandal with players that could get the school's programs (including the Hellcats) suspended. Morgan Pepper (Craig Anderson) is a pre-law student and Marti's classmate. He later befriends Marti and joins her to solve a legal case introduced by their teacher Julian ([[Gale Harold]]). Other Hellcats members include Darwin (Jeremy Wong),&lt;ref name="afterellen" /&gt; and Frankie (Alana Randall). Kathy ([[Magda Apanowicz]]) is a member of the Cyclones, usually called "Nasty Kathy".

 |ShortSummary = Marti realizes that Wanda is in the audience during qualifiers and banishes her from the stadium. Savannah must choose to stay and compete with the Hellcats or join her sister Charlotte who fell and injured herself when she was competing for the Hellcats' rival Memphis Christian College squad. The Hellcats arrange to switch places with another team, so they can postpone the competition and Savannah may be with her sister. Savannah leaves to take care of her sister though her sister does not welcome her pleasantly and her mother ignores her presence. Marti decides no to tell Wanda about her competition being postponed so she wouldn't assist. Savannah's mom invites her to a praying circle for Charlotte's health but it's the same time of the competition. Savannah confides in Marti about her uptight Christian parents disowning her because of her choice in transferring from Memphis Christian to the secular Lancer University; Marti confides in Savannah that in the past her mother's presence also tenses her up and makes her lose her concentration (the reason she failed in a past gymnastics competition). Savannah competes (after saying a prayer to God for her family and her sister). Wanda shows up, though Marti initially begins to kick her out, she realizes her mom only assists because she is proud of her and decides to let Wanda stay. In the end, Marti is able to perform even with her mother's presence and The Hellcats win the competition.

 |ShortSummary = The Hellcats decide to throw a [[toga party]] as a last farewell. Meanwhile, Marti, Vanessa, Julian, and Red hatch a plan to take down Bill Marsh once and for all. Step 1 of the plan was for Red to have Bill say something threatening and betraying about Jake, which they recorded. Step 2 they ask that Jake confess to robbing the pharmacy so Travis can be set free but Jake refused and shut them down. They showed Jake the recording of Bill Marsh, but he stormed out angry. Hopeless, Marti goes to see Travis one more time where she tells him that Jake refused to confess so they are going to take this to the media. She tells him about their situation and Travis tries to stop Marti from letting down the Hellcats but Marti is still determined to set Travis free. On the other hand, Alice and Savannah invite firemen to their party. In the party Savannah seems to be getting along with the fireman Keith. After Marti comes to the party Alice questions her about Jake and finds him on the football field. Jake resists but Alice finally convinces him to confess and prays with him; regardless of her disbelief in God. Finally, Jake calls a press conference and confesses but to his surprise, everyone is proud of him and considers him a hero. Red, Julian and Marti blackmail Bill Marsh with his recording so he will retire without pension and he accepts. As Travis is leaving jail he makes eye contact with Jake while Jake is entering the jail. After Jake gets to his cell, Jake starts to cry. In the last scene we see the Hellcats singing "[[Redemption Song]]" in Cheertown with Travis, Marti's mom, Vanessa, Julian, Lewis, Savannah's sister and Morgan.

They compete by doing a routine in front of the band, which gave both teams permission to use the song, where the best routine claims the song for nationals. The band turns out to be lazy and rude drunks who pick the Hellcats due to their skimpier uniform. The Hellcats reject the song and the band, followed suit by the Cyclones. Savannah finds out the father of Charlotte's baby is her ex-boyfriend, Noah. Charlotte announces wedding plans with the baby's father, but an interrogation from Savannah forces Noah to admit that he has no feelings for Charlotte. Savannah tries to tell Charlotte that marrying Noah is a mistake because he doesn't love her, but she refuses to see sense. Eventually Charlotte realises that things won't work, and calls off the engagement. Travis slips about Marti's father with a song that Marti's father wrote, causing Marti to regain interest and confronting Wanda to find out more about him. Wanda continues to deny Marti information about her father, stating that he was simply a bad man. Marti doesn't accept this, and goes through her father's things in the hopes of getting to know him better.

== Reception ==
[[File:Alyson Michalka.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[Newsday]]'' praised Michalka by saying she has a big talent. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' criticized her performance.]]

===Critical reception===
The show has received mixed reviews, with [[Metacritic]] giving it a score of 51 percent, based on reviews from 22 critics.&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Critic Reviews for Hellcats Season 1 at Metacritic |publisher= [[CBS]] | work = [[Metacritic]] |url= http://www.metacritic.com/tv/hellcats/season-1/critic-reviews |accessdate= September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised and criticized by critics in several round-up reviews of [[2010 in television]]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' had a good first impression of the pilot episode, saying ''Hellcats'' has a predictable story but, on the other hand, Michalka and Tisdale seem perfect for their roles. The newspaper also wrote the cheerleading world portrayed in the series is a "fun and deep world to explore".&lt;ref name="los angeles"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pilot View: The CW's new drama 'Hellcats{{'-}} |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 1, 2010|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/07/pilot-view-the-cws-new-drama-hellcats.html |last=Elena Fernandez|first=Maria|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal later gave a complete review of the series, comparing it to 1983's film ''[[Flashdance]]'' aimed squarely at audiences too young for ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' but too old for ''[[Hannah Montana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/08/entertainment/la-et-hellcatsnikita-20100908|title=Television Review: 'Hellcats' and 'Nikita' on the CW|last=McNamara|first=Mary|date=September 8, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mara Reinstein of ''[[Us Weekly]]'' gave an early review of the first episode of the series, saying ''Hellcats'' has "plenty of winning elements" but added that the series lacks spirit. She also praised the performance and Marti's relationship with her mother.&lt;ref name="us weekly"&gt;{{Cite news|title=News - Review Hellcats|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=August 24, 2010|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/review--hellcats-2010248 |last=Reinstein|first=Mara|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[ABC News]] listed ''Hellcats'' as one of the ten best new shows of 2010's fall season and described the series as "almost laughably formulaic" and added it "works like a charm".&lt;ref name="abc news"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Among Fall's TV Frosh, 10 New Shows Worth Sampling|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=September 1, 2010|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=11531852 |last=Moore|first=Frazie|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the series' promise, and said that the series has a ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''-like element in the script, while also criticizing Michalka and acclaiming O'Grady's performance. Lowry also added ''Hellcats''{{'s}} premiere "isn't quite unabashedly trashy enough to completely qualify as a guilty pleasure".&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Hellcats Review - TV Shows Reviews |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date= September 5, 2010 |url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943422.html |last= Lowry |first= Brian |accessdate= October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curt Wagner of ''[[ChicagoNow]]'' said the series is predictable and has unrealistic situations, and criticized the lack of fun in the jokes. The journal also praised Tisdale's performance, claiming she was the one who made him laugh the most.&lt;ref name="chicago now"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Review: CW cheerleader dramedy 'Hellcats' fails to 'Bring It On{{'-}}|work=[[ChicagoNow]]|date=September 8, 2010|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/show-patrol/2010/09/review-cw-cheerleader-dramedy-hellcats-fails-to-bring-it-on.html|last=Wagner|first=Curt|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancellation and possible reboot ==

According to the producer, [[Tom Welling]], he states that the reason of cancellation was due to the change of CW president of entertainment from Dawn Ostroff to Mark Pedowitz. He also said that there was a possibility of a reboot of the series with a new cast and cameos from the previous cast if enough fans continue to watch the original series on CW Seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachael Ellenbogen |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/hellcats-coming-back-producer-tom-welling-reveals-cancelation-reason-2588890 |title=‘Hellcats’ Is Coming Back, Producer Tom Welling Reveals Cancelation Reason |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16269">An '''ideograph''' or '''virtue word''' is a word frequently used in political discourse that uses an abstract concept to develop support for political positions. Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom]]&gt;, &lt;[[democracy]]&gt; and &lt;[[rights]]&gt;. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) to mark off ideographs.

The term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic [[Michael Calvin McGee]] (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions.  McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, J. (2001).  ''Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, [[Celeste Condit]] and [[John Lucaites]], influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=xxii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideographs are common in [[advertising]] and political discourse.

==Definition==
McGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;McGee, M.C. (1980). The “ideograph”: A link between rhetoric and ideology. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 66'', 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins his essay by defining the practice of [[ideology]] as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of [[ideology]] create social control.

McGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of [[political philosophy]].”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;  He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”:  “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse.  It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

An ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition.  Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the [[vocabulary]] for public values and decision-making that they are linked to [[ideology]].

== Examples ==
There is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom of speech]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, and &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;. In each case, the term does not have a specific [[referent]].  Rather, each term refers to an [[abstraction]] which may have many different meanings depending on its [[context (language use)|context]].  It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power.  If the definition of a term such as &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt; can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.

By encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of [[Richard Nixon]]’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]] by invoking “the principle of [[confidentiality]].” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the "[[rule of law]]", Nixon pitted "the principle of [[confidentiality]]” against the “[[rule of law]],” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt; Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of [[confidentiality]]” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

While the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic [[rhetorical criticism]], some [[political consulting|political consultants]] and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.

Ideographs appear in [[advertising]] and [[political campaigns]] regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “[[Social equality|equality]]” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit &amp; Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=90|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama justified the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the &lt;[[rule of law]]&gt; and &lt;democratic values&gt;, we must fight against &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;.  Obama used this term to his advantage and made &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt; appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=91|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Carol|title=In the Name of Terrorism: Presidents on Political Violence in the Post-World War II Era|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=2|edition=SUNY series on the Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNXc1s_BKSoC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=YOlgZgkKFn&amp;dq=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;, or &lt;[[privacy]]&gt; epitomized in [[eugenics]]. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the [[Nazis]] used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasian|first=M.A.|title=The rhetoric of eugenics in Anglo-American thought|year=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as "[[glittering generalities]],” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=Lincoln to Henry Pierce|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/pierce.htm|publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to practitioners, [[marketing|corporate marketing]] and [[political consulting]] use key terms in this way, concentrating on the [[image]] and [[brand management|branding]] of terms. For example, [[Frank Luntz]] tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as "trigger words" in an [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luntz|first=Frank|title=Words that work: It’s not what you say, it’s what people hear|year=2007|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
There are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics.  First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use.  By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.

Second, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the [[rhetoric|rhetorical study]] of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.

This leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics.  McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children.  This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).

==Cultural variability==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity."&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures.  The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures.  Such as the concept of [[femininity]] that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.

==Critical use==
At the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the [[Synchronic analysis|diachronic]] structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific [[rhetorical situations]] as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[patriarchy]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as &lt;[[family values]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, D. L. (1998).  The rhetoric of &lt;family values&gt;: Scapegoating, utopia, and the privatization of social responsibility.  ''Western Journal of Communication, 62'', 387-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;[[Egalitarianism|equality]]&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Condit, C. M. &amp; Lucaites, J. L. (1993).  ''Crafting quality: America’s Anglo-African word''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include [[photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. L. &amp; Winkler, C. K. (1997). Representative forms and the visual ideograph: The Iwo Jima image in editorial cartoons.  ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 83'', 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt; and objects represented in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. P. (1996).  The cigarette as representative ideograph in the debate over environmental tobacco smoke.  ''Communication Monographs, 64'', 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Centre for Theatre Research''' sometimes also known as The International Centre for Theatre Creation was founded in 1970 by [[Peter Brook]] and [[Micheline Rozan]].  It is often abbreviated to the [[acronym]] CIRT as in French the group is called the Centre International de Recherche Théâtrale.  The centre is a multicultural theatrical research and production company based out of the [[Bouffes du Nord]] theatre in Paris since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre'', edited Colin Chambers, Continuum, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8264-4959-X}}, Page 384&lt;/ref&gt; The first three years of the company were taken up by exploring a fundamental theatrical question (see below)

== Funding ==
Brook had previously been sponsored for limited periods by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] or the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] (at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]]).  Brook and Rozan acquired sufficient funding to sustain Brook's work for three years.  Working with a core company and several visiting collaborators. 
A budget of $1 million was established: $100,000 to set up the organization, and $300,000 for each year from 1971-1973{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  Money was raised from the French government and various international foundations ([[Ford Foundation]], [[Gulbenkian Foundation]] and [[Anderson Foundation]]s)
Money also came from the government of [[Iran]] in the form of a commission for a work at the [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]/[[Persepolis]] festival in 1971. Work was begun even though the full three-year budget was not secured at the outset.

== First three-year journey ==
This multinational assembly of actors, dancers, musicians and other performers travelled widely in the Middle East and Africa in the early 1970s.  This was as a three-year 'pilgrimage' to answer the question "What were the common stories, the recognizable shorthands, the instant abstractions, the shared outlines of story and character with which an international group could work?"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
On this three-year sojourn, they produced two major works ''[[Orghast]]'' I &amp; II, performed in 1971 at the [[Shiraz Arts Festival]] in Iran in the [[Achaemenid]] ruins of [[Persepolis]] and [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], and ''[[The Conference of Birds]]'' developed in [[West Africa]] and completed in 1974 at [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM]] in Brooklyn, New York.

"'''Knock Knock'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], taken from her fourth studio album ''[[After the Storm (Monica album)|After the Storm]]'' (2003). It was written and produced by rapper-producer [[Missy Elliott]] and commissioned following the delay and subsequent reconstruction of Monica's 2002 album, ''[[All Eyez on Me (Monica album)|All Eyez on Me]]''. One out of a handful of tracks which Elliott contributed, the song incorporates elements of 1970s-style [[soul music|soul]], as well as [[hip hop]], and is built around excerpts of the record "It's a Terrible Thing to Waste Your Love" as written by Lee Hatim and released by [[The Masqueraders]] in 1976. Rapper-producer [[Kanye West]], whose 2005 ''[[Freshmen Adjustment]]'' [[demo (music)|mixtape recording]] "Apologize" the track is based on, is listed as the song's co-producer.

[[J Records]] released "Knock Knock", alongside fellow Elliott production "[[Get It Off]]," as one of two singles following leading single "[[So Gone]]" during the third quarter of 2003. The song was lauded by critics, who praised its streetwise production and Monica's rap part on the track. A moderate success at the charts, it peaked at number 75 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 24 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. Its accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]], was filmed as a two-part story with "So Gone".

==Writing and recording==
"Knock Knock" was written and produced by [[Missy Elliott]] for Mass Confusion Productions, with additional production by [[Kanye West]].&lt;ref name="Booklet"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=After the Storm |publisher=J Records |others=Monica |titlelink=After the Storm (Monica album) |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Hatim is also credited in the song because it contains excerpts from The Masquerader' 1975 single, "It's a Terrible Thing to Waste Your Love."&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt; West previously [[sample (music)|sampled]] the track in his own [[demo (music)|demo recording]], "Apologize", which was later released on his 2005 mixtape ''[[Freshmen Adjustment]]''.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt; "Knock Knock" was recorded by Carlos Bedoya at [[Criteria Studios|The Hit Factory Criteria]] in [[Miami, Florida]] with further assistance from [[Marcella Araica]].&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt; Scott Kieklak [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the song, while [[Audio mastering|mastering]] was overseen by [[Tom Coyne (music engineer)|Tom Coyne]].&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt; Elliott also provided additional vocals.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;

The song is one out of three Elliott-produced records on ''[[After the Storm (Monica album)|After the Storm]]'', commissioned by [[J Records]] head and executive producer [[Clive Davis]] after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album ''[[Under Construction (Missy Elliott album)|Under Construction]]'' (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album ''[[All Eyez on Me (Monica album)|All Eyez on Me]]'' the year before.&lt;ref name="vh1 1"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Shaheem |last1=Reid |first2=Quddus |last2=Philippe |first3=Curtis |last3=Waller |title=Monica Revises Leaked LP With Help From Missy Elliott |work=[[MTV News]] |publisher=[[VH1]].com |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1471325/20030416/monica.jhtml |accessdate=2009-02-12 |date=2003-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111143229/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1471325/20030416/monica.jhtml |archivedate=2008-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a [[sequel]] to "[[So Gone]]," another Elliott track.&lt;ref name="vh1 2"/&gt; In an interview with ''[[MTV News]]'' at the 2003 [[BET Awards]], Monica stated that "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we went through all that stuff, now it's time for you to get lost. This is the end of the road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record."&lt;ref name="vh1 2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Corey|last=Moss|title='Knock Knock,' Who's There?

And she creates new trends by doing that."&lt;ref name="vh1 2"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
[[File:Kanye at ACL Music Festival 1 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|right|140px|Rapper [[Kanye West]] is credited as a co-producer on the track.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;]]
"Knock Knock" received generally positive reviews from music critics. [[Allmusic]] editor Andy Kellman felt that the song, along with Elliott's other contributions on the album, provides "a bulk of the most exciting material, with just the right amount of swagger added to the singer's more wide-eyed personality of the '90s."&lt;ref name="Kellman"&gt;Kellman, Andy. "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r643951|pure_url=yes}} After the Storm – Monica]". [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Melisa Tang from ''The Situation'' called Monica's vocals "exceptional" and felt that she "does a pretty decent job" at [[emcee]]ing on the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesituation.co.uk/reviews/monica_review.html |title=After the Storm Review |last=Tang |first=Melisa |work=The Situation |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109215114/http://www.thesituation.co.uk/reviews/monica_review.html |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Vanessa Jones declared "Knock Knock" a "streetwise party anthem."&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,Prometheus Global Media,464194,00.html|title=After the Storm Review|last=Jones|first=Vanessa|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 18, 2003|pages=76–77|accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked the song among the album's highlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dA4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22AFTER+THE+STORM%22+REVIEW+%22KNOCK+KNOCK%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pvG4UaLpEoGStAbWnIDQBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22AFTER%20THE%20STORM%22%20REVIEW%20%22KNOCK%20KNOCK%22&amp;f=false|title=Essentials: Review|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=2003-06-28|accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First released in the United States, "Knock Knock" debuted at number 89 on the national [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the week of October 2, 2003, the fifth-highest debut of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Billboard Hot 100 (2004-08-28)|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/search/detailed_chart_display.jsp?g=s&amp;cd=Aug-28-2004&amp;f=The_Billboard_Hot_100&amp;model.chartId=3055081|work=Billboard|accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single remained eighteen weeks on the chart, but as it failed to climb any higher during its runwith peak positions at number 75, the song eventually became Monica's lowest-charting, video-accompanied single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 since 1999's "[[Street Symphony]]". Just as predecessor, "[[So Gone]]," the track was more successful on ''Billboard''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s component charts: "Knock Knock" reached number 24 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart and number 37 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay]] chart. The remix of the single featured producer [[Kanye West]].

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Knock Knock" was shot by director [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]], and produced by Dawn Rose for Partizan Entertainment. It was filmed in various locations throughout Miami, Florida on in mid-late July 2003, and widely serves as the sequel ("Part II") to the video for "[[So Gone]]", the first single released from ''After the Storm''. The video features a second appearance by actor [[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]] (Antwone Fisher), who plays Monica's boyfriend, and intercuts a clip of simultaneously released club single "[[Get It Off]]" with a dance scene.

The "Knock Knock" video premiered worldwide in July 2003. It charted well on several video-chart countdowns, including peak positions of number 3 on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[106 &amp; Park]]''.

There are two versions of the video, both featuring the same premise but with certain different scenes.

'''Le Roy Benjamin''' (1917–1997) was the sculptor and manipulator of the marionettes as well as the voice impersonator for a vaudeville and television act called the '''Le Roy Brothers Marionettes'''.

==Early life==
[Http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Le_Roy_Benjamin,_Danny_Thomas,_Danny_Thomas_marionette.tif]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1803319|title=Thomas, Danny (1912-1991), entertainer and philanthropist|last=Marshall|first=Stephen G.|date=2000-02|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=American National Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy was born in Chicago to father Solomon and mother Minnie or "Mae". His father was of Persian descent and his mother of Polish descent. Etta Benjamin (1924–2009) was his wife, his business partner, his stage audio and lighting expert, and a fellow accomplished modern artist. She was born in St. Louis to Ida and Nat Perkins who come from Polish/Russian descent.

At fourteen years old, Le Roy began working at an ice cream shop during the Depression to help his family. He always liked to work with hands. He began performing his own puppet shows for children in a Chicago candy shop. His first stage act experience began in 1939 at the New York World's Fair&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Medicus (P.)|title=[Amateur film: Medicus collection: New York World's Fair, 1939-40] (Reel 3) (Part III)|date=April 1942|url=https://archive.org/details/Medicusc1939_10|accessdate=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he helped a marionette act. Then he went on the road with his own marionette act.

==Le Roy Brothers Marionettes==
His Le Roy Brothers Marionette act required two people on the stage to manipulate the marionettes, initially included his brother, Melvin Benjamin, as the other marionettist and later his brother-in- law, Earl Perkins, who replaced Melvin. He married his wife, Etta Perkins in 1946, who managed the behind-the-scenes audio and lights production.

The Le Roy Brothers Marionettes (1939–1955) was one of the most celebrated and requested vaudeville acts in America, showcasing the top vaudeville stars. The marionettes which astounded audiences in disbelief included lifelike comedians and actors: humorous Danny Thomas, Jimmy Durante performing with piano,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1953-03-14|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis; and drummer Gene Krupa whose drums would explode from being played with .38 caliber blanks going off,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1945-08-04|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other favorite characters such as the original woman on the moon, breakaway detaching fluorescent skeletons and jitterbug dancers, and a clown blowing up balloons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT33&amp;lpg=PT33|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1946-01-26|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would often break the "third wall" and bring the marionettes into the audience as part of their unique routine. This is one example why most consider Le Roy the master in his craft. He is considered the best marionettist of all time.

The Le Roy Brothers Marionettes performed at all of the popular state of the art theatres of their time including: Chez Paree, 5100 Club, Club Royale, Club Carnival, Roxy Theatre New York, RKO Palace Theatre, the Olympia, and The Normandie Roof. Their act opened for [[Danny Thomas]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], amongst others; while [[Joan Blondell]] occasionally participated with the marionette routine. Not very many vaudeville acts made the transition from live stage to television. The Le Roy Brothers Marionettes was one of the acts that did from television's "The Toast of the Town"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/toast-of-the-town/episodes/|title=Toast of the Town|last=TV.com|website=TV.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (aka: The Ed Sullivan Show) Season 2 Episode 47 aired on August 6, 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/toast-of-the-town/august-6-1950-115063/|title=Toast of the Town: August 6, 1950|last=TV.com|website=TV.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; had their own network TV show "Sandy Strong" sponsored by Ovaltine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ss21AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69&amp;lpg=PT69|title=Kids' TV: The First Twenty-Five Years|last=Fischer|first=Stuart|date=2014-06-10|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781497633902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on "The Mickey Mouse Club"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.originalmmc.com/circusacts.html|title=Original Mickey Mouse Club Show: Circus Acts|website=www.originalmmc.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 1 in 1955 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.originalmmc.com/images/Circusacts/leroymarionettes.jpg|title=Mickey Mouse Club - Season 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the transition to TV, some vaudeville performers became even more popular to become household names and segue onward to film. Those performers include Danny Thomas, Jimmy Durante, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis…the very same people who were perhaps first immortalized by the Le Roy Brothers Marionettes.

Danny Thomas and Le Roy created the closest relationship. In the early years, when Danny was in vaudeville as a stand-up comedian, Danny would always ask Le Roy to be his opening act. Le Roy opened for Danny for two years in a row at the Chez Paree in Chicago. Then Danny went on to be a famous television actor/producer. Later, he founded the [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. Every time at the hospital's annual fundraising event, Danny would immediately seek out Le Roy in the audience as a true testament to their enduring friendship that lasted decades. Danny wrote a musical interlude about Le Roy's act singing "I'm just a marionette tied to the strings of your heart". Le Roy also fostered close friendships with Broadway/TV actor Jack Soo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jacksoo.com/trailer.htm|title=You Don't Know Jack: The Jack Soo Story|website=www.jacksoo.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and singer Nat King Cole and amongst others.

The most respectable agent would often reach out to Le Roy to pitch new projects. Reporters of that time stated the Le Roy Brother Marionettes performance was "the best marionette act in show business".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Later life==
After vaudeville, LeRoy and Etta continued their creative entrepreneurial success as a framing and fine art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/artist/Etta_Benjamin_Cien/11275165/Etta_Benjamin_Cien.aspx|title=Etta Benjamin Cien - Artist, Fine Art Prices, Auction Records for Etta Benjamin Cien|website=www.askart.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; business called the Hillside House of Originals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1970/01/24/forward|title=Forward!|last=Ross|first=Lillian|date=1970-01-17|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-01-22|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then they leased out their production space to BET (Black Entertainment Television) for several years.

'''''Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Krome Studios]] ([[Tantalus Media]] for the Nintendo DS) and published by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]], released on September 14, 2010. It is based on the [[Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole|film of the same name]], and includes some elements from the [[Guardians of Ga'Hoole|books]]. The game is available for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]] and [[Xbox 360]] as well as [[Nintendo DS]]. The game takes place during the events of the movie.

==Plot==
===Introduction===

The story of the game follows the tale of Shard and his friends. The story coincides with the plot of the movie.
In the Canyonlands, The Glauxian Monks worshiped the owl god Glaux, hidden away from the strifes of life. Surtr and the Pure Ones had been defeated years ago by Lyze of Kiel and the land had been returned to peace. However, during the watch of a young guard named Grettir, the Monastery was attacked by Hagsfiends. After losing most of what he knew as his family, he was plagued of guilt and many others who had heard the story branded him a traitor and a coward. After many years of isolation, Grettir took a mate named Lygeia and had an egg together. On the night that the owlet was to hatch, the nest of Grettir was attacked by owls and they killed the Grettir and his mate, but the owlet, now named Shard, survived.

===Tutorial===

Shard charges into battle, at the side of Allomere, destroying catapults and defeating hagsfiends. But as the battle continues, Shard gets surrounded by hagsfiends and as they collapse in for the kill, Shard wakes up from his dream and we are introduced to our two main characters, Shard and Parzival. Allomere, a character from the Legends of the Guardians movie is the ryb for both of the students. As Shard takes offense to Parzival insulting his father, it escalates into a fight between the two owls and Allomere gives the flint mops, or work for punishment. Ezylryb asks to take care of flint mops. The flint mop is lighting torches for the Great Tree and just as Shard and Parzival finish their job, the Search and Rescue chaw comes in with a band of owlets, later revealed to be Soren, Gylfie, Twilight and Digger, and they are being attacked by a murder of crows. After Shard and Parvizal had cleared away the crows, the owlets went to parliament to tell them the story St. Aegolius and what the Pure Ones were doing. Parliament came to the decision that Allomere would go to the canyonlands to verify the truth of Soren's claim. After the decision, Ezylryb gave Shard the task of secret missions as a Guardian and set off to the Desert Kingdom of Kuneer.

===The Desert of Kuneer===

Shard is tasked with finding an eagle named Streak and finding out the cause for the disappearance of young owlets in the area. Shard and Parzival find Streak imprisoned by bats allied with the Pure Ones and free him. Streak becomes Shard's wingman along with Parzival and they go on missions for the rest of the story. Streak reveals that the owlet snatching is true and that the bats are being rewarded for their loyalty by being given some Non-Tyto owlets. Shard and his band go on a mission to find the hideout by destroying bat sanctuaries to make them reveal the location of the hideout. After one of the bats told Streak it was east of the sanctuary to find the secret hideout filled with bats and Pure Ones. After they defeat the defenses of the hideout, reinforcements come to defend the hideout, which guarantees the rumors of the owlets being held there. The group finds some bats still taking owlets from nests and after rescuing them, the group realizes that these problems aren't going to stop unless they take the fight to the bats. After a small attack on the Streak's Nest, the band goes and devises a plan to force the bats out of the hiding places within the compound by forcing them out with fire. The battle becomes more intense as the hideouts are burnt out and the band defeats the defenses. After what seemed like a victory, the Bat Chieftain comes out of hiding to fight with the protagonists. After vanquishing both the Chieftain and what remained of the bats, they free a wandering hermit named Uriah, who tells them that the Pure Ones are working with the bats to gain control of a mysterious substance called flecks. He asks to be part of Shard's band and becomes one of his wingmen and the band returns to the Great Tree to inform them about what was happening in the Desert of Kuneer.

===The Forest Kingdom of Tyto===
Shard is tasked with finding the activities of the Pure Ones have in the Forest of Tyto and finding locals who could know what they are doing. Shard and Parzival follow a squadron of Pure Ones who lead them to a prison with resistance fighters locked up in them.

==Gameplay==
According to ''[[GameSpot]]'', the gameplay is airborne combat. The player locks on to enemy owls or structures, and the player has the option to attack. If the player chooses to do so, the player-controlled owl will "go zooming toward your enemy and wallop it with your claws" as stated in the review. ''GameSpot'' also stated that there are some  parts where the player has to navigate through gates in a specific amount of time.&lt;ref name="GSpotX360" /&gt; The player can choose between four owl species to play as before the game starts, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. These include  [[barn owl]], [[spotted owl]], [[great gray owl]], and [[great horned owl]].

The original musical soundtrack of the ''Legend of the Guardians'' video game was composed by [[Winifred Phillips]]&lt;ref name="itunes.apple.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/legend-guardians-the-owls/id393012164 |title=Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (Original Videogame Soundtrack) by Winifred Phillips on iTunes |website=[[iTunes Store]] |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced by [[Winnie Waldron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winifredphillips.com/videos/video-quicktime-1.htm |title=Winifred Phillips, Video |website=[[Winifred Phillips]] |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was released on iTunes by [[WaterTower Music]], a division of Warner Bros.

'''''Magic in the Moonlight''''' is a 2014 American [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Woody Allen]]. It is Allen's 44th film.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A. O.|title=Metaphysical Sleight of Heart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/movies/magic-in-the-moonlight-another-woody-allen-odd-couple.html|accessdate=30 August 2015|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Emma Stone]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Hamish Linklater]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Jacki Weaver]], [[Erica Leerhsen]], [[Eileen Atkins]], and [[Simon McBurney]]. Set in the 1920s on the [[French Riviera]], the film was released on July 25, 2014, by [[Sony Pictures Classics]]. ''Magic in the Moonlight'' received a generally mixed reception. Critics praised the performances of Firth and Stone, but found its writing formulaic.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Should be up to 700 words per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] with exceptions --&gt;
In 1928, a globally famous [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]], Wei Ling Soo, performs in front of a crowd in Berlin with his world-class magic act. As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley ([[Colin Firth]]). He berates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well-wishers. In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan ([[Simon McBurney]]). Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the [[French Riviera|Côte d'Azur]] where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie ([[Emma Stone]]). In fact, the son of the family, Brice ([[Hamish Linklater]]), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister Caroline ([[Erica Leerhsen]]) and brother-in-law George ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage. Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the more he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers. So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud.

Howard and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family. Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family. A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge. Stanley begins spending time with Sophie. He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky [[corniche]]s.

When Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa ([[Eileen Atkins]]), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate secret details of Vanessa's one great love affair. This finally convinces Stanley of Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided. When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child. After the rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars.

At a [[The Great Gatsby|Gatsby]]-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance. As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her "as a woman". Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for opening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way. She leaves upset. The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking charlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal. The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident.

Stanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace. That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer. He begins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it. The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers. He decides once more to prove she is a fraud.

Using a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse. He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much about him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley. Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard. Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he enlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley.

Stanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them. In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who has recovered from her car accident, Stanley admits and fully realizes that he is in love with Sophie. He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead. Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable. She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice. Returning dejected to his aunt Vanessa's, Stanley further admits that he [[love at first sight|fell in love with Sophie at first sight]], and, saddened, is then surprised when Sophie, who had arrived before him, knocks a spirit knock. He proposes, she accepts with a spirit knock, and they kiss as the film ends.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Magic in the Moonlight'' received mixed reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 52%, based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's consensus states: "While far from a failure, ''Magic in the Moonlight'' is too slight to stand with Woody Allen's finest work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/magic_in_the_moonlight/|title=''Magic in the Moonlight''|accessdate=4 November 2014|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] assigns the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/magic-in-the-moonlight|title=Magic in the Moonlight (2014): Reviews|accessdate=23 July 2014|publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rex Reed]], writing for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', gave the film a largely positive review, calling it "a masterstroke of enchantment" and praising Colin Firth's acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.com/2014/07/that-old-black-magic-woody-allens-44th-film-is-one-of-his-best/ |title=That Old Black Magic: Woody Allen’s 44th Film Is One of His Best |accessdate=23 July 2014|publisher=observer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan Hoffman]] of [[Film.com]] also enjoyed the film, stating, "This picture isn’t as showy or obvious as one of his (many) masterpieces, but it is quite good and deserves your time and respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/movies/review-magic-in-the-moonlight |title=Review: 'Magic in the Moonlight'|accessdate=24 July 2014|publisher=film.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', David Denby agreed that Colin Firth "carries [the film] through."&lt;ref name="daviddenby"&gt;David Denby, [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/28/spell Under the Spell], ''The New Yorker'', July 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Joe Morgenstern complimented Emma Stone and concluded, "Think of it as a 97-minute séance that draws you in, spins you around, subverts your suppositions, levitates your spirits and leaves you giddy with delight"&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;Joe Morgenstern, [https://online.wsj.com/articles/film-review-magic-in-the-moonlight-by-woody-allen-1406224174 Playful and Entrancing 'Magic' From Woody Allen], ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Richard Lawson criticized Emma Stone's acting, arguing, "her line delivery is too modern to really work convincingly in the period, and like many other nonetheless talented actors, she has trouble with Allen’s stilted, formal cadence." He added that the age gap between Stone and Firth was "a little gross" and "icky".&lt;ref name="vanityfair"&gt;Richard Lawson, [http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/magic-in-the-moonlight-review The Romance in Magic in the Moonlight Distracts from the Comedy], ''Vanity Fair'', July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Scherstuhl of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' disliked the film, criticizing its familiarity to Allen's previous work and believing the writing was uninspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2014-07-16/film/magic-in-the-moonlight/ |title=It's Been a Year Already? |accessdate=23 July 2014|publisher=villagevoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the movie a "B-" grade (from A+ to F), remarking that it was funny and "pleasant" but also forgettable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20804882,00.html |title=Magic in the Moonlight (2014) |accessdate=23 July 2014|publisher=ew.com |first=Chris |last=Nashawaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon (website)|Salon]]'s Andrew O'Hehir felt that the characters were not drawn out enough because of poor writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2014/07/24/magic_in_the_moonlight_its_time_to_stop_making_excuses_for_woody_allen/ “Magic in the Moonlight”: It’s time to stop making excuses for Woody Allen], Andrew O'Hehir, salon.com, July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[A. O. Scott]] wrote: "Mr. Allen has had his ups and downs over the years. Rarely, though, has he put a story on screen that manifests so little energy, so little curiosity about its own ideas and situations."&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

In 2016 film critics [[Robbie Collin]] and Tim Robey ranked it as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All 47 Woody Allen movies - ranked from worst to best|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/woody-allens-best-and-worst-movies/|accessdate=February 12, 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film opened in limited release in North America on July 25, 2014. In 17 theaters, it grossed $412,095 ($24,241 per screen) in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; It expanded to 964 theaters on August 15, grossing $1,786,150 ($1,853 per screen) in three days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2014&amp;wknd=33&amp;p=.htm August 15-17, 2014 Weekend Chart, at boxofficemojo.com] Accessed 23 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of its North American run, it grossed $10,539,326.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4091">'''Multiplying billiard balls''' (Excelsior Ball Trick, [[August Roterberg]], 1898) is a [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] routine that is popular with both amateur and advanced conjurors but still rarely seen. As its name implies, the magician uses [[sleight of hand]] to manipulate a number of [[billiard ball]]s (the balls are often smaller than actual billiard balls), giving the impression that he is making them appear and vanish at his command.

==Effect==
In this presentation, the magician will hold a single ball in his hand.  The ball suddenly becomes two balls, in plain view of the audience.  He then proceeds to produce a third and fourth ball, all in the same hand.  The magician will then vanish the balls, one at a time, until only one remains.  Often, part of the routine involves the magician giving the impression that he is "passing" the balls through his body, in  and out of his mouth, fingertips, and pockets.

Sets of multiplying billiard balls are available from magicians' supply stores.  The quality, size, material, and price of the balls can vary greatly and are dependent on the magician's personal taste.  The balls are most frequently made of wood, plastic, or metal.

==Credits==
From an article by [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]] in the Swedish magazine ''Trollkarlen'' (No 152 - 2003):

:"The history of the Multiplying Ball effect isn’t as ancient as one might believe, but it is all the more messy. The origin has been tracked back to [[Buatier de Kolta]], who in 1875, for the first time ever, performed an effect where one ball magically was produced, and then multiplied into three balls. However, the choreography was quite different from what is considered standard today. In de Kolta’s original, the balls were held together in one hand, from underneath – the hand acting almost as a basket for the balls, while all the magic was performed with the other hand. As noted by Tommy Wonder, the original effect was both more elegant and clearer than the versions known today. But where has today’s standard handling appeared from? The history here gets trickier to follow.

:"In Hoffman’s book “More Magic” (1889), Hoffman describes, with credits to de Kolta, a small variation. But the choreography and effect is still basically the same.

:"The first time a version similar to the modern handling is published is in the August issue 1900 of a German magazine, Carl Willmann’s “Zauberwelt”. There are no credits in the description, but it isn’t claimed as a new piece either. And the piece has the somewhat odd title (in translation) “The Chicago Balls”.

:"So, the origin of the modern standard choreography seems to have appeared between the publication of Hoffman’s book in 1889 and the published effect in “Zauberwelt” 1900. And in the latter, there is an odd reference to Chicago. Going through the records, it turns out that the only connection Willmann had to Chicago, was that he was doing business with a German-born dealer of magic props named August Roterberg.

:"During this period, August Roterberg published two books, both containing effects with balls: “The Modern Wizard” (1894) and “Latter Day Tricks” (1896). Curiously enough, these pieces make use of the same props as today’s standard routines, but the choreography is still an emulation of de Kolta’s.

:"But it still seems like Roterberg is the creator of today’s standard version, because soon after the publication of “Latter Day Tricks”, he published a small manuscript (together with the props) titled: “Excelsior Ball Trick”, and here all the pieces in the puzzle is in place. Both the props and the choreography is the same as what is known as standard today, and the balls are produced between the fingers."

Two years later it was expanded to include the work of all high school students.  The first of what became an annual festival included approximately 350 students who entered 125 films.  By 1993, the Student Film Festival involved over two thousand students throughout the Los Angeles area, who together entered over 300 films.  The film festival was held each year at the [[Directors Guild]] Theater in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (May 20, 1986).

As demand for workshops, advice and support for teachers grew, NSFI/L.A's Board of Directors expanded the activities of the organization to include workshops for teachers, equipment loans, and support for filmmaking programs in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Editor (March 4, 1984).

===Grimmy Award===
The Grimmy Award was an annual award given to individuals who had supported the institute and student filmmaking.  Generally one "Grimmy" was awarded to a luminary within the industry and one educator.  The award was named after the institute's first honorary chairperson, [[Grim Natwick]], the creator of ''[[Betty Boop]]''.

===Bill Scott Award for a Good Story Well Told===
Established in the memory of Bill Scott who was a longtime advisor to the institute, the award was created to draw attention to a concern shared by Scott and the institute that writing skills were not being emphasized as much as possible.  The award acknowledges "A Good Story Well Told".  Four Bill Scott Awards were awarded each year from 1986 onward.  The judging criteria was graduated.  The four awards were awarded to the following age groups:
* Kindergarten - 2nd Grade: for a simple story: "Make an idea happen"
* 3rd - 6th Grade: "For a well-told story with a beginning, middle and end"
* 7th - 10th Grade: "For a well-told story that affects the audience emotionally"
* 11th - 12th Grade: "For a well-told story that affects the audience and tells the story in an original and personal way"

==Demise==
By the mid-1990s, with the retirement of founder Brenda Norman and the job change of founder Dave Master, it became impractical for the institute and festival to continue and so were dissolved.

[[Image:Monticello-raceway.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Monticello Raceway]] in New York where the casino has been incorporated into the grandstand]]
A '''racino''' is a combined [[race track]] and [[casino]].  In some cases, the gambling is limited to [[slot machine]]s, but many locations are beginning to include [[Table game|table games]] such as [[blackjack]], [[poker]], and [[roulette]].

In 2003, [[Joe Bob Briggs]] described the economic motivation of [[race track]] owners to convert into racinos:
:[[Horse racing]] and [[Greyhound racing|dog racing]] have been in a slow decline for almost 20 years now....the only tracks that have really thrived are the ones that have slot machines. In many cases their live handle (the daily amount bet at the track by live customers) has continued to decline, but their revenues have shot up so fast that they're able to offer the biggest purses and thereby attract the best horses. Tracks like [[Delaware Park (race track)|Delaware Park]] and West Virginia's [[Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort|Mountaineer Park]], once considered places where local degenerates bet on broken-down nags in claiming races, are now among the wealthiest tracks around, with the best races. Fabled tracks like [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]], on the other hand, sometimes have trouble making ends meet.

==In the United States==

''[[USA Today]]'' noted in a June 2003 article that receipts from slot machines are divided about evenly in four ways:
* Payment of the operating costs and payouts to lucky gamblers,
* State taxes,
* Prize money (the [[Purse distribution|purse]]) offered to [[jockey]]s and horse owners, and
* Profit for the racino operator.

As of 2013, racinos are legal in ten U.S. states: [[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[New Mexico Lottery|New Mexico]], [[New York Lottery|New York]], [[Ohio Lottery|Ohio]], [[Oklahoma Lottery|Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island Lottery|Rhode Island]], and [[West Virginia Lottery|West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author=North Dakota Legislative Council staff for the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee
| format = pdf
| accessdate = 2007-06-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first racino in [[Pennsylvania]] opened in November 2006. West Virginia pioneered the concept when [[MTR Gaming Group]] was allowed to introduce [[video lottery terminal]]s (VLTs) to the venue now known as [[Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort]] in [[Chester, West Virginia|Chester]]. Delaware, Rhode Island, and [[West Virginia Lottery|West Virginia]], three of the members of the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), jointly ran a progressive VLT game, [[Cashola|Ca$hola]], from 2006 to July 2011; the three lotteries began offering Ca$hola's successor, ''[[MegaHits]]'', on July 15, 2011.

While VLTs were somewhat successful, a November 2003 article from the ''[[Global Gaming Insider]]'' noted the real financial success story was the introduction of reel spinning slot machines in Iowa:
:In 1994, Iowa voters authorized reel spinning slot machines at Iowa racetracks (including Greyhound tracks).  [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk County]], the owner of a brand new, bankrupt horse track, [[Prairie Meadows]], spent $26 million to convert the clubhouse into a casino and install 1,100 slot machines.  The racino opened for business on April 1, 1995.  Reel-spinning slots proved to be much more popular than [[video poker]].  In the twelve months ended March 31, 1996 machine revenues totaled $119.3 million, enabling Polk County to pay off the $27 million bond issue that paid for the clubhouse casino conversion and retire the track's initial $38.8 million bond issue 17 years early.
As the racino had increased revenues, horse racing purses increased six-fold, which attracted better horses to the racetrack and helped to develop horse breeding in Iowa.

The ''Global Gaming Insider'' article also noted that the creation of the racino has led to consolidation in the ownership of racetracks, with [[Magna Entertainment]] Corporation (currently [[Stronach Group]]) and [[Churchill Downs Incorporated]] the largest.

In November 2004, [[Florida]] voters amended their state constitution to allow slot machines at [[Parimutuel betting|parimutuel]] facilities.

In [[Bangor, Maine]],  a $131 million complex is under construction that will house, among other things, a gaming floor featuring up to 1,500 slot machines, a seven-story hotel, and a four-level parking garage. The new racino is slated to open in the summer of 2008. In Biddeford, Maine on November 2, 2010 by a vote of 59%-41% approved a referendum to relocate Scarborough Downs to Biddeford with a new Harness Racing Track/Racino Complex with Slot Machines, an Entertainment Complex and a 200 room Hotel. The plan is to have most if not all of  the complex open sometime in 2012. Maine voters also approved the Oxford County Maine casino on Nov 2, 2010 also, the indications are that the Bangor Maine Racino and the possibly relocated Scarborough Downs Racino facility could also have table games as well.

There are two racino-like facilities in [[Arkansas]]. The Oaklawn Jockey Club Racing Track, a horse track, is in Hot Springs. Southland Park, a greyhound track, is in West Memphis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">'''Radio Peace and Progress''' (RPP; {{lang-ru|Радиостанция Мир и Прогресс}}) was an [[foreign broadcasting]] radio station of the [[Soviet Union]] besides ''[[Radio Moscow]]'' and the external services of the union republics.

==History==

''RPP'' was established in 1964 as a Soviet answer to the American [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Allen C. {{Google books|D-M5AAAAMAAJ|''USIA: public diplomacy in the computer age''|page=183}} (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and ceased broadcasting in May 1991.

==Tendency==

''RPP'' presented itself as ″the voice of the Soviet public opinion″. The ″public″ (as opposed to government or party) organizations which sponsored RPP broadcasts included three of the [[creative unions in the Soviet Union]] (journalists, writers, composers), [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] news agency, the [[VOKS|Union of Societies of Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries]], the Znaniye Society (a lecture and public information organization), the [[Soviet Peace Committee]], the [[Committee of Youth Organisations]], and the Soviet Women's Committee.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State. [http://insidethecoldwar.org/sites/default/files/documents/Department%20of%20State%20Note%20Moscows%20Radio%20Peace%20and%20Progress%20August%201982.pdf ''Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress''] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the themes addressed were standard ones that followed the official line, ''RPP'' broadcasts were sometimes notably more tendentious and outspoken than those of ''Radio Moscow'', purveying propaganda lines for which the Soviet government might wish to disclaim responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Directorate of Intelligence. [https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP87T00787R000200170003-4.pdf ''The Soviet foreign propaganda apparatus''] (1986), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==

Languages offered by both ''RPP'' and ''Radio Moscow'': [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

Languages covered by ''RPP'', but not by ''Radio Moscow'': [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[French-based creole languages|Creole]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish]].

A '''samba school''' ({{lang-pt|Escola de samba}}) is a dancing club or school. They practice and often perform in huge square-[[Compound (enclosure)|compound]]s ("quadras de samba") devoted to practising and exhibiting [[samba]], an African-Brazilian dance. The schools (which are structured more like a guild than a school in the usual sense&lt;ref&gt;Renata de Sá Gonçalves, "The traditional samba school dance as a performative experience", {{cite web |url=https://www.mecon.nomadit.co.uk/pub/conference_epaper_download.php5?PaperID%3D6753%26MIMEType%3Dapplication%2Fpdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312114714/http://mecon.nomadit.co.uk/pub/conference_epaper_download.php5?mimetype=application%2Fpdf&amp;paperid=6753 |archivedate=2016-03-12 |df= }} accessed 12 Mar 2014&lt;/ref&gt;) have a strong community basis and are traditionally associated with a particular neighborhood. They are often seen to affirm the cultural validity of the Afro-Brazilian heritage in contrast to the mainstream education system.&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;Dils A., Albright A., (eds.) "Moving History / Dancing Cultures - A Dance History Reader", Wesleyan University Press 2001:169.&lt;/ref&gt; and have evolved often in contrast to authoritarian development.&lt;ref&gt;Guillermoprieto, A., "Samba", Jonathan Cape 1990:23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "escola de samba" is popularly held to derive from the schoolyard location of the first group's early rehearsals.&lt;ref name="Dils" /&gt; In Rio de Janeiro especially, they are mostly associated with particular shanty towns ("[[favela]]"){{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Samba and the samba school can be deeply interwoven with the daily lives of the shanty-town dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;"Samba", a documentary directed by ella Jessouroun, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the year the samba schools have various happenings and events, most important of which are rehearsals for the main event which is the yearly [[carnival]] parade. Each of the main schools spend many months each year designing the theme, holding a competition for their song, building the floats and rehearsing. It is overseen by a "carnavalesco" or carnival director.

Each school's parade may consist of about 3,000 performers or more, and the preparations, especially producing the many different costumes, provide work for thousands of the poorest in Brazilian society.&lt;ref&gt;"Imperatriz do Carnival" a documentary directed by Fernando Schultz, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting competition is a major economic and media event, with tens of thousands in the live audience and screened live to millions across South America.

==Carnival parade==
[[File:Unidos da Tijuca é a quinta escola no desfile das campeãs 2016 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A typical performer of [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|Samba dance]] at [[Rio Carnival]]]]

The formal parades ("desfiles") during [[carnival]], are a showcase of each main "escola" enhanced by the participation of celebrities, fans and guests who often pay large sums of money for their elaborate costumes. In Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Porto Alegre, the formal parades are held in specially constructed arenas called Sambadromes ([[Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí]] in Rio, the [[Anhembi Sambadrome]] in São Paulo) designed by influential architect, [[Oscar Niemeyer]], the [[Sambadromo Complexo Cultural Porto Seco]] in Porto Alegre and the [[Sambadromo de Uruguaiana]] in Uruguaiana where participates "escolas de samba" from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Sambadromes are designed to accommodate all social classes, with VIP lounges, tourist sections, and various types of seating right down to cheapest seats for poorest sections of the community. Those who choose to only watch the parade may also be charged for the best seats. 

In Uruguay, the major samba parades are in Artigas and in Montevideo. The [[Artigas Samba Parade]] and the [[Montevideo Samba Parade]] are the most importants in Uruguay.

Each school displays glamour in colorful costumes and floats with special effects and is organized into different segments or "alas". The "alas" represent different components of the school's theme, or "enredo", as they act out a homage to a myth, historic event or figure, or express their view on a social, environmental or international issue. The "alas" display distinct costumes or "fantasias" and also reflect traditional '''samba school''' roles developed years ago. Thus, each samba school parade has the "comissao de frente"; individuals who open the parade by walking in social attires, saluting the crowds; the "ala das Baianas", or the traditional segment of Bahian African-Brazilian ladies with impressive round dresses spinning through the avenue; the "puxadores" (lead singers) singing the "samba-enredo" or theme-song while they play the "[[cavaquinho]]" or other string instruments; the "velha guarda", or veterans who made history in the school; the "[[bateria]]", or samba band with drums, "cuicas" and other instruments, preceded by the "madrinha da bateria", or band godmother who is often a sexy female celebrity. The "porta-bandeira", or the female flag holder, and the "mestre-sala", or male cortsy, display and salute the school's flag, as they dance and strive to show harmony and samba expertise, as their performance is carefully observed and scored by the judges.

==Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo==
"Cariocas", the Rio natives, and "Paulistanos", São Paulo natives, are overtaken with emotion while performing or watching their favorite school, much more so in Rio, where a carnival samba school culture has been developed since the 1930s and samba rehearsals, costume making, and planning is a year-round event. It is often said that a samba school slum dweller may not have a job or food on the table the whole year, but they will make sure they have the money for their costume to show their "samba no pe'" or dancing skills expertise.&lt;ref name="Origemdocarnaval"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origemdocarnaval.com.br/ |title=Origem do Carnaval |accessdate=9 May 2015 |publisher=origemdocarnaval.com.br |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501235054/http://origemdocarnaval.com.br/ |archivedate=1 May 2015 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Imperatriz 2007 - comissão de frente.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Front commission dressed as [[codfish]] in the parade of Imperatriz Leopoldinense (2007)]]
As samba schools originated in Rio de Janeiro, they are today the most famous ones and, arguably, produce the most spectacular parades or (as it is often said) the "greatest show on Earth". The city of São Paulo also has a number of samba schools with some tradition that is linked to an interesting mixture of African-Brazilian display of pride, immigrant or working class activism, and soccer team fondness, as schools such as "Gavioes da Fiel", "Mancha Verde" began as a singing/dancing group that cheered and rooted during matches in São Paulo stadiums. Nearly all Brazilian states have samba schools, but states such as Bahia and Pernambuco tend to have floats that lead a crowd composed of general people, without the need for membership, rehearsals or even a special attire. Some groups do charge a certain amount of money for the "abadás", or colorful T-shirts that display affiliation to a specific group, or "bloco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academiadosamba.com.br/escolasbrasil.htm |title=Academia do Samba - escolas do Brasil |accessdate=3 January 2009|publisher=Academia do Samba}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academiadosamba.com.br/escolasmundo.htm |title=Academia do Samba - escolas do Mundo |accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Academia do Samba}} {{small|ver também [[Lista os samba schools]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization of samba schools==
A significant majority of the samba schools, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, have in their name the words ''Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba'' (Recreative Guild Samba School), represented by the acronym GRES, before the name itself. In [[São Paulo]] there is a common variation ''Grêmio Recreativo Cultural e Escola de Samba'' (Recreative Cultural Guild and Samba School). There are exceptions, such as the ''[[Rosas de Ouro|Sociedade Rosas de Ouro]]'' (Golden Rose Society) and the traditional ''Agremiação Recreativa Cultural e Escola de Samba Vizinha Faladeira'' (''grêmio'' and ''agremiação'' in Portuguese are synonyms).&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://super.abril.com.br/superarquivo/1996/conteudo_31266.shtml |title=Revista Super Interessante, edição mensal de fevereiro de 1996 |pages=32–37 |accessdate=5 January 2009 |publisher=Revista Superinteressante |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207204801/http://super.abril.com.br/superarquivo/1996/conteudo_31266.shtml |archivedate=7 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of the classifications of entities emerged in 1935 when the Rio carnival associations were required to take a charter to the ''Delegacia de Costumes e Diversões'' (Delegation of Customs and Entertainment) to be able to parade. In an effort to show a modicum of decency and organization, the delegate owner, Dulcídio Gonçalves, refused to grant the permit to associations with "inappropriate" names, which is why the GRES Portela had to change to the current name, instead of the previous ''Vai Como Pode'' (Come as You Will).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson p.94 (p.112 of e-book)&lt;/ref&gt;

The samba school system seems to be unique to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://postimg.cc/gallery/2dwwg9jvi/ Carnaval da Diamond]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike parades such as the Rose Parade in California, for instance, the samba schools' organizations consist almost entirely of community volunteer work. More than just musical groups, the schools are the neighborhood associations that cover a variety of community needs, such as educational resources and medical care. There are often political and commercial interests involved as well, even from abroad, especially when the samba school honors the literature, music and dance, or a myth, historic figure or event from another country. Drug lords who control trafficking in the Rio favelas as well as illicit gambling ([[Jogo do Bicho]]) are also said to contribute financially to schools, as many of them are guardians and controllers of shanty town life.

== History ==
The origins of samba schools are linked to the history of carnival in Rio itself, as well as the creation of the modern samba. The first parades, or "cortumes", as Luso-Brazilians called them, were more exclusive events and used to have white revelers, rather than mostly African-Brazilians like nowadays. The rhythms were often the "marchinhas", with a more Portuguese or European flair. Samba players from a group called Estácio were the pioneers of present-day samba schools, with the founding of "[[Estácio de Sá (samba school)|Deixa Falar]]", or Let Me Speak in 1928. [[Ismael Silva]] seems to have been the first to have come up with idea of creating "blocos de Carnaval" in which groups could dance and move to the samba rhythms and sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

The first samba school contests began in 1928 and were held at the home of Zé Espinguela, where his [[GRES Portela|Conjunto Oswaldo Cruz]] won and Mangueira and Deixa Falar also competed for the title. Some consider this as the starting point leading to the development of present-day samba schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/artigos/capitulo-1.htm Academia do Samba - Capítulo 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211534/http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/artigos/capitulo-1.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, between 1930 and 1932, these were only considered a variation of the ''blocos'', local street parade celebration, and in 1932 the owner of [[Mundo Sportivo]], [[Mário Filho]], decided to sponsor the first Parade of Samba Schools in Praça Onze. Composers such as [[Antônio Nassar]], [[Armando Reis]] and [[Orestes Barbosa]]) had the idea of organizing a Carnival parade which was supported by local newspapers. Newspaper owners and journalists such as Mário Filho and his brother [[Nélson Rodrigues]], who did not have much to write about after the end of the [[soccer]] season, joined journalist [[Carlos Pimentel]], who was connected to samba personalities in holding a parade at Praca XI square.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of "Sports World", 19 schools attended. The newspaper established the criteria for judging the participating schools and nowadays news networks still have some say on the parades as they strive for fairness and high quality, especially because so much money is invested on TV networks that have broadcasting rights for the parades. Newspapers and magazines also make huge profitsl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1932.htm Composer Orestes Barbosa, actors Eugênia Brandão and Álvaro Moreyra and repórter Fernando Costa were jury members in 1932.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201009/http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1932.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional "ala das Baianas" was a prerequisite to compete, and the schools, all with more than one hundred members, should present sambas unpublished and not use pipe instruments, among other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning school was [[GRES Estação Primeira de Mangueira|Mangueira]], while the second group had the ''Conjunto Osvaldo Cruz'', or Portela. The officials assured the success of the contest remained up in Praca XI Square in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;"Nosso Tempo", Turner Publishing, Inc. e Century Books, Inc. ''Nosso Tempo'', Volume I; pg. 239. Editora Klick. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the samba schools took many elements brought by ranches, such as the plot, the pair of mestre-sala cortsy and flag holder and the opening committee, elements with which Ismael Silva disagreed.

With the rise of populist dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] and the foundation of the [[União Geral das Escolas de Samba do Brasil|General Union of Samba Schools]] in 1934, the marginalization of samba persisted for some time. Then, it regained power and began to expand and gain importance in the Rio carnival, supplanting the ranches carnival. It did not take long for the samba schools to expand to other states, with the foundation in 1935 of the "Primeira São Paulo" (First of São Paulo),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090207224014/http://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/scultura/CARNAVAL/2008/i14bambas.htm Prefeitura de Ribeirão Preto - Carnaval 2008, homenagem da Os Bambas à Primeira de São Paulo]&lt;/ref&gt; the first school of samba de São Paulo. The official competitions of the samba schools in São Paulo only started in 1950 with the victory of Lavapés, but before that there were other minor tournaments at the municipal and state levels.&lt;ref&gt;Revista Quatro Rodas, ano VII, nº91, fevereiro de 1968, página 61 - many informations in article [[Santos carnival]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s some organized soccer support fan groups, like the [[Vai-Vai]] (Go-Go) and the [[Camisa Verde e Branco]] (Green and White Jersey) became samba schools.

Due to the large number of schools, in 1952, the access league "Grupo de Acesso" was created in order to allow news schools in and promote them to the "premier league" only if they aboded by certain rules of excellence. That year, the parade of the access league (Group 2, current Group RJ-1) went seamlessly, but the parade of the main group (Group 1, currently the Special Group) was carried out under heavy rain. The judging results were canceled and all schools belonging to the access league were promoted to the "premier league".&lt;ref&gt;[http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1952.htm Academia do Samba - 1952] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230014/http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1952.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 [[União Geral das Escolas de Samba do Brasil|UGESB]] and [[Federação Brasileira de Escolas de Samba|FBES]] in AESCRJ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1952.htm Academia do Samba - 1953] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230014/http://academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1952.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; merged as [[LIESA]], an association of samba schools from the premier league which became known in Portuguese as Grupo Especial. In 2008, LESGA was created, representing schools from the access league. LIESA inspired the creation of similar bodies in other cities, such as [[LIGA-SP]].

In 1984, Rio de Janeiro governor [[Leonel Brizola]] dedicated the Sambadrome, a special space for the parading of samba schools. Years later, in São Paulo, Mayor [[Luiza Erundina]] did the same, creating the [[Anhembi Sambadrome]].

Today, many other cities throughout the country also have their Sambadromes, including [[Manaus]] and in 1993 its parade was broadcast for the first time.&lt;ref name="Manchete"&gt;'[http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/tomatoes/792/festivos.htm FortuneCity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319012505/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/tomatoes/792/festivos.htm |date=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization ==
Natural associations are almost always local, largely from poor communities or the suburbs, forming samba schools that usually represent in a district, sub-district or set of districts. A parade which usually has local character, whereas the main schools of the city gather to compete among themselves for the best of the year. In this show, conducted over two nights, they are evaluated by a committee of judges chosen in advance by their leaders or by the representative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odia.terra.com.br/carnaval/htm/liesa_inicia_curso_de_jurados_nesta_segunda_feira_143446.asp O Dia - LIESA inicia curso de jurados nesta segunda-feira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929003737/http://odia.terra.com.br/carnaval/htm/liesa_inicia_curso_de_jurados_nesta_segunda_feira_143446.asp |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Carnaval2008/0,,MUL248220-9772,00.html G1 - Carnaval 2008 - RJ: anunciados os 40 julgadores dos desfiles do Grupo Especial] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215517/http://g1.globo.com/Carnaval2008/0,,MUL248220-9772,00.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liesu.com.br/Regulamento%20da%20LIESU%20Carnaval%20de%202009.doc Regulamento do Carnaval de Uruguaiana 2009] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges consider each of the judging categories, giving points to each. On the day that the results are announced, the final assessment of the panel can be affected by certain penalties for breaking certain rules, such as the requirement to parade within specific time limits, parading with the minimum components, and avoiding total nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.portalmaratimba.com/noticias/news.php?codnot=221009 |title=Portal Maratimba |language=Portuguese |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206042542/http://www.portalmaratimba.com/noticias/news.php?codnot=221009 |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parade ==
In major cities, the parade of each samba school currently takes about an hour, with some variations according to the rules imposed by the organization of the carnival in the city. For each of the Special Group in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the parade has a maximum time of one hour and twenty minutes, while in São Paulo is the maximum of 1 hour and five minutes. Along the parade ground, stop watches mark the period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Introduced 1986. {{cite web|url=http://liesa.globo.com/2014/por/08-historiadocarnaval/cronologia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120002/http://liesa.globo.com/2014/por/08-historiadocarnaval/cronologia.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concentration area ===
This is the time and place occupied by the schools while waiting their turn to enter the parade in the Sambadrome.

After the end of a parade, the narrator announces the school next to perform, and the sounds from the microphone, restricted to only a part of sambadrome, are released so that people can hear in the bleachers. Then the opening cries are heard, after which the parade itself begins, and the timer starts to run.

=== Requisites ===
Several elements are part of the characterization of a parade of the samba school, and some areas to which the jury should assign notes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040622032531/http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/turismo/lazer_cultura/carnaval/criterios.doc Prefeitura Municipal de Florianópolis - Regras do desfile carnavalesco de 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the wing of Bahia, however, are not considered as items, but can cause loss of points for the body anyway, if not shown.

==== Front Commission ====
This is the first group of parade participants to perform, and consists of about ten to fifteen people who execute a choreography to introduce the theme. Apart from the Front Commission, there is no other rule regarding the order of the elements during the parade of samba schools.

Functioning as a sort of master of ceremonies of the show by welcoming the public and presenting the school, the front commission of the samba schools has undergone many changes over time. In its early years, it was formed by a group of men, the general directors of the college, who came in front of the school wearing their best clothes and welcomed the public. Sometimes they carried sticks in their hands, whose prime objective was "to defend the group against rivals".&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/secretarias/cultura/patrimonio_historico/institucional/0051 |title=Carnaval |accessdate=5 January 2009 |author=Prefeitura de São Paulo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207224327/http://www6.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/secretarias/cultura/patrimonio_historico/institucional/0051 |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portela samba school developed a more refined front commission, where its performers paraded with elegant clothes, even occasionally with tails and top hat, a model which soon came to be copied by other schools. That was the policy of its most illustrious member, Paulo da Portela, which meant that Sambistas should always go well dressed, in order to dispel the negative image of them held by the upper class. In the less formal blocos, predecessors of the schools, they had a reputation of being supporters of street fights and street riot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samba-choro.com.br/noticias/arquivo/2372 Samba-choro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404161337/http://www.samba-choro.com.br/noticias/arquivo/2372 |date=April 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloninha.org.br/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=74 Coloninha.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212344/http://www.coloninha.org.br/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=74 |date=March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Allegorical floats and props ====
[[Image:Mangueira 2013 130211.jpg|thumb|250px|Allegorical floats of the [[Estação Primeira de Mangueira]] school during the carnival parade of 2013.]]

One of the judging categories is the allegorical floats, filled with sculptures of wood, plastic, Styrofoam and other materials, decorated to represent the elements of the plot.&lt;ref name="Quesitos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carnaval2008.ig.com.br/riodejaneiro/noticias/2008/01/03/criterios_de_julgamento_dos_quesitos_1138454.html |title=Critérios de julgamento dos quesitos - Manual do julgador |accessdate=6 January 2009 |author=IG, por Lisandra Maioli e Alessandra Correa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206203000/http://carnaval2008.ig.com.br/riodejaneiro/noticias/2008/01/03/criterios_de_julgamento_dos_quesitos_1138454.html |archivedate=6 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/tecnologia/pergunta_286840.shtml |title=Como é feito um carro alegórico? |accessdate=6 January 2009 |author=Revista Mundo Estranho |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207200212/http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/tecnologia/pergunta_286840.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Special Group performance of Rio de Janeiro, floats currently may not exceed eight meters and fifty centimeters wide and nine meters and eighty centimeters tall.

The first float of the parade often includes a stylised depiction of the school. Some schools, such as Portela for example, always bring their winged eagle symbol, regardless of plot.&lt;ref name="Sambariocarnaval"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sambariocarnaval.com/funciona.htm |title=Como funciona o carnaval |accessdate=5 January 2009 |publisher=Sambariocarnaval.com.br |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206152037/http://www.sambariocarnaval.com/funciona.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest floats can reach up to 13 meters high and 60 meters in length, which sometimes affects their entry into the parade ground. These floats are propelled by hand with people who are below or behind the float. No float can be moved by an engine (during the 1990s, it was to prevent the risk of fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grupopacifica.com.br/carnival/index_05.html Grupo Pacífica - como funciona o Carnaval] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924075145/http://www.grupopacifica.com.br/carnival/index_05.html |date=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Progression and harmony====
The progression or evolution of the school's parade as it develops its story is of great importance to the judges. Anyone watching should have the impression that the school is a single body, a continuous row. There is no requirement that the components perform samba, but they must move with a degree of unison and good timing.&lt;ref name="Quesitos"/&gt; Schools that suffer dramatic changes in its parade speed, parading sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly, are usually penalized.

Schools where the participants do not sing the samba, or sing badly, may receiving lower points.&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;

====Plot-theme ("enredo")====
As a feature of the parades, the plot, usually chosen some time after the previous carnival, will occupy the school for the following year. Meanwhile, from the main theme, a synopsis is drawn, which will guide the design and manufacture of costumes, floats and samba-song. Judges will decide whether the school explained the theme during the parade,.&lt;ref name="Quesitos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papodesamba.com.br/site/index.php?a=noticia&amp;ncat=8&amp;nid=9228 |title=Quesito enredo |accessdate=5 January 2009 |author=Papo de Samba |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206155646/http://www.papodesamba.com.br/site/index.php?a=noticia&amp;ncat=8&amp;nid=9228 |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Samba-song ====
{{Main|samba-enredo}}

Judges assess whether the samba has a good melody and lyrics with interesting features, musically rich, reflecting the theme, and without bias or errors of language.&lt;ref name="Quesitos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extra.globo.com/blogs/rodadesamba/post.asp?t=quesitos-samba-enredo&amp;cod_Post=48306&amp;a=108 |title=Quesito Samba-enredo |accessdate=5 January 2009|author=Extra Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The samba of each school is chosen after an internal competition at the school, where Sambistas or groups create their sambas, based on the previously agreed theme. The competition takes place over several weekends, some entries are eliminated, until only there is a winning song which the school then adopts. In Rio de Janeiro, the competition usually takes place in August. In October, a CD of the Special Group is recorded with chosen sambas from each school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diversao.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI753444-EI5253,00-Ouca+os+sambas+para+o+Carnaval+do+Rio.html |title=Ouça os sambas para o carnaval do Rio |accessdate=5 January 2009 |author=Terra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160320/http://diversao.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI753444-EI5253,00-Ouca+os+sambas+para+o+Carnaval+do+Rio.html |archive-date=2011-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tudodesamba.com.br/conteudo.asp?id=1485 |title=Ouça os sambas para o carnaval do Rio |accessdate=5 January 2009 |author=Tudo de Samba |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131170148/http://tudodesamba.com.br/conteudo.asp?id=1485 |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2007, the Special Group schools of São Paulo, the samba song would be considered twice, once for lyrics and once for melody of music, with equal points for each.

==== Mestre-sala and Porta-Bandeira ====
[[Image:Unidos de Vila Isabel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Casal de Mestre-Sala de Porta-Bandeira da [[Unidos de Vila Isabel]] no Carnaval de 2006.]]

The mestre-sala (literally, "The Master of the Room") and porta-bandeira ("she who carries the flag") display the flag of the school to the audience. The porta-bandeira carries the flag, and the mestre-sala pays tribute and draws attention to both the flag and the porta-bandeira. Her dance is not a samba, but she spins and swirls her way ahead. The mestre-sala dances around her. All their moves are regulated in a set of rules, and at one point during the parade they are evaluated by the judges. The slightest mistake may result in their scores being lowered. For example: it is forbidden that the two turn their backs to each other at the same time, and errors such as the drop of a hat or other slips will result in lower scores.&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quesitos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpnet.com.br/anteriores/1998/02/25/urbana2_0.html |title=Viradouro levanta sambódromo |language=Portuguese |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211114828/http://www.dpnet.com.br/anteriores/1998/02/25/urbana2_0.html |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their costumes are similar to the gala costumes typical of the eighteenth century, but "carnavalized", i.e. with an exaggerated amount of colors and decorations.

Currently, at least since the 1990s, the schools of the Special Group of Rio and São Paulo parade usually with three or four pairs of mestre-salas and porta-bandeira, but only the first is evaluated, the other being merely decorative, and optional. Normally, they are there to represent the school in some events when the main couple is unable to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/23755+ensaios+o+que+devem+e+nao+podem+fazer+o+mestre+sala+e+porta+bandeira SRZD - Ensaios: O que devem e não podem fazer o mestre-sala e porta-bandeira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001028/http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/23755+ensaios+o+que+devem+e+nao+podem+fazer+o+mestre+sala+e+porta+bandeira |date=March 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mestre-sala'' seems to reflect the carnival dances of the nineteenth century, in which there was a professional organization responsible for the hall that was called "master of room" or "master-room." With respect to the porta-bandeira, the name was a natural adaptation of the old flag-bearer character, usually male, who carried the heavy banners of Brazilian carnival groups&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fundaj.gov.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=16&amp;pageCode=302&amp;textCode=7592&amp;date=currentDate |title=FUNDAJ.gov |language=Portuguese |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016183849/http://www.fundaj.gov.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=16&amp;pageCode=302&amp;textCode=7592&amp;date=currentDate |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual aspect of the mestre-sala has also been compared to the [[Zé Pilintra]] of ethnic Afro-Brazilian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lourenço R, "Bandeira, Porta Bandeira e Mestre-Sala Elementos De Diversas Culturas Numa Tríade Soberana Nas Escolas De Samba Cariocas", Textos escolhidos de cultura e arte populares, Rio de Janeiro, v.6, n.1, p. 7-18, 2009, {{cite web|url=http://www.tecap.uerj.br/pdf/v6/ricardo_lourenco.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234140/http://www.tecap.uerj.br/pdf/v6/ricardo_lourenco.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drumming Section ====
[[Image:Repique.JPG|thumb|200px|right|One of many instruments in a samba school bateria: the [[repique]].]]

The drumming wing, or "bateria", is a kind of orchestra of percussion instruments. They accompany the singer and lead the pace of the parade. The faster and stronger the pace of the bateria, the faster members usually parade. Each school has, currently, an average 250 to 300 musicians.&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresconsulado.com.br/pub/index.pub.php?s=conteudo&amp;contid=2&amp;subcontid=14 GRES Consulado] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504202132/http://www.gresconsulado.com.br/pub/index.pub.php?s=conteudo&amp;contid=2&amp;subcontid=14 |date=May 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every bateria is evaluated on "the regular maintenance and support of the cadence ... in accordance with the Samba Theme: the perfect combination of sounds emitted by various tools, and the creativity and versatility of the bateria."&lt;ref name="Quesitos"/&gt;

The following instruments usually form part of a bateria of the samba school: [[Surdo]] de primera, surdo de segunda, surdo de terceira, caixa de guerra, [[repinique]], [[chocalho]], [[tambourim]], [[cuíca]], [[agogô]], [[reco-reco]], and frigedeira.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artes.com/carnaval/bateria.html Artes.com - bateria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040838/http://www.artes.com/carnaval/bateria.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are variations in composition, for example, the samba-school Mangueira, does not use the surdo de segunda, only surdo de primeira and terceira, while the samba-school Empire Serrano emphasizes the agogô.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samba-choro.com.br/s-c/tribuna/samba-choro.0410/0386.html Samba-choro - tribuna] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175046/http://www.samba-choro.com.br/s-c/tribuna/samba-choro.0410/0386.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s came the "Paradinha" ("little stop") of Mestre André, a famous director of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel. André was the creator of the musical effect in which the bateria suddenly stop playing during a parade, leaving only the cavaquinho (a small string instrument) and voice components for a moment. When the music returns, the effect is of surprise and excitement. The expected effect, considered beautiful by the critics, is also risky because it increases the chances that the samba song can mistakenly be taken up again at the wrong moment.&lt;ref name="Sambariocarnaval"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnaval2006.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI829948-EI6239,00-Sem+paradinha+eu+fico+em+casa+diz+Mestre+Cica.html Terra - Carnaval 2006 - 12 de janeiro de 2006, 07h36 "Sem paradinha, eu fico em casa", diz Mestre Ciça] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060558/http://carnaval2006.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI829948-EI6239,00-Sem+paradinha+eu+fico+em+casa+diz+Mestre+Cica.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The queen of the drums section dances ahead of the drummers group and sometimes interacts with them.&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;

The figure of the queen of the drums section appeared in the 1970s when the famous mulatto Adele Fatima led the Youth Independent Drums Section, an unprecedent fact, and gained popularity in the following decade. Today it is one of the most celebrated roles in samba schools. Monique Evans, in [[Mocidade]], [[Luma de Oliveira]], in [[GRES Tradição|Tradição]] and Soninha Capeta, in Beija-Flor, were some notable queens of drum sections. Some schools also introduced the figure of a King of the drums section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Carnaval2007/0,,AA1454556-8037,00.html G1 - Rei de bateria enfrenta preconceito entre ritmistas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701131434/http://g1.globo.com/Carnaval2007/0,,AA1454556-8037,00.html |date=July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The godmother of the drumming section is similar to the queen, and the two often get confused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ego.globo.com/Carnaval2008/0,,MUL212616-9773,00-RAINHAS+DE+BATERIA+ABRAM+ALAS+PARA+AS+VOSSAS+MAJESTADES.html Globo.com - carnaval 2008 - 12/12/2007 - Rainhas de bateria: abram alas para as vossas majestades] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701121653/http://ego.globo.com/Carnaval2008/0,,MUL212616-9773,00-RAINHAS+DE+BATERIA+ABRAM+ALAS+PARA+AS+VOSSAS+MAJESTADES.html |date=July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools use the two roles to pay tribute to more women. In the 1980s, many schools began to choose famous TV actresses instead of girls from the community, raising controversy in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sambariocarnaval.com/denise03.htm Samba Rio Carnaval - Coluna da Denise - 27 de abril de 2008, nº 03, ano I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301051209/http://www.sambariocarnaval.com/denise03.htm |date=March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the position of godmother should be offered to women of importance in the history of the school or in daily life, on a lifelong basis, which does not change every year, as the position of queen, but this is often not the case&lt;ref&gt;[http://minhanoticia.ig.com.br/editoria/Celebridades/2008/12/22/julia+alves+sera+rainha+de+bateria+da+escola+de+samba+perola+negra+3218346.html Juliana Alves será rainha de bateria da escola de samba Pérola Negra] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603091612/http://minhanoticia.ig.com.br/editoria/Celebridades/2008/12/22/julia+alves+sera+rainha+de+bateria+da+escola+de+samba+perola+negra+3218346.html |date=June 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnaval.uol.com.br/noticias/2008/01/24/ult5681u40.jhtm Carnaval UOL - 24/01/2008 - 19h42 - "Todas as rainhas de bateria se odeiam", diz rainha da Acadêmicos da Rocinha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404151843/http://carnaval.uol.com.br/noticias/2008/01/24/ult5681u40.jhtm |date=April 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the godmother only a queen with another name.

==== Ala das Baianas ====
The "ala das baianas" is considered one of the most important wings of a samba school parade, and preferably composed of ladies dressed in clothes that refer to old aunts of the first groups of Bahia samba of the early twentieth century. It is mandatory for all competition parades of samba schools, although not official.&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/baiana.html |title=Texto sobre as baianas |language=Portuguese |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926122355/http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/baiana.html |archivedate=2009-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1940 to 1950, it was common for men to parade dressed in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnaval2006.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI843009-EI6238,00.html Terra - Carnaval 2006 - Baiana de "cueca" vai desfilar por escola do Rio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045259/http://carnaval2006.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI843009-EI6238,00.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional clothing of Bahia consists of torso, coat, cloth and skirt round the coast. However, often we can see Bahia with the most unusual costumes, such as brides, statues of liberty, space beings, globe (pictured) or oil wells.

==== Old-guard ====
The old guard (in Portuguese "Velha Guarda") is a group of samba dancers older, often already quite old, often the founders of schools that no longer hold positions within the hierarchy of the party, but as a separate department, and occupy the Carnival parade in positions of honor, dressed in carnival costumes typical of samba, such [[zoot suit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Nei Lopes]]. Enciclopédia Brasileira da Diáspora Africana.

==== Singer ====
The singer, also known as the performer or puller is responsible for the professional performance of the samba-plot during the parade, and usually aided by a group of supporting singers. Using a microphone, and usually more powerful than the supporting singers, his voice stands out over the other members of the school, taking the lead on how fast the song is sung by the school's parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://odia.terra.com.br/carnaval/htm/escolas_do_grupo_especial_apostam_na_contratacao_de_diretores_musicais_215820.asp |title=Escolas apostam na contratação de diretores musicais |accessdate=8 January 2009 |author=[[O Dia]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212060507/http://odia.terra.com.br/carnaval/htm/escolas_do_grupo_especial_apostam_na_contratacao_de_diretores_musicais_215820.asp |archivedate=12 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jamelão.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Jamelão]] (1913-2008), a Brazilian samba singer.&lt;ref&gt;Renato Roschel, [http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/jamelao.htm "Jamelão"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503162947/http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/jamelao.htm |date=May 3, 2016 }}.

Acesso: 20 de fevereiro, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The samba during the parade should not be interpreted by one or just a few people, but sung by the entire school: the music should only be "pulled" (initiated) by the minority group. Moreover, many believe that the handle would be a special category of performer, able not only to interpret a samba, but also encourage and arouse the audience.
	
From the 1990s, [[Jamelão]], da Mangueira, has criticized the traditional term, seeking to replace it with a new terminology: Interpreter of samba-plot. In the words of Jamelão, one who would handle "smoke pull, pull cart, pull-bag" (in original "puxa fuma fumo, puxa carro, puxa saco"; in Rio de Janeiro's giria, "smoke marijuana, steals veicule, yes-man") which in his opinion, a derogatory term. From this, many commentators and TV stations began to replace the first by the second term, which however, still remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sambariocarnaval.com/editorial14.htm |title=Editorial Samba Rio |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=18 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109133640/http://www.sambariocarnaval.com/editorial14.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy that is still common for interpreters is the question whether or not it is unethical for the official interpreter at a school to participate in the internal dispute of their own college. Some schools prohibit this, but release their professionals to participate in tryouts for other schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/21859+e+correto+o+interprete+oficial+nao+participar+do+concurso+de+samba Sidney Rezende - É correto o intérprete oficial não participar do concurso de samba?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085209/http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/21859+e+correto+o+interprete+oficial+nao+participar+do+concurso+de+samba |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carnavalesco ====
&lt;!-- [[Carnavalesco]] redirects here --&gt;
This is the professional responsible for design and development of the plot to be submitted by a school of samba as well as the design, development and construction of floats and costumes related to the proposed plot. In some cases, the carnavalesco develops the plot from a topic proposed by the direction of the samba school. In others, he suggests the theme of an idea from its original. The carnavalesco is usually a single person, but the Beija-Flor school of Rio de Janeiro now use a team of carnavalescos. The carnavalescos may or may not be university-trained for the profession, and may even have a team of researchers working with them to develop the school's theme. Many have a strong carnaval connection or background in the visual arts, performing arts, theater or dance.&lt;ref name="Superinteressante"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasilprofissoes.com.br/verprof.php?codigo=97 |title=Carnavalesco |accessdate=6 January 2009 |author=Brasil Profissões |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224000629/http://www.brasilprofissoes.com.br/verprof.php?codigo=97 |archivedate=24 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dirigents/Directorial staff ====
This is the name by which may be called the [[president]], the president of honor and [[patron]] of the school. One can also use this to include carnival directors, producers and other crew members. A director of carnival is a director of the samba school that heads up the guidelines and philosophy of their carnival college, taking part in the selection of members of various sectors, even sometimes the plot, coordinating also the shed or warehouse where the floats are made, the purchase of equipment, payments and the development of the entire project of the school. It is not uncommon for directors of Carnival to be paid professionals. Many also include the executive directors of the samba school, such as Laíla, of Beija-Flor.

== Carnival parade results ==
The results of the carnival competition are announced on the afternoon of Ash Wednesday in Rio, and on the afternoon of Tuesday of carnival in São Paulo. In both cities, there is a ceremony where long lines are set up in the Sambódromo site. Tents are set up where the representatives of each samba school will annotate the scores as they are being disseminated, making the calculations. The chairman of the league makes the final considerations about the carnival that year, reads the possible loss of points given to each samba school, and then reads the scores.

The bleachers are open to the public, and the charge for entry is typically one kilogram of non-perishable food. Both in Rio and in São Paulo the event is transmitted live on television; television cameras in real time are used to broadcast the movement of blocks within the main school, the title favorite, where members and fans that Sambódromo were not to gather to watch the event from there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spturis.com/carnaval2008/lista-noticias.php?action=fullnews&amp;showcomments=1&amp;id=73 SPTuris - Cinco toneladas de alimentos são arrecadadas na apuração] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207020843/http://www.spturis.com/carnaval2008/lista-noticias.php?action=fullnews&amp;showcomments=1&amp;id=73 |date=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnaval2008.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI2337465-EI10737,00.html Terra - Carnaval 2008 - Apuração: ambulantes vendem sacos de açúcar como ingresso] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190319/http://carnaval2008.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI2337465-EI10737,00.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scores typically range between 7 and 10 in Rio and São Paulo, and the points are further subdivided into decimal fractions in Rio and 25 hundredths in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centraldenoticias.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/vila-maria-mocidade-vai-vai-e-imperio-favoritas-em-sp/ Central de notícias - Vila Maria, Mocidade, Vai-Vai e Império, favoritas em SP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216194934/http://centraldenoticias.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/vila-maria-mocidade-vai-vai-e-imperio-favoritas-em-sp/ |date=December 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rio, all the marks given by all the jurors are valid, while in São Paulo the lowest note of each item is eliminated .&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnaval2008.ig.com.br/riodejaneiro/noticias/2008/01/03/criterios_de_julgamento_dos_quesitos_1138454.html IG Carnaval 2008 - Critérios de Julgamento] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206203000/http://carnaval2008.ig.com.br/riodejaneiro/noticias/2008/01/03/criterios_de_julgamento_dos_quesitos_1138454.html |date=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scoring system has changed several times in both cities. In Rio and São Paulo, until the early 2000s, the division was more than half a point, and there have been years when there was also the elimination of major score given to each school, the very removal of the lower scores have also and has ceased to be part of the rule several times. In Rio de Janeiro, the lowest score in the same period was 5, and note the 0 (zero) allowed only in case of failure of the plot.

Often the scores given by the jurors are questioned, both by fans, as by members of schools who are harmed, causing many complaints after the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/13-1087 SRZD - Bruno Chateaubriand diz que não julga mais desfile de escola de samba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207174802/http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/13-1087 |date=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some results have been controversial stop in court. In the case of the school of samba [[GRES Acadêmicos de Santa Cruz|Acadêmicos de Santa Cruz]] that the dark parade carnival in 1991 because of a blackout and was not evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academicosdesantacruz.com/v1/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=305&amp;Itemid=372 |title=Título ainda não informado (favor adicionar) |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academiadosamba.com.br/memoriasamba/desfiles/1991-1.htm |title=Título ainda não informado (favor adicionar) |language=Portuguese |author= |work= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years in São Paulo has been the climate of acceptance of the outcome, when in 2007 the president of Tobias Go-Go Live congratulate the Youth Alegre, being greeted by members of the Lemon school the following year.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Rede Globo]]'s archives, apuration of Carnival of São Paulo, 2007 and 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Champions Parade ==
Started in the 1980s, the Parade of Champions is an event during which the top 5 schools of the Special Group and the winner of Group A repeat their parades in the [[Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí|Sambadrome]]. It takes place on the Saturday following Ash Wednesday. This parade has no competitive character; it is a celebratory festival to crown the year's best schools that gives the parade participants (AKA foliões) a chance to be more carefree and enjoy themselves.&lt;ref name="Blumar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blumar.com.br/novo_site/carnival_rio_new.cfm?lang=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090211092752/http://www.blumar.com.br/novo_site/carnival_rio_new.cfm?lang=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 February 2009 |title=Carnaval do Brasil |accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Blumar.com.br }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In São Paulo, the parade of champions is the night between Friday night and after the carnival on Saturday. Already the parade in Rio is the night of Saturday to the early hours of Sunday. In Rio de Janeiro, until the 1990s, participated in the parade of champions also promoted the schools of the Group to access, something that remains in São Paulo. Tradition was considered also in the participation of society Rio carnival hundred Italian Carnevale D'Italia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbonline.terra.com.br/jb/evento/carnaval2001/rio/materia/2001/03/carriomat20010304015.html JB Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224122645/http://jbonline.terra.com.br/jb/evento/carnaval2001/rio/materia/2001/03/carriomat20010304015.html |date=February 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, an event that is considered integral to the history of Nene de Vila Matilde, was when the school was invited to join the parade of champions Rio, in an era where the Carnival Paulistano was much less popular and have not had a proper space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baressp.com.br/detalhe.asp?n=2304 Nenê de Vila Matilde - site oficial] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202193157/http://www.baressp.com.br/detalhe.asp?n=2304 |date=February 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not always, however, the parade of champions was a moment of pure celebration: many schools have taken the day to protest against the outcome of the championship. Fifth-placed in 2005, the Vai-Vai had no parade that year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090301202812/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u105478.shtml Folha - Em protesto, Vai-Vai desiste de participar do desfile das campeãs]&lt;/ref&gt; The Viradouro already the champions parade on Saturday with members using the clown nose&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnaval2007.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI1434758-EI8194,00.html O Dia - 25 de fevereiro de 2007, Beija-Flor exibe sua supremacia no desfile das campeãs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204812/http://carnaval2007.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI1434758-EI8194,00.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and banners of protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anteriores.gazetaweb.com/2001/Mar/04/col/nacional/nacional.htm Gazetaweb] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421103956/http://anteriores.gazetaweb.com/2001/Mar/04/col/nacional/nacional.htm |date=April 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sivaji''''' is a 2007 Indian [[Tamil language|Tamil-language]] [[masala film]] directed by [[S. Shankar]] and produced by [[AVM Productions]]. [[Rajinikanth]] and [[Shriya Saran]] play the lead roles, with [[Suman (actor)|Suman]], [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] and [[Raghuvaran]] playing other significant roles in the film. [[A. R. Rahman]] composed the soundtrack and background music, while [[Thotta Tharani]] and [[K. V. Anand]] were the film's [[art director]] and [[cinematographer]] respectively.

The film revolves around a well-established [[Software engineering|software systems architect]], Sivaji, who returns home to India after finishing work in the United States. On his return, he dreams of giving back to society with free medical treatment and education. However his plans face a roadblock in the form of the influential businessman, Adiseshan. When corruption also arises, Sivaji is left with no option but to fight the system in his own way.

The film was released worldwide on 15 June 2007 in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and subsequently released in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as a [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] version on the same date. The film was also dubbed in Hindi, which released on 8 January 2010. The film was positively received by critics, and became a commercial success worldwide. It went on to win a [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]], three [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]] and two [[Vijay Awards]].

The film was converted into [[3D film|3D]] and released on 12 December 2012 as ''Sivaji 3D''. The runtime of the 3D version was shorter than the original, cut to 155 minutes, and released amidst moderate fanfare and fared positively critically and commercially. It also became the first Indian film to use [[Dolby Atmos]] surround sound technology.

== Plot ==
Sivaji, an Indian [[software architect]], returns to India from the United States. He aims to establish a non-profit trust called ''Sivaji Foundation'', which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Adiseshan, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt [[Civil Services of India|civil service]], but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high that he has to mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji falls in love with a girl named Tamizhselvi. However, upon asking for his horoscope, an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.

Following the loss in the court case, Tamizhselvi requests Sivaji out of fear not to come for her again. Sivaji is reduced to utter poverty. Realising that the methods he used are unlikely to work again, he decides to play the game his own way. Sivaji, with the help of his uncle Arivu, acquires evidence of {{INR}}2&amp;nbsp;billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. He further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by [[hawala]] forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to ''Sivaji Foundation'', making the money usable and legitimate.

Sivaji informs the [[Income tax in India|Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department]] about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders (including Adiseshan) and gets them arrested. He reopens the foundation and soon is able to provide free, good quality education, infrastructure, services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu. Led by Adiseshan, those who were blackmailed by Sivaji exploit Tamizhselvi's innocence to silence him. Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested.

Adiseshan and the police order Sivaji to unlock his laptop. When Sivaji refuses, Adiseshan tortures him, leaving him for dead. To cover this up, Adiseshan and the police organise for thugs to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji's body, making it look like a murder by a third party. Sivaji, however, is faking; he was informed of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left alone in the room, he&lt;!--do ''not'' add "electrocute" here as, according to Wiktionary, it properly means "to kill by electric shock"--&gt; electrifies himself. Sivaji's friend Dr. Chezhian, Tamizhselvi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire. While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead, Chezhian revives him using a [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]]. Following Sivaji's "death", Adiseshan and the CBI still try to open Sivaji's laptop by trying to fool the [[Voice activity detection|voice-detection]] program; they fail and all the data in the laptop is erased.

A few days later, while everyone wonders about the future of ''Sivaji Foundation'', the revived Sivaji returns to take control of the foundation in the guise of an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] friend, M. G. Ravichandran. Though Adiseshan immediately realises that Ravichandran is actually Sivaji, he is unable to prove this to the police due to the proof of Sivaji's "death" and Ravichandran's identity. Later, Sivaji confronts Adiseshan and the two fight atop the terrace of Adiseshan's medical college. During the fight, Adiseshan inadvertently strikes the campus's terrace roof causing money hidden in it to fly around the campus. The students spot the money and go after it, causing a stampede in which Adiseshan is killed. ''Sivaji Foundation'' soon becomes a frontier for India's economic and industrial rise.

=== Development ===
Following the success of his film ''[[Jeans (film)|Jeans]]'' (1998), [[S. Shankar]] wrote a script for his next film titled ''[[Mudhalvan]]'' (1999) having [[Rajinikanth]] in mind for the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/did-you-know-/Rajinikanth-was-to-do-Shankars-Mudhalvan/articleshow/22368963.cms |title=Rajinikanth was to do Shankar's 'Mudhalvan' |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=7 September 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113044500/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/did-you-know-/Rajinikanth-was-to-do-Shankars-Mudhalvan/articleshow/22368963.cms |archivedate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to schedule conflicts with ''[[Padayappa]]'' (1999).{{Sfn|Ramachandran|2014|page=156}} Hence the role went to [[Arjun Sarja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/E8880B73B7238248652569400065DD65 |title=Cinema Reviews&amp;nbsp;– Mudhalvan |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=12 November 1999 |accessdate=9 February 2015 |author=Malathi Rangarajan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725212236/http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/%28docid%29/E8880B73B7238248652569400065DD65 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post ''[[Anniyan]]'' (2005), Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2005/06/21/stories/2005062100500100.htm |title='Success is a sweet struggle' |work=The Hindu |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=9 February 2015 |author=T.

In August 2005, Rajinikanth signed up for his next film which was to be produced by [[Chennai]]'s oldest operative studio, [[AVM Productions]], which was run by [[M. S. Guhan]] and [[M.

Tharani described the set designing for the song "Sahana", which was also shot at Ramoji Film City, as "extremely challenging".&lt;ref name="Tharani4" /&gt; After listening to the lyrics of the song which speaks of the four traditional [[Season|calendar seasons]], Tharani thought of using a concept titled ''Living in Seasons'', which he used at a [[symposium]] held in Japan.{{efn|''[[The Hindu]]'' gives the year the symposium was held as 1991,&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/for-me-every-set-is-a-challenge/article2273078.ece |title='For me, every set is a challenge' |work=The Hindu |date=20 July 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2015 |author=Savitha Gautham |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426014650/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/for-me-every-set-is-a-challenge/article2273078.ece |archivedate=26 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Rediff.com]] states the year to be 1992.&lt;ref name="Tharani4" /&gt;}} For the set's design which depicted the four seasons, Tharani proposed three concepts&amp;nbsp;– a traditional Japanese house, a contemporary house and a futuristic house. Shankar chose the futuristic house concept, which consisted of three domes in the shapes of a square, a circle and a pyramid adjacent to one another.&lt;ref name="Tharani4" /&gt; The circular dome had a pathway around it and water falling from a 50 feet high rock, which would seep under the set. Tharani made use of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]] and [[glass|normal glass]] with the former being implemented on the floor to make the dance movements more easier to perform. Construction of the set for the number was completed in 30&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/may/16slide5.htm |title=Thota Tharani on ''Sivaji''&amp;nbsp;– Slide&amp;nbsp;5 |publisher=Rediff |date=16 May 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2015 |author=Shobha Warrier |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426022645/http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/may/16slide5.htm |archivedate=26 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes and influences ==

Sivaji, who is a software engineer is frustrated with the corruption in India which is shown in the scene where he watches the pitiable condition of poor people stating that: "The rich get richer, the poor get poorer".&lt;ref name="Theme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/reel-city/article5055543.ece |title=Reel City |author=Sudhish Kamath |work=The Hindu |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202153041/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/reel-city/article5055543.ece |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivaji's love for his country is also illustrated in a scene where he is advised by his uncle to go back to abroad but he says "Where else will I go?

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Malathi Rangarajan of ''[[The Hindu]]'', in a review about the story, said that the lead character carrying out a rebellion against corruption was something "not be true to life". She concluded by saying that "the story sags towards the end". She, however, appreciated the performances of the prominent actors, the soundtrack, art direction, photography and the animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/06/22/stories/2007062250530200.htm |title=A magnum opus in style&amp;nbsp;– Sivaji |work=The Hindu |date=22 June 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2008 |author=Malathi Rangarajan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010091847/http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/06/22/stories/2007062250530200.htm |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ananth Krishnan, another review from ''The Hindu'', a month after the film's release, said that the film "... presents an effective diagnosis of entrenched corruption but the rather disturbing remedy it offers is, good old vigilantism." It concluded by saying that, though the film did well at the box-office, the message of rejecting the corrupt system instead of reforming it was troubling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/15/stories/2007071555071000.htm |title=Sivaji: super hit but the message is troubling |work=The Hindu |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate=9 January 2008 |author=Ananth Krishnan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118172127/http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/15/stories/2007071555071000.htm |archivedate=18 January 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.

It appreciated the other technical departments and suggested a good response at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/REVIEW-Sivaji-the-Boss/Article1-230429.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125060544/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/REVIEW-Sivaji-the-Boss/Article1-230429.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 January 2013 |title=REVIEW: Sivaji: the Boss |work=Hindustan Times |date=16 June 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2008 |author=TSV Hari}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of India]]'' had a similar review about the story saying that "it had nothing new to offer" but promised it to be entertaining and gave it four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/tamil/movie-reviews/Sivaji-The-Boss/movie-review/2142960.cms |title=Sivaji The Boss |work=The Times of India |date=23 June 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103224310/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/tamil/movie-reviews/Sivaji-The-Boss/movie-review/2142960.cms |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R G Vijayasarathy of [[Rediff.com]] summed the film by saying, "No logic, only Rajni's magic". About the story, he said, "Unfortunately, (the) message is lost in the maze of illogical and sometimes absurd sequences". The review, however, praised the performances of Rajinikanth, Shriya and Vivek and the technical crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jun/15sivaji2.htm |title=No logic, only Rajni's magic |publisher=Rediff |last=Vijayasarathy |first=R.

Such is the overpowering screen presence of his cinematic charisma in every frame of the film. The film works big time as Shankar has made the film on a grand scale, [..] which is a visual treat with superbly choreographed action scenes. All this comes with top-of-the line techno-finesse, perhaps the best ever in Tamil cinema" and also wrote that "Technically, [..] a revelation [..] there are stunning visuals, which is paisa vasool. K.V.Anand's cinematography is top class. Art director Thotta Tharani work is enticing, especially the sets in songs".&lt;ref name="Sify" /&gt;

[[Image:Stamp of Moldova 341.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Star boys. Children singing Christmas carols.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Star singers''' also known as '''Epiphany singers''', or '''Star boys' singing procession''' (England), are children and young people walking from house to house with a star on a rod and often wearing crowns and dressed in clothes to resemble the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (variously also known as Three Kings or Three Wise Man). The singing processions have their roots in an old medieval ecclesiastical play, centred on the Biblical Magi of the Christmas story in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (Mt 2,1-28), appropriate to [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. It is observed usually during the period between 27 December and 6 January (the feast of the Epiphany).

In Scandinavia and Central Europe a special set of songs, distinct from Christmas carols has developed in this context. In England, the liturgical drama developed from being performed by cathedral schoolboys in the 16th century to become a more secular mystery drama, containing also some ordinary Christmas songs and carols. Historically performed by boys and male adolescents only, it is nowadays performed by children and young people of both sexes in most regions where the tradition is alive.
[[File:01 Das katholische Fest der Heiligen drei Könige 2013 in Sanok.JPG|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Star boys and angels singing carols in church during [[Christmas]] and Epiphany in [[Sanok]], Poland 2013&lt;/center&gt;]]

== History ==
At a synod in [[Konstanz]] in Germany at Christmas in 1417 the British clergies performed the Star boy drama for the rest of the participants at the meeting. They wore expensive costumes and had a large shining star.&lt;ref&gt;Alv S. Hvidbergskaar: May the star come in? [Manuscript from a speech in the Norwegian Radio NRK on 3. January 1953], p. 6-7, op. cit. in Edvardsen 1993, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was a huge success at the church conference and could have been one of the main reasons for growing popularity of the drama in post-medieval Europe.

The importance of the Twelfth Day and the feast of the Epiphany grew with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar as the day, according to the earlier Julian calendar, is also the Old Christmas Day.

After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, pupils of the cathedral schools in Protestant nations conducted these processions to raise funds to replace the church support that had disappeared. The custom passed further on to the general populace as a kind of narrative folk drama, but seems to have declined in its original form since the late 19th century.

Since then the singing procession has become common in many parts of Europe (both in Catholic and Protestant areas) and in Russia. In most countries it is no longer restricted to boys, but children or both sexes participate. In Germany, Austria and Belgium organisations centrally organise the processions, collecting money for charity or international aid projects, leading to a widespread support of the custom.

[[File:Пимоненко Колядки 1880.jpg|thumbnail|&lt;center&gt;In Russia. 1880&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Central Europe ==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F064527-0021, Bundespräsident empfängt Sternsinger.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Epiphany singers are received by Germany's Federal President [[Karl Carstens]] in Bonn 1 December 1982. The poster reads: "Dreikönigssingen 1983 AMANI. Damit Kinder heute leben können".&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{clear}}
In Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria the Epiphany singing is performed at or close to Epiphany (January 6) and has developed into a nationwide custom, where the children of both sexes call on every door and are given sweets and money for charity projects - mostly in aid of poorer children in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Dec2000/Feature1.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

A tradition in most of Central Europe involves writing a blessing above the main door of the home. For instance if the year is 2014, it would be "20 * C + M + B + 14". The initials refer to the Latin phrase "Christus mansionem benedicat" (= May Christ bless this house&lt;!--mansionem=house, apartment; benedicat=he bless--&gt;); folkloristically the letters are often interpreted as the names of the Three Wise Men (Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar). In Catholic parts of Germany and in Austria, this is done by the ''Sternsinger'' (literally "Star singers"). After having sung their songs, recited a poem, and collected donations for children in poorer parts of the world, they will chalk the blessing on the top of the door frame or place a sticker with the blessing.

=== In Germany ===
Annually around 300 000 people are active in collecting donations in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sternsinger.de/|title=Home - Die Sternsinger|last=Sternsinger|website=Die Sternsinger|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Austria ===
In Austria the biggest carol singing campaign is organized by the "DKA" (Dreikönigsaktion), an aid foundation founded by the youth organization [[Katholische Jungschar]]. Annually about 85,000 children and 30,000 adults take part in the "Dreikönigsaktion".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dka.at/english/about-us/ Homepage of DKA: About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sternsinger.jpg|thumb||300px|Star singers in [[Vienna]], Austria.]]

=== In Slovakia ===
The biggest carol singing campaign in Slovakia is Dobrá Novina (English: "Good News"). It is also one of the biggest charity campaigns by young people in the country. Dobrá Novina is organized by the youth organization [[ERko – Hnutie kresťanských spoločenstiev detí|eRko]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. also Jančovič, J, Fialová, Z and O’Mullane, M (2015) '[http://www.developmenteducationreview.com/issue20-perspectives%205 Development Education at University Level in Slovakia: Experiences and Challenges]', Vol. 20, Spring, pp. 166-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Star singers, aged about ten to fifteen, are dressed in long white shirts and pointed brown or white paper hats, in imitation of a well-known picture of the Biblical Magi as [[Babylon]]ians Balthazar carries the star and Caspar and Melchior are armed with wooden swords. The other characters usually do not disguise themselves but also dress in long shirts, often in brown, green or grey colours and conical hats. Joseph has got a cylindrical paper hat and a wooden timber or broad axe. King Herod wears a crown and he and his soldiers carry wooden swords.&lt;ref&gt;Neither the star play nor the costumes have however anything to do with the [[Plough Monday]] [[Mummers Play|mummers]] in England as suggested by Kathleen Stokker 2000, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the crowd there may also be shepherds with long shirts and sticks and some angels with white shirts and wings.

The Star singers walk about from house to house "singing at the doors, with a star on a pole".&lt;ref&gt;Laurits Bødker 1965, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic part is introduced by one of the Wise Men knocking on someone's door asking: "May the star come in?" If the offer is accepted, they are all invited inside. Then the whole procession will enter the home singing a special Christmas carol. Then the play begins.

In the performance, the [[Biblical Magi|Three Wise Men]], [[Biblical Magi#Names|Gaspar]], [[Melchior]] and [[Biblical Magi#Names|Balthazar]], are first confronted by [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], who tries to protect the newborn baby [[Jesus]] (a doll) and his wife [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] from the intruders with a wooden axe. The three magi are however most welcome inside after saying that they have brought with them presents for the child. The Wise Men also have to mislead [[Herod the Great|King Herod]], who is also trying to find the new born 'prince' in the stable. Both Gaspar and Melchior fight the king and his men with swords, together with Joseph who uses his broad axe, while Mary nurses her son and Balthazar takes care of the shining star.

After the performance [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] comes to collect money or other gifts from the audience in a large bag. The boys and girls are usually treated to drinks and cakes afterwards. Then the Star singers leave the house for their next visit to somewhere in the neighbourhood, singing a song containing a farewell and many thanks for the received gifts.

The star itself is made anew each year, using transparent paper on a constructed frame built of wooden lists and with one to three candles placed inside. The star on the rod has to be movable and turned around all the time, so that the paper does not get overheated and does not go up in flame.

The Star boys' singing procession in England seems later to have been mixed together with several other kinds of carol singers at Christmas. They do not go from house to house, but visit two or three local pubs to receive free beer. Nowadays they are not carrying the shining star anymore, but just a quadrangular paraffin wax on a long stick or even a candle lamp with an ordinary handle.&lt;ref&gt;Edvardsen 1993, p. 109-110. Refers to oral information collected from British theatre director [[Nadine Baylis]], in Haddenham ([[Buckinghamshire]]), and from Tove Gaarder, who grew up in the mining town [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]].&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas religious folk plays are the norm in the rest of Europe, the British folk drama is absolutely secular, even if they are mostly taking place on the Christian festival days.

== "Stjernespill" in Scandinavia and Finland ==
[[Image:Tiernapojat oulussa.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Finnish Star boys (''tiernapojat'') in [[Oulu]], 1919.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the Nordic countries the Star boys' singing procession is known all along the coast, though not often in inland communities. At the end of the 1880s many objected to this Catholic form of organised begging, and officials began forbidding the practice. By the 1900s it had largely disappeared, and there are now just a few places where the original play of the Star boys can be counted as an unbroken linear tradition, for instance the islands Amager in Denmark, and Haram and Vigra on the west coast of Norway, but the most famous one is probably the Star boys' singing procession in the small town of Grimstad on the south coast of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;The Grimstad custom is encouraged by local people of influence – journalists, teachers and local historians – who train the new boys and maintain standards. However, the grown ups also prevent changes in the tradition.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Sweden ===
In 19th century the Swedish Star boys started to join in with horse riding on St. Stephen's Day, 26 December. The tradition of Star boys (sometimes even with [[Judas Iscariot]]), singing and acting about [[Christmas]], [[Saint Stephen and Herod|Saint Stephen]] and [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], has traditionally been performed from St. Stephen's Day until Epiphany.

Today they are only to be seen bringing up the rear together with bridesmaids and elves as a part of the [[Saint Lucy's Day|Lucia]] procession on December 13. Recently school teachers, nursery nurses and Christian clergymen have tried to revitalize the play for small children, inviting their parents to come to the schools, the kindergartens or the churches to see it performed. But the popular and more humorous folkloristic elements of the play are often left out.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, a version of the Star boys' procession originating in the city of [[Oulu]], a musical play known as ''Tiernapojat'', has become established as a cherished Christmas tradition nationwide. The ''Tiernapojat'' show is a staple of Christmas festivities in schools, kindergartens, and elsewhere, and it is broadcast every Christmas on radio and television. The Finnish version contains non-biblical elements such as king Herod vanquishing the "king of the Moors", and a short song of praise to [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander]].

'''''Tatsumi''''' is a 2011 Japanese-language Singaporean animated drama film directed by [[Eric Khoo]]. It is based on the [[manga]] memoir ''[[A Drifting Life]]'' and five earlier short stories by the Japanese manga artist [[Yoshihiro Tatsumi]]. The film is a Singaporean production with Japanese dialogue, and was animated in Indonesia.

The film premiered in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 2011.&lt;ref name="Cannes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/File/Web/HORAIRES%202011/Horaire%20internet.pdf|title=Horaires 2011|language=French|work=festival-cannes.com|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later made its box office debut in the Singapore box office on 15 September 2011.&lt;ref name="insing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.insing.com/movie/tatsumi/id-43030000 |title=Tatsumi on inSing movies|work=SingTel Digital Media Pte Ltd. |publisher=inSing|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected as the Singaporean entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]],&lt;ref name="84th"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.zaobao.com/pages12/movies110912.shtml |title=邱金海动画片《辰巳Tatsumi》 报名奥斯卡最佳外语片奖 |accessdate=29 September 2011 |work=Zaobao |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103004614/http://stars.zaobao.com/pages12/movies110912.shtml |archivedate=3 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMPAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20111013.html |title=63 Countries Vie for 2011 Foreign Language Film Oscar |accessdate=14 October 2011|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not make the final shortlist.&lt;ref name="Oscar Shortlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120118.html|title=9 Foreign Language Films Vie for Oscar|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=May 2011}}
The film follows the career of [[Yoshihiro Tatsumi]], as he begins to work as a comics artist in post-war occupied Japan, meets his idol [[Osamu Tezuka]], and invents the [[gekiga]] genre of Japanese comics for adults. Interwoven with the biographical material are segments based on Tatsumi's short stories "Hell", "Beloved Monkey", "Just a Man", "Good-Bye" and "Occupied".&lt;ref name=presskit /&gt;

==Voice cast==
* [[Tetsuya Bessho]]
* [[Yoshihiro Tatsumi]]

==Production==
===Development===
Singaporean director [[Eric Khoo]], who previously exclusively made live-action films but has a past as a comics artist, was first introduced to the works of [[Yoshihiro Tatsumi]] during his military service, and says that he immediately was stricken by the sadness and beauty of the stories. When Tatsumi's 840-page autobiographical [[manga]], ''[[A Drifting Life]]'', was published in Singapore in 2009, Khoo realised that Tatsumi still was alive and wanted to pay tribute to him. Khoo visited Tatsumi in Japan in October 2009 and received the permission to adapt the work to film.&lt;ref name=labouroflove&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ee-Meyers|first=Elaine|date=2 December 2010|url=http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/film/feature/life-in-cartoon-motion|title=Eric Khoo's latest labour of love: Tatsumi|work=[[Time Out Singapore]]|accessdate=2 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xdz3hADJ?url=http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/film/feature/life-in-cartoon-motion |archivedate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was led by Khoo's Singaporean company Zhao Wei Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Frater|first=Patrick|date=7 February 2011|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/tatsumi-finds-match-with-factory|title=Tatsumi finds match with Factory|work=Film Business Asia|accessdate=2 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509145012/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/tatsumi-finds-match-with-factory|archivedate=9 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget of the film corresponded to 800,000 US dollars.&lt;ref name=thpqa&gt;{{Cite web|last=Landreth|first=Jonathan|date=15 May 2011|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-qa-tatsumi-director-eric-188489|title=Cannes Q&amp;A: 'Tatsumi' Director Eric Khoo|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual style and storyboards of the film were kept tightly to Tatsumi's original drawings. Khoo said: "You see, Tatsumi loves cinema, and when he created this new movement of comics using strips with real characters, rather than the four-panel manga convention, he produced works that are like storyboards for a film. All we need to do is stretch them out to a widescreen format. And give them multi-planes, like layers, so there is more depth and feel. I also tweaked certain things, changed some of the sequences of the stories, so for the cinema his stories got a new voice."&lt;ref name=labouroflove /&gt;

===Casting and staff===
Tatsumi himself was involved in the project and oversaw details to secure authenticity, as well as provided the narration for the biographical segments. Other prominent voices were performed by the Japanese stage actor [[Tetsuya Bessho]].&lt;ref name=presskit&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/040659.pdf|title=English press kit Tatsumi|publisher=The Match Factory|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=labouroflove /&gt; Minor characters were played by amateurs from Singapore's Japanese minority. People with roots in [[Osaka]] were sought out specifically, and Tatsumi instructed the actors how to speak the Osaka dialect of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=thpqa /&gt;

===Principal production===
Animation work started in March 2010 at Infinite Frameworks Studios in [[Batam]], Indonesia.&lt;ref name=labouroflove /&gt; It involved a team of 25 artists who previously had worked mainly on [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated television]] shows.&lt;ref name=thpqa /&gt;

===Music===
The theme song of this film was composed by director Eric Khoo's then 13-year-old son Christopher.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterreview" /&gt; Christopher composed a total of 3 musical compositions for the film.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterreview" /&gt;

==Critical reception==
In a review written at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]], the Hollywood Reporter said reviewed that the film "evinces a mood that is unutterably sad, yet indescribably beautiful.", but added that "the sinister and decidedly adult subject matter may scale down its widespread marketability".&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterreview" /&gt; The reviewer also praised the three music compositions, which she felt "lend the biographical segments a sweetly rueful timbre".&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterreview" /&gt; The reviewer also said that "the uncompromising, shattering power of the stories, (made) the account of Tatsumi's life seem less engaging."&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterreview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/tatsumi-cannes-2011-review-190892 |title=Tatsumi: Cannes 2011 Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tickles The Chimp", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-10/news/9612100178_1_elmo-tickle-sesame-street-character | title=Toy Creator Unwraps Story Of Success | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=December 10, 1996 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Black, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as "Tickles The Chimp," which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make ''Sesame Street'' plush, but did have ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], they also made Tickle Me versions of baby [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Tweety]], they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do ''Looney Tunes'' but gained the rights to ''Sesame Street,'' thus starting Tickle Me Elmo.  The invention was originally introduced under [[Cabbage Patch Kids|Cabbage Patch]] at [[Hasbro]] Industries.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Neil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, "When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Chelsea|year=2009|title=Child's Play: Mattel's Neil Friedman Has Built a Career out of Toying Around—And Making Kids Smile|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-203927063|others={{subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|journal=[[Success (magazine)|Success]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996 Elmo craze==
Tickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the  [[Black Friday (shopping)|day after Thanksgiving]], when they suddenly sold out.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; With the [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers.&lt;ref name="desperate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baca|first=Maria Elena|date=10 December 1996|title=Desperate shoppers not laughing at Tickle Me Elmo|newspaper=Star Tribune|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62644967.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was helped by [[Rosie O'Donnell]], who had shown the toy on [[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|her popular TV show]] in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummins|first=H.

The scarcity of the new toy provoked a "shopping frenzy".&lt;ref name="frenzy"/&gt; Two women were arrested in [[Chicago]] for fighting over the doll,&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt; while in [[New York City|New York]] some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Riddell|first=Mary|date=20 December 1996|title=Spend!

"[1996]: Tickle Me Elmo becomes the hottest toy of the holiday season. More than a million are sold that year alone."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further Tickle Me toys==
In early 1997, Tyco released new "Tickle Me" toys based on other characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' – first ''Tickle Me Ernie'' and ''Tickle Me Big Bird'', then ''Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo.&lt;ref name="hot toy"/&gt; With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, ''Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' and ''Mini Tickle Me Ernie'' were also put on the market.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The "Surprise Edition" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the "Surprise Edition" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Katie|date=11 October 2001|title=Elmo's Worth More Than a Tickle|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,47368,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TMX===
In 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, [[Fisher-Price]] released a new Elmo doll called ''TMX'', meaning "Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten" or "Tickle Me eXtreme".  The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention ([[River Forest, Illinois]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jedlowski|first=Jill|date=17 January 2007|title=Toy Story: TMX Elmo Creator Talks Business|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157884899.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first announced at the [[American International Toy Fair]]. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4x-VW_rCSE "Tickle Me Elmo X TMX Elmo"] (on Youtube).&lt;/ref&gt;

The full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing [[confidentiality agreement]]s. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of ''Toy Wishes'' magazine said, "The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.".&lt;ref name="top secret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Olivia|date=1 February 2006|title=Meet 'Top Secret Elmo'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-02-01-tickle-me-elmo_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Image:Tmx-elmo.jpg|TMX Elmo--&gt;
Toy analyst Chris Byrne told ''[[USA Today]]'', "This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category." Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. "The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon." He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since [[Furby]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="top secret"/&gt; However, some members of the media expected a large response.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[Toys "R" Us]] stores and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kotecki Vest|first=Erin|date=22 September 2006|title=Elmo Suckers Me to the Dark Side|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erin-kotecki-vest/elmo-suckers-me-to-the-da_b_30043.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which said the man "was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tickle pickle: Your Elmo or your life! |date=25 September 2006 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061727/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 [[financial year]] to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of [[financial analyst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=16 October 2006|title=Mattel Posts 6 Percent Rise in Profit|newspaper=AP Online|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-99173190.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=17 October 2006|title=Mattel Tops Expectations|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Post]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152989624.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In January 2007, Mattel announced it would release ''TMX Friends'', featuring Elmo, [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] and [[Cookie Monster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kavilanz|first=Parija B.|date=29 January 2007|title=Following T.M.X.

===eXtra Special Edition===
For the Christmas 2007 season, [[Fisher-Price]] released a version with hidden surprises.  [[Mattel]] has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmxspecialedition.com/ Fisher Price T.M.X. Special Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===LOL Elmo===
[[Playskool]] released the toy again as ''LOL Elmo''. Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's [[Sesame Street]] section, there is a sign printed "Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012".  Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
===Tickle Me Elmo (2017)===

[[Playskool]] made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like "Elmo is one ticklish monster". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found

'''''Tomfoolery''''' (or '''''Tom Foolery''''') is a [[musical theater|musical]] [[revue]] based on lyrics and music that American mathematician, songwriter, and satirist [[Tom Lehrer]] first performed in the 1950s and 1960s.

Devised and produced by [[Cameron Mackintosh]], it premiered in London at the [[Criterion Theatre]], directed by [[Gillian Lynne]], on 5 June 1980, where it had a successful run. It subsequently opened on December 14, 1981 [[off-Broadway]] at the Top of the Gate in [[Greenwich Village]], New York, where it ran for 120 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_t/tom_foolery.htm ''Tomfoolery'' production and plot information] www.nodanw.com, accessed December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mti&gt;[http://www.mtishows.com/show_home.asp?id=000199 ''Tomfoolery'' production and show information] mtishows.com, accessed December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included [[Jonathan Hadary]].&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, Frank.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9B06EEDD1538F936A25751C1A967948260  "''Tomfoolery'', A Revue of Lehrer Lyrics",] ''The New York Times'', December 15, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehrer himself was brought in as a consultant.

The revue features 28 of Lehrer's satirical songs that were written in the 1950s and 1960s, known for their "witty naughtiness".&lt;ref name=rich/&gt;  Stage directions suggest each actor use their own name and wait onstage in a bar area while the others perform.&lt;ref name=mti/&gt;

Two cast recordings have been released, one by the original London cast ([[Robin Ray]], [[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]], [[Martin Connor (actor)|Martin Connor]] and [[Tricia George (actress)|Tricia George]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001LDH3XC ''Tomfoolery'' 1980 Original cast recording listing on amazon.com] www.amazon.com, accessed December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the other much rarer one by the Canadian cast.

The '''Ventriloquist''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s, [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. All of the Ventriloquist's versions are enemies of [[Batman]], belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]].

==Publication history==
The original Ventriloquist, '''Arnold Wesker''', first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #583 (February 1988) and was created by [[John Wagner]], [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]].

In ''Detective Comics'' #827 (March 2007), a new Ventriloquist ('''Peyton Riley''') was introduced by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Don Kramer]].

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Ventriloquist was introduced named '''Shauna Belzer''', first appearing in ''Batgirl'' #20 (July 2013), as created by [[Gail Simone]] and Fernando Pasarin.

==Fictional character biography==
===Arnold Wesker===
A meek, quiet man named '''Arnold Wesker''' (the first Ventriloquist) plans and executes his crimes through a [[Ventriloquism|dummy]] named '''Scarface''', with the dress and persona of a 1920s [[gangster]] (complete with pinstripe suit, cigar, and [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy gun]]). His name comes from the nickname of [[Al Capone]], after whom Scarface is modeled.

Born into a powerful [[Mafia]] family, Wesker develops [[dissociative identity disorder]] after seeing his mother [[assassination|assassinated]] by thugs from a rival family. Growing up, his only outlet is [[ventriloquism]].

''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase '94]]'' #8-9 establishes an alternate [[origin story]]: after a barroom brawl in which he kills someone during a violent release of his repressed anger, Wesker is sent to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]. He is introduced to "Woody" — a dummy carved from the remains of the former Blackgate [[gallows]] by his cellmate Donnegan — who convinces him to escape and kill Donnegan in a fight which scars the dummy, thus resulting in the birth of Scarface.

Wesker lets the Scarface personality do the dirty work, including robbery and murder. He is totally dominated by Scarface, who barks orders at him and degrades him with verbal (and even physical) abuse. Wesker is unable to enunciate the letter "B" in his words while throwing his voice and replaces them with the letter "G" instead (for example, Scarface often calls Batman and Robin "Gatman and Rogin").

In the 1995 [[Riddler]] story ''Riddler: The Riddle Factory'', it is revealed that a gangster named "Scarface" Scarelli had once been active in [[Gotham City]], though he had apparently died long before Batman's era. A [[supernatural]] aspect to Scarface was hinted at in Wesker's alternate origin story in ''Showcase '94'' #8-9, when Wesker's cellmate creates the first Scarface dummy from pieces of wood from the remains of Blackgate Prison's gallows. 2001's ''Batman/Scarface: A Psychodrama'' reinforces this and shows the dummy to be indirectly responsible for two accidents while separated from Wesker (with at least one fatality). The dummy also retained his speech impediment while operated by a young boy and seemed to even show awareness of his name during this period.

The Ventriloquist is one of many [[villain]]s in the Batman's rogues gallery to be confined to [[Arkham Asylum]] when Batman apprehends him. One particularly memorable series of events concerning him took place during the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline, after [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] had destroyed Arkham and released its inmates. Unable to find Scarface, the Ventriloquist uses a sock puppet in his place for a short time (aptly named Socko). After an ill-fated team-up with fellow escapee [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]],&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #659&lt;/ref&gt; he procures a number of other hand puppets to fill in for Scarface, including one of a police officer which he refers to as "Chief O'Hara". Later, when Wesker does indeed find Scarface, Scarface and Socko are set at odds until a standoff occurs, and the puppets shoot each other, leaving Wesker unconscious and bleeding from two wounded hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #664&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events of the ''[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' story arc, the stress caused by the earthquake apparently triggered the release of another personality within Wesker in the form of the 'Quakemaster', who claimed to have caused the earthquake himself over a video and threatened to trigger another unless he was paid $100 million. However, the [[seismology|seismologist]] Quakemaster had captured to provide him with information deliberately feeds him inaccurate scientific data to provide detectives looking for her with information as to her location. [[Tim Drake|Robin]] subsequently deduces 'Quakemaster's' true identity, due to his speeches always taking great effort to avoid saying any words with the letter "B".

In one issue, Wesker is apparently killed, and in a bizarre twist, Scarface appears to still talk and act alive before he is destroyed. This death appears to have been [[retcon]]ned in "[[One Year Later]]" (presumably due to the events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]]). Wesker appears as one of the members of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] that faces the [[Lady Shiva|Jade Canary]], who pitches Scarface off the top of a roof.

In ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #818, an issue later included in the trade paperback ''[[Batman: Face the Face]]'', Wesker is murdered by an unseen assailant. The dummy Scarface is stepped on and its head crushed. The dying Wesker uses Scarface's hand to leave a clue regarding his murder: a street name. Later in the storyline, it is revealed that [[Tally Man#Second Tally Man|Tally Man]], acting as an enforcer for the [[Great White Shark (comics)|Great White Shark]], is responsible for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #818-819 (June–July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Wesker is among the many deceased villains that receive a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] and is reanimated into a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. Using his power ring, Wesker creates a construct of Scarface made of black energy. He is shown murdering many police officers.&lt;ref name="bn1"&gt;''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1-3 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Arnold Wesker was never killed. He appears in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]'' #2. Implied to be in possession of the Venom steroid, he clashes briefly with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].

During ''The War of Jokes and Riddles'', Wesker and Scarface are seen as part of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s gang in his gang war against the Riddler's gang.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' vol. 3 #26&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Harley Quinn: Rebirth'', after turning on the Penguin, the Ventriloquist and Scarface join up with the few remaining crimelords of New York that managed to escape from the Penguin's giant penguins and they help Harley to fight back. Afterwards, he is put in charge of Coney Island's Mafia.

===Peyton Riley===
[[Image:Peyton Riley.jpg|thumb|180px|The second Ventriloquist, Peyton Riley. Cover to ''Detective Comics'' #843, art by [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]].]]
A new female Ventriloquist, '''Peyton Riley''', called "Sugar" by Scarface, soon surfaced in the pages of ''[[Detective Comics]]''. Batman responded to a police scanner call - witnesses said [[Catwoman]] had been shot. He got to the body, which had a note on it that read "dummy." A counter started at four seconds - he got out as the place exploded. When he got back to his car, there was a dummy posing as Robin. He shot it with a grapple and it, too, exploded.

Batman had the police exhume Arnold Wesker's body, but the coffin was empty. Bruce went out disguised as Lefty Knox to see what the underground was saying. Within a week, he heard the Ventriloquist was making a comeback at the [[Iceberg Lounge]]. "Lefty" attended the big show - as the curtains parted, Wesker sat with Scarface in his lap. A beautiful blonde whom Scarface calls "Sugar" knocked over the dead body, picked up the dummy, and continued on. When she was questioned by an audience member, she shot him. Scarface told the room he was working on a plan to take over the city, but would have to remove Batman from the equation first. He called Batman out, knowing that he would be in the audience. Bruce threw his voice and made it look like one of the other criminals was confessing. A batarang flew and took out the lights. Scarface opened fire. Batman swooped in and grabbed the woman and the dummy. He separated them and realized the dummy was a bomb. The woman escaped. Batman informed Gordon of what had happened.

Sugar is a more compatible partner than Wesker, since Scarface no longer substitutes "B" with "G", and she is far more willing to commit violent crime. When nearly captured by Batman and [[Harley Quinn]] (who had been close to Wesker after he tried to cheer her up when she was initially sent to Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose), Sugar has Scarface say, "Save yourself." Unlike Wesker, who is horrified at any damage to Scarface, Sugar rigs her dummies to explode, using this to cover her escapes. She has numerous identical dummies at her hideout, one of which then becomes the "real" Scarface.

During ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' #2 (January 2008), Sugar and Scarface, along with [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]], the [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], and [[Killer Moth]] are told by the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] that the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] is working for the [[Suicide Squad]]. They attack him, but end up meeting a team of criminals working for the Penguin. While they try to escape, they are brought to a dead end by the Scarecrow. [[Tobias Whale]] shoots Scarface, but lets Sugar live, although he informs one of the men escorting her that she is to be "hurt".

In ''Detective Comics'' #843 (April 2008), Scarface kidnaps a rival gangster, Johnny Sabatino, and takes Bruce Wayne hostage. While alone, Sugar breaks away from Scarface and talks to Bruce in what appears to be her 'real' personality. She reveals that she was engaged to Wayne's friend, Matthew Atkins, "years ago." Her real name is revealed to be Peyton Riley, and she expresses remorse for her crimes before the Scarface persona reappears and interrupts their conversation.

In the following issue, Riley reveals that her father, an [[Irish Mafia]] boss named Sean Riley, wanted to marry her off to Sabatino, forming a permanent alliance between Gotham's Irish and [[Italian Mafia|Italian]] gangs. Sean Riley therefore assaults Peyton's fiancé, leaving him in intensive care. He subsequently becomes an [[alcoholic]], and Peyton was forced to marry Sabatino. This does not lead to the hoped-for gang alliance, as Sabatino proves to be an inept gangster. He and Peyton are eventually taken to see Scarface, as Sabatino had cheated him on a weapons deal. Both Scarface and Wesker were impressed by Peyton's intelligence, and give Sabatino a second chance, taking 30% of his profits.

In ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #850 (November 2008), she and [[Hush (comics)|Tommy Elliot]] bond over their mutual resentment of their families, and vow that they will escape together when Elliot comes into his fortune. However, Elliot's ailing mother does not approve of their relationship, and when Tommy refuses to stop seeing Peyton, she writes him out of her will. Peyton subsequently runs the departing family lawyer off of the road and kills him (calling in a favour from some of her father's men to "take care of the details"), while Elliot murders his mother. Peyton declares that they can finally be free together - only to be abandoned by Elliot, who later describes her as a "sweet girl, but too needy."

When Scarface's hold on the mob begins to crumble, Sabatino, now a crime boss in his own right, decides to cement his own position by wiping out the Rileys. After killing his father-in-law, he takes Peyton to a gangster's hide-out and shoots her in the head. She survives, however, and regains consciousness just as the [[Tally Man#Second Tally Man|Tally Man]] is killing Wesker nearby. Peyton finds the body of Wesker, and is shocked to hear Scarface talking to her. Although she suspects she may be hallucinating, she forms a partnership with him.

Scarface and Peyton plan to throw Sabatino over the side of his own yacht. [[Zatanna]] rescues Wayne from something, and, as Batman, he proceeds to rescue Sabatino while Zatanna tries to talk down Peyton, explaining that dolls and puppets have powerful magic. Before she can have any effect, a thug named Moose hits her with an oar. While Batman protects Zatanna from Moose, Peyton makes another attempt to throw Sabatino over the side, but gets too close, and he begins to strangle her with his own bonds. Scarface quietly says, "Jump, Sugar", and Peyton sends them both over the side. Before they hit the water, Scarface says "G'bye, kiddo. I loved y..." Riley has not appeared again ever since.

===Shauna Belzer===
In ''[[The New 52]]'', a new Ventriloquist debuted in the pages of ''[[Batgirl]]''. '''Shauna Belzer''' grew up in the shadow of her twin brother Ferdie, whom their parents treated as a favorite while ignoring her; other children, meanwhile, idolized Ferdie while bullying her. When Shauna learned she could [[telekinesis|move things with her mind]], she used her newfound powers to murder one of her tormentors. She would later use these powers to kill her hated brother and make it look like an accident.

Shauna was trying to find her place in the world when she first met Ferdie, the dummy. She saw him at a birthday party and killed the clown who was using him. Shauna would later go on to kill her parents and start doing ventriloquist acts that would usually end with a dead audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl'' Vol. 4 #20 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shauna is one of six individuals who are kidnapped by a man identifying himself as the [[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]], and sealed inside a shipping container on the bottom of the ocean. Besides Shauna, the others are the [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], [[Big Shot (comics)|Big Shot]], [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]], [[Strix (comics)|Strix]] and [[Porcelain (comics)|Porcelain]]. After escaping, this group becomes known as the new [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Six'' vol. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Mockingbird is eventually revealed to be the [[Riddler]], who believes that one of the six stole a priceless diamond from him, but he does not know who. The thief is revealed to be the ventriloquist doll Ferdie, who had stolen the diamond and hidden it within his own wooden body, his persona being so separate from Shauna's that she did not even realize that her doll was the thief. In the final issue of the ''Secret Six'' series, Shauna betrays the team and abandons Ferdie when he insists that they remain loyal to the group. Shauna is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, where she is now using a sock puppet as her new doll.

==Powers and abilities==
The first Ventriloquist has no superhuman powers and is not a good hand-to-hand combatant. He is a skilled ventriloquist and his Scarface persona is a skilled criminal strategist. However, he is unable to pronounce any word with a letter "B" in it accurately without moving his lips, giving Scarface a speech impediment in which he says every "B" in a word as a "G". Wesker usually carries a handgun of some kind, while Scarface carries a trademark [[Tommy gun]]. However, Wesker tends to show that he and Scarface hold two different personalities and he and Scarface can sometimes argue amongst each other, which tends to work as an advantage to Batman in several occasions.

The second Ventriloquist is much more skilled in ventriloquism than her predecessor and is capable of pronouncing all speech patterns with more proficiency when in her Scarface persona. Unlike the first one, the second Ventriloquist's personality does not contradict Scarface's and is much more willing to commit cruel acts, especially since she believes that the she and the dummy are in a romantic relationship. Coming from an elite Mafia family, she is also a brilliant criminal mastermind.

The third Ventriloquist is, possibly, a metahuman capable of controlling other beings. Her psychotic mind often leads those to gain their own personalities.

==Other versions==
===DCAU continuity===
In the [[DC Animated Universe|DCAU]]-[[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] comic books, Scarface has his speech impediment from the mainstream [[DC Universe]] version. This was explained by Scarface claiming that, while "in prison" after one of Wesker's arrests, he was involved in a fight where a fellow inmate tore his lips off.

===Batman: Arkham Unhinged===
In ''[[Batman: Arkham Unhinged]]'' #29-31, the Ventriloquist and Scarface are seen participating in [[Two-Face]]'s trial against Joker as a juror, where he voted guilty due to Joker forcefully taking Scarface from him.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Arkham Unhinged'' #29-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===
In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Arnold Wesker's Ventriloquist appears mutated into a macaw by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] and the [[Foot Clan]] to attack Batman and Robin. Batman is captured, but Robin manages to escape. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] then arrive, where Splinter defeats the mutated villains, while Batman uses his new Intimidator Armor to defeat the Shredder and the Turtles defeat Ra's al Ghul. Later, Gordon tells Batman that the police scientists have managed to turn all of the Arkham inmates, including Wesker, back to normal and they are currently in [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#A.R.G.U.S.|A.R.G.U.S.]] custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Batman: White Knight''===
The Arnold Wesker incarnation of the Ventriloquist has a minor appearance in ''[[Batman: White Knight]]''. Wesker, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a [[Joker (character)|Joker]] who had been force-fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from [[Clayface]]'s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]’s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Wesker and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of [[Gotham City]]’s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by the Neo-Joker (the second [[Harley Quinn]], who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality while the Joker was the true, beautiful personality) in an effort to get Napier to release the Joker persona.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist appears in the projects of the [[DC animated universe]], where he and Scarface are both voiced by [[George Dzundza]]. Both Rhino (voiced by [[Earl Boen]]) and Mugsy (voiced by [[Joe Piscopo]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Townsend Coleman]] in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'') have appeared alongside the Ventriloquist in the animated series.
** Ventriloquist and Scarface appear in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. In this depiction, he is a master ventriloquist and can pronounce every sound perfectly as Scarface, a decision [[Bruce Timm]] fought for even though DC Comics wanted Scarface to substitute 'B' with 'G' as in the comics.&lt;ref&gt;"Read My Lips" Commentary&lt;/ref&gt; In his first appearance "Read My Lips", Batman investigates a series of robberies and discovers that the crimes are planned by a mob boss known as "Scarface" who has been having his minions Rhino, Mugsy, and their new recruit Ratso (voiced by [[Neil Ross]]) commit them. He traces Scarface to his lair at a deserted mannequin warehouse and discovers that the crime czar is a wooden dummy, manipulated by a mild-mannered man called 'Ventriloquist'. As he makes further developments, he realizes Arnold Wesker (the ventriloquist) has a split personality and it is the dummy who manipulates Wesker. Scarface and his gang capture Batman by discovering the bug he put on the Ventriloquist's tie and organizes a fake heist to get Batman. Scarface ties and hangs Batman and sets him to fall into a pit full of mannequin hands with sharpened nails pointing up while destroying the bug. Batman even admitted that he allowed Wesker to let him get close to Scarface. At this point by faking and projecting the voice of the Ventriloquist, Batman plays both of Wesker's personalities, setting them to fight against each other. This gets to the point where Scarface orders that Wesker be shot, an order no one carries out, so Scarface tries to shoot Wesker himself until Batman cuts off his hand with a [[batarang]]. While the duo argue, Batman manages to free himself safely and take out the gang. During the fight, Scarface's minion Mugsy shoots at Batman, but accidentally destroys Scarface. At the end of the episode, Wesker is shown in one of Arkham Asylum's workshops working on a project. After a nurse congratulates him on his recovery, he rolls it over revealing a new dummy head. He takes a knife and makes a scar across the face similar to the original Scarface's as Wesker is rebuilding Scarface. In the [[DVD]] commentary to "Read My Lips", Timm stated that the [[Fox Kids]] censors allowed the recurring destruction of Scarface because he wasn't a "living" character which allowed the production staff to vent their darker impulses by finding a more gruesome way of destroying the dummy each time, culminating in grinding him to [[sawdust]] in a building's [[HVAC|ventilation fans]] in a later episode. In the episode "Trial", Ventriloquist and Scarface act as bailiffs in Batman's trial after the inmates at Arkham Asylum take control of it. When they try to stop Batman from escaping the asylum, Scarface is accidentally decapitated by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s scythe. In the episode "Catwalk", Ventriloquist and Scarface hire [[Catwoman]] to pull off a robbery for them, though it turns out to be a ruse for Scarface to steal some valuable stuffed animals and leave Catwoman to take the fall. Angered, Catwoman destroys Scarface by throwing him onto a conveyor belt and dropping a pile of logs on him, crushing him and burning the remains. She very nearly kills the Ventriloquist as well to ensure Scarface will never return, but Batman stops her at the last moment.
** Ventriloquist and Scarface appear in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. In the episode "Double Talk", Arnold Wesker is deemed sane by Arkham and released into the community. Now free of his domineering other personality, Wesker is supported by Bruce Wayne, who gives him a job at Wayne Enterprises and keeps tabs on his as Batman. After a while, Wesker begins hearing Scarface's voice ordering his "dummy" around again and even to the part where Rhino and Mugsy try to get him back to Scarface's side. In addition, Rhino and Mugsy enlist dwarfish con-man Hips McManus (voiced by [[Billy Barty]]) into posing as a living version of Scarface. Wesker relapses when he finds Scarface planted in his apartment. When prompted by Batman to take control, Wesker toss Scarface into a fan, destroying him and finally setting himself free. 
** In ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', the character makes two [[cameo appearance|cameo]]s. In part two of the episode "A Better World", an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] version of Ventriloquist and Scarface is among the several [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] patients courtesy of the [[Superman]] of the [[Justice Lords]], a Justice League who goes to extreme measures to ensure peace and is not bound by a "no killing" policy (Ventriloquist's forehead is unmarked while Scarface's intriguingly bears the two burn scars indicative of the treatment which apparently had the same psychological effect). In part three of the episode "Starcrossed", another Scarface dummy is in another glass display case in the Batcave.

[[Image:The Big Dummy.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Scarface robot holding Wesker in ''The Batman''.]]
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', where he and Scarface are both voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. In the series, Wesker is a ventriloquist who snapped when he was booed off the stage one night and turned to a life of crime with his first successful act being the robbery of each and every person in the audience who had booed him. Scarface's costume is updated to one reminiscent of that worn by [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In his debut episode "The Big Dummy", Wesker arranges for the theft of various gadgets which are used to construct a giant Scarface robot which holds Wesker in its hand in a reversal of their roles. However, Scarface still needs Wesker to actually move and talk as he is just an oversized "Dummy." In the end, Scarface is destroyed when he is run over by a train. Wesker is then taken to Arkham Asylum. In the episode "Fistful of Felt," Wesker returns with a rebuilt Scarface. It is then revealed that Wesker once had a TV show called ''Cockamanee Junction'' which was cancelled. After Batman prevents them from stealing dollar molds from a treasury, Wesker and Scarface are seen in Arkham during [[Hugo Strange]]'s therapy group with [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] and [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. Strange considers Wesker his main patient and "frees" Wesker from Scarface by simply removing the puppet and prohibiting access to him. Wesker seems to recover and starts to do kids' parties with a puppet named Mr. Snoots until Strange begins the next phase of his plan. He places Scarface in Wesker's apartment, perhaps to see if Wesker is completely cured and able to stand up to Scarface's overbearing demands. Upon seeing the puppet, the voice of Scarface begins to speak from the dummy. In a confrontation with Batman in a newly opened building for children, the Mr. Snoots puppet confronts Scarface. Scarface and Mr. Snoots start fighting and are both once again destroyed by a train. Wesker is then returned to Arkham. In "Rumors," Wesker and Scarface are among the villains captured by Rumor and have been placed in separate cells. Wesker and Scarface both make their final appearance in the series in the season five episode "The End of The Batman", being assisted by [[Wrath (comics)|Wrath and Scorn]].
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist was originally set to appear in the fifth and final season of the ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/gotham-season-5-orphan-scarface-ventriloquist-lady-shiva/&lt;/ref&gt; However, showrunner [[John Stephens (TV producer)|John Stephens]] revealed that the character wouldn't be included as they struggled to fit him into the storyline. Although he won't be appearing properly, [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] related to the character will be featured instead.&lt;ref&gt;https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/10/08/gotham-season-5-villains-not-included-ventriloquist-condiment-king/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist makes a cameo appearance in ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'', as one of the inmates of Arkham Asylum playing bingo.
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist appears in ''[[Scooby-Doo! &amp; Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' as one of the Arkham Asylum inmates during the riot incited by [[Clayface|Crimson Cloak]].
* According to some concept art, the Ventriloquist was originally planned to be featured in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/143240-the-lego-batman-movie-setcmf-rumors-discussion/&amp;page=323#comment-2741909&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
====Lego====
{{main article|Lego Batman}}
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist is featured in the "Villain Hunt" minigame in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]''.
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyo10MF8W_M]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Batman: Arkham''====
* While the Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist is not depicted in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', he is referenced numerous times and Scarface is even afforded a [[cameo appearance]]. During the game's opening sequence, the asylum administrator Quincy Sharp may be heard claiming that Wesker is among those who have been rehabilitated by his institution. Later on, Scarface may be glimpsed on display in Sharp's cluttered office. Shortly afterwards, a [[hallucinating]] Batman, who has been drugged by the Scarecrow, sees an apparently self-sufficient Scarface making an absurd speech welcoming him to madness. Well into the storyline's final stages, the Joker appears using Scarface to entertain himself. He subsequently discards the latter in disgust after a mock dialogue stating that Scarface is going back to the Ventriloquist. Observant players have noted Scarface's trademark Thompson submachine gun can be found mounted on a wall in one of Arkham's many cell blocks. Closer inspection will automatically unlock the Ventriloquist's biography and patient report. He is also one of the villains who is listed on the party list.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', the game's background information has confirmed Peyton Riley's career as the second Ventriloquist, although, unlike her comic book counterpart, she took possession of Scarface while Wesker was still living. Arnold Wesker, meanwhile, is stil at large in Gotham City; listening to Batman's [[police scanner]] will reveal that he has taken a hostage in a shootout with the police. As in ''Arkham City'''s prequel, the Joker has somehow managed to procure the puppet and has forced his henchmen to create numerous copies so he may destroy each one after amusing himself. One particular Scarface was even impounded by the Penguin, and may be seen locked away inside a display case in his headquarters, and will dance if interacted with. The final appearance of a Scarface doll is in the DLC ''Harley Quinn's Revenge''. This Scarface puppet was found in the Steel Mill where a crib has been placed with the doll inside painted the same scheme as the Joker.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', Peyton Riley's Tommy Gun is stored in the evidence room of the Gotham City Police Department. If the display is interacted with, Aaron Cash expresses his confusion about the relationship between Scarface and the Ventriloquist asking if it is actually the puppet's gun rather than Riley's. The status of both Riley and Wesker is unknown. Also, the Scarface puppet used by Joker is also on display.

====Other games====
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist appears as a boss in the ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]'' game. He is seen engaging in a gang war with [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] using weapons that have been covertly supplied to both sides by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to distract Batman during his latest scheme.
* The Arnold Wesker incarnation of Ventriloquist appears in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by [[Larry Brisbowitz]]. This version of the character uses a sock puppet named Socko (also voiced by Larry Brisbowitz) instead of the traditional Scarface, just like he did in the ''Knightfall'' storyline. In episode 4 "Guardian of Gotham", Wesker is one of the inmates of [[Arkham Asylum]] and the imprisoned Bruce has the opportunity to ask him about "John Doe".

The now mostly defunct franchise's fall is attributed to the rise of online piracy and the local introduction of streaming services such as [[Netflix]], [[Stan (company)|Stan]] and [[Amazon Prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/technology-killed-the-video-store-20150506-1mrikr.html | title=Technology killed the video store | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=19 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Video Ezy commenced trading in 1983, when Kevin Slater opened his first store in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Hurstville, New South Wales|Hurstville]] renting out a small selection of [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] format movies. The first franchised store opened in September 1984 at [[Miranda, New South Wales|Miranda]]. The franchisees at Miranda were Peter McLaughlin and Bill Coe. Other stores to open in quick succession were in the Sydney suburbs of [[Bankstown]], [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. In the majority of these stores, Kevin funded 50% of the [[capital (economics)|capital]] required to open. By 1986, Video Ezy comprised 18 stores, and by August 1987, there were 34 stores located across [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videolibraries.com.au/video-libraries-articles/1987/8/19/corner-stores-being-pushed-out-by-video-supermarkets/|title=Corner Stores Being Pushed Out By Video Supermarkets|first=Lea|last=Wright|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 August 1987|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion followed throughout other Australian states before opening its first international location in [[Auckland]], New Zealand in 1988, with the Master Licence commencing in 1991 under Video Ezy International. In March 1999, Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd expanded into the [[Asia]]n market with its first outlet opening in [[Bangkok]], Thailand.&lt;ref name="Video Ezy Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videoezy.com.au/info/About/|title=Video Ezy: About Us|publisher=Video Ezy Online|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Superbrands"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superbrands.com.au/index.php/volumes/volume-4/81-volumes/volume-4/217-videoezy-vol4| title=Superbrands: Video Ezy Australia | publisher=Superbrands.com | accessdate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000, Video Ezy introduced EzyRetail, a video store specific [[point of sale]] [[Windows]]-based system exclusively used by Video Ezy. The software was first developed by Radek Soucek and Robert Gongorra and allowed information to be centrally created and pushed down the line to stores, both as real-time and locally stored data. It provided comprehensive reporting capabilities, inventory management and collection abilities, giving the store network one of the most comprehensive databases in retail history. This new system replaced VideoMinder, a then [[DOS]]-based system once used by [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] and some older Video Ezy franchisees.&lt;ref name="Superbrands"/&gt;

In 2001, the first Video Ezy outlet opened in Singapore within the Jelita Shopping Centre. Since then, the Singapore network has comprised a mixture of corporate-owned and franchised stores located in either outdoor shopping strips like, [[Holland Village, Singapore|Holland Village]],  residential towers such as, [[International Plaza (Singapore)|International Plaza]], or large shopping centres such as, [[VivoCity]]. Unlike Australia, Video Ezy Singapore can operate in most shopping centres due to 7-day-week late night shopping hours and its population less reliant on private automobiles needing to park outside stores.&lt;ref name="Video Ezy Singapore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videoezy.com.sg/locations.aspx|title=Video Ezy: Singapore Store Locations|publisher=Video Ezy Online|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videoezy.com.sg/aboutus.aspx | title=Video Ezy (Singapore): About Us | publisher=Video Ezy Online | accessdate=17 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Video Ezy sold its corporate-owned stores in Australia leaving only 2 stores&amp;ndash;[[Narellan, New South Wales|Narellan]] and [[Rosehill, New South Wales|Rosehill]], some 10 minutes from its new Head Office at [[Rhodes, New South Wales|Rhodes]]&amp;ndash;although in 2006 it had acquired additional corporate-owned stores. In 2003, Video Ezy also went on to market a subscription model with DVD Unlimited (not associated with the New Zealand company with the same name). Also in that year, Video Ezy commenced selling and renting 'Ezy Exclusive' TV series and movies on DVD such as, ''[[Dinotopia (TV miniseries)|Dinotopia]]'', ''[[Kingpin (TV series)|Kingpin]]'', ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', ''[[Taken (TV miniseries)|Taken]]'', ''[[The Believer (film)|The Believer]]'' and other exclusive titles from [[Hallmark Entertainment]] and [[NBC]]. These titles were usually branded with Video Ezy's logo and carried slightly different artwork to DVDs sold outside the [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] market ('Ezy Exclusives' were phased out in 2006).&lt;ref name="Video Ezy Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superbrands"/&gt;

In August 2005, business partners, Paul Uniacke and Edward Nedelko - who between them owned 24 Video Ezy franchises in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] - purchased the shares held in Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd by Perpetual Trustees and Ivany Investments to become majority shareholders in the company. They replaced Robert Maidment as Executive Chairman. At that stage Video Ezy-branded outlets numbered, 560 in Australia, 156 in New Zealand, 128 in Thailand, 135 in Indonesia, 19 in Singapore, 9 in Malaysia, 1 in [[Fiji]] and 1 in the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.franchisebusiness.com.au/c/Brumby-s-Bakery-338002/Will-they-still-call-Australia-home-n854616| title=Will they still call Australia home?

In February 2007, [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]], seeking to rationalise its international operations and concentrate on its home [[United States]] market, sold its entire Australian store network to Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd. At the time, Blockbuster Australia comprised 370 outlets nationwide - 29 owned by the company and 341 owned by franchisees. Video Ezy had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group's [[market share]] to 40% of the country's video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the master franchise agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that. As a consequence of the deal, the company changed its name from Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd to Franchise Entertainment Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/seeking-nerdvana/9862-video-ezy-to-acquire-blockbuster-as-rental-stores-prepare-for-video-download-onslaught|title=Video Ezy to acquire Blockbuster as rental stores prepare for video download onslaught|first=Adam|last=Turner|work=iWire|date=23 February 2007|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/strategy/video-ezy-takeover-of-blockbuster-gets-green-light.html| title=Video Ezy takeover of Blockbuster gets green light (19 September 2007) | publisher=Smart Company | accessdate=27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/video-ezy-fast-forwards-with-blockbuster-buy/2007/02/23/1171734021454.html|title=Video Ezy fast forwards with Blockbuster buy|first=AAP|last=Breaking News|work=[[The Age]]|date=24 February 2007|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Franchise Entertainment Group bought failed video retail (non-rental) chain, [[EzyDVD]] from receivers, [[Ferrier Hodgson]], for an estimated $10 million. The transaction included, the EzyDVD brand and online business, the 25-store franchise network, in addition to stock, plant, equipment and the remaining 11 company-owned stores. FEG CEO Paul Uniacke said to the media after the deal, "We don't have video rental stores in high-traffic areas such as the major malls because you can't rent a DVD and the next day just easily park your car and return to it. The EzyDVD stores are in all the major mall chains and this cements us well and truly in this market." Soon after, EzyDVD's head office, warehouse and distribution facility in [[Torrensville, South Australia|Torrensville]] closed, and currently (as of October 2012), only 3 branded stores remain in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Browns Plains, Queensland|Browns Plains]] and [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]]. Most of its sales are now generated from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/retail/ezydvd-bought-from-receivers-by-franchise-entertainment-group.html|title=EzyDVD bought from receivers by Franchise Entertainment Group|first=James|last=Thomson|work=Smart Company|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/rival-buys-troubled-ezydvd-for-10m/story-e6frfkp9-1111118642717|title=Franchise Entertainment Group buys troubled EzyDVD for $10m|first=Anthony|last=Klan|work=News.com.au|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Paul Uniacke and Edward Nedelko's other company, Surrealus, bought the failed entertainment group, [[Stomp Entertainment]] (which included the Australian operations of Play4Me and [[CD WOW!]]) for an undisclosed sum. By October that year, Surrealus had reorganised Stomp and given it a new name - [[Elan Media Partners|Élan Media Partners]]. Uniacke and Nedelko also arranged for the transfer of the [http://www.videoezy.com.au Video Ezy Australia], [http://www.blockbuster.com.au Blockbuster Australia] and [http://www.ezydvd.com.au EzyDVD] online businesses from FEG to Élan Media Partners, leaving FEG to manage the franchise relationships with individual Video Ezy/Blockbuster outlets and the three remaining EzyDVD-branded stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-news/industry/2010/08/20/stomp-sold-to-video-ezy-blockbuster-ezydvd/|title=Stomp Sold To Video Ezy, Blockbuster, EzyDVD|date=20 August 2010|work=The Music Network|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-features/industry/2010/09/09/the-aftershock-whats-next-for-shock-and-stomp/|title=The Aftershock: What's next for Shock and Stomp|first=Lars|last=Brandle|work=The Music Network|date=9 September 2010|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elanmediapartners.com/media/584/elan_release_6_oct_2010.pdf|title=Media Release: New Name, New Business Opportunities As Stomp Becomes Élan Media Partners|date=6 October 2010|work=Élan Media Partners|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, a new [[loyalty card]] branded as Flash Rewards was introduced by Video Ezy (superseding DVD Unlimited), offering customers who sign-up and pay a fee, discounts and extended services in all participating Video Ezy stores. This allows customers to upgrade their basic rental membership, with Paul Uniacke adding, "when someone joins Flash Rewards, they can then rent from any participating Video Ezy store and access their Flash benefits without the need to sign up with each store every time." In addition, Flash Rewards offered discounts from partner companies such as, [[Donut King]], [[Eagle Boys Pizza]], [[AMF Bowling Australia|AMF Bowling]], [[Anytime Fitness]], [[ACP Magazines]], and 25% off cinema ticket prices at, [[Village Cinemas]], [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle]], [[Hoyts]], [[Reading Cinemas]], [[Wallis Cinemas]], Dendy, and [[Palace Films and Cinemas|Palace Cinemas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.net.au/inspire/franchisee/movie-downloads-no-threat-as-video-ezy-launches-ne|title=Movie downloads no threat as Video Ezy launches new rewards program|first=Danielle|last=Bowling|work=Franchising|date=1 June 2011|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.retailbiz.com.au/2011/05/26/article/Video-Ezy-launches-flashy-loyalty-program/PVFNITLYCS.html| title=Video Ezy launches flashy loyalty program (26 May 2011)| publisher=RetailBiz.com.au | accessdate=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideretailing.com.au/IR/IRNews/Flashy-new-rewards-program-981.aspx|title=Flashy new rewards program|first=Inside|last=Retailing|work=Inside Retailing|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deals involving outside partner companies ended in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flashrewards.com.au/| title=Flash Rewards| publisher=Video Ezy Online | accessdate=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a select group of Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises incorporated [[Metcash]]'s Lucky 7 convenience stores stocking more than 500 different products including, newspapers, bread, milk and various snacks. If deemed successful, Lucky 7 could roll out nationally across Video Ezy and Blockbuster's 650 store network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.franchise.net.au/inspire/franchisee/video-ezy-and-blockbuster-trialling-convenience-st| title=Video Ezy and Blockbuster trialling convenience store offering (6 June 2011)| publisher=Franchising | accessdate=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.net.au/inspire/franchisee/franchisees-in-control-of-lucky-7-expansion|title=Franchisees in control of Lucky 7 expansion|first=Danielle|last=Bowling|work=Franchising|date=8 June 2011|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.retailbiz.com.au/2011/06/07/article/Lucky-7s-trial-in-video-stores/NTETKDBSZP.html| title=Lucky 7's trial in video stores (7 June 2011)| publisher=RetailBiz.com.au | accessdate=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, it was announced that former chief executive of Video Ezy and their largest franchisee, Daryl McCormack, would partner his 15 stores with Franchised Food Company's [[Cold Rock Ice Creamery]] to open smaller, Express oulets within stores becoming dual franchises. The first Video Ezy/Cold Rock Express outlet reopened in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], Melbourne, to dollar-for-dollar sales with the core business of video rental and retail. This concept has also extended to McCormack's co-owned chain, Souvlaki Hut (now Souv Hut), with point-of-sale systems being updated to combine sales from both video and ice cream, or souvlaki meals and ice cream. Like the Lucky 7 deal before it, Franchised Food Company is offering Cold Rock Express outlets to other Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchisees wishing to diversify their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.franchise.net.au/news/cold-rock-launches-new-express-model| title=Cold Rock launches new Express model (7 November 2011)| publisher=Franchising | accessdate=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/Page/Uuid/6da5742c-f9ed-11e0-a5a3-48efda096a5a|title=Mix and match sales|first=Jessica|last=Gardner|work=[[BRW (magazine)|BRW]]|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/iceman-plans-to-pair-licks-and-flicks/story-fn6ck2gb-1226353297283|title=Iceman plans to pair licks and flicks|first=Sophie|last=Foster|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Video Ezy found itself embroiled in a [[social media]] backlash when it refused to end its long-term sponsorship with [[Southern Cross Austereo]]'s networked radio program, ''[[Take40 Australia]]'', after its co-host, [[Kyle Sandilands]] made sexist comments about a [[News Limited]] journalist on his [[2Day FM]] breakfast program, ''[[The Kyle and Jackie O Show]]''. Even though the comments were made on another program and Video Ezy having the added complication of being a [[naming rights]] sponsor of Take40 Australia, complaints piled up on its [[Facebook]] page to such an extent that after a month the brand was forced to pull advertising from the show temporarily during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/internet/20111129-smes-warned-of-potential-for-social-media-backlash-after-customers-attack-video-ezy-on-facebook.html|title=SMEs warned of potential for social media backlash after customers attack Video Ezy on Facebook|first=Patrick|last=Stafford|work=Smart Company|date=29 November 2011|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.franchise.net.au/news/video-ezy-in-online-storm-over-ad-support-for-sand| title=Video Ezy in online storm over ad support for Sandilands' radio show (28 November 2011)| publisher=Franchising | accessdate=28 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandilands was removed as co-host of Take40 Australia during this period, and Video Ezy continues to sponsor the program.

In December 2011, Franchise Entertainment Group switched on its first Video Ezy Express DVD and Blu-ray rental kiosk after announcing their roll-out in May that year. FEG bought 1,000 DVD kiosks through US company, [[NCR Corporation]] for $2 million with Uniacke adding, "we're looking to get to 3,000 within three years. I'm looking to own the market within a two-year period." Video Ezy Express kiosks can be leased from FEG by local Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchisees and located in high foot-traffic areas like shopping centres and supermarkets. For consumers, prices to rent are much lower, and no membership cards are required with the initial rental fee and extended fees being charged direct to the consumers credit card. Video Ezy/Blockbuster Express currently competes in Australia and New Zealand with the 300+ [[Hoyts Kiosk]] network. They also competed with approximately 100 RedRoom kiosks for the first month until FEG acquired the entire seven-year-old business, taking out a significant competitor while adding capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/video-stores-to-roll-out-rental-kiosks-in-fight-for-dvd-dollars/story-e6frg8zx-1226061473875|title=Video stores to roll out rental kiosks in fight for DVD dollars|first=Lara|last=Sinclair|work=[[The Australian]]|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/franchising/redroomdvd-sale-heralds-a-move-to-kiosks-20111216-1oy1z.html|title=RedRoomDVD sale heralds a move to kiosks|first=Clare|last=Kermond|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videoezy.com.au/express| title=Video Ezy Express (Australia)| publisher=Video Ezy Online | accessdate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videoezyexpress.co.nz/| title=Video Ezy Express (New Zealand)| publisher=Video Ezy Online | accessdate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In 1993, the ''Get it first time, or get it free'' was launched. Video Ezy re-launched their guarantee under the "Movie Guarantee" umbrella in April 2007. This includes Rental Guarantee, Price Guarantee and an Ex-Rental Guarantee.

Video Ezy utilises rent-only releases with the "Rent It - The Only Way To Get It" campaign. Another advertising campaign used by Video Ezy is "Upsize Your Entertainment" - when a consumer rents a specific title they have the opportunity to upsize by buying a specified similar title for only $4.95&amp;ndash;in April 2007, Video Ezy had Charlotte's Web as the rental title &amp; Paulie as the upsize title.

[[File:D003793-R1-12-13A.jpg|330px|thumb|right|Network Video Sandringham a former Video Ezy store in Victoria that has been rebranded.]]

Slogans include:
* "In the Mood" (1990s)
* "Relax" (1998-2000)
* "Ezy does it" - (October 2003&amp;ndash;present)
* "There is More to See (2000-2003)
* "The choice is Ezy" (2000s)
* "Get it first time, or get it free" - Defunct, being re-released in April 2007.
* "We have so many copies of our Rental Guarantee title, we guarantee you'll rent it now, or rent it free" - Video Ezy Rental Guarantee as of April 2007.
* "Love Movies" - (2009&amp;ndash;present).
* "More to Love" - Current Australia slogan expanded from "Love Movies" to be more inclusive of other products in store.
* "Rent it. Buy it." - Current Singapore slogan.

In 2000, Video Ezy launched its Fight Back campaign, using slogans such as "Sick of low interest rates?  - bank on cheap entertainment with Video Ezy. Due to the franchise nature of Video Ezy stores, each store runs their own promotions and set their own pricing.

== Industrial relations ==
The company established a training facility in 2006 to develop staff expertise. They had previously worked with a company called ''Rascals'' which promoted the use of [[Australian Workplace Agreement]]s.

== Competition and threats ==
[[File:Video Ezy Express Jam Factory.jpg|thumb|left|A Video Ezy Express rental kiosk located within [[The Jam Factory]] on [[Chapel Street, Melbourne]].]]

In its home market of Australia, Video Ezy's individual franchises compete with other rental chains such as, [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]], [[Civic Video]], Network Video, Video City, Movies 4U (also known as, Top Video, or [[Leading Edge Group|Leading Edge Video]]) and many independently-branded stores throughout the country. Franchises also compete with rental-by-mail and [[streaming media|instant streaming]] service, [[Quickflix]]. Video Ezy dominates the New South Wales market, however, in other Australian states like [[Queensland]], it has a similar number of stores to rival, Civic Video, and in [[Tasmania]], its chain of Video City oulets are more numerous and larger in floor space. Since February 2007, Video Ezy's parent company, Franchise Entertainment Group, no longer competes with Blockbuster having acquired it, yet all individual franchises still do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.networkvideo.com.au/?mode=locator| title=Network Video: Store Locator| publisher=Network Video Online | accessdate=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://videocity.com.au/| title=Video City home| publisher=Video City Online | accessdate=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of video and gaming retail, Video Ezy also competes with many of the brands mentioned above, but primarily Australia's DVD, Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and gaming disc market share is taken up by [[Kmart Australia|Kmart]], [[Target Australia|Target]], [[Big W]], [[Sanity Entertainment|Sanity]], [[JB Hi-Fi]], [[EB Games Australia|EB Games]], and [[Amazon.com]]. However, recent years have seen huge movements towards legal and illegal online entertainment in the form of legal services such as [[iTunes]] or illegal [[BitTorrent]] downloads that continue to challenge Video Ezy's established [[business model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/technology-news/has-downloading-killed-the-video-star-20120622-20t0n.html|title=Has downloading killed the video star?|first=Dan|last=Nancarrow|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises closing 270 stores across Australia in the four years to August 2011, and Video Ezy's Indonesian franchises shutting 60 outlets in the two years to January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/online-demand-killing-video-rental-stores/story-e6frg13u-1226118789866|title=Online demand killing video rental stores|first=Liam|last=Croy|work=[[PerthNow]]|date=20 August 2011|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/12/video-rental-stores-survive-digital-era.html|title=Video rental stores survive in digital era|date=12 January 2013|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some Australian regional centres such as [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and [[Berri, South Australia|Berri]] have recently lost their only full scale video libraries when Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises have closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/1309046/death-of-the-disc-video-ezy-to-close-their-doors/?cs=1212|title=Death of the disc: Video Ezy to close their doors|first=Len|last=Ashworth|work=Lithgow Mercury|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverlandweekly.com.au/blog/2013/01/16/dvd-hire-to-shut-its-doors/|title=DVD hire to shut its doors|date=16 January 2013|work=Riverland Weekly|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Franchise Entertainment Group's CEO, Paul Uniacke told ''[[Sunshine Coast Daily]]'' in response to a local [[Maroochydore]] outlet closing that, "I'm not happy that Maroochydore has gone. It's not something we like to see, absolutely there is a human cost to what's happening here." He went on to add, "the worst thing that happens in a [[rationalization (economics)|rationalisation]] is losing stores and losing good people. We've been up on the Coast with Blockbuster for a number of years and with Video Ezy for about 20 years." Uniacke said that Video Ezy/Blockbuster was not alone in facing Australian post-[[Global Financial Crisis]] retail conditions, leaving Video Ezy Express rental kiosks to fill the void left by closed stores. He said, "but mark my words, you will see us back in a short space of time. We don't want to leave that territory without the brand too long, we want to stay strong." Adding, "and they are lined up out the door to run kiosks in there, so you will see Blockbuster, or maybe Video Ezy kiosks flowing through there." But in the same interview he admitted, "absolutely we will have less stores, but I don't want to do away with them because they form a valuable part of the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/a-blockbuster-battle-kiosks-cut-rents-and-wages/1796121/|title=DVD kiosks set to replace stores as market changes|first=Nev|last=Madsen|work=[[Sunshine Coast Daily]]|date=22 March 2013|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, responding to Blockbuster US announcing they will shut all their domestic stores, ''SmartCompany'' compared [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] figures from financial year 1999&amp;ndash;2000 stating there were 1166 individual video hire businesses operating within Australia; compared to a 2013 [[IBISWorld]] study finding just 255 DVD rental businesses still operating in the country (a drop of almost 80%). The same study found the overall industry has declined at an annual rate of 14.8% over the five years to 2013. In addition to the obvious competition and threats to rental businesses, it also blamed recent developments from [[Pay TV]] and [[free-to-air]] television, both radically increasing their channel selections. Another impact stems from the reduced cost of DVD and Blu-ray discs, seeing the average 2013 price of a DVD settle at $16, compared to $20 in the early-2000s. This has acted as a double-edged sword for the industry, boosting the numbers of DVD sales, but also turning renters into buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/marketing/sales/34486-the-end-of-the-video-store-blockbuster-to-close-300-us-stores.html|title=The end of the video store: Blockbuster to close 300 US stores|first=Yolanda|last=Redrup|work=SmartCompany|date=8 November 2013|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wild Westing''' was the term used by Native Americans for their performing with [[Wild West Shows|Buffalo Bill's Wild West]] and similar shows. Between 1887 and World War I, over 1,000 Native Americans went "Wild Westing."&lt;ref&gt;See,  E.H. Gohl, (Tyagohwens), "The Effect of Wild Westing", ''The Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians'', Washington, D.C., Volume 2, 1914, p.226-228. Heppler, [http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/ “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians”]. Other major shows included Pawnee Bill, Cummins Wild West, Miller's 101 Ranch and Sells-Floto Circus.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most were [[Oglala Lakota]] (''Oskate Wicasa'') from their reservation in [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]], the first Lakota people to perform in these shows.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Delaney, [http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/Buffalo-Bill%E2%80%99s-Wild-West-Warriors-Photographs-by-Gertrude-K%C3%A4sebier-4679 “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude Kasebier, Smithsonian National Museum of American History”], (hereinafter "Delaney") (2007), p.21. "Wild West Shows and Images", p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  During a time when the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] was intent on promoting Native assimilation, Col. William Frederick Cody ("[[Buffalo Bill]]") used his influence with U.S. government officials to secure Native American performers for his Wild West. Col. Cody treated Native American employees as equals with white cowboys.

Wild Westers received good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food, and gifts of cash and clothing at the end of each season. Wild Westing was very popular with the Lakota people and benefited their families and communities. Wild Westing offered opportunity and hope during time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. Americans and Europeans continue to have a great interest in Native peoples and enjoy modern [[Pow-wow]] culture, traditional Native Americans skills; horse culture, ceremonial dancing and cooking; and buying Native American art, music and crafts. First begun in Wild West shows, Pow-wow culture is popular with Native Americans throughout the United States and a source of tribal enterprise. Wild Westers still perform in movies, pow-wows, pageants and rodeos. Some Oglala Lakota people carry on family show business traditions from ancestors who first worked for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows.

== Vanishing race ==

During the [[Progressive Era]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was an explosion of public interest in Native American culture and imagery. Newspapers, dime-store novels, Wild West shows, and public exhibitions portrayed Native Americans as a "vanishing race." Their numbers had decreased since the [[Indian Wars]], and survivors were struggling with poverty and constraints on [[Indian reservations]]. American and European anthropologists, who represented a new field, historians, linguists, journalists, photographers, portraitists and early movie-makers believed they had to study western Native American peoples. Many researchers and artists lived on government reservations for extended periods to study Native Americans before they "vanished." Their inspired effort heralded the "Golden Age of the Wild West."  Photographers included [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Frank A. Rinehart]], [[Edward Curtis]], [[Jo Mora]] and John Nicholas Choate, while portraitists included [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[Charles M. Russell]] and [[John Hauser]].

== Progressive Era fight for the image ==
[[File:Buffalo bill wild west show c1899.jpg|450px|thumb|left|In 1893, over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's Wild West perform during the [[Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois.]]
During the Progressive Era, U.S. government policy focused upon acquiring Indian lands, restricting cultural and religious practices and sending Native American children to boarding schools. Progressives agreed that the situation was serious and that something needed to be done to educate and acculturate Native Americans to white society, but they differed as to education models and speed of assimilation. Reformist progressives, a coalition led by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the [[Society of American Indians]] and Christian organizations, promoted rapid assimilation of children through off-reservation Indian boarding schools and immersion in white culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jason A. Heppler, "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians", 2011. Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians is a collaborative project of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of History with the assistance from the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of American Indians was opposed to Wild West shows, theatrical troupes, circuses and most motion picture firms. The Society believed that theatrical shows were demoralizing and degrading to Indians, and discouraged Indians from "Wild Westing." &lt;ref&gt;See,  E.H. Gohl, (Tyagohwens), "The Effect of Wild Westing", ''The Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians'', Washington, D.C., Volume 2, 1914, p.226-228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chauncey Yellow Robe]] wrote that "Indians should be protected from the curse of the Wild West show schemes, wherein the Indians have been led to the white man's poison cup and have become drunkards."  &lt;ref&gt;Chauncey Yellow Robe, ''"The Menace of the Wild West Show"'', ''The Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians'', Washington, D.C., Volume 2,  p.224-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformist progressives believed Wild West shows exploited Native Americans and vigorously opposed theatrical portrayals of Native Americans as savages and vulgar stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;"It was one thing to portray docile natives who had not progressed much since the late fifteenth century, but quite another matter to portray some of them as armed and dangerous." L.G. Moses, "Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933, (hereinafter "Wild West Shows and Images") (1996), p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1886 to the onset of World War I, reformist progressives fought a war of images with Wild West shows before public exhibitions at world fairs, expositions and parades portraying the model [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] as a new generation of Native Americans embracing civilization, education and industry.&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner John H. Oberly explained in 1889: "The effect of traveling all over the country among, and associated with, the class of people usually accompanying shows, circuses and exhibitions, attended by all the immoral and unchristianizing surroundings incident to such a life, is not only most demoralizing to the present and future welfare of the Indian, but it creates a roaming and unsettled disposition and educates him in a manner entirely foreign and antagonistic to that which has been and now is the policy of the Government.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public interest in Native American culture and imagery ==
Wild West shows were exceptionally popular in the United States and Europe. Here, the American and European public could see and hear some of the first Americans, not as curiosities, but a people with vibrant culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild West Shows and Images", p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's Wild West perform during the [[Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;"Wild West Shows and Images", pp.137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; "Buffalo Bill" Cody launched his Wild West traveling show in 1883, and was so successful there were fifty copies in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Alida S. Boorn, "Oskate Wicasa (One Who Performs)" (hereinafter "Oskate Wicasa"), Central Missouri State University, (2005), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo Bill toured the United States and Europe until his death in 1917. Wild West shows were "[[dime novel]]s come alive." Millions of Americans and Europeans enjoyed the imagery and adventure of historic reenactments of the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]; demonstrations of Lakota horse culture and equestrian skills; archery, ceremonial dancing, cooking and music. Visitors could stroll through model Indian tipi "villages" and meet performers; available for purchase were crafts from women artisans, and autographed postcards, photographs and memorabilia from famous Wild Westers.&lt;ref&gt;Chief [[Geronimo]] was an entrepreneur, cutting off his suit buttons as he walked the fairgrounds and selling them as celebrity souvenirs. He also made souvenir bows, arrows and canes; and signed photographs for twenty-five cents. Parezo, Nancy J. and Fowler, Don D, "The 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition: Anthropology Goes to the Fair", (2007), p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1887 and World War I, over 1,000 Native Americans went "Wild Westing" with Buffalo Bill's Wild West.&lt;ref&gt;Heppler, "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians". Other major shows included Pawnee Bill, Cummins Wild West, Miller's 101 Ranch and Sells-Floto Circus.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Wild Westers were [[Oglala Lakota]] from [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]], the first Lakota people to go Wild Westing.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Delaney, "Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude Kasebier, Smithsonian National Museum of American History", (hereinafter "Delaney") (2007), p.21. "Wild West Shows and Images", p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a time when the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] was intent on promoting Native assimilation, Col. Cody used his influence with U.S. government officials to secure Native American performers for his Wild West. Buffalo Bill treated Native American employees as equals with white cowboys. Wild Westers received good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food, and gifts of cash and clothing from Buffalo Bill at the end of each season. Wild Westers were employed as performers, interpreters and recruiters. Men had money in their pockets and for their families on the reservation. Female performers were paid extra for infants and children, and supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Calls the Name and other women supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts. Women served important community roles in camps backstage. Augmenting their show wages was common among Show Indians, especially "'bead work' made into moccasins, purses, etc.," which earned them "very large prices," according to Nate Salsbury. Cody and Salsbury often purchased goods at wholesale prices and sold the goods to Indians at cost, allowing them to create souvenirs for tourists. Show Indians created and sold goods to museums, collectors, and customers across Europe and the United States. Heppler, "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians". Performers' newborn babies became part of the villages set up outside show areas. Oskate Wicasa, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cliff House 1902.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Wild Westers with Buffalo Bill's Wild West, [[Cliff House, San Francisco]], 1902. Wild Westing offered adventure and personal time, and performers traveled to the great cities of the world. ]]
Sobriety and good conduct was required. Performers agreed to refrain from all drinking, gambling and fighting, and to return to his or her reservation at the end of each seasonal tour. Shows hired venerable elder male Indians to appear in the parades to ensure that young men acted with appropriate behavior when visiting host communities, and rules were self-policed by traditional Oglala Lakota chiefs and former U.S. Army Indian Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.6, 54. The number of police chosen depended on the number of Indians traveling with the show each season, a usual number being one policeman for every dozen Indians. Indian policemen, selected from the ranks of the performers, were given badges and paid $10 more in wages per month. in 1898, Chief Iron Tail managed the Indian Police. Delaney, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most performers spent one or two seasons on the road; some Wild Westers became cowboys, stuntmen for films, artisans, musicians, educators, authors, movie actors and entrepreneurs. Chief [[Flying Hawk]] was a veteran of Wild West shows over 30 years, from about 1898 to 1930.

Wild Westing was very popular with the Lakota people and beneficial to their families and communities. It offered a path of opportunity during a time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race, whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. It offered a safe haven for Lakota leadership after the Sioux Wars and for famous Native American prisoners of war. The touring also offered freedom six months each year from the degrading confines of government reservations. Wild Westing was an act of passive resistance to oppressive Bureau of Indian Affairs policies.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wild Westing was a means for the Lakota to preserve their culture and religion. Shows generally toured from late spring to late autumn, paralleling the traditional buffalo hunt season.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In performance, the Lakota performed dances banned at the time on reservations. Lakota dancers in the present day credit Cody and the Wild Westers for preserving dances that were otherwise suppressed. The Lakota easily adapted to historical reenactments of the traditional practice of continually reenacting their history in dance and rituals. By this means, the exploits of the warriors were indelibly inscribed upon the collective consciousness of the ''oyate'', or nation. Wild Westers at times performed programs that dramatized the very battles, raids and massacres in which the men had participated as warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wild Westing allowed individuals to draw their own conclusions and make decisions about their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; It improved self-esteem and provided pleasure from performing for appreciative audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It offered adventure;  performers traveled to the great cities of the world and freely associated with new cultures. Inter-marriage was not uncommon and many performers settled in Europe, some traveling with other shows and circuses. Between daily performances, Wild Westers played games such as ping pong and dominoes, which they had adopted during European tours.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traveling and performing was hard work, and rest and relaxation was important. Performers were permitted to freely travel by automobile or by train, for shopping, sightseeing, visiting friends, attending parties and gala events.&lt;ref&gt;However, travel was occasionally hazardous and there were accidents and misadventures. Oskate Wicasa, p.6. Was injured the next year in a train accident and almost died. Luther Standing Bear was severely injured in a train accident and almost died. Luther Standing Bear, "My People the Sioux", (1928), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wild westers educated the American and European public about Native American history and culture. The Wild Wester community was a diverse group, including U.S. Army Indian Scouts from the Great Sioux War; famous prisoners of war such as Lakota Chief [[Sitting Bull]], [[Ghost dancers|Ghost Dancers]] [[Kicking Bear]] and [[Arnold Short Bull|Short Bull]]; Apache Chief [[Geronimo]]; [[Carlisle Indian School]] students [[Luther Standing Bear]] and Frank C. Goings; and Chiefs Iron Tail and [[Red Shirt (Oglala)|Red Shirt]], who became international celebrities. Chief Iron Tail was the most famous Native American of his day; a popular subject for professional photographers, he had his image circulated across the continents.&lt;ref&gt;Chief Iron Tail was an international personality and appeared as the lead with Buffalo Bill at the Champs- Élysées in Paris, France, and the Colosseum in Rome, Italy. In France, as in England, Buffalo Bill and Iron Tail were feted by the aristocracy. Early in the twentieth century, Iron Tail's distinctive profile became well known across the United States as one of three models for the five-cent coin Buffalo nickel or Indian Head nickel. The popular coin was introduced in 1913 and showcases the native beauty of the American West.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Red Shirt was popular with journalists and newspapers and was the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; Early dime novels, Wild West shows and Golden Age photographers, portraitists and movie-makers created the theatrical image and portrayal of the Lakota people as the iconic American Indian mounted warrior. This popular perception in the United States and Europe was created by Lakota performers in their historic reenactments of the Sioux Wars; demonstrations of Lakota horse culture and equestrian skills; and ceremonial dancing, cooking and music.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Moses, "Indians on the Midway: Wild West Shows and the Indian Bureau at World's Fairs, 1893-1904", (hereinafter "Indians on the Midway"), South Dakota State Historical Society, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], was the flagship Indian boarding school in the United States from 1879 through 1918. Carlisle was the first Indian boarding school located far from the reservation, in an Eastern environment free of the West's anti-Indian prejudices and free from the influences of native cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Linda F. Witmer, "The Indian Industrial School: Carlisle, Pennsylvania 1879-1918, Cumberland County Historical Society (2002), cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlisle set the bar for 26 Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding schools in 15 states and territories and hundreds of private boarding schools sponsored by religious denominations. Over 10,000 Native American children from 140 tribes attended Carlisle. Tribes with the largest number of students included the [[Sioux]], [[Chippewa]], [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]], [[Apache]], [[Cheyenne]] and [[Alaskan]].&lt;ref&gt;The total number of students is listed as 10,595, with 1,842 list of names and nation unknown.  Carlisle Indian School Tribal Enrollment Tally (1879-1918). http://home.epix.net/~landis/tally.html&lt;/ref&gt; Carlisle offered a path of opportunity and hope at a time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Utlely, ed. "Battlefield &amp; Classroom: An Autobiography by Richard Henry Pratt", (hereinafter "Utely") (1964), p. xi-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlisle was founded on principle that Native Americans are the equals of whites and that Native American children immersed in white culture would learn skills to advance in society.  Carlisle evolved beyond an industrial trade school. Nearby historic [[Dickinson College]] provided Carlisle Indian School students with visiting professors, access to the Dickinson Preparatory School ("Conway Hall") and college level education. The [[Dickinson School of Law]] was another resource to the Carlisle Indian School and a number of Carlisle students attended. Students excelled at music, debating, journalism and sports, and were offered internships and a summer outing program living with white families and earning wages. The Carlisle Indian Band, Carlisle Cadets and [[Carlisle Indians football]] team earned national reputations. The Carlisle Indian Band performed at world fairs, expositions, parades and every national presidential inaugural celebration until the school closed. The Carlisle Cadets at arms marched in parades.  The Carlisle Indians were a national football powerhouse in the early 20th century and competed and won games against Harvard, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, Princeton, Brown, and Army and Navy. During the program's 25 years, the Carlisle Indians compiled a 167–88–13 record and 0.647 winning percentage, the most successful defunct major college football program.  In 1911, the Indians posted an 11–1 record, which included one of the greatest upsets in college football history. Legendary athlete [[Jim Thorpe]] and coach [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] led the Carlisle Indians to an 18–15 upset of Harvard before 25,000 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Thorpe scored all the points for Carlisle, a touchdown, extra point and four field goals.&lt;ref&gt;See Carlisle Indian School Yearly Results, http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/discontinued/c/carlisle/yearly_results.php?year=1910&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|400px|thumbnail|left|Carlisle was a unique school and produced a new generation of Native American leadership in the United States.]]

Attending Carlisle is considered by some Native Americans like going to Yale, Princeton or Cambridge, and the family tradition of Carlisle alumni as "Harvard style" is one of pride and stories of opportunity and success.&lt;ref&gt;Witmer, p.xvi. Carlisle had developed something of a rivalry with Harvard, and though the Indians had never beaten the Crimson, they always gave them a game. The Indians both admired and resented the Crimson, in equal amounts. They loved to sarcastically mimic the Harvard accent; even players who could barely speak English would drawl the broad Harvard a. But Harvard was also the Indians' idea of collegiate perfection, and they labeled any excellent performance, whether on the field or in the classroom, as "Harvard style." Sally Jenkins, "The Real All Americans", (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Carlisle was a unique school and produced a new generation of Native American leadership in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Benjey, "Doctors, Lawyers, Indian Chiefs", (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

State of Nebraska'' in New York City, and began a new journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England with Buffalo Bill to perform at the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]].]] [[File:Luther Standing Bear.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left| [[Luther Standing Bear]] was taught to be brave and unafraid to die; he left the reservation to attend Carlisle and bring honor to his family. In 1902, with his wife Nellie and their children, Standing Bear joined [[Wild West Shows|Buffalo Bill's Wild West]] and traveled through England for eleven months. Luther was hired as an interpreter and chaperon for seventy-five Indians. He also performed as a skilled horseback rider and dancer.]] Wild Westing and the Carlisle Indian School were portals to education, opportunity and hope, and came at a time when the Lakota people were impoverished, harassed and confined.  Most Wild Westers were Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the first Lakota people to go Wild Westing.&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, p.21. "Wild West Shows and Images", p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Known as "[[Show Indians]]", Oglala Wild Westers referred to themselves as ''Oskate Wicasa'' or "Show Man", a title of great honor and respect.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa is a colloquialism meaning "one who performs." Its usage began in the early days of the Buffalo Bill Cody Wild West Shows. Oskate Wicasa, p.1. The phrase "Show Indians" likely originated among newspaper reporters and editorial writers as early as 1891. By 1893 the term appears frequently in Bureau of Indian Affairs correspondence. Some believe that the term is derogatory, describing the "phenomenon of Native exploitation and romanticization in the U.S." Arguments of a similar nature were made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs during the popularity of Wild West shows in the U.S. and Europe. "Indians on the Midway", p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 1887, [[Chief Blue Horse]], Chief American Horse and Chief [[Red Shirt (Oglala)|Red Shirt]] and their families boarded the ''S.S. State of Nebraska'' in New York City, led a journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England on Buffalo Bill's first international tour to perform at the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]] and in Birmingham, Salford and London over a five–month period. The entourage consisted of 97 Indians, 18 buffaloes, 2 deer, 10 elk, 10 mules, 5 Texas steers, 4 donkeys, and 108 horses.&lt;ref&gt;Heppler, "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1887, Wild Westing has been a family tradition with several hundred Pine Ridge families. Between 1906 and 1915, 570 individuals from Pine Ridge went Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill and other shows.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; Often entire families worked together, and the tradition of the Wild Wester community is not unlike that of circus communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank C.

Many Oglala Lakota Wild Westers from Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota attended Carlisle.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlisle Wild Westers were attracted by the adventure, pay and opportunity and were hired as performers, chaperons, interpreters and recruiters. Wild Westers from Pine Ridge enrolled their children at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from its beginning in 1879 until its closure in 1918. In 1879, Oglala Lakota leaders Chief Blue Horse, Chief American Horse and Chief Red Shirt enrolled their children in the first class at Carlisle. They wanted their children to learn English, trade skills and white customs. "Those first Sioux children who came to Carlisle could not have been happy there. But it was their only chance for a future."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Rinaldi, "My Heart is on the Ground: the Diary of Nannie Little Rose, a Sioux Girl, Carlisle Indian School, Pennsylvania, 1880," (1999), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luther Standing Bear]] was taught to be brave and unafraid to die, and left the reservation to attend Carlisle and do some brave deed to bring honor to his family. Standing Bear's father celebrated his son's brave act by inviting his friends to a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Agonito, "Lakota Portraits: Lives of the Legendary Plains People" (hereinafter "Agonito")(2011), p.237.&lt;/ref&gt;

== World fairs and expositions ==

Cummins, General Manager of the Exposition; High Hawk, [[Red Cloud|Jack Red Cloud]], [[Chief Blue Horse]], Little Wound and [[William Jennings Bryan]]. [[Pan-American Exposition|Pan-American Exposition of 1901]].]]
During the [[Progressive Era]], from the late 19th century until the onset of World War I, Native American performers were major draws and money-makers. Millions of visitors at world fairs, exhibitions and parades throughout the United States and Europe observed Native Americans portrayed as the vanishing race, exotic peoples and objects of modern comparative anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;David R.M. Beck, "The Myth of the Vanishing Race", Associate Professor, Native American Studies, University of Montana, February, 200. "Wild West Shows and Images", p.131, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Reformists Progressives and the [[Society of American Indians]] fought a war of words and images against popular Wild West shows at world fairs, expositions and parades and opposed theatrical portrayals of Wild Westers as vulgar heathen stereotypes. In contrast, Carlisle students were portrayed as a new generation of Native American leadership embracing civilization, education and industry. The fight for the image of the Native American began when Reformist Progressives pressured organizers to deny Buffalo Bill a place at the [[Columbian Exposition of 1893]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;"Wild West Shows and Images", p.131, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, a feature of the Exposition was a model Indian school and an ethnological Indian village supported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Financial difficulties, however, led the Bureau of Indian Affairs to withdraw its sponsorship and left the ethnological Indian Villages exhibit under the directorship of Frederick W. Putnam of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Robert A. Trennert, Jr., "Selling Indian Education at World's Fairs
&lt;/ref&gt; In style, Buffalo Bill established a fourteen-acre swath of land near the main entrance of the fair for "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World" where he erected stands around an arena large enough to seat eighteen thousand spectators.
Seventy-four Wild Westers from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, who had recently returned from a tour of Europe, were contracted to perform in the show. Cody also brought in an additional one hundred Wild Westers directly from Pine Ridge, Standing Rock and Rosebud reservations, who visited the Exposition at his expense and participated in the opening ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;"Indians on the Midway", p. 210-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's Wild West outside the Columbian Exposition, often mistaking the show as an integral part to the World's Fair.&lt;ref&gt;Parezo and Fowler, p.6. "Wild West Shows and Images", p.137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "vanishing race" theme was dramatized at the [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]] of 1898 at [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and The Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York. Exposition organizers assembled Wild Westers representing different tribes who portrayed Native Americans as a "vanishing race" at "The Last Great Congress of the Red Man", brought together for the first and last time, apparently to commiserate before they all vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Parezo and Fowler, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] of 1904, known as the St. Louis World's Fair, was the last of the great fairs in the United States before World War I. Organizers wanted their exotic people to be interpreted by anthropologists in a modern scientific manner portraying contrasting images of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Indians performing included Oglala Lakotas from Pine Ridge Reservation with Cummins's Wild West Show and Brule Lakotas from Rosebud Reservation with the Department of Anthropology. Parezo and Fowler, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; A Congress of Indian Educators was convened and Oglala Lakota Chief [[Red Cloud]] and Chief [[Chief Blue Horse|Blue Horse]], both eighty-three years old, and the best-known Native America orators at the St. Louis World's Fair, spoke to audiences. A model Indian School was placed on top on a hill so Indians below could see their future as portrayed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Parezo and Fowler, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; On one side of the school, "blanket Indians", men or women who refused to relinquish their native dress and customs, demonstrated their artistry inside the school on one side of the hall. On the other side, Indian boarding school students displayed their achievements in reading, writing, music, dancing, trades and arts.&lt;ref&gt;Parezo and Fowler, p. 135-136. 354, 459. J. McGee portrayed contrasting images of Native Americans and was critical of BIA programs destroying Native cultures and turning Indians into "counterfeit Caucasians."&lt;/ref&gt; The Carlisle Indian Band performed at the Pennsylvania state pavilion, and the Haskell Indian Band performed a mixture of classical, popular music and Wheelock's "Aboriginal Suite" which included Native dances and war whoops by band members.&lt;ref&gt;Parezo and Fowler, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1905 inaugural parade of Theodore Roosevelt ==
[[File:Roosevelt Inauguration Parade.jpg|500px|thumbnail|right|First Inaugural Parade of Theodore Roosevelt, March 4, 1905.

Six famous Native American Chiefs, [[Geronimo]] (Apache), [[Quanah Parker]] (Comanche), Buckskin Charlie (Ute), [[American Horse]] (Oglala Lakota), [[Hollow Horn Bear]] (Sicangu Lakota) and Little Plume (Blackfeet), met in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to rehearse the parade with the Carlisle Cadets and Band.&lt;ref&gt;A week or so before the inauguration, six famous chiefs from formerly hostile tribes, arrived in Carlisle to head the school's contingent in the parade. But, before they left for Washington, there was much to do. First, they spoke to an assembly of students through interpreters. A dress rehearsal was held on the main street of Carlisle to practice for the parade. The ''Carlisle Herald'' predicted that the group would be one of the big parade's star attractions.  Those marching in the parade were woken at 3:45 a.m., had breakfast at 4:30, and were the special train to Washington at 5:30. As the train rolled out of Carlisle, a heavy snow fell, but later the sun burned through, making for a fine day weather-wise. Fortunately, the travelers had lunch on the train because it was late in arriving in Washington. They were hurried into the last division of the Military Grand Division. Originally, they were to have been in the Civic Grand Division, but Gen. Chaffee transferred all cadets under arms to the military division, putting them in a separate brigade. Tom Benjey, "Carlisle Indian School", 1905 Inaugural Parade, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Roosevelt sat in the presidential box with his wife, daughter and other guests, and watched West Point cadets and the famed 7th Cavalry, Gen. George A. Custer's former unit that fought at the Battle of Little Bighorn, march down Pennsylvania Avenue.  When the contingent of Wild Westers and the Carlisle Cadets and Band came into view, President Roosevelt waved his hat and all in the President's box rose to their feet to see the six famous Native American Chiefs adorned with face paint and elaborate feather headdresses, riding on horseback, followed by the 46-piece Carlisle Indian School Band and a brigade of 350 Carlisle Cadets at arms. Leading the group was Geronimo, in full Apache regalia, riding a horse also in war paint. It was reported that: "The Chiefs created a sensation, eclipsing the intended symbolism of a formation of 350 uniformed Carlisle students led by a marching band,"  and "all eyes were on the six chiefs, the cadets received passing mention in the newspapers and nobody bothered to photograph them."&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Utely, "Geronimo"  p.257, 2012;  The Carlisle Band were led by Claude M. Stauffer and cadets led by Captain William M. Mercer, superintendent of the school and member of the 7th Cavalry. Tom Benjey, "Carlisle Indian School", 1905 Inaugural Parade, (2009). Witmer, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st century Wild Westing ==
 [[File:Grand Entry Omaha.jpg|400px|thumbnail|left|Americans and Europeans continue to have a great interest in Native peoples and enjoy modern [[Pow-wow]] culture.

Wild Westers still perform in movies, pow-wows, pageants and rodeos. Some Oglala Lakota people carry on family show business traditions from Carlisle alumni who worked for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans and Europeans continue to have a great interest in Native peoples and enjoy modern Pow-wow culture. First began in Wild West shows, [[Pow-wow]] culture is popular with Native American throughout the United States and a source of tribal enterprise. Americans and Europeans continue to enjoy traditional Native Americans skills; horse culture, ceremonial dancing and cooking; and buying Native American art, music and crafts. There are several on-going national projects that celebrate Wild Westers and Wild Westing.

The National Museum of American History's Photographic History Collection at the Smithsonian Institution preserves and displays Gertrude Käsebier's photographs, as well as many others by photographers who captured the displays of Wild Westing.
