'''Anna Gyllander''' (born 1633 – [[floruit]] 1659) was a Swedish [[imposter]], who during the reign of King [[Charles X of Sweden]], presented herself to be the abdicated queen [[Christina of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Stålberg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fraud==
In 1659, rumors reached King Charles X that there was a woman travelling about the country who claimed to be the former regent queen Christina, who abdicated and was living in Rome. The alleged "Queen Christina" had traveled about the country for at least a year, toasting "her brother the king" and firing gunshots to his honour. When asked if she was "''Cristina Regina''", she reportedly replied: ''"Ni säger så"'' (In English: "I hear you say that," or: "So you say"),&lt;ref&gt;Stålberg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor&lt;/ref&gt; and said that her parents were King [[Gustav II Adolf of Sweden]] and [[Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg|queen Maria Eleonora]]. She never said straight out that she was Queen Christina, but gave the impression this was the case, and never denied it when others claimed she was.

The impostor was apprehended and identified as Anna Gyllander, daughter of Anders Gyllander from [[Norrköping]] and married to a cavalry captain from [[Courland]] in the division of Kruuse.&lt;ref&gt;Stålberg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor&lt;/ref&gt;

She defended herself by claiming that she had no idea how serious the whole thing would be considered and pleaded for mercy. The king sentenced her to one month imprisonment on [[bread and water]], followed by banishment and exile from the kingdom and its provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Stålberg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13192">'''Avalanche''' was a [[criminal]] syndicate involved in [[phishing]] attacks, [[online bank fraud]], and [[ransomware]]. The name also refers to the network of owned, rented, and compromised systems used to carry out that activity. Avalanche only infected computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. 

In November 2016, the Avalanche botnet was destroyed after a four-year project by an international consortium of law enforcement, commercial, academic, and private organizations.

==History==

Avalanche was discovered in December 2008, and may have been a replacement for a phishing group known as Rock Phish which stopped operating in 2008.&lt;ref name="greene1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greene|first=Tim|title=Worst Phishing Pest May be Revving Up|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/196304/worst_phishing_pest_may_be_revving_up.html|accessdate=2010-05-17|newspaper=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100520022702/http://www.pcworld.com/article/196304/worst_phishing_pest_may_be_revving_up.html| archivedate= 20 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was run from [[Eastern Europe]] and was given its name by security researchers because of the high volume of its attacks.&lt;ref name="mcmillan1"&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillan |first=Robert |title=Report blames 'Avalanche' group for most phishing |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/051310-report-blames-avalanche-group-for.html?hpg1=bn |accessdate=2010-05-17 |newspaper=[[Network World]] |date=2010-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613121028/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/051310-report-blames-avalanche-group-for.html?hpg1=bn |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcmillan2"&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillan |first=Robert |title=Report blames 'Avalanche' group for most phishing |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9176661/Report_blames_Avalanche_group_for_most_phishing |accessdate=2010-05-17 |newspaper=[[Computerworld]] |date=2010-05-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516031426/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9176661/Report_blames_Avalanche_group_for_most_phishing |archivedate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Avalanche launched 24% of phishing attacks in the first half of 2009; in the second half of 2009, the [[Anti-Phishing Working Group]] (APWG) recorded 84,250 attacks by Avalanche, constituting 66% of all phishing attacks. The number of total phishing attacks more than doubled, an increase which the APWG directly attributes to Avalanche.&lt;ref name="aaron1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaron|first=Greg|year=2010|title=Global Phishing Survey: Trends and Domain Name Use 2H2009|url=http://www.antiphishing.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_2H2009.pdf|journal=APWG Industry Advisory|author2=Rod Rasmussen|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avalanche used [[E-mail spam|spam email]] purporting to come from trusted organisations such as financial institutions or employment websites. Victims were deceived into entering personal information on websites made to appear as though they belong to these organisations. They were sometimes  tricked into installing software attached to the emails or at a website. The [[malware]] [[Keystroke logging|logged keystrokes]], stole passwords and credit card information, and allowed unauthorised [[remote desktop software|remote access]] to the infected computer.

[[Internet Identity]]'s Phishing Trends report for the second quarter of 2009 said that Avalanche "have detailed knowledge of commercial banking platforms, particularly treasury management systems and the [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH) system. They are also performing successful real-time [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s that defeat two-factor security tokens."&lt;ref name="iid1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phishing Trends Report: Analysis of Online Financial Fraud Threats Second Quarter, 2009 |url=http://www.internetidentity.com/images/stories/docs/phishing_trends_report_q2-2009_by_internet_identity.pdf |publisher=[[Internet Identity]] |accessdate=2010-05-17 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avalanche had many similarities to the previous group [[Rock Phish]] - the first phishing group which used automated techniques -  but with greater in scale and volume.&lt;ref name="kaplan1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan |first=Dan |title="Avalanche" phishing slowing, but was all the 2009 rage |url=http://www.scmagazineus.com/avalanche-phishing-slowing-but-was-all-the-rage-last-year/article/170052/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201222945/http://www.scmagazineus.com/avalanche-phishing-slowing-but-was-all-the-rage-last-year/article/170052/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2010-05-17 |newspaper=SC Magazine |date=2010-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Avalanche hosted its domains on compromised computers (a [[botnet]]). There was no single [[Internet hosting service|hosting provider]], making difficult to take down the domain and requiring the involvement of the responsible [[domain registrar]].

In addition, Avalanche used [[fast-flux]] [[Domain name system|DNS]], causing the compromised machines to change constantly. Avalanche attacks also spread the [[Zeus (malware)|Zeus]] [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] enabling further criminal activity. The majority of domains which Avalanche used belonged to national [[domain name registrar]]s in Europe and Asia. This differs from other phishing attacks, where the majority of domains use [[United States of America|U.S.]] registrars. It appears that Avalanche chose registrars based on their security procedures, returning repeatedly to registrars which do not detect domains being used for fraud, or which were slow to suspend abusive domains.&lt;ref name="iid1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mohan1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohan|first=Ram|title=The State of Phishing - A Breakdown of The APWG Phishing Survey &amp; Avalanche Phishing Gang|url=http://www.securityweek.com/content/state-phishing-breakdown-apwg-phishing-survey-avalanche-phishing-gang|accessdate=2010-05-17|newspaper=Security Week|date=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avalanche frequently registered domains with multiple registrars, while testing others to check whether their distinctive domains were being detected and blocked. They targeted a small number financial institutions at a time, but rotated these regularly. A domain which not suspended by a registrar was re-used in later attacks. The group created a phishing "kit", which came pre-prepared for use against many victim institutions.&lt;ref name="iid1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="naraine1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naraine |first=Ryan |title='Avalanche' Crimeware Kit Fuels Phishing Attacks |url=http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/avalanche-crimeware-kit-fuels-phishing-attacks-102309 |work=ThreatPost |publisher=[[Kaspersky Lab]] |accessdate=2010-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802000726/http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/avalanche-crimeware-kit-fuels-phishing-attacks-102309 |archivedate=2010-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avalanche attracted significant attention from security organisations; as a result, the [[uptime]] of the [[domain name]]s it used was half that of other phishing domains.&lt;ref name="aaron1" /&gt;

In October 2009, [[ICANN]], the organisation which manages the assignment of domain names, issued a Situation Awareness Note encouraging registrars to be pro-active in dealing with Avalanche attacks.&lt;ref name="icann1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ito|first=Yurie|title=High volume criminal phishing attack known as Avalanche the delivery method for the Zeus botnet infector|url=http://www.icann.org/en/security/sa-2009-0002.htm|work=ICANN Situation Awareness Note 2009-10-06|publisher=[[ICANN]]|accessdate=2010-05-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100402223820/http://www.icann.org/en/security/sa-2009-0002.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK registry, [[Nominet]] has changed its procedures to make it easier to suspend domains, because of attacks by Avalanche.&lt;ref name="aaron1" /&gt; Interdomain, a Spanish registrar, began requiring a confirmation code delivered by [[mobile phone]] in April 2009 which successfully forced Avalanche to stop registering fraudulent domains with them.&lt;ref name="iid1" /&gt;

In 2010, the APWG reported that Avalanche had been responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks in the second half of 2009, describing it as "one of the most sophisticated and damaging on the Internet" and "the world's most prolific phishing gang".&lt;ref name="aaron1" /&gt;

==Takedown==

In November 2009, security companies managed to shut down the Avalanche botnet for a short time; after this Avalanche reduced the scale of its activities and altered its ''[[modus operandi]]''. By April 2010, attacks by Avalanche had decreased to just 59 from a high of more than 26,000 in October 2009, but the decrease was temporary.&lt;ref name="greene1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aaron1" /&gt;

On November 30, 2016, the Avalanche botnet was destroyed at the end of a four-year project by [[Interpol|INTERPOL]], [[Europol]], the Shadowserver Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Shadowserver/Mission|title=Shadowserver Foundation - Shadowserver - Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurojust]], the [[Lüneburg|Luneberg]] (Germany) police,  The&amp;nbsp;[[Federal Office for Information Security|German Federal Office for Information Security]] (BSI), the Fraunhofer FKIE, several antivirus companies organized by [[Symantec]], [[ICANN]], [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|CERT]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and some of the domain registries that had been used by the group.

Symantec [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the client malware and the consortium analyzed 130 [[Terabyte|TB]] of data captured during those years. This allowed it to defeat the [[fast-flux]] distributed [[Domain name system|DNS]] obfuscation, map the command/control structure&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/images/editor/avalanche_-_double_flux-_details.png&lt;/ref&gt; of the botnet, and identify its numerous physical servers.

37 premises were searched, 39 servers were seized, 221 rented servers were removed from the network when their unwitting owners were notified, 500,000 [[Zombie (computer science)|zombie computers]] were freed from remote control, 17 families of malware were deprived of c/c, and the five people who ran the botnet were arrested.

The law enforcement [[DNS sinkhole|sinkhole server]], described in 2016 as the "largest ever", with 800,000 domains served, collects the IP addresses of infected computers that request instructions from the botnet so that the ISPs owning them can inform users that their machines are infected and provide removal software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/avalanche-botnet-comes-tumbling-down-in-largest-ever-sinkholing-operation/d/d-id/1327618?_mc=NL_DR_EDT_DR_daily_20161203&amp;cid=NL_DR_EDT_DR_daily_20161203&amp;elqTrackId=07a363846c414e28a454dada70e0dd31&amp;elq=eb2866eb5fba46899765800b077fc473&amp;elqaid=75229&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=24598|title=Avalanche Botnet Comes Tumbling Down In Largest-Ever Sinkholing Operation|last=Peters|first=Sarah|date=December 1, 2016|website=darkreading.com|publisher=|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/avalanche-malware-network-hit-law-enforcement-takedown|title=Avalanche malware network hit with law enforcement takedown|last=Symantec Security Response|first=|date=December 1, 2016|website=Symantec Connect|publisher=Symantec|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation|title=‘Avalanche’ network dismantled in international cyber operation|last=Europol|first=|date=December 1, 2016|website=europol.europa.eu|publisher=Europol|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bacall to Arms''''' is a 1946 [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon in the [[Merrie Melodies]] series, co-planned by Bob Clampett, in his second-to-last cartoon at Warner Bros. (''[[The Big Snooze]]'' would be the last) and [[Tex Avery]], finished by [[Arthur Davis (animator)|Arthur Davis]] and supervised by [[Friz Freleng]]. Neither Clampett (he was left uncredited because he had left the studio before the cartoon was released) nor voice characterizations are credited. [[Mel Blanc]]'s voice is recognizable as a fat theater patron, a husband in a newsreel, and the wolf's vocal effects. Impressionist [[Dave Barry (actor)|Dave Barry]] portrays the voice of [[Humphrey Bogart]] while [[June Foray]] voices Lauren Bacall. The title refers both to Hemingway's ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' and actress [[Lauren Bacall]], whose acclaimed film debut was in ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'', based on another Hemingway novel, as well  as a play on the term "A Call to Arms".

==Background==

[[Bob Clampett]] started his directing career with [[black-and-white]] animated shorts for the [[Looney Tunes]] series, this phase of his career lasting from 1937 to 1941. In 1941, fellow director [[Tex Avery]] departed the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] studio. Clampett replaced Avery as the head of a unit producing [[Color motion picture film|films]] for the [[Merrie Melodies]] series, while [[Norman McCabe]] took over Clampett's former unit.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (1999), unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; The chief animator of Clampett's new unit was [[Robert McKimson]].

==Plot==
The cartoon is set in a [[movie theater]]. Various random gags occur before the film, such as one patron moving to another seat another patron taking the vacated seat, and so on, accelerating into a free-for-all. A [[wolf]] makes a pass at a sexy movie [[Usher (occupation)|usher]]ette, gets slapped in the face, then settles down for the show. While the theater is in color, the films-within-the film are black-and-white. A short "[[newsreel]]" is narrated by Robert C. Bruce.

The main feature is a film called ''To Have- To Have- To Have- ...'', a parody of ''[[To Have and Have Not]]''. It includes images of [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], who are credited as "Bogey Gocart and Laurie Becool". In addition to recreating a few well-known scenes from that film (the kissing scene; the "put your lips together and blow" scene), the players sometimes lapse into slapstick (Bacall lighting her cigarette with a [[blowtorch]] à la [[Harpo Marx]]; or letting loose with a loud, shrill whistle after her famous sultry comment) and interact with the theater audience.

Although the theater was initially full, it is eventually seen to be empty except for one patron: a literal [[lone wolf (trait)|lone wolf]] in a [[zoot suit]] who goes ga-ga over Bacall. The final gag has the wolf grabbing a [[cigarette]] that was dropped in the film and jumps off the screen, and Bogie shoots him. He hands it to Bogie and it explodes, covering him with "[[blackface]]". Bogie suddenly adopts a "[[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson]]" voice, and says, "Mah, oh mah! I can work fo' Mr. [[Jack Benny|Benny]] nah!"

==Analysis==

The film reuses animation from an earlier short, ''[[She Was an Acrobat's Daughter]]'' (1937) by [[Friz Freleng]]. Like its 1930s predecessor, the film depicts a noisy movie audience member which disrupts the screening. In this case the noisy audience is represented by the [[wolf-whistling]] and [[Gray wolf#Howling|howling]] of a wolf in the audience.&lt;ref name="Sartin"&gt;Sartin (1998), p. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses [[caricature]]s of [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], who attempt to act out the scene from ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944) in which they first kiss, and her character's advice on how to whistle. Bogart eventually shoots the disruptive wolf from the movie screen, though the [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film]] never properly ends.&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The short is one of two memorable parodies of Bogart from the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] studio. The other was ''[[Slick Hare]]'' (1947), where restaurant customer Bogart demands "fried rabbit" from [[Elmer Fudd]]. Setting up a plot where both Fudd and Bogart chase after [[Bugs Bunny]].&lt;ref name="Kanfer"&gt;Kanfer (2011), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The film functions as a tribute to Bacall and her [[Sexual attraction|sexual attractiveness]]. It was probably produced to promote the release of an upcoming feature film, ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946).&lt;ref name="Worland"&gt;Worland (2011), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The film [[Conflation|conflates]] two scenes from ''To Have and Have Not'', the scene where the [[protagonist]] are introduced to each other and the whistle scene.&lt;ref name="Worland"&gt;Worland (2011), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In the original film, Bogart cleans a [[fishing reel]]. In the parody, he cleans a [[List of .45 caliber handguns|.45 caliber handgun]].&lt;ref name="Worland"&gt;Worland (2011), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In a reference to Bacall's "hotness", when her caricature crosses the floor, she leaves a trail of flames behind her. While the film within a film is [[black-and-white]], making it the last [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon in [[black-and-white]], the flames are red and yellow.&lt;ref name="Worland"&gt;Worland (2011), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; When she asks for a light, the Bogart caricature offers her a [[blow torch]]. She easily catches it and uses the torch to light her [[cigarette]].&lt;ref name="Worland"&gt;Worland (2011), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive voice of [[Eddie "Rochester" Anderson]] is used here to accompany a [[blackface]]-related [[visual gag]]. Christopher Lehman notes that it was typical for blackface gags in animated films to make references to well-known [[African American]] actors. References to both Anderson and [[Stepin Fetchit]] were frequently used. He notes, however, that the creators of [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] found comedic use for Anderson's voice and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. But never for the intelligence or [[wit]] of his character, Rochester. Which he finds rather telling.&lt;ref name="Lehman"&gt;Lehman (2009), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Don Peri points that in the 1930s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] was the industry leader in [[character animation]]. But as this studio's focus shifted from animated shorts to [[List of animated feature films|animated feature films]], other studios started making their own advances in the field. At times depicting emotions that were absent from Disney films. Peri cites ''Bacall to Arms'' as a memorable depiction of [[lust]] in animation.&lt;ref name="Peri"&gt;Peri (2011), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The wolf himself seems similar to "[[Red Hot Riding Hood|Wolfie]]" by [[Tex Avery]].&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] ended in August 1945, but several animated shorts released later in that year and into 1946 still contained war-related references. In ''Bacall to Arms'' there is a [[newsreel]] featuring ''"wartime inventions put to peacetime use"''. The example depicted is that of a married man who uses a [[radar]] to receive early warnings for the unannounced visits of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt;

Norman Klein cites the film as an example of animated films referencing [[film noir]] and figures associated with the genre, such as Bogart. He argues that [[screwball comedy film]], the chase-themed animated films, the [[crime film]], and film noir were genres which shared certain elements. In his view, all were reactions to the [[melodrama]] films of the 1930s and all rejected the moralizing tendecies of these melodramas. They reacted by embracing depictions of outrageous behavior and [[amorality]]. Common themes among them were the depiction of [[poetic justice]] as [[malum in se]], of faked sentiment as a tool of [[deception]], and [[sardonicism]] as the primary form of [[Humour|humor]].&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;Klein (1996), p. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7643">'''Business Consulting International''' was a [[London]]-based investment company that collapsed after being exposed by a [[City of London Police]] investigation in 2008 as the [[United Kingdom]]'s biggest [[ponzi scheme]], estimated at £115M.&lt;ref name=BBC17290356/&gt;  The business was set up and run by Kautilya Nandan Pruthi, a London-based Indian businessman, in partnership with Kenneth Peacock and John Anderson, who both lived in [[Sunningdale]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;

Based from rented offices at 1 Relton Mews, [[Knightsbridge]], the proposal of BCI was that clients lent it money, so that BCI in turn could lend that money at very high rates of interest to "distressed" businesses that found themselves unable to borrow from banks for short periods of time.
Pruthi through BCI offered investors a return of between 4% and 20% a month on short-term fixed deposits of between four weeks and a year,&lt;ref name=FSAAPPruthi/&gt; while Anderson and Peacock through their own consulting companies promised slightly lower rates, passing on their deposits directly to Pruthi.&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;

In the last three years of operation (2005–November 2008), the partners each attracted:&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;
*Anderson: 130 clients, investing in total between £8.4M and £10.1M
*Peacock: 175 clients, investing in total between £9M and £10M
*Pruthi: 290 clients, investing in total £49.5M

Peacock, a member of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]], lured in many sports personalities to the scheme.  The three partners would also meet regularly at Lord’s and the [[Oval cricket ground]], where they would also meet potential investors. Pruthi additionally bought Apex Motorsports, in which he invested the funds, and to which he invited investment clients to participate in various UK and global motorsports events.&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;

Celebrity clients included the former cricketer [[Darren Gough]], and the actor [[Jerome Flynn]], who invested with fellow members of the [[Ratu Bagus]] religious sect.&lt;ref name=DMail1202079&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1202079/The-pop-singer-Strictly-Come-Dancing-star-vibrating-mystics--DID-fall-85m-scam.html|title=The pop singer, the Strictly Come Dancing star, the vibrating mystics... why DID so many fall for £85m 'scam'?|author=Steve Boggan and Stephen Wright|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In November 2008, BCI and the partners' assets were frozen to allow an investigation to be undertaken by the [[City of London Police]]. Lodging papers at the [[High Court]], the [[Financial Services Authority]] accused BCI and its partners of illegally accepting deposits for a collective investment scheme in contravention of the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], as they were not authorised to operate such an enterprise.&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;

Despite working in the same offices, Pruthi immediately claimed that Anderson and Peacock operated independently of him and so there was no such organised "scheme". The three also counter-argued that the monies were never pooled to be "collectively" invested, and so they could not have breached the Act.&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;

The FSA started a search for the invested monies, which globally extended to [[Dubai]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Thailand]] and [[Bermuda]]. In the UK they seized: £1 million in jewellery; £250,000 in cash; and 16 cars, including [[Bentley]]s, two [[Ferrari]]s, and a [[Lamborghini]]. Pruthi was the sole shareholder of Relton Mews Air Ltd, a Bermuda-based company that owned a twin-engine [[Cessna Citation I]] jet aircraft, registered as VP-BGE. [[2008 Farnborough Cessna Citation crash|This aircraft crashed]] near [[Biggin Hill Airport]], [[Kent]], on 30 March 2008, killing five people, including: [[David Leslie (racing driver)|David Leslie]], a touring car driver; [[Richard Lloyd (racing driver)|Richard Lloyd]], a racing driver and APEX team co-owner; and Chris Allarton, a data engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1311171,00.html Farnborough Air Crash: Cessna Aircraft Goes Down In Kent |Sky News|UK News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were travelling to the [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro Circuit]] in France to test for Apex Motorsport in preparation for the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planetlemans.com/2008/03/30/david-leslie-and-richard-lloyd-killed-in-plane-accident/ | title = David Leslie and Richard Lloyd killed in plane accident | publisher = Planetlemans | date = 30 March 2008 | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any monies from a $1 million (£610,000) insurance claim for the aircraft will now be deposited with the FSA.&lt;ref name=DMail1202079/&gt;

==Trial==
On 25 March 2010, the High Court ruled that Pruthi, Anderson and Peacock, trading as Business Consulting International, John Anderson Consulting and Kenneth Peacock Consulting, were unlawfully accepting deposits from UK consumers.&lt;ref name=FSAAPPruthi/&gt;

On 29 June 2010, the High Court declared that the three must pay the FSA £115M within a defined period, split: Pruthi £89.8M; Anderson £13.2M; Peacock £11.6M.&lt;ref name=FSAAPPruthi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/consumerinformation/firmnews/2010/anderson_peacock_pruthi.shtml|title=Anderson, Peacock and Pruthi to pay £115m after unlawfully accepting deposits|publisher=[[Financial Services Authority]]|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=2102-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on failing to do so, the High Court declared each of them [[bankrupt]], to allow the FSA to recover the maximum amount of client funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/consumerinformation/firmnews/2011/anderson_peacock_pruthi.shtml|title=Call to clients of Anderson, Peacock and Pruthi|publisher=[[Financial Services Authority]]|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=2102-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2010, Pruthi was charged with 30 fraud offences including running a bogus business, money laundering and obtaining money by deception, later released on [[bail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10821820|title=Businessman facing 30 charges over alleged £115m fraud|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=30 July 2010|accessdate=2102-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main trial was scheduled for early 2012 at [[Southwark Crown Court]], in front of Judge Michael Gledhill QC, to allow time for the FSA to recover funds.

On 30 January 2012, before the trial began, Pruthi pleaded guilty in a pre-trial hearing to: four specimen counts of obtaining money transfers by deception; one count of participating in a fraudulent business; one count of unauthorised regulated activity; and one count of converting and removing criminal property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16801635|title=Man admits 'biggest Ponzi fraud in the UK'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=2102-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March, Anderson and Peacock were convicted of unauthorised regulated activity, in a scheme masterminded by Pruthi. On 7 March, Anderson and Peacock were found not guilty of recklessly making a misleading, false or deceptive promise. Jurors also cleared them of one count each of fraud.&lt;ref name=BBC17290356&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17290356|title=Ponzi scheme pair not guilty of deception|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=2102-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Musical''''' (originally known as '''''Alferd Packer: The Musical''''') is a 1993 American [[Independent film|independent]] [[black comedy]] [[horror film|horror]] [[musical film]] directed, written, produced, co-scored by and starring [[Trey Parker]] while studying at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], before reaching fame with ''[[South Park]]'' alongside his friend [[Matt Stone]] who also stars in and produced the film. It is loosely based on the true story of [[Alferd Packer]] and the sordid details of the trip from [[Utah]] to [[Colorado]] that left his five fellow travelers dead and partially eaten. Trey Parker (credited as Juan Schwartz) stars as Alferd Packer, with frequent collaborators Stone, [[Dian Bachar]], and others playing the supporting roles.

In 2001, a stage production was staged [[Off-Broadway]] at the Kraine Theater on East 4th Street in New York. The show continued to find small theaters and audiences across America and beyond for many years.

A large-scale stage production was produced by The Rival Theatre Company at the [[2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. It featured West End performers. It was executive produced by [[Jason McHugh]] and directed by Frazer Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannibalthemusical.org/|title=Welcome to CannibalTheMusical.Net|publisher=CannibalTheMusical.Net|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, producer Jason McHugh released a book titled, "Shpadoinkle: The Making of Cannibal! The Musical," which chronicles all aspects of the creation and continuation of the Cannibal! The Musical cult phenomenon.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Plot==
The film begins with a [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] of the gruesome events of [[cannibalism]] as described by the prosecuting attorney during Alferd Packer's trial in 1883. Packer insists that things happened differently than what has been recounted, and begins to tell his story to journalist [[Polly Pry]] through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] ("Shpadoinkle").

In 1873, a group of miners in [[Bingham Canyon, Utah]] hear of new gold discoveries in [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]] and decide to travel to [[Colorado Territory]] to stake a claim. After the original guide, Lucky Larry, dies from a lightning strike, Packer is nominated as the replacement since he claimed knowledge of the area ("Shpadoinkle [Reprise]"). He and his trusty horse, Liane, set off on what Packer estimates will be a three-week journey with a party of five miners: Shannon Wilson Bell, an aspiring [[Mormon]] priest; James Humphrey, who was forced by his father to join the party; Frank Miller, a cynical [[butcher]] who reluctantly joins their party at the mine; George Noon, a teenager hoping to meet women in Breckenridge; and Israel Swan, an [[Optimism|optimist]].

Four weeks later, while attempting to visit [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] for supplies they become convinced they are lost. An attempt to ask a local for directions to Provo proves unsuccessful, with the local warning them of impending doom awaiting them in the mountains. Finally arriving at a frontier post in Provo, they run into a group of three fur trappers bound for [[Saguache, Colorado|Saguache]]; O.D. Loutzenheiser, Preston Nutter, and their diminutive leader, Jean "Frenchy" Cabazon. The trappers despise the miners, whom they contemptuously call "diggers", yet seem to like Packer’s horse, telling Packer that she's a "trapper horse". Making camp, Packer and company reveal their goals for traveling to each other in song ("That's All I'm Asking For"). The next day, Packer wakes up to discover his horse and friend, Liane, is missing. After Bell wounds his leg in a [[Trapping#Leg-hold_traps|bear trap]], the men attempt to cross the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] near the Utah border. The group asks Packer if there are any other big rivers that they will have to cross to which he replies, “Oh no, just the [[Colorado River]].” They camp out for the night after their crossing, with Packer singing a heartfelt song about Liane ("Ode to Liane"). Eventually, after a disastrous crossing of the Colorado River the Packer party is spotted by two “[[Nihonjin]]” Indians (obviously played by Japanese actors and speaking Japanese). They are taken back to the tribe's encampment near [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]] where the chief warns them of a winter storm, allowing them to wait it out with the tribe. Packer's party also find the trappers camping out with the tribe, who proceed to brag about their lives in song before a small altercation breaks out over Liane, whose feedbag Packer finds in their possession ("Trapper Song").

The story returns to the present time, where Packer is sentenced to death by hanging, with his execution to occur in [[Lake City, Colorado|Lake City]]. That night, alone, Polly muses over the case and Packer's testimony, and she reveals her growing affection for him through song ("This Side of Me"). The next day, Polly visits Packer once again in prison, where he continues his story.

The men set out in the wilderness after Packer learns the trappers have already left, persuading them to leave under the guise of there being a break in the storm. The group begins to suspect that Packer is really only interested in following the trappers to find his horse. They soldier on until they encounter a foreboding "[[Cyclops]]", a tall man with a wounded eye, while unwittingly trying to steal one of his sheep for sustenance. The Cyclops recalls how a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier shot out his eye in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and becomes enraged when he realizes Packer's men are not “[[Confederate States of America|Southern boys]]” after they can not finish the lyrics to "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]", causing them to flee. They escape and the badly [[Frostbite|frostbitten]] Swan tries to cheer everybody up with a song about building a [[snowman]] ("Let's Build a Snowman"). They soon run out of food, resorting to eating their shoes as they become lost in the snow-covered [[Rocky Mountains]]. Out of frustration, Bell shoots Swan in the head because he does not appreciate his (Swan's) [[Pollyanna]]-esque perspective on their predicament ("Let's Build a Snowman [Reprise]"). The men discuss their dire situation that night over the fire, speaking of the [[cannibalism]] that the [[Donner Party]] had to resort to in California. They decide to consume the body of their dead companion (but “not the butt”) as Miller cuts up Swan's body, and only Bell refuses to partake in the cannibalism. Packer then has a [[ballet|ballet-inspired]] nightmare involving himself, Liane, and Cabazon. A few more days leads to talk of sacrificing one of their own. Packer convinces them for one more chance for a scouting trip, but when he returns, Bell has killed the others, claiming they planned to kill and eat him after Packer left. Packer is forced to kill Bell after threatening to turn him in, realizing he has gone insane. He is then forced to cannibalize the others to wait out the rest of the winter.

Arriving in Saguache sometime later, Packer finds Liane, who has taken to Cabazon, upsetting Packer. The sheriff of Saguache, suspicious of Packer arriving without the rest of his party, eventually finds out the fate of the other members and attempts to arrest Packer for cannibalism at a saloon. A bar-fight between Packer and the trappers (and some of the bar patrons, including the Cyclops from earlier) occurs, which Packer wins after brutally attacking Cabazon's groin using fighting techniques he learned from the Nihonjin chief, leaving Cabazon incapacitated with a high-pitched voice. Following this, Packer attempts to flee to [[Wyoming]], only to later be arrested there and brought back to Colorado to await judgement. On the day of Packer's execution in Lake City, the town breaks into song, celebrating Packer's impending death ("Hang the Bastard"). However, he is saved at the last minute by Polly, who arrives on the scene with Liane. Polly reveals that Packer had gotten a [[stay of execution]] from the governor stating that he could not be convicted of a state crime since Colorado [[Ex post facto law|was not a state at the time of the incident]]. Meanwhile Cabazon, who wants revenge against Packer for their fight in Saguache, claims the townsfolk came to see bloodshed and tries to trigger the gallows. The Nihonjin chief saves Packer by cutting his rope with a [[katana]] before beheading Cabazon, satisfying the crowd's blood-lust. Packer, seeing that Polly brought back Liane, realizes he doesn't need her anymore and chooses Polly (much to the excitement of the chief, who takes off after Liane with his katana), and the two kiss, only to be frightened by a still-alive Bell ("Shpadoinkle [Finale]").

Contrasting with the musical's generally dark and morbid humor are its cheerful songs, all composed by Parker, including "Let's Build a Snowman", "Ode to Liane", "Hang the Bastard", and "Shpadoinkle" (pronounced ''shpah-doink-ul''). The last of these is a transparent [[parody]] of the song "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning" from the [[Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein]] musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]''.

Two songs that were originally going to be in the film, but later taken out, were "Shatterproof" and "Don't Be Stupid". An interview with Ian Keldin said that Trey thought "Shatterproof" (which was going to be a rap song sung by Packer during the bar fight scene) made Packer seem too tough.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
The film began as a 3-minute [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] made for a film class. After the trailer drew much attention, Parker and Stone raised around $125,000 and began shooting the full-length film. The film was shot during weekends and on spring break in 1993, and according to Ian Hardin, most of the crew failed their film history class as a result.&lt;ref&gt;"Keith", [http://cannibalthemusical.net/interviews.shtml Interview with Ian Keldin (Ian Hardin)]. Retrieved 10 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in shooting, Parker was thrown from one of the horses playing "Liane", fracturing his hip.

This film was originally titled ''Alferd Packer: The Musical'' in 1993. The [[film premiere]]d on October 31, 1993, in Boulder, Colorado, at a cinema near the University of Colorado campus. A fake protest organized by friends of Parker and Stone, organized along the lines of an animal rights demonstration, took place in front of the theater. The film then played at Raindance Film Festival in October 2004. Parker and Stone attended.

Parker was credited onscreen as Juan Schwartz, a reference to Alferd Packer's alias "John Schwartze", which he was living under when discovered in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

It was not released generally until 1996, however, when [[Troma Entertainment]] picked it up and renamed it ''Cannibal! The Musical'' out of concern that not enough people outside of Colorado knew who Packer was. Few people outside of Colorado ever saw the film since Troma did not distribute it widely. Parker and Stone's animated [[satire]] ''[[South Park]]'' debuted the following year.

Several live productions of the show have been mounted, with excerpts from one live version available on the DVD.

==Home media==
Following Matt and Trey's success with ''South Park'', Troma re-released the film on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] and it enjoyed a decent [[cult following]]. The DVD contains a "Drunken [[Audio commentary|Director's Commentary]]" where Parker and Stone along with most of the cast get drunk as they watch the film, although there are a few times when the commentary cuts out (either because the recorder was turned off or they spoke of things they later decided nobody should hear).

The film has since been released on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] for the [[Sony PSP]]. A special edition 13th anniversary DVD was released by Troma with added features, including all new interviews with the cast and crew.

The film was re-released on November 2008 as the first of the "Tromasterpiece Collection," as Troma considers ''Cannibal!'' to be one of its best films. Included in the new two-disc version, with over three hours of special features, never-before-seen deleted material and stage shows. Songs such as "Shatter Proof" and the early short films of Parker and Stone were considered to be a part of the new DVD, but these additions were ultimately rejected.

==Stage productions==
There have been several amateur productions of ''Cannibal! The Musical'' since 1996.  The first was at the [[Sierra College]] in Northern California and then at [[Dad's Garage Theatre Company|Dad's Garage Theater]] where it won accolades by fans and the press.

In 2001, Saturday Players launched a six-month off-off-Broadway run of the show that earned critical acclaim and returning audience members.

In 2004, ''Cannibal'' made its European debut in Rome at the Teatro di Servi.

In 2005, the first High School group attempted the show at The [[Ironwood Ridge High School]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], but the show was censored by the school and performed off campus as a benefit. Later that year the show made its German debut at the [[University of Regensburg]] and played many small colleges and community houses in the US.

In 2006, the show debuted at its first Fringe Festivals in Minneapolis and Victoria, Canada and continued to find adoption by small colleges and community theaters.

In 2008, The Insurgo Theater Movement launched the show in Las Vegas for the first of several runs by their company.  Unexpected Productions launched the first of four October runs of Cannibal in Seattle.

Also in 2008, The Rival Theatre Company produced the first large-scale professional production. The show ran from July 31 to August 25 at the George Square Theatre, Edinburgh for a total of 26 performances. It starred [[Aimie Atkinson]] as Polly Pry and James Topping as Alferd Packer. Original film cast member [[Jason McHugh]] made a guest appearance as Mr. Mills. Other guest stars included [[Jim Bowen]] and The Q Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fringereview.co.uk/fringeReview/2598.html|title=Cannibal!

In 2011, M.P.M.M. Productions, performed the musical in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada during the 2011 Winnipeg Fringe Festival. It won "The Best of Fest" for its venue (meaning it outsold other shows in the venue and was awarded an additional show).  The show also debuted in St Louis and Denver with great reviews and enthusiastic casts and audience members.

In May 2012, Logan Donahoo Presents performed a version of the musical in [[Orlando, Florida]] during the 2012 Orlando International Fringe Theatre Festival, in the Yellow venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orlandofringe.org/2012-2/detailed/?subject=lineup&amp;_year=2012&amp;artist=39|title=Cannibal!

The show will run between June 12, 2014, until 8 March 2015, with two separate seating areas (a "Gore Zone" where audience members are subject to splash-zone-esque involvement, and a less messy "Gore-Free Zone".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/cannibal-the-musical-live-stage-show-review/|title="CANNIBAL!: THE MUSICAL LIVE!"|last=Parker|first=Trevor|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=February 16, 2015|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term “caviar diplomacy” was first used in 2012, in a report by the European Stability Initiative (ESI) – “Caviar Diplomacy – How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe”. It was noted in the report that this term is being used in informal conversations of Azerbaijani officials to describe generous gifts to foreign politicians.&lt;ref name="ESI_Caviar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carnegie.ru/2016/10/31/ru-pub-64986|title=Независимому Азербайджану — 25: начинается новая эпоха перемен и потрясений?|author=Thomas de Waal|publisher=Carnegie Middle East Center|accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Investigation of the “European Stability Initiative” ==
According to the sources of the European Stability Initiative, Azerbaijan has a group of 10-12 friends in [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] and 3-4 people in the secretariat who receive at least half a kilogram of black caviar (the price on the market is more than 1300 euros per kilogram) as a gift four times a year. Many deputies are invited to Baku and during their visits receive, alongside the caviar, numerous other gifts including: expensive silk carpets, gold and silver items, drinks, caviar and money. In Baku, a common gift is 2 kg of caviar. According to the ESI, outside of PACE, there is no doubt about the situation with democracy in Azerbaijan, which is characterized as semi-authoritarian even by its biggest supporters. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there were no opposition parties elected to the Azerbaijani parliament in 2010, the head of the PACE mission stated that the elections corresponded to international standards. According to the ESI, this can be explained only by “caviar diplomacy”.
The ESI cited an example of PACE discussions in its report, when Azerbaijan was publicly supported by its frequent visitors – British Liberal Democrat Michael Hancock and former Foreign Minister of Estonia Cristina Oyuland, who, despite the obvious regression in human rights situation in Azerbaijan, the lack of free elections, as well as criticism from international human rights organizations, stated that there are no serious problems in Azerbaijan. The ESI also added to the list of “friends of Azerbaijan” the Belgian [[Paul Vitte]], {{ill|Eduard Lintner|de}} from Bavaria, [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] from Turkey, [[Robert Walter (politician)|Robert Walter]] from Britain, and a number of Russian representatives.&lt;ref name="ESI_Caviar" /&gt;

During the 2008 presidential elections, PACE observers included a large group of frankly pro-Azerbaijani MPs. The variant of the statement on elections, prepared by the head of the group of observers Andreas Herkel, containing critical remarks, faced the rejection of the pro-Azerbaijani group consisting of Michael Hancock, Eduard Lintner and Paul Ville. Herkel was forced to declare his resignation if criticism did not go into the statement. During the referendum, which lifted the limits on the number of presidential terms for Ilham Aliyev, four PACE deputies – Eduard Litner, Paul Ville, Khaki Keskin and Pedro Agramunt evaluated the referendum as the progress of democracy.&lt;ref name="ESI_Caviar" /&gt;

In addition to PACE representatives, observers from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE (ODIHR) who have extensive experience of such observations, which revealed numerous violations of the procedure, which exclude the possibility of choice, were also present at the 2010 parliamentary elections. During the meetings of European observers, attended by PACE representatives in the person of Paul Ville and Pole Tadeusz Ivinski, the head of ODIHR observers, Audrey Glover from Great Britain, noted numerous violations that were not contested by PACE representatives. Nevertheless, the preliminary result of PACE monitoring, presented by Paul Ville, noted the compliance of preparations for elections with international standards, as well as transparent and effective work of the organizers. During the election, ODIHR observers recorded multiple violations and unprecedented ballot stuffing. By the closing of polling stations, the elections were assessed by the ODIHR as probably the most fraudulent they monitored. However, speaking on Azerbaijani television, Paul Ville stated that the elections were democratic and that he did not know about any violations. The ODIHR, in turn, subjected the elections to sharp criticism.

When asked if bribes were given to observers, Glover replied that she had not personally received it. After returning from Baku, representative of the PACE group Wolfgang Grosruck accused Audrey Glovek of being “unreliable”, unprofessional, and also of not speaking out in defense of PACE representatives when the questions about bribes were asked. The ODIHR report published in January 2011 contained extremely critical assessments of the 2010 elections.&lt;ref name="ESI_Caviar" /&gt;

== 2013 Presidential elections ==
On October 9, 2013, Ilham Aliyev was elected Azerbaijan’s president for the third time. Observers from the OSCE / ODIHR, led by Tana de Zulueta, spoke of restrictions on freedom of speech during elections, while representatives of the European Parliament headed by Pino Arlacchi confirmed free and fair elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioazadlyg.ru/content/article/25132555.html Наблюдательная миссия ОБСЕ подвергла резкой критике выборы] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185549/http://www.radioazadlyg.ru/content/article/25132555.html# |date=2016-03-04 }} // RFE/RL, 10.10.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament and PACE issued a joint statement in which they highly appraised the elections. A group of observers from the US House of Representatives also acknowledged fair elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Azerbaijan/Love-Aliyev-love-Aliyev-not-143007 Love Aliyev, love Aliyev not] // Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso, 17 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Varying estimates of the elections led to a scandal. On October 11, the representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton and European Commissioner Stefan Fule, ignored the assessment of the European Parliament, including in its statement the results of the ODIHR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/polit/1718628.html Кэтрин Эштон и Штефан Фюле раскритиковали президентские выборы в Азербайджане] // Регнум, 11 Октября 2013 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160109013652/http://regnum.ru/news/polit/1718628.html копия])&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission on Foreign Relations of the EU discussed the report of Arlacchi. During the discussion, representatives of the “green” condemned the report and said that it discredited the European Parliament. The head of the Socialists’ faction in the EU said that the PACE report cannot be considered reliable at all. It later emerged that a number of EU representatives traveled to Azerbaijan unofficially and on the dime of Azerbaijani organizations, which was regarded by the “European Voice” as “stupidity or corruption”, these trips were labeled “electoral tourism”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/meps-must-explain-trips-to-azerbaijan/ MEPs must explain trips to Azerbaijan] // EUROPEAN VOICE, 10/16/13 ([https://web.archive.org/save/http://www.politico.eu/article/meps-must-explain-trips-to-azerbaijan/ копия])&lt;/ref&gt;

The US State Department in its turn discredited the observers from the House of Representatives, describing the elections as not meeting international standards, and expressing solidarity with the ODIHR's assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/10/215283.htm Azerbaijan Presidential Election (Press Statement)] // U.S. Department of State, October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== The turning point ==
In 2015, during the discussion of the resolution on political prisoners in the European Parliament, the text written by the pro-Azerbaijani rapporteurs initially contained almost no criticism, but as a result, a resolution was adopted calling for Azerbaijan to stop repression of human rights defenders, revising the law on non-governmental organizations, not putting pressure on journalists and there was also a threat of sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=21953&amp;lang=en The functioning of democratic institutions in Azerbaijan] // Parliamentary Assembly, Resolution 2062 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German deputy Frank Schwab, this was a turning point for Azerbaijan's “caviar diplomacy”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/agenda/der-europarat-und-aserbaidschan-abschied-von-der-kaviardiplomatie/11981014.html Abschied von der «Kaviardiplomatie»?] // Der Tagesspiegel, 02.07.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2015, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which Azerbaijan was condemned for “unprecedented repression”. The resolution also called on the European authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of allegations of corruption against President Aliyev and his family members, and to consider imposing targeted sanctions against officials related to the persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/75116 EU and Azerbaijan: Breaking Up or Muddling Through?] // Eurasianet, September 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation of the Italian prosecutor's office and in PACE ==
In June 2016, the Milan prosecutor's office brought charges of corruption and money laundering to Luca Volonte, the former head of the European People's Party faction in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. According to the Prosecutor's Office Volonte received €2.39 million for the support of Azerbaijani officials. Volonte’s lawyers called these accusations absolutely groundless. According to the second ESI report – “Caviar Diplomacy. Part 2”, published in December 2016, Volonte agreed to cooperate with the investigation and named many European politicians who have been lobbying for the interests of the Azerbaijani authorities. During the interrogations Volonte confirmed receiving €2.39 million for lobbying in favor of Azerbaijan. According to the ESI, the money went to bribing Italian and other politicians who voted against PACE resolutions and reports condemning human rights violations in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="kavkaz-uzel"&gt;[http://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/294691/ Оппозиция потребовала от властей Азербайджана реакции на доклад о подкупе депутатов ПАСЕ] // Кавказский узел, 21 декабря 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary film shown on Italian television, Volonte also confirmed the receipt of €2.39 million, arguing that this money was transferred from a member of the Azerbaijani delegation to PACE Elkhan Suleymanov for consultations on agriculture. Payments to Volonte went through four British companies, which, according to “The Guardian”, did not conduct any operations in Britain and probably are front companies.&lt;ref name="Guardian31December"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/31/bribery-claims-azerbaijan-pipeline UK companies ‘linked to Azerbaijan pipeline bribery scandal’] // The Guardian, 31 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milan prosecutor's office accused Volonte of two episodes: money laundering and accepting bribes. The court of Milan, having considered the second charge, recognized Volonte's immunity for this episode, as according to the Italian constitution, a deputy cannot be prosecuted for his professional activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/05/22/parlamentare-che-si-vende-una-legge-non-processabile-la-sentenza-i-suoi-atti-sono-insindacabili-dibattimento-inutile/3605608/ Parlamentare che si vende una legge? Non processabile. La sentenza: «I suoi atti sono insindacabili, dibattimento inutile»] // Il fatto quotidiano, 22 maggio 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Supreme Court of Italy reversed this decision and returned the case to the Milan Court, citing the fact that the article of the Constitution is not about using his or her position for personal enrichment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/07/24/corruzione-immunita-parlamentare-non-preclude-perseguibilita-la-cassazione-annulla-proscioglimento-volonte/3751620/ Corruzione, «immunità parlamentare non preclude perseguibilità». La Cassazione annulla proscioglimento Volontè] // Il fatto quotidiano, 24 luglio 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-ambassador of Azerbaijan to the European Union Arif Mammadov told “The Guardian” that he spent about 30 million euros for the services of lobbyists as representative of the Azerbaijani delegation to the Council of Europe: “All members of the Azerbaijani delegation knew about this figure, although it never appeared anywhere. It was said, that the money is intended for bribing members of other delegations and the PACE as a whole.” A number of PACE deputies said that they knew about proposals to bribe the European deputies.&lt;ref name="theguardian_20_04_2017"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/20/council-of-europe-urged-to-investigate-azerbaijan-bribery-allegations Fresh claims of Azerbaijan vote-rigging at European human rights body] // The Guardian, 20/04/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkhan Suleymanov, the representative of Azerbaijan in PACE, is called the “curator” of Volonte and other European deputies. The European press cites examples of how Volonte recalled his requests to the PACE, informing Suleymanov that “your every word is an order for me”. Through the company, from which Volonte received his payments, in total of about one billion euros were conducted. Attempts by Armenian MEPs to raise the issue of corruption in PACE came up against the opposition of PACE President Pedro Agramunt, another subject of investigation of the “caviar diplomacy”, who deprived them of their voice and prevented the investigation. Der Tagesspiegel qualifies this investigation as “the biggest scandal in the history of Europe”. After the publication in the media, Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, called on Agramut to personally provide an independent external investigative body without any further delay. Agramunt and the leaders of the five political groups rejected the proposals of the CoE official Wojciech Sawicki, which sets out the conditions for an independent investigation. However, after the visit of Agramunt to Syria, the PACE Bureau expressed to him a vote of no confidence and in fact removed Agramunt from real power,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6623&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=13 PACE Bureau declares ‘no confidence’ in Pedro Agramunt as President] // Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, 28/04/2017&lt;/ref&gt; after which in April 2017 the Parliamentary Assembly formed a commission to investigate alleged corruption accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/ru/совет-европы-расследует-возможный-подкуп-парламентариев-азербайджаном/a-38571944?maca=rus-yandex_new_politics_mm-9641-xml Совет Европы расследует возможный подкуп парламентариев Азербайджаном] // DW, 24.04.2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/agenda/korruptionsvorwuerfe-im-europarat-die-spur-des-geldes/19544662.html Die Spur des Geldes] // Der Tagesspiegel, 22.03.2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian_20_04_2017" /&gt; Its report has been published in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Communication/IBAC/IBAC-GIAC-Report-EN.pdf Report of the Independent Investigation Body on the allegations of corruption within the Parliamentary Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Maltese press published documents according to which the top politicians of Malta and the wife of Prime Minister [[Joseph Muscat]] received millions of dollars from a bank controlled by [[Ilham Aliyev]]'s daughter Leila. According to the editorial investigation, Joseph Muscat made a trip to Baku in 2015, after which he called on Europe to give an objective assessment of the positive processes in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/83401 Azerbaijan’s First Family Accused in Maltese Corruption Scandal] // Eurasianet, May 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Compitalia''' ([[Latin]]: '''''[[Ludi]] Compitalicii''''') was a [[Religious festival#Ancient Roman religious festivals|festival]] celebrated once a year in honor of the [[Lares|Lares Compitales]], [[household deity|household deities]] of the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]], to whom sacrifices were offered at the places where two or more ways meet.&lt;ref&gt;"Compita", [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''De lingua latina libri XXV'', ed. Müller; Festus, s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the Latin ''compitum'', a cross-way.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Compital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This festival is more ancient than the building of [[Rome]].{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} It is said by some writers to have been instituted by [[Tarquinius Priscus]] in consequence of the miracle attending the birth of [[Servius Tullius]], who was supposed to be the son of a [[Lares Familiares|Lar Familiaris]], or family guardian deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', xxxvi.70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] says&lt;ref name="Roman Antiquities, iv.14"&gt;''Roman Antiquities'', iv.14&lt;/ref&gt; that Servius Tullius founded the festival, which he describes as it was celebrated in his time. Dionysius relates that the sacrifices consisted of [[honey]]-cakes (''{{lang|grc|πέλανοι}}'') presented by the inhabitants of each house; and that the people who assisted as ministering servants at the festival were not free men, but slaves, because the Lares took pleasure in the service of slaves. He further adds that the Compitalia were celebrated a few days after the [[Saturnalia]] with great splendor, and that the slaves on this occasion had full liberty to do as they pleased.

During the celebration of the festival, each family placed the statue of the [[Mania (mythology)|underworld goddess Mania]] at the door of their house. They also hung up at their doors figures of wool representing men and women, accompanying them with humble requests that the Lares and Mania would be contented with those figures, and spare the people of the house. Slaves offered balls or fleeces of wool instead of human figures.&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia, vol 1, p 288"&gt;''Cyclopaedia'', vol 1, p 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Saturnalia'' i.7&lt;/ref&gt; says that the celebration of the Compitalia was restored by the Etruscan king [[Tarquinius Superbus]] in response to an [[oracle]] that "they should sacrifice heads (''capita'') for heads." The oracle was taken to mean that in order to maintain the health and prosperity of each family, children should be sacrificed to Mania, identified in this case as the mother of the Lares. But [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]], after overthrowing the line of Tarquin kings, instead satisfied the oracle by exploiting a verbal loophole, substituting "heads" of garlic and poppies.&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia, vol 1, p 288"/&gt;

[[Image:Compitalia fresco.jpg|thumb|275px|A rare [[fresco]] from a building near [[Pompeii]], depicting Roman men in ''togae praetextae'' with dark red borders and probably participating in the '''Compitalia''']]
The people who presided over the festival were ''magistri vici'' ("neighborhood officers") and on that occasion were allowed to wear the ''[[toga praetexta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asconius, ''ad Cic. in Pis.'' p7, ed. [[Johann Caspar von Orelli|Orelli]]&lt;/ref&gt; Public games were added to the festival during the [[Roman Republic|Republican period]], but they were suppressed by command of the [[Roman Senate|senate]] in 68 BCE.  [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Calpurnius Piso]] was charged by [[Cicero]] with violating the decree by allowing the games to be celebrated during his [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 58.&lt;ref&gt;''In Pisonem''. 4; Ascon. l.c.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival itself still continued to be observed, even if the games were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Atticum'', ii.3&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Caesar's civil war|civil wars of the 40s]], the festival fell into disuse, and was accordingly restored during the program of religious reforms carried out by [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Augustus'', 31; comp. [[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', v.128-148&lt;/ref&gt; As Augustus was now the ''[[pater patriae]]'', the worship of the old Lares was discontinued, and the Lares of the emperor consequently became the Lares of the state. Augustus set up Lares or [[penates]] at places where two or more ways met&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholium|Scholiast]] on [[Horace]], ''ad Sat.'' ii.3.261&lt;/ref&gt; and instituted an order of priests to attend to their worship. These priests were chosen from the ''[[freedman|libertini]]'', people who had been legally freed from slavery, and were called [[Augustales]].&lt;ref&gt;These Augustales are not the same as the Augustales appointed to attend to the worship of Augustus after his death, according to [[August Wilhelm Zumpt|A.W. Zumpt]], ''De Augustalibus et Seviris Augustalibus commentatio epigraphica'', Berol. 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compitalia belonged to the ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', that is, festivals which were celebrated on days appointed annually by the [[Roman magistrates|magistrates]] or priests. The exact day on which this festival was celebrated appears to have varied, though it was always in the winter, at least in the time of [[Varro]], as observed by [[Isaac Casaubon]].&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia, vol 1, p 288"/&gt; Dionysius again relates&lt;ref name="Roman Antiquities, iv.14"/&gt; that it was celebrated a few days after the Saturnalia, and Cicero&lt;ref&gt;''In Pisonem''. 4&lt;/ref&gt; that it fell on the [[Kalends]] of January; but in one of his letters to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epistulae ad Atticum]]'', vii.7&lt;/ref&gt; he speaks of it as occurring on the fourth before the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] of January, that is, January 2.&lt;ref&gt;The Nones are on the 5th of January, and including that day when counting backwards gives a date of January 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact words with which the festival was announced are preserved by Macrobius&lt;ref&gt;''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#4.27 i.4.27]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aulus Gellius]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/gellius10.html#24 x.24]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Die noni popolo romano quiritibus compitalia erunt''.}}

Suetonius writes that Augustus ordered the Lares Compitales crowned twice yearly with spring and summer flowers ("Compitales Lares ornari bis anno instituit vernis floribus et aestivis").&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo012.perseus-lat1:31.4 ''Augustus'' 31.4 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lott2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

The '''December 2012 Lesbos, Greece migrant boat disaster''' occurred in the early hours of December 14, 2012, off [[Greece|Greek]] island [[Lesbos]] in the northeastern [[Aegean Sea]] when a boat carrying illegal immigrants, which set sail from [[Turkey]], sank. At least 18 people died by the incident, eight were missing and one man was rescued by the Greek harbor police.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article112041148/Mindestens-18-Menschen-vor-Griechenland-ertrunken.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |title=Mindestens 18 Menschen vor Griechenland ertrunken |date=2012-12-15 |language=German |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/planet/22165027.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Ege’de göçmen dramı: 18 ölü |author=Kırbaki, Yorgo  |date=2012-12-15 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="u"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ubalert.com/s84 |publisher=Disaster Alert Network |title=

According to the report of local authorities, 18 dead bodies were found stranded at the coast of [[Loutropoli Thermis|Thermis]] west of the island. The survivor, a man of age 20, stated that a total of 28 people of [[Iraq]]i nationality, including children, were aboard a small boat, which departed from the Turkish coast shortly after midnight on Thursday. After about one hour of sailing, the boat capsized due to bad weather conditions about {{convert|2.2|nmi|km|abbr=on}} before the Greek coast.

The '''economic impact of immigration''' is an important topic in [[Canada]]. While the immigration rate has dropped sharply from its peak early in the 20th century, Canada is still among the countries in the world that accept most immigrants per capita.

The per capital immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada. However, over the last 25 years the economic position of newcomers to Canada relative to the native population has steadily declined. A 2007 [[Statistics Canada]] study shows that the income profile of recent immigrant families deteriorated by a significant amount from 2000 to 2004.&lt;ref name=PicotHouUpdated&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2007294-eng.pdf Chronic Low Income and Low-income Dynamics Among Recent Immigrants], [[Statistics Canada]], January 2007, URL accessed 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Recent immigrants themselves are far more likely than native born Canadians to initially have low incomes, with income and employment rates increasing towards the national average with more time spent in Canada. 

==Overview==

===Immigration to Canada===
{{Main|Immigration to Canada}}
According to the CIA World Factbook, (2017), Canada has one of the  highest migration rates in the world.&lt;ref name=CIP&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2112rank.html Country Comparison :: Net Migration (2017)], The CIA World Factbook, URL accessed 12 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Canada is also unusual among western nations in the widespread popular support for high rates of immigration, and in recent years support for immigration has increased in Canada.&lt;ref name="Canadians support diversity and immigrants;"&gt;  Michael Adams. The Windsor Star. Windsor, Ont.: 28 November 2007. p. A.8.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Canada's major political parties support either sustaining or increasing the current level of immigration.&lt;ref name="HollifieldMartin2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hollifield|author2=Philip Martin|author3=Pia Orrenius|title=Controlling Immigration: A Global Perspective, Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys9jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2014|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-8627-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic rationale for immigration===
[[Image:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Donald Alexander Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Alexander Smith]], a migrant from [[Scotland]], drives the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]]. [[Immigration|Migrants]] to [[Canada]] at that time were [[British subjects]] (not [[Canadian citizens]]).]]
There is no agreed view on the net impact of immigration in current times. Historically, Canada's unusually high immigration rates can be traced to the nation's unique economy. One factor is that Canada has one of the world's largest supplies of natural resources such as oil, metals, and lumber. It also has a sparse population spread over a vast landscape. Canada has thus faced acute labour shortages and has responded by actively searching for immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Iain, ''A Geography of the Canadian Economy.'' Don Mills: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century this included bringing Chinese migrants to build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and actively advertising in Europe to find farmers with the [[Last Best West]] campaign. Today similar recruitment efforts are needed to staff the oil sands projects in Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;Scotton, Geoffrey. "Alberta worker shortfall could hit 350,000 by 2025." ''Calgary Herald.'' Calgary, Alta.: 11 April 2006. p. D.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jewish market day, Kensington Avenue, 1924.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Toronto's Jewish market in 1924. In that era the Jewish community, largely composed of recent immigrants, was concentrated in the impoverished area known as [[The Ward, Toronto|The Ward]].]]

Another factor that contributes to the immigration question is Canada's low birth rate (10.3 births per 1000 people). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2054.html#ca Field Listing :: Birth Rate (2017)] The CIA World Factbook, URL accessed 12 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that new residents can assist in meeting future government obligations relating to pay-as-you-go liabilities.

The economic dangers of [[population decline]] are not universally accepted. Organizations like the [[Fraser Institute]] question whether a declining population would reduce or increase per capita income, noting that in the short term, with a stable economy, fewer people would increase the per capita income simply because you divide the income among fewer people.  The study's authors conducted a series of studies using large amounts of census data (844,476 individuals) and conclude that immigrants who arrived from 1987–2004 paid only 57% of the taxes paid by average Canadian in 2006, with the effect that taxes from immigrants do not exceed the government expenses relating to them (a gap of $23 billion annually according to their numbers).&lt;ref name=FI&gt;[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/immigration-and-the-canadian-welfare-state-2011.pdf Immigration and the Welfare State 2011], Herbert Grubel and Patrick Grady, [[Fraser Institute]], May 2011, URL accessed 18 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  A study by the [[C. D. Howe Institute]] suggests that immigration cannot keep Canada's population young and could possibly contribute to [[population ageing]] in the near term.&lt;ref name=CDyoung&gt;[http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/backgrounder_96.pdf No Elixir of Youth: Immigration Cannot Keep Canada Young] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023246/http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/backgrounder_96.pdf |date=14 April 2008 }}, Backgrounder, [[C. D. Howe Institute]], Number 96, September 2006, URL accessed 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Employment statistics also bring into question whether skilled worker immigrants, with a 34% unemployment rate,&lt;ref name=StatCan1&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-614-x/2005001/t/4079148-eng.htm Immigrants' labour force rates, by immigration category, 2001], [[Statistics Canada]], URL accessed 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; are successfully meeting existing labour market needs in Canada. Many developed nations have much lower fertility rates than Canada but have not embraced immigration.

The first detailed analysis of Canadian immigration policy came from the [[Economic Council of Canada]]; it called for immigration to be increased to eventually bring Canada's population to 100 million. While it found that the economic benefits to Canada of immigration were fairly small, noting that "a historical perspective gives little or no support to the view that immigration is needed for national prosperity", it also concluded that the benefits to the newcomers themselves were extremely large. The report concluded that "it would be hard not to recommend an increase when immigrants can gain so much and Canadians not only do not lose but actually make slight economic gains".&lt;ref name="EconCouncil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogben, David. "Wanted: 100 million people to make Canada efficient." ''The Vancouver Sun.'' Vancouver, B.C.: 21 February 1991. p. E.1&lt;/ref&gt;
==Immigrant well being==

===Education levels===
The Canadian system puts great emphasis on finding skilled immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;George, Usha. "Immigration and Refugee Policy in Canada." ''Canadian Social Policy: Issues and Perspectives.'' ed. Anne Westhues.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants to Canada are more skilled than immigrants to the United States. [[George J. Borjas]] compared immigrants to Canada and the United States finding those to Canada being better educated and receiving higher wages once settled. He accredits this to Canada's points based immigration system, and argues for the United States to more closely emulate the Canadian method.&lt;ref&gt;Brojas, George J. ''Heaven's Door: Immigration Policy and the American Economy.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Canadian economy, immigrants are mostly found at the highest education levels. In Canada, 38% of male workers with a [[post-graduate degree]] are immigrants to the country.&lt;ref name="Bryan, Jay 2007. pg. C"&gt;Bryan, Jay. "Newcomers improve pay equality in Canada;" ''The Gazette.'' Montreal, Que.: 26 May 2007. p. C.1.BRE&lt;/ref&gt; 23% of Canadians are foreign born, but 49% of doctorate holders and 40% of those with a master's degree were born outside Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Meagan. "Majority of recent immigrants to Canada have degree." ''[[National Post]].'' Tuesday, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A persistent problem for skilled immigrants is the recognition of foreign credentials. Data from Statistics Canada reports that only 72.2% of new immigrants (landed within 5 years) between the ages of 25 and 54 that possess a university degree are employed. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410008701&amp;pickMembers%5B0%5D=2.3&amp;pickMembers%5B1%5D=4.8&amp;pickMembers%5B2%5D=5.1&amp;pickMembers%5B3%5D=6.2 Labour force characteristics of immigrants by educational attainment, annual], accessed 12 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; While Canada recruits people to come based on their degrees, many newcomers arrive to find employers and professional organizations not recognizing their foreign education.&lt;ref name=credentials&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070218/layton_credentials_070218/20070218?hub=CTVNewsAt11 NDP calls for recognition of foreign credentials] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204145421/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070218/layton_credentials_070218/20070218?hub=CTVNewsAt11 |date=4 February 2008 }}, [[CTV News]], URL accessed 23 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As the percentage of skilled newcomers as a share of total migrants has increased, so has this problem. A study done by the [[IZA Journal of Migration]], found that between 1991 and 2006, Canadian-educated immigrants and Foreign-educated immigrants, found that Canadian-educated immigrants who graduated from university had a large earnings gap with their Canadian-born counterparts both in the initial years after immigration and in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[Feng Hou and Yuqian Lu https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40176-017-0091-5.pdf International students, immigration and earnings growth: the effect of a pre-immigration host-country university education] accessed 14 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that this outcome was likely due to lack of Canadian work experience and deficiencies in their social networks and language abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[Feng Hou and Yuqian Lu https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40176-017-0091-5.pdf International students, immigration and earnings growth: the effect of a pre-immigration host-country university education] accessed 14 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The setting of standards for, or recognition of, almost all professional credentials does not fall within the federal government's control and are therefore not determined by either federal laws or [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] policies,&lt;ref name=NotFed&gt;[http://winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2007/02/20/3647264-sun.html Immigrants' creds not up to feds:PM], [[Winnipeg Sun]], 20 February 2007, URL accessed 24 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but Citizenship and Immigration Canada established the Foreign Credentials Referral Office to provide something like a directory assistance service for immigrants.&lt;ref name=credsoffice&gt;[http://www.credentials.gc.ca/ Foreign Credentials Referral Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501162234/http://www.credentials.gc.ca/ |date=1 May 2011 }}, Part of [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of [[Ontario]] enacted the ''[[Fair Access to Regulated Professions Act]], 2006'' to help immigrants qualify for 34 provincially regulated professions.&lt;ref name=ONfair&gt;[http://www.citizenship.gov.on.ca/english/working/farpa/ Fair Access to Regulated Professions Act, 2006], [[Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration (Ontario)]], URL accessed 23 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also established the position of [[Fairness Commissioner (Ontario)]].  In 2007, the Government of [[Alberta]] signed an agreement with federal government that will accelerate the process of foreign credential recognition for new immigrants by licensing bodies in that province.&lt;ref name=CBCalberta&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/05/11/immigration-alberta.html Alberta signs immigration deal with Ottawa], [[CBC News]], URL accessed 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other provinces have made similar commitments.

===Wages===
In terms of the impact of immigration to economy-wide wage levels, Statistics Canada estimates that for every 10% increase in the population from immigration, wages in Canada are now reduced by 4% on average (with the greatest impact to more skilled workers, such as workers with post-graduate degrees whose wages are reduced by 7%).&lt;ref name=wagelevels&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-001-x/89-001-x2007001-eng.pdf The Impact of Immigration on Labour Markets in Canada, Mexico, and the United States], [[Statistics Canada]], Update on Family and Labour Studies, May 2007, URL Accessed 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because of the credential issue, many immigrants are forced to find work below their education level and at lower wages. However, even for doing work of the same skill level, immigrants are much less well compensated than their native born counterparts. Immigration scholar Jeffrey Reitz calculated that in 2001 native Canadian employers were benefiting from, and immigrant employees were losing out on, between $2 and 3 billion per year due to this imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, Jeffrey. "Immigrant Skill Utilization in the Canadian Labour Market: Implications of Human Capital Research," Journal of International Migration and Integration 2.3 (2001): 347–78&lt;/ref&gt; A study published by Statistics Canada reviewed data from 1991 to 2010 regarding the convergence of wages between immigrants and native-born Canadians. The study found that there was a convergence of relative earnings for immigrants. Immigrant men's average annual wages were 86% of those of native-born men in 2010, up from 76% in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-626-x/11-626-x2013032-eng.htm Twenty Years in the Careers of Immigrant and Native-born Workers] accessed 15 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of possible explanations for why newcomers earn less than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the [[labour productivity]] of immigrants is lower, and employers thus have reason to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to offer the same salary as to a native.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamur, Alice. "The Potential Impacts of Immigration on Productivity in Canada" ''Canada's Immigration Policy for the 21st Century'' edited by Charles M. Beach, Alan G. Green and Jeffrey G. Reitz, John Deutsch Institute: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than native-born Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than native-born Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than native-born Canadians.

===Employment===
Unemployment tends to be very high for recent immigrants, compared to more established immigrants (lived in Canada between 5 to 10 years). Established immigrants tend to have an unemployment rate closer to the national unemployment rate of native-born citizens. In 2011, the unemployment rate of recently arrived immigrants  was 13.6%, considerably above the native Canadian average of 5.5%. For more established immigrants, the rate fell to 8.2%&lt;ref&gt;[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-606-x/2012006/t043-eng.htm Labour market outcomes of immigrants aged 25 to 54, by period of landing, Canada — 2010-2011, URL accessed 12 October 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;For clarity: Employment Rate = Participation Rate * (1 – Unemployment Rate)&lt;/small&gt;

===Income===
Higher rates of unemployment and lower wages combine to give newcomers less income than the Canadian average. An analysis of Longitudinal Immigration Database by Statistics Canada showed that immigrants who landed in 2014, had a median income of $24,000 in 2015, compared to an income of $36,000 for native-born Canadians. The median income for new immigrants in 2015 was the highest ever recorded and $2,000 more than the median income of new immigrants in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171127/dq171127a-eng.htm Income and mobility of immigrants, 2015] accessed 15 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In previous decades, immigrant income levels did rise to the national average after 10 years, but in recent years the situation has deteriorated. A 2003 study published by [[Statistics Canada]] noted that "in 1980 recent immigrants had low-income rates 1.4 times that of Canadian born, by 2000 they were 2.5 times higher, at 35.8%."&lt;ref name=PicotHou&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2003198-eng.pdf The rise in low-income rates among immigrants in Canada], Analytical Studies Branch research paper series, [[Statistics Canada]], June 2003, URL accessed 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that the deterioration was widespread and affected most types of immigrants.  The 2003 study explains that the low-income rate among non-immigrants declined in the 1990s, but this was more than offset by the income profile of new immigrants, resulting in a net rise in Canada's total low-income rate.  An updated January 2007 study by Statistics Canada, explains that the deterioration continued into the next decade, with the low-income rate of recent immigrants reaching rates of 3.5 times that of Canadian born in 2002 and 2003, before edging back to 3.2 times in 2004.&lt;ref name="PicotHouUpdated"/&gt; The 2007 study explains that this deterioration has occurred even though Canada implemented changes in 1993 to encourage more highly educated immigrants, with 45% of new immigrants having university degrees as of 2004.

In 1991 the [[Economic Council of Canada]] found that periods of immigration were not directly linked to periods of high growth. They noted that "a historical perspective gives little or no support to the view that immigration is needed for economic prosperity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the fastest growth in per capita real incomes occurred at times when net immigration was nil or negative. Later in the 20th century, the opposite linkage is seen but, clearly, there is no long-term correlation." However, the same report found that a high rate of immigration was good for Canada's future, and recommended expanding immigration rates to bring Canada's population to 100 million.&lt;ref name=EconCouncil&gt;Economic Council of Canada (1991), Economic and Social Impacts of Immigration (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; A [[University of Montreal]] study published in 2002 by professor Marc Termote used different methods and studied different countries and concluded that immigration has no statistically significant impact to the per capita income of a country.&lt;ref name=UOM&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/cqd/2002/v31/n1/000423ar.html La mesure de l’impact économique de l’immigration internationale.

===Decline in economic well being===
Over the last 25 years the economic position of newcomers to Canada relative to the native population has steadily declined. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain these issues.
# The selection process is flawed;&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;
# Government and corporate policies deliberately shift immigrants to secondary sector occupations. These are jobs characterized by high instability, hazardous work environments, and low pay. Inherently those involved in these sectors will have lower wages and more periods of unemployment. In several European countries the immigration system is almost fully designed to try to fill these positions. This is less the case in Canada, but significant recruitment programs for sectors such as agriculture and oil and gas recruit many workers to perilous jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kazemipur |first1=Abdolmohammed |last2=Shiva |first2=S. |title=Halli Immigrants and 'New Poverty': The Case of Canada |journal=International Migration Review |issue=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2007 study by Statistics Canada analyzed the drop in income of economic immigrants from several perspectives.&lt;ref name="PicotHouUpdated"/&gt;  Economic immigrants are now more likely to begin their stay in Canada with a "low-income" (less than 50% of the median income) than an immigrant in any of the other immigration classes (see Table 16 in the study). This drop occurred during the 1990s and early 2000s despite the percentage of immigrants arriving with degrees in the economic class (including principal applicants, spouses, and dependents) rising from 29% in 1992 to 56% in 2003.

Stating an intention to reduce a backlog of immigration applicants of all classes, and to better target the required skills needed in Canada, the federal government passed a law in 2008 that gave the immigration minister new powers to alter immigrant selection.  Many expected that these powers would be used to favour workers in skilled trades over immigrants selected on the basis of education through the points system.&lt;ref name=BusinessApplaud&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080328.IMMIGRATION28/TPStory/National |title=Businesses applaud proposed immigration law|work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=28 March 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the well being of immigrants has declined in recent years, this has not affected second generation immigrants, or those who came to Canada as a child. This group is one of the most successful in Canada, with education and earning levels well above that of their parents and also above the Canadian average.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Monica and Elizabeth M. Grieco "Triumphant Transitions: Socioeconomic Achievements of the Second Generation in Canada." ''International Migration Review,'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long term outcomes===
One of the most important studies of the economic impact of immigration to Canada is [[Morton Beiser]]'s ''Strangers at the Gate.'' This study looked at the arrival of the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[boat people]] who began to arrive in Canada in 1979 to much controversy. The total number of refugees was 60,000, the largest single group of refugees to ever arrive in Canada. Beiser first studied the boat people upon their arrival, finding that few spoke English or French, that most were farmers with few skills useful in Canada, and that they had arrived with no assets with which to establish themselves. Beiser then followed the progress of the boat people to see what effect they would have on Canada. Within ten years of arrival the boat people had an unemployment rate 2.3% lower than the Canadian average. One in five had started a business, 99% had successfully applied to become Canadian citizens, and they were considerably less likely than average to receive some form of social assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, Martin. ''Strangers at the Gate: The "Boat People's" First Ten Years in Canada''Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarick, Lila. "Vietnam boat people prospering, study finds Public perception of refugees as drain on society is false, researcher says." ''The Globe and Mail.'' Toronto, Ont.: 27 September 1994. p. A.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government and social assistance===
The government has a large department and a number of programs to try to ensure the well being of immigrants to Canada, and ameliorate their economic condition.
The [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] department employs 5,000 staff,&lt;ref name=CIC5000&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060524110432/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/brochure/service.html About the Department], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 25 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which on a per capita basis is 3 times more than the 15,000 [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] employees. Citizenship and Immigration Canada recoups some of its department costs through landing fees.  In 2006, the Canadian government reduced the landing fee per immigrant by 50%.&lt;ref name=PMCUTFEE&gt;[http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1159 Promoting opportunity for new Canadians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914141044/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1159 |date=14 September 2006 }}, [[Prime Minister of Canada]] website, 12 May 2006, URL accessed 25 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliamentary Budget Officer]] has reported that irregular migration, from the initial entry into Canada to the final decision from the Immigration and Refugee Board and/or Federal Court, as well as any deportations, cost the federal government $340 million in 2017-18, and is projected to rise to $396 million in 2019-20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

New immigrants are also entitled to settlement assistance such as free language training under provincial government administered programs usually called [[Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada]] (LINC), for which the federal government budgeted about $350 million to give to the provinces for the fiscal year 2006–2007.&lt;ref name=CIC307&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/press/06/0620-e.html Canada's New Government Delivers on $307 Million in Settlement Funding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114195548/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/press/06/0620-e.html |date=14 November 2006 }}, [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], 10 November 2006, URL accessed 25 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the $350 million was allocated to [[Quebec]] under the [[Canada-Quebec Accord]], at $196 million per year,&lt;ref name=BudgetVol1&gt;[http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/v1pa06-e.pdf Public Accounts of Canada, 2006, Volume I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128002914/http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/v1pa06-e.pdf |date=28 January 2007 }}, Summary Reports and Financial Statements, [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]], 19 September 2006, URL accessed 12 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; even though immigration to Quebec represented only 16.5% of all immigration to Canada in 2005.&lt;ref name=QuebecPcnt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/facts2006/facts2006_provinces.asp |title=Annual Immigration by Province |website=www.cic.gc.ca |publisher=[[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] |accessdate=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $350 million is budgeted to increase by an additional $90 million by 2009.&lt;ref name=Budget07&gt;[http://www.budget.gc.ca/2007/pdf/bp2007e.pdf The Budget Plan 2007], Page 219, [[Department of Finance (Canada)]], URL accessed 24 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial governments in Canada have established citizenship and immigration departments, such as the [[Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration (Ontario)]].

Support for immigrants was also one of the key issues that formed the basis of the New Deal for Cities between [[Toronto]] (and other urban centres), the Government of Ontario, and the Government of Canada,&lt;ref name=newdeal&gt;[http://www.canadascities.ca/newdealforcities.htm New Deal for Cities], ''Canada's Cities'', URL accessed 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; because 43% of new immigrants settle in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] resulting in certain challenges for that region.&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/Special/Canada2020/article/106702 |title=When immigration goes awry |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=5 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=space&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070730.wuniversities30/BNStory/National/home |title=Will there be space for your child? |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published by [[Statistics Canada]] noted that "Over the 1990s (1990 to 2000) the city's low-income rate rose 1.9 percentage points. All of this increase was associated with deteriorating outcomes among immigrants, which tended to increase the city's low-income rate by 2.8 percentage points."&lt;ref name="PicotHou"/&gt;  In other words, the low-income rate among non-immigrants fell, but the income profile of new immigrants resulted in a net widening of the [[income inequality]] gap in Toronto during the 1990s.

The needs of immigrants prompted the [[United Way of Canada|United Way]] of Greater Toronto, the largest United Way charity in Canada, to identify immigration services in Toronto as a top priority for their $100 million 2006 campaign to combat poverty and social exclusion.&lt;ref name=UW&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1125369681.html?dids=1125369681:1125369681&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+11%2C+2006&amp;author=Leslie+Ferenc&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.3&amp;desc=Campaign+starts+on+a+high Campaign starts on a high – Immigrant services again a top priority for United Way], [[Toronto Star]], 11 September 2006, URL accessed 11 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the ''Daily Bread Food Bank'' in Toronto reported that over 40% of its clients are foreign-born, and that almost half of that group had been in the country for less than 4 years.&lt;ref name=foodbanks&gt;[http://www.dailybread.ca/pdf/blueprint.pdf BLUEPRINT to fight hunger], Daily Bread Food Bank, 2006, URL accessed 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  While the less than 4 year group shows far above average need, the over 40% figure is in line with the general population as 44% of Torontonians are foreign-born.&lt;ref name=foreignborn&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3898795.stm Miami tops 'foreign-born' cities], [[BBC News]], 15 July 2004, URL accessed 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government finances===
There is no consensus on the net impact of immigration to government finances. A 1990 study found that an average immigrant household paid $22,528 in all forms of taxes and on average each household directly consumed $10,558 in government services. By contrast an average native Canadian household paid $20,259 in tax and consumed $10,102 dollars in services. Across the country this means that immigrant households contributed $2.6 billion more than their share to the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;Ather H. Akbari, "The Impact of Immigrants on Canada's Treasury, circa 1990," in Diminishing Returns, ed. Don J. DeVoretz, Policy Study 24 (C. D. Howe Institute, Laurier Institution, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 study found that over a lifetime a typical immigrant family will pay some forty thousand dollars more to the treasury than they will consume in services.&lt;ref&gt;"The Political Economy of Canadian Immigration Debate: A Crumbling Consensus?" ''RIIM Commentary Series'' #96-03, Simon  Fraser University. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations for this include that immigrant households tend to be larger, and have more wage earners, increasing taxes. Newcomers are also less likely to make use of many social services. Immigrants are less likely than native Canadians to receive [[employment insurance]], [[social assistance]], and [[subsidized housing]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Michael and Dwayne Benjamin "The Receipt of Transfer Payments by Immigrants to Canada." ''The Journal of Human Resources'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants are also much less likely to become homeless or suffer from mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto's white underbelly. Kate Hammer. The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ont.: 17 May 2008. pg. M.4&lt;/ref&gt; Recent immigrants are also less likely to make use of subsidized housing than native Canadians of the same income level. In 2004 22.5% of low-income native Canadians lived in subsidized housing, but only 20.4% of low income recent immigrants did so, though this number was considerably higher among more established immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/publications_resources/research/categories/inclusion/2007/sp_680_05_07_e/page12.shtml A Study of Poverty and Working Poverty among Recent Immigrants to Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a study from the [[Fraser Institute]] found that the immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004 cost governments $23 billion per [[annum]] (as of 2006) in excess of [[taxes]] raised from those immigrants, relating to universal social services (e.g., [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]], [[public education]]).&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;

===International trade===
The presence within Canada of people representative of many different cultures and nations has also been an important boost to Canada's international trade. Immigrants will often have expertise, linguistic skills, personal connections with their country of origin that can help forge international trade ties. Studies have found that Canada does have greater trade relations with those nations that have provided large numbers of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Head, John Ries "Immigration and Trade Creation: Econometric Evidence from Canada." The Canadian Journal of Economics Vol. 31, No. 1 (Feb. 1998), pp. 47–&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's economy is heavily centered on international trade, which accounted for 31.4% of GDP in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html North America :: Canada (2017)], The CIA World Factbook, URL accessed 12 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 76.4% of Canadian exports go to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html North America :: Canada (2017)], The CIA World Factbook, URL accessed 12 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been good for the source countries of immigrants to Canada. For many years, expanded markets for trade has been a common rationale and justification for high immigration from the developing world. Data from Statistics Canada in 2017 reveals&lt;ref&gt;http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cimt-cicm/home-accueil?lang=eng accessed on October 12 2018&lt;/ref&gt; that the trade balances with developing countries from which Canada receives most of its immigrants ameliorates. Current data, 2017, shows that only India has balanced trade with Canada:

'''[India]''':  Canada imports $4.158 billion, and exports $4.204 billion

'''[Pakistan]''':  Canada imports $401.826 million, and exports $733.060 million

'''[Philippines]''': Canada imports $1.392 billion, and exports $811.073 million

'''[China]''':  Canada imports $70.926 billion, and exports  $21.845 billion

'''[Iran]''':  Canada imports $88.482 million, and exports  $125.955 million

'''[Syria]''':  Canada imports $1.179 million, and exports $22.520 million

The '''Elephant Fayre''' was held in the stately home of [[Port Eliot]], [[St Germans, Cornwall|St Germans]]. A "[[fayre]]" in every sense of the word, it featured a host of different types of performances, media, experimental theatre and rock, punk, folk and reggae music. The first Fayre was tiny, attracting only 1500 or so, but the attendance increased over the years as the organisers booked better known acts, such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[The Cure]], and [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]. The organisers decided to close down the festival after 1986 because of [[hard and soft drugs|hard drug]] use and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/elephant_fayre_1981-86.html History of the Elephant Fayre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1980 a small festival which had outgrown its site at [[Polgooth]] in mid-Cornwall approached the Port Eliot estate and asked if it could be held in the idyllic grounds. The estate office agreed a price, and there began the Elephant Fayre, one of the most eclectic festivals of the 1980s, which was named after the elephant in the Eliot family’s crest. A  prime attraction of the event was a giant wooden elephant which could be mounted via an internal ladder. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/07/17/the-earl-of-st-germans--obituary/|title=The Earl of St Germans, founder of the Port Eliot Festival – obituary |publisher= The Telegraph|accessdate=23 February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The festival ran from 1981–1986, beginning with some 1,500 visitors over four days, and featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts. Over the years the festival grew, attracting crowds of up to 30,000 and bands such as [[The Cure]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. By 1986 the festival, like so many of the time, had become victim of its own success. The tolerance of the free festival culture of the 70s was over, as [[New Age Travellers]] became a focus for disorder across the country. Despite the tolerance of the then [[Peregrine Eliot, 10th Earl of St Germans|Lord Eliot]] and fellow festival benefactor [[Michael Eavis]] at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] (known affectionately in festival crew parlance as 'The Good Lord and The Worthy Farmer') the travellers put paid, it was said, to the Elephant Fayre and seriously compromised Glastonbury.

Whilst the festival at Port Eliot had built up a reputation as one of the best in the country, with extraordinary acts and the liberal attitude of the organisers, it was alleged the travellers had taken advantage and destroyed the festival. The burning down of the oldest tree in the park, looting of the village surgery and the robbing of stall-holders prompted Lord Eliot and fellow organisers to make the 1986 festival the last.

The Elephant Fayre has reinvented itself and is now the [[Port Eliot Festival]]. It describes itself as having "All the brains of a literary festival. All the soul of a music festival." It is held mid summer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">A '''failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action system''' (FRACAS) is a system, sometimes carried out using software, that provides a process for reporting, classifying, analyzing failures, and planning corrective actions in response to those failures. It is typically used in an industrial environment to collect data, record and analyze [[system]] [[failure]]s. A FRACAS system may attempt to manage multiple failure reports and produces a history of failure and corrective actions.
FRACAS records the problems related to a product or process and their associated root causes and failure analyses to assist in identifying and implementing corrective actions.

The FRACAS method&lt;ref&gt;[http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=207200 MIL-HDBK-2155 at ASSIST]&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by the US Govt. and first introduced for use by the US Navy and all department of defense agencies in 1985. The FRACAS process is a closed loop with the following steps:&lt;br /&gt;
# Failure Reporting (FR). The failures and the faults related to a system, an equipment, a software or a process are formally reported through a standard form (Defect Report, Failure Report).
# Analysis (A). Perform analysis in order to identify the root cause of failure.
# Corrective Actions (CA). Identify, implement and verify corrective actions to prevent further recurrence of the failure.

Common FRACAS outputs may include: Part Number, Part Name, OEM, Field [[Mean time between failures|MTBF]], [[Mean time between repairs|MTBR]], [[Mean time to repair|MTTR]], spares consumption, reliability growth, failure/incidents distribution by type, location, part no., serial no, symptom, etc.

{{Criminal law}}

'''Forgery''' is a [[white-collar crime]] that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a [[legal instrument]] with the specific [[mens rea|intent]] to [[wikt:defraud#English|defraud]] anyone (other than himself or herself).&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooby"/&gt; Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful [[misrepresentation]]s. Forging [[money]] or [[currency]] is more often called [[counterfeit]]ing. But [[consumer good]]s may also be ''counterfeits'' if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the [[label]] or flagged by the [[trademark]] symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a [[false document]].

This usage of "forgery" does not derive from [[Metalworking|metalwork]] done at a forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of "to [[counterfeit]]" is already in the Anglo-French verb ''forger'', meaning "falsify".

A forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself &amp;ndash; what it is worth or what it "proves" &amp;ndash; than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a [[hoax]]. In a hoax, a [[rumor]] or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.

The similar crime of [[fraud]] is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including [[identity theft]]. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by [[security engineering]].

In the 16th century, imitators of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by [[signature forgery|signing]] them "AD", making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Henri Matisse]].

A special case of double forgery is the forging of [[Vermeer]]'s paintings by [[Han van Meegeren]], and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren's work by his son [[Jacques van Meegeren]].

==Criminal law==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}

===England and Wales and Northern Ireland===
In [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person’s prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legislation.gov.uk]]. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/1 Digitised copy of section 1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Instrument" is defined by section 8, "makes" and "false" by section 9, and "induce" and "prejudice" by section 10.

Forgery is [[triable either way]]. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on [[indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on [[summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/6 sections 6(1) to (3)(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For offences akin to forgery, see [[English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating]].

The [[common law offence]] of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/13 section 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Forgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;W J Stewart and Robert Burgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. {{ISBN|0 00 470009 0}}. Pages 176 and 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803]] was repealed in 2013.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]] which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0025.html Digitised copy of section 25].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]], section 25(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Any offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0003.html sections 3(2) and (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0065.html section 65(4)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Forgery is an offence under sections 366, 367 and 368 of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  The offence is a [[Hybrid offence#Canada|hybrid offence]], subject to a maximum prison sentence of:
*if tried [[Summary offence#Canada|summarily]]: 6 months
*if tried [[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Forgery|on indictment]]: 10 years

===United States===
{{Further|Crimes Act of 1790}}
Forgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the [[United States]], both state and federal.&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;''United States v. Hunt'', [https://casetext.com/case/us-v-hunt-74#p1260 456 F.3d 1255], 1260 ([[10th Cir.]] 2006) ("Historically, forgery was defined as the false making, '''with the intent to defraud''', of a [[legal instrument|document]] which is not what it purports to be, as distinct from a document which is genuine but nevertheless contains a term or representation known to be false.") (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added); see generally, {{USC|10|923}} ("Forgery"); {{USC|18|470|514}} (counterfeiting and forgery-related federal offenses); {{USC|18|1543}} ("Forgery or false use of passport").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooby"&gt;{{cite web |title=§ 19.71 S. Forgery |url=https://nortontooby.com/node/16998#booktext |publisher=The Law Offices of Norton Tooby |date= |accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states, including [[California]], describe forgery as occurring when a person alters a written [[document]] "with the intent to defraud, knowing that he or she has no authority to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=470.&amp;lawCode=PEN|title=California Legislative Information, Penal Code section 470|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written document usually has to be an instrument of legal significance.

==Civil law==
As to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]].

==Documentary art==
Before the invention of [[photography]], people commonly hired painters and engravers to "re-create" an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate based on the information available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others removed elements out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were ready to pay to see illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.

==In popular culture==
*The 1839 novel by [[Honoré de Balzac]], ''[[Pierre Grassou]]'', concerns an artist who lives off forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ruth Yeazell|last=Yeazell |first=Ruth Bernard |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka4Ox67dy_cC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Art of the Everyday: Dutch Painting and the Realist Novel |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=88 |isbn=0691127263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Orson Welles]] documentary ''[[F for Fake]]'' concerns both art and literary forgery. For the movie, Welles intercut footage of [[Elmyr de Hory]], an art forger, and [[Clifford Irving]], who wrote an "authorized" autobiography of [[Howard Hughes]] that had been revealed to be a [[hoax]]. While forgery is the ostensible subject of the film, it also concerns art, film making, storytelling and the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFp8S8Tf-dQC&amp;pg=PA245 |title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?: A Portrait of an Independent Career |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=245–250 |isbn=0813124107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The 1972 novel by [[Irving Wallace]], ''[[The Word (novel)|The Word]]'' concerns archaeological forgery, the finding and translation of a supposed lost [[gospel]] by [[James the Just]], close relative of [[Jesus Christ]], as part of a large project to be published as a new Bible that would inspire a Christian revival, but which is possibly a forged document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawelti |first=John G. |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LiRHxXOHYEC&amp;pg=PA281 |title=Adventure, Mystery, and Romance: Formula Stories as Art and Popular Culture |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=281 |isbn=0226098672}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], is based on the real story of [[Frank Abagnale]], a [[confidence trick|con man]] who stole over $2.5 million through forgery, imposture and other frauds, which are dramatized in the film. His career in crime lasted six years from 1963 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wight |first=Douglas |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fxEt4Rw-IYkC&amp;pg=PT72 |title=Leonardo DiCaprio: The Biography |chapter=Owning December |publisher=John Blake Publishing Ltd |isbn=1857829573}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The graphic art novel ''[[The Last Coiner]]'', authored by Peter M.

In the [[social sciences]], '''framing''' comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies, organize, perceive, and communicate about [[reality]]. Framing involves [[social construction]] of a [[social phenomenon]] – by [[mass media]] sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. Participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual's ''[[perception]]'' of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. Politically, the language communities of [[advertising]], [[religion]], and mass media are highly contested, whereas framing in less-sharply defended [[speech community|language communities]] might evolve imperceptibly and organically over [[cultural]] time frames, with fewer overt modes of disputation.

Framing can manifest in [[cognition|thought]] or interpersonal [[communication]]. ''Frames in thought'' consist of the mental representations, interpretations, and simplifications of reality. ''Frames in communication'' consist of the communication of frames between different actors.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Druckman | first1 = J.N. | year = 2001 | title = The Implications of Framing Effects for Citizen Competence | url = | journal = Political Behavior | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 225–56 | doi=10.1023/A:1015006907312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can view framing in communication as positive or negative – depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. The framing may be in the form of ''equivalence frames'', where two or more logically equivalent alternatives are portrayed in different ways (see [[framing effect (psychology)|framing effect]]) or ''emphasis frames'', which simplify reality by focusing on a subset of relevant aspects of a situation or issue.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001" /&gt; In the case of  "equivalence frames", the information being presented is based on the same facts, but the "frame" in which it is presented changes, thus creating a reference-dependent perception.

The effects of framing can be seen in many journalism applications. With the same information being used as a base, the "frame" surrounding the issue can change the reader's perception without having to alter the actual facts. In the context of politics or mass-media communication, a frame defines the packaging of an element of [[rhetoric]] in such a way as to encourage certain interpretations and to discourage others.  For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="van der Pas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Pas|first=D.|title=Making Hay While the Sun Shines: Do Parties Only Respond to Media Attention When The Framing is Right?|journal=Journal of Press/Politics|year=2014|volume=19|issue=1|pages=42–65|doi=10.1177/1940161213508207}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social theory]], framing is a [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], a collection of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] and [[stereotype]]s, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.&lt;ref name="Goffman1974"&gt;
Goffman, E. (1974). Frame analysis: An easy on the organization of experience. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people build a series of mental "filters" through biological and cultural influences. They then use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.

Framing is also a key component of [[sociology]], the study of social interaction among humans.  Framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data on a daily basis.  Successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know.

== Explanation ==
When one seeks to explain an event, the understanding often depends on the frame referred to. If a friend rapidly closes and opens an eye, we will respond very differently depending on whether we attribute this to a purely "physical" frame (they blinked) or to a social frame (they winked). Though the former might result from a speck of dust (resulting in an involuntary and not particularly meaningful reaction), the latter would imply a voluntary and meaningful action (to convey humor to an accomplice, for example). 

Observers will read events seen as purely physical or within a frame of "nature" differently from those seen as occurring with social frames. But we do not look at an event and then "apply" a frame to it. Rather, individuals constantly project into the world around them the interpretive frames that allow them to make sense of it; we only shift frames (or realize that we have habitually applied a frame) when incongruity calls for a frame-shift. In other words, we only become aware of the frames that we always already use when something forces us to replace one frame with another.&lt;ref&gt;
This example borrowed from Clifford Geertz: ''Local Knowledge: Further Essays in Interpretive Anthropology'' (1983), Basic Books 2000 paperback: {{ISBN|0-465-04162-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Goffman offers the example of the woman bidding on a mirror at an auction who first examines the frame and surface for imperfections, and then "checks" herself in the mirror and adjusts her hat. See Goffman, Erving. ''Frame Analysis: An essay on the organization of experience''. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-930350-91-X}}, p. 39. In each case the mirror represents more than simply a physical object.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Framing is so effective because it is an heuristic, or mental shortcut that may not always yield desired results; and is seen as a 'rule of thumb'. According to Susan T. Fiske and Shelley E. Taylor, human beings are by nature "cognitive misers", meaning they prefer to do as little thinking as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1991). Social cognition (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Frames provide people a quick and easy way to process information. Hence, people will use the previously mentioned mental filters (a series of which is called a schema) to make sense of incoming messages. This gives the sender and framer of the information enormous power to use these schemas to influence how the receivers will interpret the message.&lt;ref name="EntmanRobertTree"&gt;Entman, Robert "Tree Beard". Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm. Journal of Communication; Autumn 1993, 43, 4, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some consider framing to be synonymous with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]], other scholars state that there is a distinction. According to an article written by Donald H. Weaver, framing selects certain aspects of an issue and makes them more prominent in order to elicit certain interpretations and evaluations of the issue, whereas agenda setting introduces the issue topic to increase its salience and accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=David H.|title=Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=57|page=142|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framing effect in communication research==
In the field of communication, framing defines how news media coverage shapes [[mass opinion]]. [[Richard Vatz|Richard E. Vatz's]] discourse on creation of rhetorical meaning relates directly to framing, although he references it little.  To be specific, framing effects refer to behavioral or attitudinal strategies and/or outcomes that are due to how a given piece of information is being framed in [[public discourse]]. Today, many volumes of the major communication journals contain papers on media frames and framing effects.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, D. A. &amp; Iyengar, S. (forthcoming). The state of framing research: A call for new directions. In K. kENSKI, &amp; K. H. Jamieson (Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of political communication theories. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches used in such papers can be broadly classified into two groups: studies of framing as the dependent variable and studies of framing as the independent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Tewksbury &amp; Scheufele (2009). News framing theory and research, In J. Bryant, &amp; M. B. Oliver (Eds.) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The former usually deals with ''frame building'' (i.e. how frames create societal discourse about an issue and how different frames are adopted by journalists) and latter concerns ''frame setting'' (i.e. how media framing influences an audience).

===Frame building===
Frame building is related to at least three areas: journalist norms, political actors, and cultural situations. It assumes that several media frames compete to set one frame regarding an issue, and one frame finally gains influence because it resonates with [[popular culture]], fits with media practices, or is heavily sponsored by [[elite]]s.
First, in terms of practices of news production, there are at least five aspects of news work that may influence how journalists frame a certain issue: larger societal norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, external pressures from [[interest group]]s and other [[policy maker]]s, professional routines, and ideological or political orientations of journalists. The second potential influence on frame building comes from elites, including interest groups, government bureaucracies, and other political or corporate actors. Empirical studies show that these influences of elites seem to be strongest for issues in which journalists and various players in the policy arena can find shared narratives. Finally, cultural contexts of a society are also able to establish frame. [[Erving Goffman]]&lt;ref name="Goffman1974"/&gt; assumes that the meaning of a frame has implicit cultural roots. This context dependency of media frame has been described as 'cultural resonance'&lt;ref&gt;Gamson, W. A. &amp; Modigliani, A. (1987) The changing culture of affirmative action. Research in Political Sociology, 3, 137–77&lt;/ref&gt; or 'narrative fidelity'.&lt;ref name="SnowBenford1988"&gt;Snow, D. A., &amp; Benford, R. D. (1988). Ideology, frame resonance, and participant mobilization. In B. Klandermans, H. Kriesi, &amp; S. Tarrow (Eds.), International social movement research. Vol. 1, From structure on action: Comparing social movement research across cultures (pp. 197–217). Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame setting===
When people are exposed to a novel news frame, they will accept the constructs made applicable to an issue, but they are significantly more likely to do so when they have existing schema for those constructs. This is called the applicability effect. That is, when new frames invite people to apply their existing schema to an issue, the implication of that application depends, in part, on what is in that schema. Therefore, generally, the more the audiences know about issues, the more effective are frames.

There are a number of levels and types of framing effects that have been examined. For example, scholars have focused on attitudinal and behavioral changes, the degrees of perceived importance of the issue, voting decisions, and opinion formations. Others are interested in psychological processes other than applicability. For instance, Iyengar&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, S. (1991). Is anyone responsible? How television frames political issues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that news about social problems can influence attributions of causal and treatment responsibility, an effect observed in both cognitive responses and evaluations of political leaders, or other scholars looked at the framing effects on receivers' evaluative processing style and the complexity of audience members' thoughts about issues.

==In mass communication research==
News media frame all news items by emphasizing specific values, facts, and other considerations, and endowing them with greater apparent applicability for making related judgments.  News media promotes particular definitions, interpretations, evaluations and recommendations.&lt;ref name=Entman1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Entman|first=R.M.|title=Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=51–58|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NelsonClawsonOxley1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=T.E.|author2=Clawson, R.A. |author3=Oxley, Z.M. |title=Media framing of a civil liberties conflict and its effect on tolerance|journal=American Political Science Review|year=1997|volume=91|issue=3|pages=567–83|doi=10.2307/2952075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundations in mass communication research===

Anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] first articulated the concept of framing in his 1972 book ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]''.  A frame, Bateson wrote, is "a spatial and temporal bounding of a set of interactive messages."&lt;ref name=Bateson1972&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=G.|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind|year=1972|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociological roots of media framing research====

Media framing research has both sociological and psychological roots.  Sociological framing focuses on "the words, images, phrases, and presentation styles" that communicators use when relaying information to recipients.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001" /&gt; Research on frames in sociologically driven media research generally examines the influence of "social norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, pressures of interest groups, journalistic routines, and ideological or political orientations of journalists" on the existence of frames in media content.&lt;ref name=Scheufele2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=D.A.|title=Agenda-setting, priming, and framing revisited: Another look at cognitive effects of political communication|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2&amp;3|pages=297–316|doi=10.1207/S15327825MCS0323_07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Todd Gitlin]], in his analysis of how the news media trivialized the student [[New Left]] movement during the 1960s, was among the first to examine media frames from a sociological perspective.  Frames, Gitlin wrote, are "persistent patterns of cognition, interpretations, and presentation, of selection [and] emphasis ... [that are] largely unspoken and unacknowledged ... [and] organize the world for both journalists [and] for those of us who read their reports."&lt;ref name=Gitlin1980&gt;{{cite book|last=Gitlin|first=T.|title=The Whole World is Watching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the New Left|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological roots of media framing research====

Research on frames in psychologically driven media research generally examines the effects of media frames on those who receive them.  For example, Iyengar explored the impact of episodic and thematic news frames on viewers' attributions of responsibility for political issues including crime, terrorism, poverty, unemployment, and racial inequality.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=S.|title=Is Anyone Responsible? How Television Frames Political Issues|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iyengar, an episodic news frame "takes the form of a case study or event-oriented report and depicts public issues in terms of concrete instances," while a thematic news frame "places public issues in some more general abstract context ... directed at general outcomes or conditions."&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt; Iyengar found that the majority of television news coverage of poverty, for example, was episodic.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  In fact, in a content analysis of six years of television news, Iyengar found that the typical news viewer would have been twice as likely to encounter episodic rather than thematic television news about poverty.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  Further, experimental results indicate participants who watched episodic news coverage of poverty were more than twice as likely as those who watched thematic news coverage of poverty to attribute responsibility of poverty to the poor themselves rather than society.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  Given the predominance of episodic framing of poverty, Iyengar argues that television news shifts responsibility of poverty from government and society to the poor themselves.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  After examining content analysis and experimental data on poverty and other political issues, Iyengar concludes that episodic news frames divert citizens' attributions of political responsibility away from society and political elites, making them less likely to support government efforts to address those issue and obscuring the connections between those issues and their elected officials' actions or lack thereof.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;

===Clarifying and distinguishing a "fractured paradigm"===

Perhaps because of their use across the social sciences, frames have been defined and used in many disparate ways.  Entman called framing "a scattered conceptualization" and "a fractured paradigm" that "is often defined casually, with much left to an assumed tacit understanding of the reader."&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt; In an effort to provide more conceptual clarity, Entman suggested that frames "select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described."&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;

Entman's&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;  conceptualization of framing, which suggests frames work by elevating particular pieces of information in salience, is in line with much early research on the psychological underpinnings of framing effects (see also Iyengar,&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  who argues that accessibility is the primary psychological explanation for the existence of framing effects).  Wyer and Srull&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984 /&gt;  explain the construct of accessibility thus:
# People store related pieces of information in "referent bins" in their long-term memory.&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyer Jr.|first=R.S.|title=Social Cognition: The Ontario Symposium|year=1984|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Srull |first2=T.K. |editor=E.T. Higgins |editor2=N.A. Kuiper |editor3=M.P Zanna |chapter=Category Accessibility: Some theoretic and empirical issues concerning the processing of social stimulus information}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# People organize "referent bins" such that more frequently and recently used pieces of information are stored at the top of the bins and are therefore more accessible.&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984 /&gt;
# Because people tend to retrieve only a small portion of information from long-term memory when making judgments, they tend to retrieve the most accessible pieces of information to use for making those judgments.&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984 /&gt;

The argument supporting accessibility as the psychological process underlying framing can therefore be summarized thus: Because people rely heavily on news media for public affairs information, the most accessible information about public affairs often comes from the public affairs news they consume.  The argument supporting accessibility as the psychological process underlying framing has also been cited as support in the debate over whether framing should be subsumed by [[agenda-setting theory]] as part of the second level of agenda setting.  McCombs and other agenda-setting scholars generally agree that framing should be incorporated, along with [[Priming (media)|priming]], under the umbrella of agenda setting as a complex model of media effects linking media production, content, and audience effects.&lt;ref name=Kosicki1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosicki|first=G.M.|title=Problems and opportunities in Agenda-setting research|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=100–27|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCombsShaw1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M.E.|author2=Shaw, D.L.|title=The evolution of agenda-setting research: Twenty-five years in the marketplace of ideas|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=58–67|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCombsLlamasLopez-EscobarRey1997 /&gt;  Indeed, McCombs, Llamas, Lopez-Escobar, and Rey justified their attempt to combine framing and agenda-setting research on the assumption of parsimony.&lt;ref name=McCombsLlamasLopez-EscobarRey1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M.F.|author2=Llamas, J.P. |author3=Lopez-Escobar, E. |author4=Rey, F. |title=Candidate images in Spanish elections: Second-level agenda-setting effects|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|pages=703–17|doi=10.1177/107769909707400404|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheufele, however, argues that, unlike agenda setting and priming, framing does not rely primarily on accessibility, making it inappropriate to combine framing with agenda setting and priming for the sake of parsimony.&lt;ref name=Scheufele2000 /&gt; Empirical evidence seems to vindicate Scheufele's claim.  For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley empirically demonstrated that applicability, rather than their salience, is key.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt; By operationalizing accessibility as the response latency of respondent answers where more accessible information results in faster response times, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley demonstrated that accessibility accounted for only a minor proportion of the variance in framing effects while applicability accounted for the major proportion of variance.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt; Therefore, according to Nelson and colleagues, "frames influence opinions by stressing specific values, facts, and other considerations, endowing them with greater apparent relevance to the issue than they might appear to have under an alternative frame."&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;

In other words, while early research suggested that by highlighting particular aspects of issues, frames make certain considerations more accessible and therefore more likely to be used in the judgment process,&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  more recent research suggests that frames work by making particular considerations more applicable and therefore more relevant to the judgment process.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheufele2000 /&gt;

===Equivalency versus emphasis: two types of frames in media research===

Chong and Druckman suggest framing research has mainly focused on two types of frames: equivalency and emphasis frames.&lt;ref name=ChongDruckman2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chong|first=D.|author2=Druckman, J.N. |title=Framing theory|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|year=2007|volume=10|pages=103–26|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalency frames offer "different, but logically equivalent phrases," which cause individuals to alter their preferences.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001" /&gt; Equivalency frames are often worded in terms of "gains" versus "losses."  For example, Kahneman and Tversky asked participants to choose between two "gain-framed" policy responses to a hypothetical disease outbreak expected to kill 600 people.&lt;ref name=KahnemanTversky1984&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=D.|author2=Tversky, A.|title=Choices, values, and frames|journal=American Psychologist |year=1984|volume=39|issue=4|pages=341–50 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.4.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Response A would save 200 people while Response B had a one-third probability of saving everyone, but a two-thirds probability of saving no one.  Participants overwhelmingly chose Response A, which they perceived as the less risky option. Kahneman and Tversky asked other participants to choose between two equivalent "loss-framed" policy responses to the same disease outbreak.  In this condition, Response A would kill 400 people while Response B had a one-third probability of killing no one but a two-thirds probability of killing everyone.  Although these options are  mathematically identical to those given in the "gain-framed" condition, participants overwhelmingly chose Response B, the risky option.  Kahneman and Tversky, then, demonstrated that when phrased in terms of potential gains, people tend to choose what they perceive as the less risky option (i.e., the sure gain).  Conversely, when faced with a potential loss, people tend to choose the riskier option.&lt;ref name=KahnemanTversky1984 /&gt;

Unlike equivalency frames, emphasis frames offer "qualitatively different yet potentially relevant considerations" which individuals use to make judgments.&lt;ref name=ChongDruckman2007 /&gt; For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley exposed participants to a news story that presented the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s plan to hold a rally.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;  Participants in one condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of public safety concerns while participants in the other condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of free speech considerations.  Participants exposed to the public safety condition considered public safety applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold a rally and, as expected, expressed lower tolerance of the Klan's right to hold a rally.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;  Participants exposed to the free speech condition, however, considered free speech applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold a rally and, as expected, expressed greater tolerance of the Klan's right to hold a rally.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;

==Framing effect in psychology and economics==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
{{Main|Framing effect (psychology)}}
[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] have shown that framing can affect the outcome (i.e. the choices one makes) of choice problems, to the extent that several of the classic axioms of [[rational choice]] do not hold.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = Amos | last2 = Kahneman | first2 = Daniel | year = 1981 | title = The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice | url = | journal = Science | volume = 211 | issue = 4481| pages = 453–58 | doi = 10.1126/science.7455683 | pmid = 7455683 | bibcode = 1981Sci...211..453T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of [[prospect theory]] as an alternative to rational choice theory.&lt;ref&gt;Econport. "Decision-Making Under Uncertainty – Advanced Topics: An Introduction to Prospect Theory". (EconPort is an economics digital library specializing in content that emphasizes the use of experiments in teaching and research.) [http://www.econport.org/econport/request?page=man_ru_advanced_prospect]&lt;/ref&gt;

The context or framing of problems adopted by decision-makers results in part from extrinsic manipulation of the decision-options offered, as well as from forces intrinsic to decision-makers, e.g., their norms, habits, and unique [[temperament]].

===Experimental demonstration===
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) demonstrated systematic [[preference reversal|reversals of preference]] when the same problem is presented in different ways, for example in the Asian disease problem. Participants were asked to "imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume the exact scientific estimate of the consequences of the programs are as follows."

The first group of participants was presented with a choice between programs:
In a group of 600 people,
* Program A: "200 people will be saved"
* Program B: "there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved"

72 percent of participants preferred program A (the remainder, 28%, opting for program B).

The second group of participants was presented with the choice between the following:
In a group of 600 people,
* Program C: "400 people will die"
* Program D: "there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die"

In this decision frame, 78% preferred program D, with the remaining 22% opting for program C.

Programs A and C are identical, as are programs B and D. The change in the decision frame between the two groups of participants produced a preference reversal: when the programs were presented in terms of lives saved, the participants preferred the secure program, A (= C). When the programs were presented in terms of expected deaths, participants chose the gamble D (= B).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Absolute and relative influences===
Framing effects arise because one can frequently frame a decision using multiple [[scenario]]s, wherein one may express benefits either as a relative risk reduction (RRR), or as absolute risk reduction (ARR). Extrinsic control over the cognitive distinctions (between [[risk tolerance]] and [[Incentive|reward anticipation]]) adopted by decision makers can occur through altering the presentation of [[relative risk]]s and [[Three degrees of comparison|absolute]] benefits.

People generally prefer the absolute certainty inherent in a positive framing-effect, which offers an assurance of gains. When decision-options appear framed as a ''likely gain'', risk-averse choices predominate.

A shift toward risk-seeking behavior occurs when a decision-maker frames decisions in negative terms, or adopts a negative framing effect.

In [[Decision-making|medical decision making]], [[framing bias]] is best avoided by using absolute measures of efficacy.&lt;ref name="pmid21792695"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Perneger TV, Agoritsas T | title=Doctors and Patients' Susceptibility to Framing Bias: A Randomized Trial | journal=J Gen Intern Med | year= 2011 | volume= 26| issue= 12| pages= 1411–17| pmid=21792695 | doi=10.1007/s11606-011-1810-x | pmc= 3235613| url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame-manipulation research===
Researchers have found that framing decision-problems in a positive light generally results in less-risky choices; with negative framing of problems, riskier choices tend to result.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1981" /&gt;

In a study by researchers at [[Dartmouth Medical School]], 57% of the subjects chose a medication when presented with benefits in relative terms, whereas only 14.7% chose a medication whose benefit appeared in absolute terms. Further questioning of the patients suggested that, because the subjects ignored the underlying risk of disease, they perceived benefits as greater when expressed in relative terms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=8271086&amp;dopt=Abstract The framing effect of relative and absolute risk.

Researchers have proposed&lt;ref&gt;Chong, D. and Druckman, J. N. (2007): Framing Theory, Annual Review of Political Science, vol. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, V., Tewksburg, D. and Powers, E. (1997): Switching Trains of Thought: The Impact of News Frames on Readers' Cognitive Responses, Communication Research, Vol. 24. No. 5, 481–506&lt;/ref&gt; various models explaining the '''framing effect''':
* cognitive theories, such as the [[fuzzy-trace theory]], attempt to explain the framing-effect by determining the amount of cognitive processing effort devoted to determining the value of potential gains and losses.
* [[prospect theory]] explains the framing-effect in functional terms, determined by preferences for differing perceived values, based on the assumption that people give a greater weighting to losses than to equivalent gains.
* [[motivation]]al theories explain the framing-effect in terms of [[hedonic]] forces affecting individuals, such as fears and wishes—based on the notion that negative emotions evoked by potential losses usually out-weigh the emotions evoked by hypothetical gains.
* cognitive [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit]] trade-off theory defines choice as a compromise between desires, either as a preference for a correct decision or a preference for minimized cognitive effort. This model, which dovetails elements of cognitive and motivational theories, postulates that calculating the value of a sure gain takes much less cognitive effort than that required to select a risky gain.

===Neuroimaging===
Cognitive [[neuroscientist]]s have linked the framing-effect to neural activity in the [[amygdala]], and have identified another brain-region, the orbital and medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (OMPFC), that appears to moderate the role of [[emotion]] on decisions. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to monitor brain-activity during a financial decision-making task, they observed greater activity in the OMPFC of those research subjects less susceptible to the framing-effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Martino | first1 = B. | last2 = Kumaran | first2 = D. | last3 = Seymour | first3 = B. | last4 = Dolan | first4 = R.

==Framing theory and frame analysis in sociology==
Framing theory and frame analysis provide a broad theoretical approach that analysts have used in [[communication studies]], [[journalism|news]] (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and [[social movement]]s (among other applications).

According to some sociologists, the "social construction of collective action frames" involves "public discourse, that is, the interface of media discourse and interpersonal interaction; persuasive communication during mobilization campaigns by movement organizations, their opponents and countermovement organizations; and consciousness raising during episodes of collective action."&lt;ref&gt;
Bert Klandermans. 1997. ''The Social Psychology of Protest''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 45
&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[diction|Word-selection]] or diction has been a component of [[rhetoric]] since time immemorial. But most commentators attribute the concept of framing to the work of [[Erving Goffman]] on [[frame analysis]] and point especially to his 1974 book, ''Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience''. Goffman used the idea of frames to label "schemata of interpretation" that allow individuals or groups "to locate, perceive, identify, and label" events and occurrences, thus rendering meaning, organizing experiences, and guiding actions.&lt;ref&gt;
Erving Goffman (1974). ''Frame Analysis: An essay on the organization of experience''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974, p. 21.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Goffman's framing concept evolved out of his 1959 work, ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'', a commentary on the [[management]] of [[Impression management|impressions]]. These works arguably depend on [[Kenneth Boulding]]'s concept of image.&lt;ref&gt;
Kenneth Boulding: ''The Image: Knowledge in Life and Society'', University of Michigan Press, 1956)
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social movements===
Sociologists have utilized framing to explain the process of [[social movement]]s.&lt;ref name="SnowBenford1988" /&gt;
Movements act as carriers of beliefs and ideologies (compare [[meme]]s). In addition, they operate as part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988). Sociologists deem the mobilization of mass-movements "successful" when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. Researchers of framing speak of this process as ''frame re-alignment''.

===Frame-alignment===
Snow and Benford (1988) regard frame-alignment as an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, "frame alignment" occurs,&lt;ref name="Snowetal1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snow | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Rochford | first2 = E. B. | last3 = Worden | first3 = S. K. | last4 = Benford | first4 = R. D. | year = 1986 | title = Frame alignment processes, micromobilization, and movement participation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 51 | issue = 4| page = 464 | doi=10.2307/2095581| jstor = 2095581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
producing "frame resonance", a catalyst in the process of a group making the transition from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts prove successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts include the following:
* "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing-tasks, and state that the degree to which framers attend to these tasks will determine participant mobilization. They characterize the three tasks as the following:
*# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame
*# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem
*# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action
* The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger [[belief system|belief-system]]; centrality: the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness, if the framer links the frame to only one core belief or value that, in itself, has a limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
* Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must seem relevant to participants and must also inform them. Empirical credibility or testability can constrain relevancy: it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, meaning that it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations.
* [[Protest cycle|Cycles of protest]] (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Previous frames may affect efforts to impose a new frame.

Snow and Benford (1988) propose that once someone has constructed proper frames as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame-alignment.

====Types====
Frame-alignment comes in four forms: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.

# ''Frame bridging'' involves the "linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;467). It involves the linkage of a movement to "unmobilized [''[[sic]]''] sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters" (p.&amp;nbsp;467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base.
# ''Frame amplification'' refers to "the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs.
# ''Frame extensions'' represent a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;472).
# ''Frame transformation'' becomes necessary when the proposed frames "may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;473).

When this happens, the securing of participants and support requires new values, new meanings and understandings. Goffman (1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44) calls this "keying", where "activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework, in terms of another framework" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;474) such that they are seen differently. Two types of frame transformation exist:

# Domain-specific transformations, such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and
# Global interpretive frame-transformation, where the scope of change seems quite radical—as in a change of [[world view|world-views]], total conversions of thought, or uprooting of everything familiar (for example: moving from [[communism]] to [[market capitalism]], or vice versa; [[religious conversion]], etc.).

==Frame analysis as rhetorical criticism==
Although the idea of language-framing had been explored earlier by [[Kenneth Burke]] (terministic screens), political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] first published work advancing [[frame analysis]] (framing analysis) as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event) and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers's work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that "induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information...."&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis" in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action'', edited by J.A. Kuypers,  Lexington Press, 2009. p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 essay "Framing Analysis" in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;ref&gt;
''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;/ref&gt; and his 2010 essay "Framing Analysis as a Rhetorical Process",&lt;ref&gt;Kuypers, Jim A. "Framing Analysis as a Rhetorical Process," Doing News Framing Analysis.  Paul D'Angelo and  Jim A. Kuypers, eds. (New York: Routeledge, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers offers a detailed conception for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, "Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea."&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers's work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view. Curing the problem is not rhetorical and best left to the observer.

==Rhetorical framing in politics==

{{POV section|date=March 2017}}

Framing is used to construct, refine, and deliver messages. Framing in politics is essential to getting your message across to the masses. Frames are mental structures that shape the way we view the world (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate 2004).&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;In Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate, by George Lakoff, 144. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Reframing is used particularly well by both conservatives and liberals in the political arena, so well that they have news anchors and commentators discussing the ideas, supplied phrases and framing (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate 2004).&lt;ref name=Lakoff/&gt;

==Applications==

===Finance===
Preference reversals and other associated phenomena are of wider relevance within behavioural economics, as they contradict the predictions of [[rational choice]], the basis of traditional economics. Framing biases affecting investing, lending, borrowing decisions make one of the themes of [[behavioral finance]].

===Law===
[[Edward Zelinsky]] has shown that framing effects can explain some observed behaviors of legislators.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Zelinsky|Zelinsky, Edward A.]]. 2005. Do Tax Expenditures Create Framing Effects? Volunteer Firefighters, Property Tax Exemptions, and the Paradox of Tax Expenditure Analysis. ''Virginia Tax Review'' 24. [http://www.allbusiness.com/accounting/3584666-1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
The role framing plays in the effects of media presentation has been widely discussed, with the central notion that associated perceptions of factual information can vary based upon the presentation of the information.

====News media examples====
In ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age,''&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2006),&lt;/ref&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]] examined the differences in framing of the [[War on Terror]] between the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush]] administration and the U.S. mainstream news media between 2001 and 2005.  Kuypers looked for common themes between presidential speeches and press reporting of those speeches, and then determined how the president and the press had framed those themes.  By using a rhetorical version of framing analysis, Kuypers determined that the U.S. news media advanced frames counter to those used by the Bush administration:

{{quote| the press actively contested the framing of the War on Terror as early as eight weeks following 9/11. This finding stands apart from a collection of communication literature suggesting the press supported the President or was insufficiently critical of the President's efforts after 9/11. To the contrary, when taking into consideration how themes are framed, [Kuypers] found that the news media framed its response in such a way that it could be viewed as supporting the idea of some action against terrorism, while concommitantly opposing the initiatives of the President.  The news media may well relay what the president says, but it does not necessarily follow that it is framed in the same manner; thus, an echo of the theme, but not of the frame.  The present study demonstrates, as seen in Table One [below], that shortly after 9/11 the news media was beginning to actively counter the Bush administration and beginning to leave out information important to understanding the Bush Administration's conception of the War on Terror.  In sum, eight weeks after 9/11, the news media was moving beyond reporting political opposition to the President—a very necessary and invaluable press function—and was instead actively choosing themes, and framing those themes, in such a way that the President's focus was opposed, misrepresented, or ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, Stephen D. Cooper, Matthew T. Althouse, "George W. Bush, The American Press, and the Initial Framing of the War on Terror after 9/11," ''The George W. Bush Presidency: A Rhetorical Perspective,'' Robert E. Denton, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2012), 89–112.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1991 Robert M. Entman published findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Entman | first1 = R. M. | year = 1991 | title = Symposium Framing U.S. Coverage of International News: Contrasts in Narratives of the KAL and Iran Air Incidents | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 6–27 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1991.tb02328.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding the differences in media coverage between [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] and [[Iran Air Flight 655]]. After evaluating various levels of media coverage, based on both amount of airtime and pages devoted to similar events, Entman concluded that the frames the events were presented in by the media were drastically different:

{{quote| By de-emphasizing the agency and the victims and by the choice of graphics and adjectives, the news stories about the U.S. downing of an Iranian plane called it a technical problem, while the Soviet downing of a Korean jet was portrayed as a moral outrage… [T]he contrasting news frames employed by several important U.S. media outlets in covering these two tragic misapplications of military force. For the first, the frame emphasized the moral bankruptcy and guilt of the perpetrating nation, for the second, the frame de-emphasized the guilt and focused on the complex problems of operating military high technology. }}

Differences in coverage amongst various media outlets:

In 1988 Irwin Levin and Gary Gaeth did a study on the effects of framing attribute information on consumers before and after consuming a product (1988). In this study they found that in a study on beef, people who ate beef labeled as 75% lean rated it more favorably than people whose beef was labelled 25% fat.

===Politics===

Linguist and rhetoric scholar [[George Lakoff]] argues that, in order to persuade a political audience of one side of an argument or another, the facts must be presented through a rhetorical frame.  It is argued that, without the frame, the facts of an argument become lost on an audience, making the argument less effective.  The rhetoric of politics uses framing to present the facts surrounding an issue in a way that creates the appearance of a problem at hand that requires a solution.  Politicians using framing to make their own solution to an exigence appear to be the most appropriate compared to that of the opposition.&lt;ref name="van der Pas" /&gt;  Counter-arguments become less effective in persuading an audience once one side has framed an argument, because it is argued that the opposition then has the additional burden of arguing the frame of the issue in addition to the issue itself.

Framing a political issue, a political party or a political opponent is a [[strategy|strategic]] goal in [[politics]], particularly in the [[United States of America]]. Both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political parties compete to successfully harness its power of persuasion. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'':

{{quote|Even before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|election]], a new political word had begun to take hold of the party, beginning on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and spreading like a virus all the way to the inner offices of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]]. That word was 'framing.' Exactly what it means to 'frame' issues seems to depend on which Democrat you are talking to, but everyone agrees that it has to do with choosing the language to define a debate and, more important, with fitting individual issues into the contexts of broader story lines.|&lt;ref name="framingwars"&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/magazine/17DEMOCRATS.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=e3e686efd4fa97c5&amp;ex=1183608000 The Framing Wars. ''[[New York Times]]'' 17 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because framing has the ability to alter the public's perception, politicians engage in battles to determine how issues are framed. Hence, the way the issues are framed in the media reflects who is winning the battle. For instance, according to Robert Entman, professor of Communication at George Washington University, in the build-up to the Gulf War the conservatives were successful in making the debate whether to attack sooner or later, with no mention of the possibility of not attacking. Since the media picked up on this and also framed the debate in this fashion, the conservatives won.&lt;ref name="EntmanRobertTree" /&gt;

One particular example of [[George Lakoff|Lakoff's]] work that attained some degree of fame was his advice to rename&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Olson]], [http://www.overlawyered.com/2005/07/some_framing_advice.html Overlawyered weblog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707192530/http://www.overlawyered.com/2005/07/some_framing_advice.html |date=2007-07-07 }}, 2005-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[trial lawyer]]s (unpopular in the United States) as "public protection attorneys". Though Americans have not generally adopted this suggestion, the [[Association of Trial Lawyers of America]] did rename themselves the "American Association of Justice", in what the [[Chamber of Commerce]] called an effort to hide their identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al Kamen]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601429_pf.html "Forget Cash – Lobbyists Should Set Support for Lawmakers in Stone"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2007-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' depicted similar intensity among Republicans:

{{quote|In one recent memo, titled 'The 14 Words Never to Use,' [[Frank Luntz|[Frank] Luntz]] urged conservatives to restrict themselves to phrases from what he calls ... the 'New American Lexicon.' Thus, a smart Republican, in Luntz's view, never advocates '[[oil drilling|drilling for oil]]'; he prefers 'exploring for energy.' He should never criticize the 'government,' which cleans our streets and pays our firemen; he should attack '[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]],' with its ceaseless thirst for taxes and regulations. 'We should never use the word [[outsourcing]],' Luntz wrote, 'because we will then be asked to defend or end the practice of allowing companies to ship American jobs overseas.'|&lt;ref name="framingwars"/&gt;}}

From a political perspective, framing has widespread consequences. For example, the concept of framing links with that of [[agenda setting theory|agenda-setting]]: by consistently invoking a particular frame, the framing party may effectively control discussion and perception of the issue. [[Sheldon Rampton]] and [[John Stauber]] in ''[[Trust Us, We're Experts]]'' illustrate how [[Public Relations|public-relations]] (PR) firms often use language to help frame a given issue, structuring the questions that then subsequently emerge. For example, one firm advises clients to use "bridging language" that uses a strategy of answering questions with specific terms or ideas in order to shift the discourse from an uncomfortable topic to a more comfortable one.&lt;ref&gt;
Rampton, Sheldon and Stauber, John. ''Trust Us, We're Experts!'' Putnam Publishing, New York, NY, 2002. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;
Practitioners of this strategy might attempt to draw attention away from one frame in order to focus on another. As Lakoff notes, "On the day that [[George W. Bush]] took office, the words "tax relief" started coming out of the White House."&lt;ref name="Lakoff2004"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Don't think of an elephant!: know your values and frame the debate|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=978-1-931498-71-5|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By refocusing the structure away from one frame ("tax burden" or "tax responsibilities"), individuals can set the agenda of the questions asked in the future.

[[Cognitive linguistics|Cognitive linguists]] point to an example of framing in the phrase "[[tax cut|tax relief]]". In this frame, use of the concept "relief" entails a concept of (without mentioning the benefits resulting from) taxes putting strain on the citizen:

{{quote|The current tax code is full of inequities. Many single moms face higher marginal tax rates than the wealthy. Couples frequently face a higher tax burden after they marry. The majority of Americans cannot deduct their charitable donations. Family farms and businesses are sold to pay the death tax. And the owners of the most successful small businesses share nearly half of their income with the government. President Bush's tax cut will greatly reduce these inequities. It is a fair plan that is designed to provide tax relief to everyone who pays income taxes.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/reports/taxplan.html The President's Agenda for Tax Relief] retrieved 3 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alternative frames may emphasize the concept of taxes as a source of infrastructural support to businesses:

{{quote|The truth is that the wealthy have received more from America than most Americans—not just wealth but the infrastructure that has allowed them to amass their wealth: banks, the Federal Reserve, the stock market, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the legal system, federally sponsored research, patents, tax supports, the military protection of foreign investments, and much much more. American taxpayers support the infrastructure of wealth accumulation. It is only fair that those who benefit most should pay their fair share.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitivepolicyworks.com/resource-center/planning-tools/framing-tutorials/simple-framing/ Cognitive Policy Works/Rockridge Institute: Simple Framing]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frames can limit debate by setting the vocabulary and [[metaphor]]s through which participants can comprehend and discuss an issue. They form a part not just of political discourse, but of [[cognition]]. In addition to generating new frames, politically oriented framing research aims to increase public awareness of the connection between framing and reasoning.

====Examples====
* The initial response of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|assault of September 11, 2001]] was to frame the acts of [[Counterterrorism|terror]] as [[crime]]. This framing was replaced within hours by a war metaphor, yielding the "[[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]". The difference between these two framings is in the implied response. Crime connotes bringing criminals to justice, putting them on trial and sentencing them, whereas as [[war]] implies enemy territory, military action and war powers for government.&lt;ref name="Lakoff2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Juyan |title=Beyond anti-terrorism: Metaphors as message strategy of post-September-11 U.S. public diplomacy |journal=Public Relations Review|year=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2006.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term "escalation" to describe an increase in American troop-levels in [[Iraq]] in 2007 implied that the United States deliberately increased the scope of conflict in a provocative manner and possibly implies that U.S. strategy entails a long-term military presence in Iraq, whereas [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|"surge"]] framing implies a powerful but brief, transitory increase in intensity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/48059/ "It's Escalation, Stupid." ''Alternet''] retrieved 3 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "bad apple" frame, as in the proverb "one bad [[apple]] spoils the barrel". This frame implies that removing one underachieving or corrupt official from an [[institution]] will solve a given problem; an opposing frame presents the same problem as systematic or structural to the institution itself—a source of infectious and spreading rot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-budner/the-rumsfeld-dilemma-dem_b_29550.html "The Rumsfeld Dilemma: Demand an Exit Strategy, Not a Facelift"] by Bruce Budner, in ''The Huffington Post'' 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[taxpayers]] money" frame, rather than [[government spending|public or government funds]], which implies that individual taxpayers have a claim or right to set [[government policy]] based upon their payment of tax rather than their status as [[citizen]]s or [[voters]] and that taxpayers have a right to control public funds that are the shared property of all citizens and also privileges individual self-interest above group interest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
* The "collective property" frame, which implies that property owned by individuals is really owned by a collective in which those individuals are members. This collective can be a territorial one, such as a nation, or an abstract one that does not map to a specific territory.
* Program-names that may describe only the intended effects of a program but may also imply their effectiveness. These include the following:
** "[[Foreign aid]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://hij.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/12/2/120 "Is It All in a Word? The Effect of Issue Framing on Public Support for U.S. Spending on HIV/AIDS in Developing Countries."] by Sara Bleich. Retrieved 2007-07-03
&lt;/ref&gt; (which implies that spending money will aid foreigners, rather than harm them)
** "[[Social security]]" (which implies that the program can be relied on to provide security for a society)
** "[[Stabilisation policy]]" (which implies that a policy will have a stabilizing effect).
* Based on [[opinion polling]] and [[focus group]]s, [[ecoAmerica]], a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm, has advanced the position that [[global warming]] is an ineffective framing due to its identification as a leftist advocacy issue. The organization has suggested to government officials and environmental groups that alternate formulations of the issues would be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/us/politics/02enviro.html "Seeking to Save the Planet, With a Thesaurus"] article by John M.

* In her 2009 book ''Frames of War'', [[Judith Butler]] argues that the justification within liberal-democracies for war, and atrocities committed in the course of war, (referring specifically to the current war in Iraq and to [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]] and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]]) entails a framing of the (especially Muslim) 'other' as pre-modern/primitive and ultimately not human in the same way as citizens within the liberal order.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J.

'''Fu Deng''' ({{zh|c=苻登}}; 343–394) was an [[emperor]] of the [[History of China|Chinese]]/[[Di (Wu Hu)|Di]] state [[Former Qin]].  He assumed the throne in 386 after the deaths of [[Fu Jiān]] (Emperor Xuanzhao) and Fu Jiān's son [[Fu Pi]] (Emperor Aiping), even though he was only a distant relative of theirs, as by that time Former Qin's territory had largely been reduced to the territory under his control.  He battled the [[Later Qin]] emperor [[Yao Chang]] for years in a stalemate that neither could conclusively prevail, but in 394, he made a major attack on Later Qin after Yao Chang's death, seriously underestimating Yao Chang's son and successor [[Yao Xing]], who captured and executed him.  Later that year, his son [[Fu Chong]], who succeeded him, would die in battle, ending Former Qin.&lt;ref name=Wei95&gt;{{cite book|url=http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/魏書/卷95|language=Chinese|title=Book of Wei|last=Wei Shou|authorlink=Wei Shou|chapter=列傳 匈奴劉聰 羯胡石勒 鐵弗劉虎 徒何慕容廆 臨渭氐苻健 羌姚萇 略陽氐吕光|trans-chapter=Biographies of Xiongnu Liu Cong, Jiewu Shi Le, Titfu Liu Hu, Tuhe Murong Hui, Linweidi Fu Jiān, Qiang Yao Chang, Lueyangdi Lü Guang|volume=Volume 95|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Fu Deng was born in 343, to Fu Chang (苻敞), a distant grandnephew of Former Qin's founder [[Fu Jiàn]], while still under [[Later Zhao]] rule.  After Fu Jiàn founded Former Qin in 351, Fu Chang served as a general and a commandery governor.  During the reign of Fu Jiàn's cruel and whimsical son [[Fu Sheng]] (r. 355–357), Fu Chang was executed, but he was posthumously honored after Fu Sheng was overthrown by his cousin [[Fu Jiān]].  Fu Jiān was impressed by Fu Deng's abilities, and when he grew older, Fu Deng was made the county magistrate of the capital [[Chang'an]].  Later, however, for unspecified faults, he was demoted to be the county magistrate for Didao (狄道, in modern [[Dingxi]], [[Gansu]]).

After Former Qin began to collapse in 384 and Fu Jiān was killed by the [[Later Qin]] general [[Yao Chang]] in 385, Fu Deng became a subordinate of the general Mao Xing (毛興), who sought to control all of the provinces in the west still nominally under Former Qin rule, but his soldiers became weary from all of the battles and assassinated him in 386, replacing him with Wei Ping (衛平), a very old general who was the head of the clan.  However, these soldiers soon became convinced that Wei was too old to accomplish much, and they deposed Wei and replaced him with Fu Deng.  Fu Deng submitted a report of these events to Fu Jiān's son [[Fu Pi]], the new emperor, and Fu Pi commissioned him as a provincial governor and created him the Prince of Nan'an.

The battles between Fu Deng and Yao Chang after the former replaced Wei Ping coincided with a time of droughts and famines. Fu Deng called the killed enemies ''shóushí'' (熟食, "cooked food" or "readied food") and told his soldiers, "Fight in the morning and you will have meat to eat in the evening. Why worry about hunger?" The soldiers followed his order, ate the corpses, and had the force for battles. Hearing this, Yao Chang hurried to call his brother Yao Shuode (姚碩德) for help, saying, "If you do not come, we are going to be eaten off by Fu Deng."&lt;ref&gt;晉書 卷一百一十五 載記第十五 "登既代衛平，遂專統征伐。是時歲旱眾饑，道殣相望，登每戰殺賊，名為熟食，謂軍人曰：「汝等朝戰，幕便飽肉，何憂於饑！」士眾從之，啖死人肉，輒飽健能鬥。姚萇聞之，急召碩德曰：「汝不來，必為苻登所食盡。」"&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 386, Fu Pi died in battle against [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]], and the territory under his direct control (modern [[Shanxi]]), as well as his officials, fell into the hands of the [[Western Yan]] emperor [[Murong Yong]].  His official Kou Qian (寇遣) escorted his sons Fu Yi (苻懿) the Prince of Bohai and Fu Chang (苻昶, note different character than Fu Deng's father) the Prince of Jibei to Fu Deng's domain.  Fu Deng, after mourning for Fu Pi, proposed to have Fu Yi declared emperor, but his subordinates all opined that given the state Former Qin was in (down to holding not much more than the territory under Fu Deng's control), the state needed an older emperor; at their suggestion, Fu Deng himself took the throne.  He made Fu Yi his [[crown prince]].

==Reign==

=== Before the Battle of Dajie ===
Even before he took imperial title, Fu Deng battled Yao Chang continuously, and the wars between Fu Deng and Yao Chang's Later Qin intensified after Fu Deng became Former Qin's emperor.  Fu Deng set up a shrine to Fu Jiān in his army, and whenever he made a key decision he would report it to Fu Jiān.  He was also described as a master of square and circular formations (although the exact mechanism is not understood well), and initially won a number of battles over Later Qin—so much so that Yao Chang, in fear, also set up a shrine dedicated to Fu Jiān in his army, apologizing for his killing of Fu Jiān and requesting forgiveness.  However, after that failed to yield victories, Yao Chang cut off the head of the effigy he had made of Fu Jiān and delivered to Fu Deng.  But Fu Deng's victories over Yao Chang did not appear to have lasting impact, and the wars between Former Qin and Later Qin became stalemated.  Meanwhile, Fu Deng's shortcomings became exposed—an inability to take decisive action to deal heavy damage to Later Qin, and Yao Chang took advantage of his indecisive tendencies to gradually destroy other semi-independent generals in the [[Guanzhong]] region and consolidate his power base.

In 387, Fu Deng created the ruler of [[Western Qin]], [[Qifu Guoren]], the Prince of Wanchuan, and Qifu Guoren accepted, signifying at least nominal submission to Fu Deng.  After Qifu Guoren died in 388 and was succeeded by his brother [[Qifu Gangui]], the relationship continued.

In summer 388, Fu Yi the Crown Prince died, and Fu Deng created his own son [[Fu Chong]] to be the crown prince.

In summer 389, a battle would greatly damage Fu Deng.  He had set up a base of operations at Dajie (大界, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]), guarded by his wife [[Empress Mao (Former Qin)|Empress Mao]], while attacking Later Qin's city of [[Pingliang]] and capturing it.  Meanwhile, however, Yao Chang made a surprise attack on Dajie, capturing and killing Empress Mao and Fu Deng's sons Fu Bian the Prince of Nan'an and Fu Shang the Prince of Beihai.  Some 50,000 of Fu Deng's people were captured.

===After the Battle of Dajie===
Then, Fu Deng gathered his remaining army and went back to Hu Kong Castle (胡空堡, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]). He promoted generals such as Dou Chong (竇沖), Yang Ding (楊定), and Yang Bi (楊璧). Fu Deng attacked Zhang Longshi (張龍世) in Yangquanbao (鴦泉堡). Yao Chang sent his generals to help Zhang and set up a trap. They pretended to surrender in order to catch Fu Deng. Fu Deng, initially believing in the false surrender, avoided to be fooled with the reminding of Lei Edi (雷惡地).&lt;ref&gt;晉書 卷一百一十五 載記第十五 "登收合餘兵，退據胡空堡，遣使齎書加竇沖大司馬、驃騎將軍、前鋒大都督、都督隴東諸軍事，楊定左丞相、上大將軍、都督中外諸軍事，楊璧大將軍、都督隴右諸軍事。遣沖率見眾為先驅，自繁川趣長安。登率眾從新平逕據新豐之千戶固。使定率隴上諸軍為其後繼，璧留守仇池。又命其並州刺史楊政、冀州刺史楊楷率所統大會長安。萇遣其將軍王破虜略地秦州，楊定及破虜戰于清水之格奴阪，大敗之。登攻張龍世於鴦泉堡，姚萇救之，登引退。萇密遣其將任瓫、宗度詐為內應，遣使招登，許開門納之。登以為然。雷惡地馳謂登曰：「姚萇多計略，善禦人，必為奸變，願深宜詳思。」登乃止。萇聞惡地之詣登也，謂諸將曰：「此羌多奸智，今其詣登，事必無成。」登聞萇懸門以待之，大驚，謂左右曰：「雷征東其殆聖乎！微此公，朕幾為豎子所誤。」"&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Battle of Dajie, Fu Deng appeared to be no longer able to again make major attacks against Later Qin, although the two states continued to battle continuously, and Yao Chang appeared to be equally unable to destroy Fu Deng.  However, Yao Chang continued the consolidation process by destroying other semi-independent generals, and Later Qin grew stronger and stronger.

In 392, Fu Deng created one of his concubines, [[Empress Li (Former Qin)|Consort Li]], empress.

Later in 392, Yao Chang grew ill, and Fu Deng, hearing this, made a major attack on the important Later Qin city Anding (安定, in modern [[Pingliang]], [[Gansu]]), but Yao Chang, in his illness, nevertheless faced him in battle, forcing Fu Deng to withdraw—and then, in the engagement, made a clean evasive maneuver with his troops and disengaged, to Fu Deng's surprise, and Fu Deng commented:

:''What kind of a man is Yao Chang?  I could not tell when he would go and when he would come.  Everyone thought that he is near death, but he lives to fight.  It is unfortunate that I live at the same time as this old Qiang.''

===Death===
Yao Chang died around the new year 394 and was succeeded by his son [[Yao Xing]].  While Yao Xing tried to keep news of Yao Chang's death a secret, the news still got to Fu Deng.  Fu Deng, extremely glad to hear about Yao Chang's death, prepared to launch a major assault against Later Qin—he had his brother Fu Guang (苻廣) defend the base of Yongcheng (雍城, in modern [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]]) and Fu Chong defend the base of Hu Kong Castle, and, in his anxiety, did not make sure that his army had sufficient water supply.  Yao Xing set up his army at Mawei (馬嵬, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]) to prevent Former Qin forces from reaching the river near Mawei, and Former Qin forces collapsed in thirst.  Upon hearing the defeat, Fu Guang and Fu Chong abandoned the two bases that they were holding, and Fu Deng was unable to recapture them.  He instead fled to Pingliang and then into the mountains.  He sent his son Fu Zong the Prince of Ruyin to Qifu Gangui and married his sister the [[Queen Fu|Princess Dongping]] to Qifu Gangui as his princess, seeking aid from Qifu Gangui.  Qifu Gangui sent his general Qifu Yizhou (乞伏益州) to aid Fu Deng, but as Fu Deng came out of the mountains to join Qifu Yizhou's forces, Yao Xing ambushed and captured him, and then executed him.  He disbanded Fu Deng's troops and gave Fu Deng's Empress Li to his general Yao Huang (姚晃).

{{Great Recession sidebar}}
As a direct result of the '''[[late 2000s recession]]''', some economies in [[Africa]] have been primarily affected by reduced global demand and lower prices of commodities such as oil, platinum, nickel, gold, and copper. [[South Africa]] was the first African country to fall in recession. Other countries like [[Morocco]] and [[Egypt]], which benefited from their previous high economic growth experienced a great decline due to the global economic crisis without falling in recession.

==South Africa==
[[Moody's Investors Service]] warned on July 7, 2008 that South Africa could slip into a recession by the turn of the year. Moody's cited electricity shortages, high interest rates, soaring inflation, a slumping housing and vehicle market and lower business and consumer confidence indicators. Growth in South Africa's real gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2008 slowed to 0.39%. CPIX inflation, the monetary-policy inflation target measure, rose 10.9% on a year-on-year basis in May, its highest level since November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/moodys-says-south-africa-may/story.aspx?guid=%7B8A9FE5B9-E704-4520-A54A-58096C0EE203%7D|title=Moody's says South Africa may slip into recession|publisher=Market Watch|date=2008-07-07|accessdate=2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa's National Treasury criticized the statement by Moody's saying, "It's not possible that we'll end up in recession." He added that the government may revise lower its 4 percent growth forecast for the year following growth of 5.1% in 2007. Car sales in South Africa dropped an annual 22 percent in June due to higher interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&amp;sid=aSsCu.e0KNew&amp;refer=africa|title=South Africa Says Moody's Recession Claim `Alarmist'|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=2008-07-09|accessdate=2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''He Jiankui''' ({{zh |s = 贺建奎}}; born 1984) is a Chinese [[biophysics]] researcher who is an associate professor in the Department of Biology of the [[Southern University of Science and Technology]] in [[Shenzhen]], China.

He became widely known in November 2018 after he said that he had created the first human [[Genome editing|genetically edited]] babies, twin girls known by their pseudonyms, '''Lulu''' ({{zh|c=露露|links=no}}) and '''Nana''' ({{zh|c=娜娜|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=Statuproar&gt;{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Sharon |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT News |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sina1127"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2018-11-27/doc-ihpevhck8869227.shtml|title=复盘贺建奎的人生轨迹：是谁给了他勇气|publisher=[[sina.com.cn]]|date=27 November 2018|accessdate=28 November 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The announcement was met with widespread condemnation, and on 29 November 2018, Chinese authorities suspended all He's research activities.&lt;ref name="CNN-20181129"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jiang |first1=Steven |last2=Regan |first2=Helen |last3=Berlinger |first3=Joshua |title=China suspends scientists who claim to have produced first gene-edited babies |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/health/china-gene-editing-he-jiankui-intl/index.html |date=29 November 2018 |work=CNN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Born in [[Xinhua County]], [[Loudi, Hunan]] in 1984,&lt;ref name="sina1127"/&gt; He Jiankui was educated at the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] as an undergraduate student from 2002 to 2006.&lt;ref name="sina1127"/&gt; He entered [[Rice University]] in 2007 and received his Ph.D degree in Biophysics under the supervision of Professor [[Michael W. Deem]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="sina1127"/&gt; After his PhD, he worked as a postdoc fellow with [[Stephen Quake]] at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=Statjkbio/&gt;  He moved back to China in 2012 under the [[Thousand Talents Program (China)|Thousand Talents Program]] and opened a lab at the [[Southern University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=Statjkbio/&gt; As part of the program, he was given 1 million yuan ($144,000) in angel funding, which he used to start biotech and investment companies.&lt;ref name=AK/&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP/&gt;  One of his startups is Direct Genomics, which is developing  [[single-molecule sequencing]] devices based on patents invented by Quake that had been formerly been licensed by [[Helicos Biosciences]].&lt;ref name=AK&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coleman |first1=Zach |title=The businesses behind the doctor who manipulated baby DNA |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/The-businesses-behind-the-doctor-who-manipulated-baby-DNA |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also founded Vienomics Biotech, which offers genome sequencing services for people with cancer.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite news |last1=He |first1=Laura |last2=Zhang |first2=Jane |last3=Moon |first3=Louise |title=Who are the investors supporting He Jiankui, the Chinese scientist behind the gene-edited babies? |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2175486/who-are-investors-supporting-he-jiankui-chinese-scientist |work=South China Morning Post |date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took an unpaid leave from the university starting in February 2018, and began conducting the genome-editing clinical trial.&lt;ref name="NatureNews1126"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cyranoski|first1=David|last2=Ledford|first2=Heidi|date=26 November 2018|title=Genome-edited baby claim provokes international outcry|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=563|issue=7733|pages=607–608|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-07545-0|pmid=30482929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marchione |first1=Marilyn |title=Chinese researcher claims first gene-edited babies |url=https://www.apnews.com/4997bb7aa36c45449b488e19ac83e86d |work=AP NEWS |date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sina"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2018-11-26/doc-ihmutuec3827836.shtml|title=南科大：贺建奎2月已停薪留职 项目违背学术伦理|last=|first=|date=2018-11-26|website=Sina|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 November 2018, Chinese authorities suspended all He's research activities, saying He's work was "extremely abominable in nature" and a violation of Chinese law.&lt;ref name="CNN-20181129"/&gt;

==Research ==
In 2010, at [[Rice University]], He and [[Michael W. Deem]] published a paper describing some details of the [[CRISPR]] protein; this paper was part of the early work on the [[CRISPR/Cas9]] system, before it had been adopted as a [[Genome editing|gene editing]]  tool.&lt;ref name=Statjkbio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Joseph |first1=Andrew |last2=Robbins |first2=Rebecca |last3=Begley |first3=Sharon |title=An outsider claimed genome-editing history; the world snapped to attention |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/he-jiankui-gene-edited-babies-china/ |work=STAT News |date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, He gave a presentation at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory describing work he did at Southern University of Science and Technology, in which he used CRISPR/Cas9 on mice, monkeys, and around 300 human embryos.&lt;ref name=MITTR/&gt;

==Clinical trial==
[[File:He Jiankui at Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing.jpg|thumb|He speaking at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing]]

He's human gene-editing clinical trial was conducted without public discussion in the scientific community; it was first made public on November 25, 2018 when ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' published a story about the work, based on documents that had been posted earlier that month on the Chinese [[clinical trials registry]]. After that story posted, He released a promotional video on YouTube and the next day the ''Associated Press'' published an interview with He.&lt;ref name=MITTR&gt;{{cite news |last1=Regalado |first1=Antonio |title=Chinese scientists are creating CRISPR babies |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612458/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/|work=MIT Technology Review |date=November 25, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; He had engaged a public relations firm as well.&lt;ref name=Statjkbio/&gt;  He eventually presented the work on November 27 at the International Human Genome Editing Summit in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=Statuproar/&gt;

The trial had recruited couples who wanted to have children; in order to participate, the man had to be [[HIV]]-positive and the woman, uninfected.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;  The couples were recruited through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;  As of 28 November, it was unclear whether the clinical trial had received appropriate ethical review from an [[institutional review board]] before it started, and it was unclear if the participants had given truly [[informed consent]].&lt;ref name=Statuproar/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

He said that he took sperm and eggs from the couples, performed [[in vitro fertilization]] with them, and then [[genome editing|edited the genomes]] of the embryos using [[CRISPR/Cas9]].&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;  The editing targeted a gene, ''[[CCR5]]'', that codes for a protein that HIV-1 uses to enter cells.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181128"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/asia/gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html|title=Chinese Scientist Who Says He Edited Babies’ Genes Defends His Work|last=Belluck|first=Pam|date=28 November 2018|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15556703"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Silva E, Stumpf MP | title = HIV and the CCR5-Delta32 resistance allele | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 241 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = Dec 2004 | pmid = 15556703 | doi = 10.1016/j.femsle.2004.09.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was trying to create a specific mutation in the gene, ([[CCR5-Δ32|CCR5 Δ32]]), that few people naturally have and that possibly confers [[innate resistance to HIV|innate resistance to HIV-1]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20181128"/&gt; as seen in the case of [[the Berlin Patient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=«Menschenversuche»: Geburt genmanipulierter Babys verkündet |url=https://www.stern.de/panorama/crispr-cas9-verfahren--menschenversuche---geburt-genmanipulierter-babys-verkuendet-8464784.html |work=Stern |date=26 November 2018 |language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Twin girls were conceived as a result of the in vitro fertilization. He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 given [[mosaicism]] inherent in the present state of the art in germ-line editing.&lt;ref name="Statuproar" /&gt; 

He said that he used a [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] process on the embryos that were edited, where three to five single cells were removed and the editing was checked. He said that parents were offered the choice of using edited or unedited embryos.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

The twin girls were born in late October or early November; He said that they appeared to be healthy.&lt;ref name=Statuproar/&gt;  When they were born, it was unclear if there might be long-term effects from the gene-editing; He was asked about his plans to monitor the children, and pay for their care should any problems arise, and how their confidentiality and that of their parents could remain protected.&lt;ref name=Statuproar/&gt; The names of the children used in reports, "Lulu" and "Nana", and the names of their parents, "Mark" and "Grace", are pseudonyms.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181126"&gt;{{cite news |author=Reuters |title=China Orders Investigation After Scientist Claims First Gene-Edited Babies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/11/26/world/asia/26reuters-health-china-babies-genes.html |date=26 November 2018 |work=The New York Times|dead-url=no |archive-url=https://archive.today/20181127002913/https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/11/26/world/asia/26reuters-health-china-babies-genes.html |archive-date=27 November 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He also said at the meeting, that a second mother in his clinical trial was in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Statuproar/&gt;

===Reactions===
Once the existence of the clinical trial was made public, He's conduct was widely condemned.&lt;ref name="SN-20181126"&gt;{{cite news |last=Begley |first=Sharon |title=Claim of CRISPR’d baby girls stuns genome editing summit |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/claim-of-crispred-baby-girls-stuns-genome-editing-summit/ |date=26 November 2018 |work=STAT News|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127014126/https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/claim-of-crispred-baby-girls-stuns-genome-editing-summit/|archive-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20181126"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MITTR/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20181127"/&gt; 

Chinese scientists and institutions harshly criticized He; an article in ''Nature'' stated that concerns about He's conduct were "particularly acute in China, where scientists are sensitive to the country’s reputation as the Wild West of biomedical research".&lt;ref name="NAT-20181127"/&gt;

Geneticist [[Eric Topol]] stated, "This is far too premature .. We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal."&lt;ref name="NYT-201781127"&gt;{{cite news |author=Eric Topol |authorlink=Eric Topol |title=Editing Babies?

Church|George Church]], a [[geneticist]] at [[Harvard University]], said gene editing for HIV resistance was "justifiable" since HIV is "a major and growing public health threat", but questioned the decision of this project to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, since the use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ "main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease".&lt;ref name="CNBC-20181126"/&gt;

[[Arthur Caplan]], bioethicist at the [[New York University School of Medicine]], said that engineering human genes is inevitable and, although there are concerns of creating "[[designer babies]]", medical researchers are more interested in using the technology to prevent and treat diseases, much like the type of experiments performed by He.&lt;ref name="HP-20181127"&gt;{{cite news |last=Almendrala |first=Anna |title=World’s First Gene-Edited Babies Could Set Genetic Science Backward, Experts Worry |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gene-edited-babies-hiv-scientists_us_5bfd80eae4b0771fb6bed214 |date=27 November 2018 |work=Huffington Post|dead-url=no |archive-url=https://perma.cc/XP2M-8TMB |archive-date=27 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Zimmer]] compared the reaction to He's human gene editing experiment to the initial reactions and subsequent debate over [[mitochondrial replacement therapy]] (MRT), and the eventual regulatory approval of MRT in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181201"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Genetically Modified People Are Walking Among Us |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/sunday-review/crispr-china-babies-gene-editing.html |date=1 December 2018 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
The Southern University of Science and Technology stated that He had been on unpaid leave since February 2018, and his research was conducted outside of their campus; the university and He's department said they were unaware of the research project and said it was inviting international experts to form an independent committee to investigate the incident, and would release the results to the public.&lt;ref name="Sina"/&gt; Local authorities and the Chinese government also opened investigations.&lt;ref name="CNN-20181129"/&gt;

[[Michael W. Deem]], his doctoral advisor at [[Rice University]], was involved in the clinical trial, and was present when people involved in He's study gave consent.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;  Deem came under investigation by Rice after news of the work was made public.&lt;ref name="CNN-20181127"&gt;{{cite news |last=LaMotte |first=Sandee |title=Rice professor under investigation for role in 'world's first gene-edited babies' |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/27/health/gene-edited-babies-rice-investigates-professor/index.html |date=27 November 2018 |work=CNN News|dead-url=no |archive-url=https://perma.cc/74PP-TRUE |archive-date=27 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kamen Rider Ryuki'''''|仮面ライダー龍騎|Kamen Raidā Ryūki|''Masked Rider Ryuki''}} is a Japanese [[tokusatsu]] television series. The twelfth installment in the [[Kamen Rider Series]] of tokusatsu shows, it was a joint collaboration between [[Ishimori Productions]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]], and it was shown on [[TV Asahi]] from February 3, 2002 to January 19, 2003. The series marked the franchise's switch from [[Nippon Columbia|Columbia Music Entertainment]] to [[Avex Group]], which continues to produce music for the Kamen Rider Series today.

In 2009, ''Ryuki'' was adapted into the American television series ''[[Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight]]'', the first adaptation of a Kamen Rider Series in the United States since ''[[Masked Rider (TV series)|Saban's Masked Rider]]'' in 1996.

==Story==
{{Main|List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters}}
{{nihongo|Thirteen Card Decks|カードデッキ|Kādo Dekki}} were created for thirteen Kamen Riders. They make Contracts with monsters from the mysterious {{nihongo|Mirror World|ミラーワールド|Mirā Wārudo}}, a parallel dimension opposite to our own in which only the Kamen Riders can exist. The Riders draw on their monsters' strength in exchange for feeding them the life force of the creatures they destroy. The creator of the {{nihongo|Advent Cards|アドベントカード|Adobento Kādo}} has only one rule: that there can be only one Kamen Rider. The others must be killed, and the sole victor will be granted a single wish, which leads to a conflict known as the Rider War.

All over the city, innocent people are being mysteriously abducted, never to be seen again. During his investigations of these incidents, Shinji Kido – an intern at the online news service ORE Journal – discovers one of the Advent Card decks at an apartment where every reflective surface has been covered by newspaper. He is soon sucked into the Mirror World, discovering the terrifying truth behind the disappearances: people are literally being pulled through mirrors by the monsters of the Mirror World so that they may feed. He is about to be killed by a powerful dragon named Dragredder when he is saved by [[Kamen Rider Knight]]: Ren Akiyama. Ren seeks to win the Rider War at all costs. He works with a young woman named Yui Kanzaki, who seeks her missing brother: the master of the Rider War, Shiro Kanzaki. Seeing Ren's strength, Shinji enters the Rider War not for the prize, but so that he may protect innocent people from the threat of the Mirror World, and stop the senseless fighting between the Kamen Riders. With Dragredder as his Contract Monster, he becomes [[Kamen Rider Ryuki (character)|Kamen Rider Ryuki]].

He will discover that there are some people who cannot be saved. That you must sometimes fight in order to stop the fighting. The extent to which you must go if you want your deepest wish to come true, and the sacrifices that you must make. In the end, there can be only one Kamen Rider.

==Movies and specials==

===''13 Riders''===
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Ryuki Special: 13 Riders''|仮面ライダー龍騎スペシャル 13RIDERS|Kamen Raidā Ryūki Supesharu Sātīn Raidāzu}} was written by [[Toshiki Inoue]] and directed by [[Ryuta Tasaki]]. It features the debut of the thirteenth Kamen Rider in the continuity of ''Ryuki'': [[Kamen Rider Verde|Verde]]. This special was first broadcast on [[TV Asahi]] on September 19, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toei-video.co.jp/data/hs/vcatalog_dvd/item/200307/dstd02180.html|title=仮面ライダー龍騎スペシャル　［13RIDERS］|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=239972|title=TVM 仮面ライダー龍騎　スペシャル［13RIDERS］ - allcinema|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released on DVD on July 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://movie.news.livedoor.com/dvd/detail-2203060008.html |title=仮面ライダー龍騎スペシャル 13 RIDERS - 映画 - livedoor ニュース |accessdate=2010-09-13 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD also featured information on the characters, an interview with actor [[Arthur Kuroda]], and an "interview" with some of the characters.

This television special is an alternate telling of the ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'' story. Shinji Kido's life, working as an employee at ORE Journal, takes a sharp turn after being pulled into the Mirror World by a Mispider. Luckily, he was saved by a Kamen Rider, Ryuki (Koichi Sakakibara, portrayed by [[Keiichi Wada]]). However, Sakakibara could no longer go on due to the severity of his injuries and passed his Card Deck to Shinji, allowing him to become the next Ryuki and defeat the monster. After meeting with Yui Kanzaki and Ren Akiyama (Kamen Rider Knight), Shinji learns about the conditions of the Rider War, as well as of the other Riders participating. Unable to allow such a game of death to exist like his Rider predecessor, Shinji sets out to convince all the Riders to end the senseless fighting and put an end to the War. His pleas fall upon deaf ears as just about every other Rider (except for the already-defeated Riders Raia and Scissors) sets out to hunt down Shinji and his eventual reluctant ally, Ren. Eventually, Shinji's deck is destroyed and Ren dies, after passing on the deck for Kamen Rider Knight to Shinji. The special has two different endings which were voted on by the viewers via phone at the time of the initial airing: the voted-for-air ending (in which Shinji faces the surviving Riders on his own) and the alternate ending (a resetting of the Rider War).

===''Episode Final''===
{{Main|Kamen Rider Ryuki: Episode Final}}
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Ryuki the Movie: Episode Final''|劇場版 仮面ライダー龍騎 EPISODE FINAL|Gekijōban Kamen Raidā Ryūki Episōdo Fainaru}} is an alternate ending to the series, taking place after the events of episode 46. With only six Riders remaining in the Rider War; Ryuki (Shinji Kido), Knight (Ren Akiyama), Zolda (Shuichi Kitaoka), Ouja (Takeshi Asakura), and Femme (Miho Kirishima); Shiro Kanzaki alerts them to quickly settle the Rider War within three days. One of them must win and become the last survivor before the sixth surviving Rider reveals himself. Amidst the impending chaos of the fight between the Riders, Shinji discovers an unbelievable truth about the relationship between Yui Kanzaki and the Mirror World, as well as discovering the existence of his Mirror World doppelganger, Kamen Rider Ryuga.

===''Ryuki vs. Kamen Rider Agito''===
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Ryuki: Ryuki vs. Kamen Rider Agito''|仮面ライダー龍騎 龍騎vs仮面ライダーアギト|Kamen Raidā Ryūki Ryūki Bui Esu Kamen Raidā Agito}} is the ''Ryuki'' Hyper Battle Video. It features Shinji Kido having a dream where he joins up with Kamen Riders Knight, Zolda, and Ouja, all of whom who are acting out of character, to fight an evil Kamen Rider Agito in the Mirror World. They are soon joined by the real Kamen Rider Agito who helps defeat his evil doppelganger.

===''Ultra Super Hero Taisen''===
{{main article|Kamen Rider × Super Sentai: Ultra Super Hero Taisen}}
A crossover film, titled {{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider × Super Sentai: Ultra Super Hero Taisen''|仮面ライダー×スーパー戦隊 超スーパーヒーロー大戦|Kamen Raidā × Supā Sentai Chō Supā Hīrō Taisen}} featuring the casts of ''[[Kamen Rider Ex-Aid]]'', ''[[Amazon Riders]]'', ''[[Uchu Sentai Kyuranger]]'' and ''[[Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger]]'', was released in Japan on March 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-26/kamen-rider-x-super-sentai-cho-superhero-taisen-film-announced-for-march-25-premiere/.110365 |title=Kamen Rider x Super Sentai: Chō Superhero Taisen Film Announced for March 25 Premiere - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2016-12-26 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie will celebrate 10th anniversary of ''[[Kamen Rider Den-O]]'' who also appear in this movie. It also features the spaceship Andor Genesis from the ''[[Xevious]]'' game, which serves to be used by the movie's main antagonists, as well as introducing the movie-exclusive Kamen Rider True Brave played by Kamen Rider Brave's actor [[Toshiki Seto]] from ''Kamen Rider Ex-Aid'', and villain Shocker Great Leader III played by the singer [[Diamond Yukai]]. In addition, individual actors from older Kamen Rider and Super Sentai TV series, [[Ryohei Odai]] (''Kamen Rider Ryuki''), [[Gaku Matsumoto]] (''[[Shuriken Sentai Ninninger]]''), [[Atsushi Maruyama]] (''[[Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger]]''), and [[Hiroya Matsumoto]] (''[[Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters]]'') reprise their respective roles.

==S.I.C. Hero Saga==
''Ryuki'' had two separate [[Super Imaginative Chogokin|S.I.C.]] Hero Saga side stories published in ''Monthly Hobby Japan'' magazine. The first was titled {{nihongo4|''Masked Rider Ryuki: Advent Calendar''|MASKED RIDER RYUKI -アドベントカレンダー-|Kamen Raidā Ryūki -Adobento Karendā-}} and featured original characters {{nihongo4|[[Kamen Rider Ouja]] Survive|仮面ライダー王蛇サバイブ|Kamen Raidā Ōja Sabaibu}} and his Mirror Monster the {{nihongo4|Genosurviver|ジェノサバイバー|Jenosabaibā}}. The second S.I.C. Hero Saga story {{nihongo4|''Masked Rider Ryuki: World of If''|MASKED RIDER RYUKI -IFの世界-|Kamen Raidā Ryūki -Ifu no Sekai-}} is an alternate telling that features Ouja Survive from ''Advent Calendar'' and also introduces {{nihongo4|[[Kamen Rider Ryuga]] Survive|仮面ライダーリュウガサバイブ|Kamen Raidā Ryūga Sabaibu}}. ''Advent Calendar'' ran from August to December 2004 and ''World of If'' ran from June to August 2005.

The '''killing of Tim McLean''' occurred on the evening of July 30, 2008. McLean, a 22-year-old [[Canadians|Canadian]] man, was stabbed, [[Decapitation|beheaded]] and [[Cannibalism|cannibalized]] while riding a [[Greyhound Canada]] bus about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Portage la Prairie]], [[Manitoba]], travelling the [[Trans-Canada Highway]].

==Incident==
The incident took place near [[Portage la Prairie]], [[Manitoba]], during a trip from [[Edmonton]] to McLean's hometown of [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/08/01/stabbing-victim.html "Suspect in bus killing delivered newspapers, worked at McDonald's"], [[CBC.ca]], August 1, 2008.

At 12:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 30, 2008, Tim McLean (October 3, 1985 – July 30, 2008), a [[carny|carnival barker]], was returning home to Manitoba after working at a fair in [[Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Accused still hears voices, as much a victim as beheaded passenger: psychiatrist|journal=Canadian Press|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2009|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5g6yzZOswjctLEjNXiUzmeHDRbY2w}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2009-2010/bus_1170/timeline.html |title=CBC: Fifth Estate Timeline |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100715171115/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2009-2010/bus_1170/timeline.html | archive-date = July 15, 2010 | dead-url = unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; He departed Edmonton on board Greyhound bus 1170 to Winnipeg, via the [[Yellowhead Highway]] through Saskatchewan. He sat at the rear, one row ahead of the toilet. At 6:55&amp;nbsp;p.m., the bus departed from a stop in [[Erickson, Manitoba|Erickson]], Manitoba, with a new passenger, Vince Weiguang Li.&lt;ref name="GM080806"&gt;Friesen, Joe.

Accessed August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt; Li, described as a tall man in his 40s, with a shaved head and sunglasses, originally sat near the front of the bus, but moved to sit next to McLean following a scheduled rest stop. McLean "barely acknowledged" Li, then fell asleep against the window pane, headphones covering his ears.&lt;ref name="globemail"&gt;Friesen, Joe. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080801.DEATH01/TPStory/National A quiet ride - then carnage], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 1, 2008. Accessed August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to witnesses, McLean was sleeping with his headphones on when the man sitting next to him suddenly produced a large knife and began stabbing McLean in the neck and chest. The bus driver pulled to the side of the road so that he and all the other passengers could exit the vehicle. The attacker then decapitated McLean and displayed his severed head to other passengers standing outside. The driver and two other men had attempted to rescue McLean but were chased away by Li, who slashed at them from behind the locked bus doors. Li then went back to McLean's body and began severing other parts and consuming some of his victim's flesh.

At 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) in Portage la Prairie received a report of a stabbing on a Greyhound bus west of the city. They arrived to find the suspect still on board the bus, being prevented from escaping by another passenger, the bus driver, and a truck driver who had provided a crowbar and a hammer as weapons. The other passengers were huddled at the roadside, some of them crying and vomiting. As the suspect had earlier attempted to escape by driving the bus away, the driver had engaged the emergency [[immobiliser]] system, rendering the vehicle inoperable. Witnesses had observed the suspect stabbing and cutting McLean's body, and carrying McLean's severed head.&lt;ref name="globemail"/&gt;

By 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., police were in a standoff with the suspect and had summoned special negotiators and a heavily armed [[SWAT|tactical unit]]. The suspect alternately paced the length of the bus and defiled the corpse. Police officers then observed Li eating parts of the body.&lt;ref name="GM080806"/&gt;  Meanwhile, the stranded passengers were transported from the scene to be interviewed at the Brandon RCMP detachment.&lt;ref name="globemail"/&gt; RCMP officers reportedly heard Li say, "I have to stay on the bus forever."&lt;ref name="GM080806"/&gt;

On July 31, 2008, at 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., the suspect attempted to escape from the bus by breaking through a window. The RCMP arrested Li soon afterward.&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;Kitching, Chris.

Parts of the victim's body, placed in plastic bags, were retrieved from the bus, while his ear, nose and tongue were found in Li's pockets. The RCMP drew criticism from members of the public who wondered why the police did not immediately board the bus and arrest Li; indeed, the officers did not at any time enter the vehicle. The victim's eyes and a part of his heart were never recovered and are presumed to have been eaten by Li.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"&gt;{{cite news

At 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., Greyhound representatives took the other passengers to a local store to replace their clothes, which remained on the bus. They arrived in Winnipeg at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day, to be reunited with family members and friends.&lt;ref name="globemail"/&gt;

The psychiatrist Stanley Yaren, who later examined Li, said Li was hospitalized in 2003 or 2004 after an incident with the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/03/03/man_pleads_not_guilty_in_bus_beheading.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked in Winnipeg at menial jobs at Grant Memorial Church for six months to support his wife, Anna. Pastor Tom Castor, who employed Li, said he seemed happy to have a job and was committed to doing it well, despite a language barrier with other congregation members.

"I think he would occasionally feel frustrated with not being able to communicate or understand," Castor told [[CKY-TV|CTV Winnipeg]]. "But we have a very patient staff and he seemed to respond well." Castor also said Li did not show any signs of anger issues or any other trouble before he quit in the spring of 2005. He worked as a forklift operator in Winnipeg while his wife worked as a waitress.

Li first moved to [[Edmonton]] in 2006, abruptly leaving his wife alone in Winnipeg until she joined him later.&lt;ref name="calgaryherald"&gt;[[Steve Lillebuen]], Jennifer Yang.

Four weeks before the killing, he was fired from Wal-Mart following a "disagreement" with other employees.&lt;ref name="calgaryherald"/&gt; Shortly before the incident, Li asked for time off from his delivery job to go to Winnipeg for a job interview.

===July 29, 2008===
At 12:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. July 28 in Edmonton, Li boarded a Greyhound bus bound for Winnipeg.

On July 29, around 6&amp;nbsp;p.m., Li got off the bus in [[Erickson, Manitoba|Erickson]], Manitoba, with at least three pieces of luggage, and stayed the night on a bench next to a grocery store. According to one witness, he was seen at 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. sitting bolt upright with eyes wide open.&lt;ref name="GM080806"/&gt;

On the morning of July 30, still at the bench, he sold his new laptop computer to a 15-year-old boy, Darren Beatty, for $60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Giroday, Gabrielle|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/story/4208695p-4801212c.html|title=Li sold laptop before slaying|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003059/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/story/4208695p-4801212c.html|archivedate=August 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Friesen, Joe |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080805.wbus06/BNStory/National/home |title='Please kill me,' accused pleads |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= August 5, 2008|accessdate=February 19, 2011 |location=Toronto|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810005604/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080805.wbus06/BNStory/National/home|archivedate=August 10, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laptop was seized by the RCMP as evidence; the boy was subsequently given a new laptop for his honesty by an anonymous businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjad.com/news/565/766980 |title=Montreal businessman to help Manitoba boy who bought laptop off accused killer |last=Parent |first=Tim |date=August 6, 2008 |work=cjad.com |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102033631/http://www.cjad.com/news/565/766980 |archivedate=November 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witness Garnet Caton said the attacker seemed oblivious to others when the stabbing occurred, adding he was struck by how calm the man was. "There was no rage or anything. He was like a robot, stabbing the guy," he said. When he appeared in a Portage la Prairie courthouse on charges of second-degree murder, the only words Li reportedly uttered were pleas for someone to kill him.&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt;

===Trial===
Li's trial commenced on March 3, 2009, with Li [[plea]]ding not criminally responsible (''aka'' [[insanity defense]]). This means he accepted that the offence occurred but claimed that he was unable to form the necessary mental element or ''[[mens rea]]''.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"/&gt; The psychiatrist said that Li performed the attack because God's voice told him McLean was a force of evil and was about to execute him. The presiding judge, [[John Scurfield]], accepted the diagnosis, and ruled that Li was not criminally responsible for the killing.&lt;ref name="Mental Health Ward"/&gt; Li was remanded to the [[Selkirk, Manitoba|Selkirk]] Mental Health Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2010/07/30/mb-vince-li-walks-mental-health-centre-selkirk.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|title=Killer Vince Li to walk in unfenced area|accessdate=December 18, 2010|date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The week following the attack, [[Greyhound Canada]] announced it was pulling a series of nationwide advertisements which included the slogan, "There's a reason you've never heard of bus rage." The incident has led to numerous calls and petitions demanding increased security on intercity buses.&lt;ref&gt;Rynor, Becky.

On June 3, 2010, Li was granted supervised outdoor walks within his mental health facility as voted by the provincial review board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2010/06/03/mb-vince-li-priveleges-winnipeg.html#socialcomments |title=Li granted walks supervised outside |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2014, the CBC reported that on March 6, Li would be allowed to have unsupervised visits to Selkirk, starting at 30 minutes and expanding to full-day trips.

On February 10, 2017, the Manitoba Criminal Code Review Board ordered Li be discharged. Li was granted an absolute discharge.

On July 9, 2018, Greyhound Canada announced that they would end virtually all service across Western Canada, including the Trans Canada route where McLean was murdered. The precipitous drop in ridership that led to the service cancellations was cited by multiple Canadian politicians as having been caused by McLean's murder.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Life in Color''' is a United States-based [[electronic dance music|EDM]] event company, best known for their ongoing "paint party" '''''Life in Color''''' [[concert tour]]s. The company was founded by [[Sebastian Solano]], [[Paul Campbell (American entrepreneur)|Paul Campbell]], [[Lukasz Tracz]] and [[Patryk Tracz]] as [[Committee Entertainment]] and the concert tour '''Dayglow''' in 2006. Billed by its organizers as the "world's largest paint party", the tour features performances by [[electronic music]]ians, joined by artistic performers and the tour's signature spraying of the audience with [[paint]] throughout the show. The company changed to its current name shortly after it was acquired by [[Robert F. X. Sillerman]]'s [[SFX Entertainment]] in late 2012, with the original founders remaining as partners.

Beginning in 2013, the promotion began to produce '''Life in Color Festival''', a [[music festival]] with multiple stages and a larger lineup of performers. Life in Color's annual festival event in [[Miami]] is considered to be its flagship.

==Event elements==
CEO Sebastian Solano has described the increasingly choreographed Life in Color events as being "almost like a Broadway show, but with such an energized crowd you would need to see it to believe it"; the shows feature live sets by DJs accompanied by various artistic, [[circus]]-styled performers. Throughout the show, the audience is sprayed with non-toxic paint through various means (including hoses on-stage and personal paint bottles); attendees are encouraged to dress in white clothing to serve as a "[[canvas]]" for the paint.&lt;ref name=lantern-dayglow/&gt;&lt;ref name=philly-paintrush/&gt; A countdown is also held to a special "paint blast" during the show, which features a mixture of paint and [[confetti]].&lt;ref name=lantern-dayglow/&gt;

==Company history==

===2006: The Committee===
{{Main|Committee Entertainment}}
Life in Color was founded as Dayglow by four students living in [[Florida]] in 2006. [[Sebastian Solano]], [[Paul Campbell (American entrepreneur)|Paul Campbell]], [[Lukasz Tracz]] and [[Patryk Tracz]] all were housemates at an apartment on the [[Florida State University]] (FSU)&lt;ref name="lifencoltora"/&gt; campus.&lt;ref name="bocama"/&gt; That year all four&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; began throwing themed&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; "super extravagant house parties" on a monthly basis, bringing in DJ Climax for the music.&lt;ref name="fsolanoBRAIN"/&gt; Reinvesting the monthly profits, often at a loss, eventually they began renting "half a nightclub" at a time with bottle and limousine service, then bringing the party back to their house afterwards.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; As the parties grew in size and popularity, the four founders named themselves '''Committee Entertainment''', planning events as partners.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; All founders were avid fans of [[house music]], and took different roles.&lt;ref name="gsolanoEDM"/&gt; Clubs soon began paying the small company to bring their parties, and according to Solano, they were some of the few local promoters at the time to focus on EDM.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt;

|style="text-align: left;"|"[The first DayGlow party I attended] was at a house. There were 300 kids throwing paint all over each other, and [[house music]] was rockin' the whole place..."
|-
|style="text-align: left;"|— CEO Sebastian Solano in 2013&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt;
|}
Soon a friend introduced Solano to an informal party series called Dayglow, "a fraternity and sorority tradition at FSU" that involved hundreds of college students in white shirts throwing non-toxic paint on one-another.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; Solano had recently discovered [[ID&amp;T]]'s travelling event series [[Sensation (event)|Sensation]], explaining to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that "I just couldn't believe that a party could be taken to a level where 50,000 people would show up in a stadium. Just to party, right? Not for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. But just for an actual party. Immediately, I started to go deep into research on Sensation, ID&amp;T and founder Duncan Stutterheim. It just really interested me." After experiencing a Dayglow event, Solano felt that it could become the "Sensation of America", and began to pursue the idea of a traveling Dayglow tour.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-licceo/&gt;

He and Committee Entertainment registered [[trademark]]s for Dayglow,&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; and in 2007 their first Dayglow event was held in a Miami nightclub called Allure, with close to 600 attendees.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; The company then contacted other Florida cities such as [[Orlando]], [[Tampa]], and [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], and began pitching the Dayglow parties.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; Eventually they decided to rent out the [[UCF Arena]], though Solano stated that at the time, they "had no idea how to do a real concert."&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; All four founders dropped out of college to pursue the venture.&lt;ref name=philly-paintrush/&gt;

===2007-11: Dayglow events===
[[File:Lukasz Tracz and his twin brother Patryk Tracz directing their new Life In Color Unleash Tour commercial in Miami Florida, January 2014.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Lukasz Tracz]] and his twin brother [[Patryk Tracz]] directing their new Life In Color Unleash Tour commercial in Miami Florida, January 2014]]
As the tour increased in popularity, the shows grew more extravagant in nature: booking larger acts and increasing the magnitude of its artistic elements.&lt;ref name=philly-paintrush/&gt; When the Dayglow tour started traveling to cities outside of Florida, the founders custom-built paint cannons and guns, also hiring someone from [[Cirque du Soleil]] to run their performance department.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; Solano stated in an interview with [[Pollstar]] that "We were the first dance music brand, including DJs, to ever do a college tour. Once we did our first college tour, 25 colleges, and sold out every show in about five minutes."&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; By 2009 the tour had become more established, and in 2009 and 2010, a ''Dayglow'' stage was held at [[Ultra Music Festival]].&lt;ref name=morningcall-glow/&gt;

The 2011 Dayglow tour was entitled ''BLU'', standing for "Beats, Love, and Unity"; symbolically, the events featured a special paint blast with blue paint.&lt;ref name=morningcall-glow/&gt; Also in 2011 shows were held at locations such as the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], with headliners such as [[Roger Sanchez]] and [[Diplo]].&lt;ref name=philly-paintrush/&gt; A 2011 stop at [[Stabler Arena]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] was met with such high demand that, after an initial sell-out, it was moved to [[Lehigh University]]'s larger Rauch Fieldhouse: the additional tickets quickly sold out as well.&lt;ref name=morningcall-glow/&gt; However, following the event, 6 attendees were arrested for [[substance intoxication|intoxication]] and [[disorderly conduct]], while 35 attendees were sent to local hospitals with symptoms of [[dehydration]] and possible drug or alcohol use{{emdash}}Robert Mateff, the [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]]'s Director of Emergency Management, considered the scenario to be "atypical" for a planned event in the area. Organizers stated that all attendees were checked for alcohol and other illegal substances before entering.&lt;ref name=lvl-35arrested/&gt;

===2012: Acquisition by SFX===
{{See also|SFX Entertainment}}
According to Solano, dance music promoter Disco Donnie served as an early mentor to DayGlow,&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; and on Donnie's recommendation they held back from selling for several years. In 2012 Donnie then connected Solano with investor [[Robert F. X. Sillerman|Bob Sillerman]], who at the time was putting together the media conglomerate [[SFX Entertainment]]. After negotiations, DayGlow agreed to sell the franchise to SFX, becoming SFX's second acquisition after Disco Donnie. Stated Solano, "It wasn’t just about the money but it was about the people we were going to be working with... people like [[Shelly Finkel]], Bob Sillerman and Mitch Slater." Also, "[We liked] the idea of SFX being global."&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; After the acquisition by SFX, all four founders remained executives in the company.&lt;ref name=LinkedIna/&gt;&lt;ref name="asdffdbillboard"/&gt;

Shortly after its acquisition, the company announced in September 2012 that it would re-brand itself as Life in Color.&lt;ref name=billboard-voodoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrp-lic/&gt; The company's late-2012 tour was entitled ''The E.N.D.: Electronic Never Dies''.&lt;ref name=acw-licnye/&gt;&lt;ref name=poac-licnye/&gt; On December 31, 2012, a special ''Life in Color NYE Bash'' was held and [[webcast]] from [[Atlantic City]], headlined by [[Steve Aoki]], [[Tommy Trash]], and [[Adventure Club]].&lt;ref name=acw-licnye/&gt;&lt;ref name=poac-licnye/&gt;

===2013-present: Festivals, international expansion===
[[File:Sun Life Stadium Coast Guard flyover.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The first Life in Color Festival was held in the parking lot of the [[Hard Rock Stadium]] (pictured) in [[Miami, Florida]]]]
The 2013 tour was entitled ''Life in Color Rebirth''.&lt;ref name=tcc-rebirth/&gt; It toured in over 25 countries, with a plan to expand the following year.&lt;ref name="esolanoinside"/&gt; At that point, headlining DJs had included [[Afrojack]], [[Axwell]], [[Alesso]], [[Benny Benassi]], [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]], [[R3hab]], etc. Regular features in shows beyond "paint blasts" included "aerial acts, [[stilts|stilt]] walkers, [[contortionist]]s, and fire shows."&lt;ref name="bsolanolifeincolor"/&gt; In 2013, Life in Color began to hold larger [[music festival]] events, featuring multiple stages and a larger lineup. The first of these two one-day festivals occurred in [[Washington, D.C.]] on September 21, 2013.&lt;ref name=mnt-licmiamifestival/&gt;

On August 7, 2013, organizers announced that a Life in Color Festival would be held outside [[Sun Life Stadium]] in Miami on December 27, 2013. The announcement coincided with the final of the [[2013 International Champions Cup]] [[soccer]] tournament, which was also held at Sun Life Stadium; [[R3hab]] and David Solano performed during pre-game and halftime festivities respectively as part of the announcement,&lt;ref name=festival /&gt; making them the "first EDM brand to produce a nationally televised halftime show in North America."&lt;ref name="hsolanoWalkusky"/&gt;  According to Solano, the Miami festival was the new "flagship" event of the company as of 2013, with goals to plot festivals on every continent in 2014.&lt;ref name="asolanosolano"/&gt; The event featured multiple stages, and featured appearances by [[2 Chainz]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Diplo]], [[Excision (musician)|Excision]], and [[Major Lazer]] among others.&lt;ref name=mnt-licmiamifestival&gt;{{cite web|title=Life in Color Festival: A Brilliant Blast Off in Miami|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2013/12/life_in_color_festival_concert_review_photos_miami_2013.php|website=Miami New Times|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=festival /&gt; The 2013 festival had 25,000 attendees over one night.&lt;ref name="hedonistshedonist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hedonistshedonist.com/blog/life-in-color-miami-vibrant-paint-rave-returns/|title=Life in Color Miami&amp;#039;s Vibrant Paint Rave Returns - Hedonist / ShedonistHedonist / Shedonist|publisher=hedonistshedonist.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 arena tour was entitled ''Unleash'',&lt;ref name=tcc-rebirth/&gt; and Solano stated in an interview stated that as of June 25, 2014 they had shows in 55 countries.&lt;ref name="fsolanoBRAIN"/&gt; An April 2014 ''Life in Color'' event in [[Malaysia]], headlined by [[Fedde le Grand]], was planned in partnership with local promoter Future Sound Asia, but cancelled in March 2014 out of respect for drug-related deaths at [[Future Music Festival]] Asia (which caused the final day of the festival to be cancelled) and an unrelated, but similar incident at an ''A State of Trance 650'' event in [[North Jakarta]] the same weekend.&lt;ref name=thestar-cancelledmy/&gt;&lt;ref name=jakartaglobe-asotdeath/&gt;

Life in Color returned to the [[2014 International Champions Cup]] final to announce its 2014 festival with a halftime performance by [[Martin Garrix]]. The 2014 festival was expanded to two days, December 26 and 27, 2014: Solano expected a total attendance of at least 60,000. The event was headlined by [[Adventure Club]], [[Borgore]], [[The Chainsmokers]], Diplo, [[Kaskade]], [[NERVO (duo)|Nervo]], and [[Madeon]] among others, and also featured an attempt to set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the "most people covered in paint at one time".&lt;ref name=mnt-2014festannounce&gt;{{cite web|title=Life in Color Announces Two-Day Festival, Brought Martin Garrix to Sun Life Stadium|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2014/08/life_in_color_announces_two-day_festival_brings_martin_garrix_to_sun_life_stadium.php|website=Miami New Times|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mnt-licf2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Life in Color 2014's Full Miami Lineup: Kaskade, Diplo, Juicy J, 19 Others|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2014/10/life_in_color_festival_lineup_miami_2014.php|website=Miami New Times|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc6-licfest14&gt;{{cite web|title=Life in Color Music Festival Announces Kaskade as First Headliner|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Life-in-Color-Music-Festival-Announces-Kaskade-as-First-Headliner-277103881.html|website=NBCMiami.com|publisher=NBCUniversal Media|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' included Solano on their annual list of "30 Under 30 In Music" for 2015.&lt;ref name="forbesolano"/&gt; He was the only event owner on the list, which largely included musicians and producers such as [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Afrojack]].&lt;ref name="dedtumes"/&gt;

In November 2015, SFX Entertainment promoted Solano to CEO of [[ID&amp;T]] North America and Made Event; in addition to his role as head of Life in Color, he will also oversee [[Electric Zoo]] and the North American editions of ID&amp;T's festival brands, including [[Mysteryland]] and [[TomorrowWorld]].&lt;ref name=billboard-licceo&gt;{{cite web|title=SFX Taps Life in Color's Sebastian Solano for CEO of ID&amp;T North America/Made Event: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/6752870/sfx-life-in-color-sebastian-solano-ceo-idt-made-event|website=Billboard|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists the published allegations of expenses abuse made against specific [[Members of Parliament|members of the British Parliament]] in the course of the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal]]. While the majority of these were first made public by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' on or after 8 May 2009, a few cases had already come to public attention before that date.

On 18 June 2009 the details of all MP's claims for the period 2004 to 2008 were published on the official Parliament website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpsallowances.parliament.uk/mpslordsandoffices/hocallowances/allowances-by-mp/ |title=UK Parliament - Allowances by MP |publisher=Mpsallowances.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with details of voluntary repayments amounting to approximately £500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/mec/repayments.cfm |title=UK Parliament - Repayments of Allowances |publisher=Parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621212800/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/mec/repayments.cfm |archivedate=21 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Items that became public before 8 May 2009==

===The John Lewis List===
The [[John Lewis List]] is the name given to a list used by House of Commons Clerks to ascertain whether or not claims by MPs under the Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) are a realistic representation of the price of items. The list details items that are considered acceptable to be claimed on the ACA, along with the price such items would cost in the [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] department store chain.&lt;ref name=johnlewis1&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths |first=Emma |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7234982.stm |title='John Lewis' list kept from MPs |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2008 the list was never published in case MPs saw the maximum permitted claim for each item and such a price "became the going rate", a rule House of Commons' resources chief Andrew Walker upheld in February 2008 despite campaigners wanting it released to the [[Information Tribunal]] considering the release of MPs' expenses claims.&lt;ref name=johnlewis1 /&gt; However, a freedom of information request by the [[Press Association]] just a month later, in March 2008, saw the list released into the public domain anyway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7295066.stm |title=MPs' £10,000 kitchens on expenses |publisher=BBC News |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing that MPs were able to claim for, among other things, dishwashers, television sets and tumble dryers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7295066.stm |title=In full: MPs' 'John Lewis list' |publisher=BBC News |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derek Conway===
[[Derek Conway]], the MP for [[Old Bexley and Sidcup (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Bexley and Sidcup]] then under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] whip, was found to have employed his son, Frederick, as a part-time research assistant in his parliamentary office between 2004 and 2007, with an annual salary of £10,000, despite Frederick being a full-time undergraduate student at [[Newcastle University]].&lt;ref name=firstreport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/280/280.pdf |format=PDF |title=House of Commons Standards and Privileges Report: Conduct of Mr Derek Conway (2008) |publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] |location=[[Westminster]] |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was revealed by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 27 May 2007, in an article which prompted a complaint to the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]], who in turn referred the matter to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Standards and Privileges Committee]].

The committee launched an investigation into the matter as a whole, and reported to the House on 28 January 2008. On the same day, Conway apologised on the floor of the Commons, stating that he accepted the report's criticisms "in full".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080128/debtext/80128-0004.htm#0801285000004 |title=Hansard – 28 January 2008 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's main finding was that there was "no record" of Frederick ever doing any substantive work for Conway, and that the salary he was paid was too high.&lt;ref name=firstreport /&gt; The committee ordered Conway to repay £13,000 of the money Frederick had been paid, and recommended that Conway should be suspended from the Commons for ten sitting days. These recommendations were approved, in their entirety, by the House of Commons on 31 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080131/debtext/80131-0005.htm#08013153000005 |title=Hansard – 31 January 2008 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Conway's suspension, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[John Mann (British politician)|John Mann]] announced that he would be making a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over Conway's employment of his other son, [[Henry Conway (socialite)|Henry]], in a similar capacity to Frederick.&lt;ref name=whipwithdrawn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7214573.stm |title=Tory whip withdrawn from Conway |publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Conway's suspension and the second allegation being made, the Conservative leader, [[David Cameron]], withdrew the party [[whip (politics)|whip]] from Conway, effectively leaving him sitting as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] MP.&lt;ref name=whipwithdrawn /&gt; Conway subsequently announced that he would not be standing for re-election at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|next general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winnett |first=Robert |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/1576993/Derek-Conway-to-stand-down-at-election.html |title=Daily Telegraph – Derek Conway to stand down at election |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, a year after the first report, the Committee on Standards and Privileges published a further report, specifically in relation to Conway's employment of his son Henry. The committee found that Henry had been employed immediately prior to Frederick and, similarly, had been studying as a full-time undergraduate at the time of his employment.&lt;ref name=secondreport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmstnprv/207/207.pdf |format=PDF |title=House of Commons Standards and Privileges Report: Conduct of Mr Derek Conway (2009) |publisher=House of Commons |location=Westminster |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee reported that, like the previous case, there was no "hard evidence" of Henry's employment, but also stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;it would be unfair to conclude that Henry Conway did not undertake sufficient work to fulfil the terms of his contract of employment&lt;ref name=secondreport /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The committee ordered Conway to repay £3,758 in over payments to his son, and to also write a letter of apology to the committee's chairman, [[Sir George Young, 6th Baronet|Sir George Young]]. Once again, Conway apologised "without qualification" to the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090202/debtext/90202-0017.htm |title=Hansard – 2 February 2009 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7866267.stm |title=MP Conway apologises for payments |publisher=BBC News |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caroline Spelman===
[[Caroline Spelman]], the then [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]], became embroiled in the "nannygate" saga on 6 June 2008 when the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme suggested she had paid for her nanny out of parliamentary expenses during her early years in Parliament, between 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref name="expenses1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7441360.stm |title=Tory MP paid nanny from expenses |publisher=BBC News |date=6 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spelman issued a statement to ''Newsnight'' that the nanny in question, Tina Haynes, was also her constituency secretary.  The [[Conservative Central Office]] agreed with her claim. Immediately after the revelations were made public, the nanny told ''Newsnight'' that she only took the odd phone message or posted documents when needed.&lt;ref name="expenses1"/&gt; In the following days, however, Haynes stated that her work had, in fact, been on a more formal basis, providing constituency secretarial work when Spelman's children were at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7442053.stm |title=MPs’ nanny 'did secretarial work' |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to resolve the situation and clear her name, Spelman asked John Lyons, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, to investigate the payments to Haynes. However, the commissioner himself suggested that an investigation dating back seven years would be exceptional, especially on a self-referral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7442622.stm |title=Watchdog 'considering' nanny case |publisher=BBC News |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the commissioner announced on 17 June that he would launch a formal investigation into the saga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7459528.stm |title=Spelman facing expenses inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the commissioner's investigation, ''Newsnight'' revealed that nine years earlier, Spelman's parliamentary secretary, Sally Hammond, had raised concerns over the "nannygate" payments with the leadership of the Conservative party. In 1998, Hammond informed [[Peter Ainsworth]], a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]], who in turn referred the matter to the then [[Opposition Chief Whip]], [[James Arbuthnot]], who investigated and told Spelman to stop paying Haynes out of parliamentary expenses immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crick |first=Michael |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7476527.stm |title=MPs call for Spelman to be sacked |publisher=BBC News |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the Committee for Standards and Privileges published their final report into the matter, which ruled that Spelman had inadvertently "misapplied part of [her] parliamentary allowances". However, both the Committee and the Commissioner noted that Spelman was, at the time, one of many new members who had taken their seats following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], and was therefore not fully aware of the rules governing the use or purpose of parliamentary allowances. The committee recommended that Spelman repay £9,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmstnprv/316/9780215528964.pdf|format=PDF|title=Committee on Standards and Privileges Report: Mrs Caroline Spelman|date=3 March 2009|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=House of Commons|location=Westminster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper===
In September 2007, the married couple and Labour [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] ministers, [[Ed Balls]], the [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]], and [[Yvette Cooper]], then the [[Minister of State for Housing and Planning|Housing Minister]], were accused of exploiting the Commons' allowances system in order to pay for a £655,000 house in [[Stoke Newington]], [[North London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-483406/Cabinet-husband-wife-cash-homes-loophole.html |title=Cabinet husband and wife cash in on two homes loophole |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |author=Jonathon Oliver |date=23 September 2007 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple subsequently declared this to be their second home, despite spending most of their time in London in order to fulfil their ministerial responsibilities and their children attending London schools. The declaration of the Stoke Newington property as their second home meant that they became eligible for a reported Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) of £44,000 a year to cover the property's £438,000 mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hope |first=Christopher |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1564016/Ed-Balls-claims-27000-subsidy-for-2nd-home.html |title=Daily Telegraph – Ed Balls claims £27,000 subsidy for 2nd home |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative MP [[Malcolm Moss]] made a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who agreed to launch an investigation into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Drury |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1029410/Ed-Balls-Yvette-Cooper-face-sleaze-watchdog-probe-using-expenses-pay-mortgage.html |title=Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper face sleaze watchdog probe over using expenses to pay their mortgage |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |work=Daily Mail |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner ultimately found that the couple had acted in accordance with parliamentary rules and as such dismissed the complaint against them.&lt;ref name=ballscooperreport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/1044/1044.pdf|format=PDF|title=Committee on Standards and Privileges Report: Mr Ed Balls &amp; Mrs Yvette Cooper|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=19 May 2009|publisher=House of Commons|location=Westminster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee on Standards and Privileges agreed with the Commissioner's dismissal of the complaint.&lt;ref name=ballscooperreport /&gt;

===Sir Nicholas and Ann Winterton===
[[Sir Nicholas Winterton|Sir Nicholas]] and [[Ann Winterton|Lady Winterton]], the married backbench Conservative MPs, were accused of claiming back mortgage interest through the Additional Cost Allowance (ACA) on a flat they owned in London, despite having completed payment of the mortgage itself. It was further alleged that the pair had subsequently transferred the ownership of the flat to a [[trustee|trust]] and then claimed £21,600 a year in rent for the flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter |first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2151611/Conservative-MPs-Sir-Nicholas-and-Ann-Winterton-broke-Commons-expenses-rules.html |title=Daily Telegraph – Conservative MPs Sir Nicholas and Ann Winterton broke Commons expenses rules |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complaint was made about this arrangement by two members of the public to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who in turn launched an investigation. The commissioner found that a change in the allowances rules in 2003 appeared to complicate matters as it may have placed the Wintertons' arrangement outside of the rules, and ruled it was "unfortunate" that the couple never reassessed their situation following the change in rules.&lt;ref name=wintertonreport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/744/744.pdf|format=PDF|title=Committee on Standards and Privileges: Sir Nicholas and Lady Winterton|publisher=House of Commons|date=17 June 2008|accessdate=19 May 2009|location=Westminster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner also ruled that a further change to allowance rules in 2006 meant that there was a clear breach of the rules, but noted that the Wintertons would not have received any additional public funds for their arrangement than they would have if they had resided in a different property under more acceptable arrangements. It was also noted that the Wintertons had never attempted to conceal the arrangement.&lt;ref name=wintertonreport /&gt; The Committee on Standards and Privileges agreed with the Commissioner's report and ruled that the payment of the Additional Costs Allowance to the Wintertons should be stopped. Notably however, they did not order the Wintertons to repay any money they had previously claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Drury |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1027407/Tory-couple-broke-expenses-rules-KEEP-cash.html |title=Tory couple who broke expenses rules KEEP cash |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |work=Daily Mail |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate debate, the Wintertons are two of only six Conservative MPs who have refused to disclose their full expenses claims, despite orders to do so by party leader, [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/2455511/Tory-MP-Nicholas-Winterton-accuses-David-Camerons-mafia-of-trying-to-force-him-out.html |title=Daily Telegraph – Tory MP Nicholas Winterton accuses David Cameron's mafia of trying to force him out |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=25 July 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacqui Smith===
[[File:Smith, Jacqui (crop).jpg|thumb|right|Jacqui Smith, then Home Secretary]]
In February 2009, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' reported that the [[Home Secretary]], [[Jacqui Smith]], had listed her constituency home in [[Redditch]], [[Worcestershire]] as her second home, whilst designating a house she shared with her sister in [[London]] as her main home, despite sometimes spending as little as two nights there, allowing her to claim £116,000 in Additional Cost Allowance over several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7877422.stm |title=Smith denies expenses wrongdoing |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect in the debate was the fact that Smith, as Home Secretary, was eligible for a "[[grace and favour]]" home in Westminster, and therefore did not need to claim expenses to live with her sister. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that, despite several MPs complaining to him about the affair, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards would not be launching an investigation into Smith's expenses because there was "not sufficient evidence for an inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1138782/Fury-stitch-Jacqui-Smith-escapes-sleaze-investigation-116-000-second-home-claim.html |title=Fury over 'stitch-up' as Jacqui Smith escapes sleaze investigation into £116,000 second home claim|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |work=Daily Mail |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the residents of the house next-door to Smith's sister complained to him, stating that Smith may only stay there for three nights a week, he requested that Smith explain her arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7896783.stm |title=Smith asked to explain expenses |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after allegations were made against Smith's second home arrangements, the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' revealed that Smith had claimed as parliamentary expenses for two Pay-TV [[pornographic films]] her husband, [[Richard Timney]], had watched while she was away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christopher Leake  |author2=Brendan Carlin  |lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1165611/Blue-movies-expenses-Jacqui-Smiths-husband-apologises-watching-porn--paid-taxpayer.html |title=Blue movies expenses |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and her husband both apologised for the error, and Smith said she would pay back the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7970492.stm |title=Smith 'sorry' for expenses claim |publisher=BBC News |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, coupled with the previous allegation, led to mounting pressure of Smith to resign, but the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]], gave her his full support, before proposing alterations to the existing expenses system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7973075.stm |title=Scrap second home allowance - PM  |publisher=BBC News |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/5072701/Jacqui-Smith-under-pressure-over-husbands-adult-film-expense-claims.html |title=Daily Telegraph – Jacqui Smith under pressure over husband's adult film expense claims |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Smith came under increasing pressure after yet further questions were raised about her expenses by the ''Mail on Sunday''. The newspaper suggested that Smith had claimed for several items that were supposed to allow her to "perform her duties as an MP", including a toothbrush, a patio heater, a barbecue, a flat-screen TV and a bath plug costing 89p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Chapman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167576/Dont-forget-toothbrush-Jacqui-After-porn-films-furnished-home-taxpayer.html |title=Don't forget your toothbrush |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |work=Daily Mail |date=4 May 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2009, she announced she would stand down at the Cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6415037.ece|title=Jacqui Smith to resign as Home Secretary at reshuffle|date=2 June 2009|work=The Times|accessdate=2 June 2009 | location=London | first1=Philippe | last1=Naughton | first2=Philip | last2=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony McNulty===
In March 2009, Labour minister [[Tony McNulty]] (then [[Minister for London]], [[Minister for Employment]] and MP for [[Harrow East (UK Parliament constituency)|Harrow East]]) admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, which was eight miles away from his primary residence, after details appeared in the ''Mail on Sunday''. He asserted that the claim was appropriate, but ceased claiming the allowances. In an article headlined "Tony McNulty, Benefit Cheat", ''[[The Spectator]]'' on 26 March 2009 contrasted the statements made by McNulty regarding benefit cheats with his own claims for expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tony McNulty, Benefit Cheat|author=Alex Massie|work=The Spectator|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=19 May 2009|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/alex-massie/2009/03/tony-mcnulty-benefit-cheat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned during the Cabinet reshuffle of 5 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/5454342/Tony-McNulty-resigns-following-expenses-shame.html |title=Tony McNulty resigns following expenses shame |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |work=Telegraph.co.uk |date=5 June 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Pickles===
On 26 March 2009, Conservative MP [[Eric Pickles]] ([[Brentwood and Ongar (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentwood and Ongar]]) appeared on the political debate programme ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. While discussing the controversy over Tony McNulty, Pickles admitted he claimed a second home allowance even though his constituency home was only 37 miles from Westminster. Pickles justified himself by saying ”the House of Commons works on clockwork. You have to be there. If you're on a committee, you have to be there precisely." Host [[David Dimbleby]] responded "Like a job, in other words?" reflecting the reality that many of Pickles' own constituents commute to London each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.uat.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin/9308917/Pickles_Part_II_the_Question_Time_tapes/ |title=Pickles Part II the Question Time tapes |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=27 March 2009|accessdate=21 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following details are sorted by party in descending order of parliamentary size of the party at the time of the scandal.

===Labour Party===
The ''Telegraph'' devoted the first two days of coverage to the expenses of the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], beginning with the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] on day one, before turning to junior ministers and Labour backbenchers on the second day, Saturday 9 May. Further allegations were made on Thursday, 14 May. The main allegations the newspaper made, alongside any responses to them from the various MPs are shown below.
*'''[[Gordon Brown]]''' ([[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]/[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy &amp; Cowdenbeath]]) – allegedly paid his brother in excess of £6,000 for cleaning services and claimed for the same plumbing repair bill twice. [[Downing Street]] responded by saying that Brown paid his brother, who in turn paid the cleaner as the cleaner worked for them both but preferred to be paid by a single person for [[National Insurance]] reasons. The cleaner was hired by the Prime Minister's sister-in-law to clean his brother's flat but then expanded her duties to include cleaning the Prime Minister's London flat.&lt;ref name=GBrown&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/10/gordon-brown-cleaner-mps-expenses |title=MPs' expenses: the true story of Gordon Brown, the cleaner and my husband &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=Guardian Media Group |work=The Guardian |date=10 May 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that the double payment for a repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5293446/MPs-expenses-Gordon-Browns-house-swap-that-let-him-claim-thousands.html |title=Daily Telegraph: Gordon Brown |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbckeydetails&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039273.stm |title=MPs' expenses claims – key details |publisher=BBC News |date=19 June 2009 (running) |accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;!--previous accessdate: 2009-05-13: means that the actual page/article creation date is different/earlier.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the individual who does jail time for assisting with the fraud is paid for their time served.

Long firm frauds have become significantly less common in recent years since it is no longer possible to operate for any length of time without leaving a significant [[wikt:paper trail|paper trail]].

'''Mushabib al-Hamlan''' ({{lang-ar|مسحبيب الحملان}}) was an original candidate for the [[September 11 attacks]]. He became involved with militancy in December 1999 at secondary school, when he attended gatherings to watch videos about the glory of [[Jihad]] and detailing the atrocities of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]]. The group studied under Ban-dar Marui and read the book ''Gladiator of Passion''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==The Hajj and Pakistan==
On February 15, 2000, Hamlan received a [[passport]] and after completing the [[Hajj]], went to [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah, UAE]], to obtain a [[visa (document)|visa]] to enter [[Pakistan]]. Once in [[Islamabad, Pakistan]], he and two co-travelers were led by [[Hassan Ghul]] to a waypoint controlled by [[Abu Zubaydah]]. By March, they had crossed the border into [[Afghanistan]] where he attended the [[Al Khaldan training camp]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://911.gnu-designs.com/Notes_7.html|title=9/11 Commission Report - Notes - 7 The Attack Looms|last=Desrosiers|first=David A.|website=911.gnu-designs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the camp was closed, he moved with its other members to [[Al Farouq training camp|Al-Farouq]] outside [[Kandahar]], where he met [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After injuring himself at the camp, Hamlan was assigned to guard [[Kandahar Airport]], a task that the eventual hijackers [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] and [[Waleed al-Shehri]] shared.

==Potential martyrs==
During his time at Al-Farooq and the airport, Hamlan is thought to have befriended [[Ahmed al-Nami]]. The two of them studied under Abu Basir al-Yemeni, who coaxed them to enlist with Abu Hafs al Mauritani as potential 'martyrs' who would carry out suicide missions inside the United States.

Hamlan and Nami were sent to meet bin Laden, identifying themselves through the phrase "I want to be one of this religion's bricks and glorify this religion". In October 2000, Hamlan and Nami met with [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]] who instructed them on encrypting telephone calls. They also had their passports falsified to suggest that they were world travelers visiting locations such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Turkey]]. After a meeting with [[Muhammad Atef]], they flew to [[Tehran, Iran]], onward to [[Qatar]] and back into the [[UAE]] before arriving in [[Mecca, Saudi Arabia]]. On instructions from [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], they drove to [[Jeddah]], where they stayed with the future hijacker [[Waleed al-Shehri]]. He instructed them how to obtain US visas, which both received on October 28.

==Return to family==
Hamlan did not use his visa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/22/911.commission/|title=CNN.com - 9/11 panel describes how attackers got money - Aug 22, 2004|last=Hirschkorn|first=Phil|date=|website=edition.cnn.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after they were issued their visas, Hamlan phoned his family and learned that his mother was ill. He decided not to pursue martyrdom and returned to his family. [[Khalid al Zahrani]], an associate from Al-Farouq, visited him later to try to convince him to return, but failed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''NORDIK''' Nordic Committee for Art History is an association of [[art historians]] from universities and museum in the Nordic countries. The Committee was founded in [[Helsinki]] in 1984 to promote research networks between Nordic art historians. The main task of the committee since 1984 has been to organize the NORDIK conference every third year in a Nordic country. The board of NORDIK consists members from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and are appointed by the general assembly of NORDIK for a period of three years. The general assembly usually takes place in connection with the NORDIK conferences. The present committee was appointed by the general assembly that took place in connection with NORDIK.X in 2012 in Stockholm, Sweden. Chairman of NORDIK is prof. [[:sv:Jeff Werner|Jeff Werner]], [[Stockholm University]].

'''[[Queen (band)|Queen]] live in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] 1976''' was a famous concert by the band. The concert took place on 18 September, during the hot summer of 1976. It was part of a brief summer tour of the UK by the band; they also played in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Cardiff]] on this tour.

The Hyde Park gig was a free concert, which drew in a crowd of over 150,000, which was one of the largest audiences for any concert in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Queen: Full Biography |publisher=MTV.com |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418041047/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/queen/artist.jhtml |accessdate=2009-04-09 |quote=In the summer of 1976, they performed a free concert at London's Hyde Park that broke attendance records...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Evening Standard]] |date=2005-03-30 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131014961.html |title=Win Tickets To See Queen &amp; Paul Rodgers; Concert Week In The Evening Standard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The free concert was organised by [[Richard Branson]], an entrepreneur at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/stadium-rock/queen-play-hyde-park/ |title=Queen play Hyde Park |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more than one audio source of this concert as well as a video. According to [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], the drummer of Queen, the complete show was supposed to be shown on TV in early 1977 but was never aired. Since then, the footage has leaked out to collectors, though in terrible quality. Over the years, some of the footage has been shown in various documentaries and there are rumors of a future official release. The 2011 reissue of ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]'' includes a performance of "You Take My Breath Away" from this date.

The rest of the day's music was provided by The Kiki Dee Band, Supercharge, The Rich Kids (not to be confused with Midge Ure's band of the same name), Broken Wreck Chords and Steve Hillage. Elton John did not appear duetting with Kiki Dee for "Don't go breaking my heart". She sang to a 2/3 life-sized cardboard cut-out of Elton instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/promoting-queen-and-jamming-roger-taylor |title= Promoting Queen and jamming with Roger Taylor |last=Branson |first=Richard  |authorlink= Richard Branson |date=26 August 2016 |website=Virgin.com |publisher= Virgin Records official blog |access-date=26 July 2018 |quote="Beforehand, I remember Kiki Dee singing Don’t Go Breaking My Heart to a cardboard cut-out of Elton John, who couldn’t make it."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red Bull BC One''' is an annual international [[B-boying|B-Boy]] competition organized by the energy drink company [[Red Bull]]. It is an individual B-Boy competition, notable for being the only one of the major [[International B-Boy Championships|international breaking championships]] to not include a crew event. The main event is a [[knockout tournament]] featuring sixteen B-Boys, chosen for exceptional skills in the dance and good character, competing in one-on-one battles decided by a panel of five judges. Regional Finals are held for [[Red Bull BC One North American Finals|North America]], [[Red Bull BC One Eastern European Finals|Eastern Europe]], [[Red Bull BC One Western European Finals|Western Europe]], [[Red Bull BC One Latin American Finals|Latin America]], [[Red Bull BC One Asia Pacific Finals|Asia Pacific]], and [[Red Bull BC One Middle East Africa Finals|Middle East &amp; Africa]]. The winners of each region go on and participate in the World Finals. The inaugural BC One was held in [[Biel]], Switzerland in 2004.

An official Red Bull BC One [[DVD]] was released for the 2004 and 2005 events. The production of the DVDs has been criticized due to musical rights, as the live music played during the competition had to be dubbed over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Red-Bull-One-Breakdancing-Championship/dp/B000GW8S06 Amazon.com reviews for Red Bull BC One 2005 DVD], Retrieved August 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bboyworld.com/forum/video-song-lists/42541-red-bull-bc-one-2005-a.html BBoyWorld.com forum song list thread for Red Bull BC One 2005 DVD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002522/http://www.bboyworld.com/forum/video-song-lists/42541-red-bull-bc-one-2005-a.html |date=2007-09-28 }}, Retrieved August 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 and on, Red Bull stopped releasing DVDs and made the videos available online for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redbullbcone.com/blog/we-read-your-comments Red Bull BC One], Retrieved November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Alastair Siddon directed a film about the Red Bull BC One 2007 competition. The film was released in March 2010 under the title, "Turn it Loose."

Since 2014, Red Bull BC One partnered up with the [[World BBoy Series]] and helped create [[World BBoy Series|Undisputed]], an event to crown the solo world bboy champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freestylesession.com/blog/?page_id=65 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109203802/http://freestylesession.com/blog/?page_id=65 |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }} Retrieved November 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Red Bull BC One will hold camps around the world that will feature traditional cyphers. It will no longer hold the six regional finals from previous years. Camps will be held in Austria, France, South Africa, Italy, Japan, and Ukraine. The winners of each cypher will compete in a Last Chance Cypher to qualify to the World Finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redbullbcone.com/en/about/press/big-changes-2016/ Big Changes on the Horizon for 2016] Retrieved January, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The winners of Last Chance Cypher will battle in Nagoya alongside fifteen Wild Card entries, chosen by an international team of B-Boy experts. Red Bull BC One World Finals 2016 will take place in [[Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium]], [[Nagoya]], Japan on December 3. This also happened to be the final BC One that would feature Taisuke, as he announced his retirement from this competition. Meanwhile, Issei's victory meant that he would be the first Japanese champion of Red Bull BC One.

{{main|2014 Red Bull BC One}}
Red Bull BC One took place in Paris, France. In 2014, Red Bull BC One utilized a round-by-round judging system used by [[International B-Boy Championships#Undisputed|Undisputed]]. The round-by-round judging format allows bboys to see the judges decision after every round. The battle is set for 3 rounds (Finals is 5) but can end if a bboy beats his opponent in 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebboyspot.com/judging-format-at-undisputed-world-bboy-series-events/] Retrieved November, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, this judging system received a lot of criticism from Red Bull BC One fans throughout social media following the event. Bboys and fans alike, both disagreed heavily with the judges's decisions after many individual battles. Many argued that it was the worst Red Bull BC one competition since its initiation. Due to '''Menno''' ({{flagicon|NED}}) winning Red Bull BC One and Chelles Battle Pro, '''Gravity''' ({{flagicon|USA}}) was awarded the final spot at [[International B-Boy Championships#Undisputed|Undisputed]] at the end of the year following Red Bull BC One.

==Red Bull BC One All Stars==
Red Bull BC One All Stars is a crew of thirteen internationally renowned dancers, representing the best of the best in the scene. Together, they showcase the art of B-Boying in all of its many forms.

==2008 lineup==
Monday 31st March was the day when Didi Music-Big Star Promotion Ltd (music concert organizer), announced the names of the artists that would perform at Rockwave Festival 2008. Along with the names they introduced the changes in the festival's whole structure. 
The festival is now divided in two stages, "Terra" stage and "Vibe" stage (that comes by the name of the event park "TerraVibe"). Τhey also abolished the division of the "Terra" concert area into gates PL1 and PL2, lowered the high price of the tickets and retained the special area that is on the side of the field, where there is more comfort, as there are places to sit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">'''Spring Thing''' is an annual competition to highlight works of text adventure games and other literary works, also known as [[Interactive Fiction]].

[[Adam Cadre]], author of several works of [[Interactive Fiction]], including ''[[Photopia]]'' and ''[[Varicella (computer game)|Varicella]]'', announced the Spring Thing in 2001, both to promote works that would be longer than those entered into the [[Interactive Fiction Competition]], and to encourage authors to submit works to the general public during other times of the year. It was run in 2002 and 2003, but Cadre did not host it the following year. [[Greg Boettcher]] picked up the slack, and hosted the Spring Thing from 2005 until 2013. As of 2014 it was run by [[Aaron A. Reed]].

As with the better-known Interactive Fiction Competition, works submitted to the Spring Thing must be released as [[freeware]] or [[public domain]]. Unlike that competition's limit of two hours per work, judges may spend as much time as necessary with an entry in the Spring Thing.

'''TechCrunch''' is an [[United States|American]] online [[publisher]] of technology industry news founded in 2005 by Archimedes Ventures whose partners were [[Michael Arrington]] and [[Keith Teare]].&lt;ref name="The Real History of TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrington|first1=Michael|title=The Real History of TechCrunch|url=https://uncrunched.com/2018/02/18/the-real-history-of-techcrunch/|publisher=Michael Arrington|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reports on the business of tech, tech news, analysis of emerging trends in tech, and profiling of new tech businesses and products.

==History==
TechCrunch was founded in June 2005 by Archimedes Ventures - the Partners were [[Michael Arrington]] and [[Keith Teare]].&lt;ref name="The Real History of TechCrunch"/&gt; In 2010, [[AOL]] acquired the company for approximately $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/29/aol-buys-techcrunch|title=AOL buys TechCrunch|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2010-09-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
A scandal erupted over the [[Titstare]] application, created by participants in a [[hackathon]] at Disrupt 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/09/titstare-app-women-tech-sexism|title='Titstare' app at Techcrunch: women in tech deserve better &amp;#124; Amy Gray &amp;#124; Comment is free|date=2013-09-08|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2014-08-10|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/techcrunch-forced-to-apologise-over-sydney-duos-titstare-app-20130909-2tflb.html|title=TechCrunch forced to apologise over Sydney duo's 'Titstare' app|author=Ben Grubb|date=|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/09/09/_titstare_app_at_techcrunch_disrupt_what_would_a_tech_conference_be_without.html|title=Titstare app at TechCrunch Disrupt: What would a tech conference be without the sexism?|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|date=2013-09-09|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the site came under fire for possible ethics violations. These included claims that Arrington's investments in certain firms which the site had covered created a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/business/media/michael-arringtons-audacious-venture.html|title=Michael Arrington's Audacious Adventure|author=David Carr|date=September 5, 2011|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy that ensued eventually led to Arrington's departure, and other writers, including [[Paul Carr (writer)|Paul Carr]] and [[Sarah Lacy]], followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120116/sarah-lacy-debuts-new-tech-site-pandodaily-and-guess-whos-working-for-her-video/|title=Sarah Lacy Debuts New Tech Site, PandoDaily — $2M+ in Funding and Guess Who’s Working for Her?|author=Kara Swisher|date=January 16, 2012|publisher=AllThingsD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/techcruncher-quits-slams-new-editor-techcrunch-134926|title=TechCruncher Quits, Slams New Editor—On TechCrunch|author=Anthony Ha|date=September 16, 2011|publisher=[[AdWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TechCrunch Disrupt===
First held in 2011, TechCrunch Disrupt is an annual tech conference hosted by TechCrunch in [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2011/ | title=The first TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-ny-2011/ | title=The first TechCrunch Disrupt New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe ([[London]] or [[Berlin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-eu/ |title=Disrupt Europe |year=2014 |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one 2011 conference held in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/disrupt-beijing-2011/|title=Full coverage of Disrupt Beijing 2011|last=Wood|first=Stephen|website=TechCrunch|language=en|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{visible anchor|Crunchbase}}===&lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;

From 2007 to 2015, TechCrunch operated [[Crunchbase]], a database of the startup ecosystem, consisting of investors, incubators, start-ups, key people, funds, funding rounds and events.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The company claims to have more than 50,000 active contributors on its platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/mention-800k-seed/|title=With 50,000 Users &amp; Double-Digit Monthly Revenue Growth, French Real-Time Alerts Startup Mention Raises $800K Flash Seed|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to registration, members of the public can make submissions to the database; however, all changes are subject to review by a moderator before being accepted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2013, Crunchbase claimed to have 2 million users accessing its database each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CrunchBase, People+, and the EFF | url=https://about.crunchbase.com/2013/11/crunchbase-people-and-the-eff/ |accessdate=2013-12-07 | publisher=CrunchBase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOL is in dispute with start-up Pro Populi over that group's use of the entire Crunchbase dataset in apps that Pro Populi has developed, one of which is known as People+. Pro Populi is being represented by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AOL Smacks Startup for Using CrunchBase Content It Gave Away | url=https://www.wired.com/2013/11/aol-crunchbase-cc-flap/ | accessdate=2013-12-07 | publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] | date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Crunchbase spun out of AOL/Verizon/TechCrunch to become a private entity, and is no longer a part of TechCrunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/aolverizon-completes-spinout-of-crunchbase-funded-by-emergence-capital/ |title=AOL/Verizon Completes Spinout Of CrunchBase Funded By Emergence Capital |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Daily Stormer''''' is an American [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], and [[Holocaust Denial|Holocaust denial]] commentary and message board website that advocates for the [[genocide]] of [[Jews]].&lt;ref name=mill&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/us/white-supremacists-extend-their-reach-through-websites.html|title=White Supremacists Extend Their Reach Through Websites|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Wines, Michael|date=July 5, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neo-nazi-holocaust-denial-legal-defense_us_5a612a5ce4b0125fd6354368|title=American Neo-Nazi Is Using Holocaust Denial As A Legal Defense|last=O'Brien|first=Luke|date=January 19, 2018|work=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/the-making-of-an-american-nazi/544119/|title=The Making of an American Nazi|last=O'Brein|first=Luke|date=December 2017|website=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=April 4, 2018|quote=(As Anglin would later write, the official policy of his site was: “Jews should be exterminated.”)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers itself a part of the [[alt-right]] movement.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallo|first1=William|title=What is the 'Alt-Right'?|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/hillary-clinton-attacks-donald-trump-alt-right-ties/3481117.html|accessdate=September 18, 2016|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its editor, Andrew Anglin, founded it on July 4, 2013, as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website ''Total Fascism''.

The site is known for its use of [[Internet meme]]s, which have been likened to the imageboard [[4chan]] and cited as attractions for a younger and more ideologically diverse audience.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; While some [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] authors have praised ''The Daily Stormer''{{'}}s reach, others have taken issue with its content and tone, accusing Anglin of being an [[agent provocateur]], used to discredit true white nationalism.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=White nationalism’s exploding civil war|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/10/23/white_nationalisms_exploding_civil_war_partner/|accessdate=March 4, 2015|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Stormer'' orchestrates what it calls the "Troll Army", which is involved in [[Internet troll]]ing of figures with whom Anglin disagrees politically. In August 2017, after causing outrage by insulting the victim of [[Charlottesville car attack|a car-ramming homicide]] at the far-right [[Unite the Right rally]], the website was rejected by several [[domain name registrar|domain registrar]]s.

===Andrew Anglin===

Andrew Anglin was born on July 27, 1984, and grew up near [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anglin|first1=Andrew|title=I was Born in 1984|url=https://andrewanglinblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/i-was-born-in-1984/|accessdate=August 25, 2017|publisher=Andrew Anglin Blog|date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="o'brien"/&gt; According to both Anglin and his childhood classmates, he was [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] as a youth.&lt;ref name="o'brien"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vocativ/&gt; He attended the [[Linworth Alternative Program]] and the [[Worthington Christian High School]] from 1999 to 2003, where he was remembered as a dreadlocked [[vegan]].&lt;ref name=alive&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliphint|first1=Joel|last2=Downing|first2=Andy|title=The White Nationalist from Worthington|url=http://www.columbusalive.com/entertainment/20170208/white-nationalist-from-worthington|accessdate=February 23, 2017|publisher=Columbus Alive|date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends in high school report that his behavior changed during his sophomore year at Linworth, where he exhibited [[self-harm]]ing behavior, and began promoting conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="o'brien"/&gt; After high school, Anglin took classes at [[Columbus State Community College]] in 2003, and studied English at [[Ohio State University]] for one semester in 2004.&lt;ref name="o'brien"/&gt;&lt;ref name=alive/&gt;

In 2006 Anglin launched a [[conspiracy theory]] website, ''Outlaw Journalism'', which was modeled after the works of [[Alex Jones]] and [[Hunter S. Thompson]], whom Anglin admired.&lt;ref name="o'brien"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Luke|title=The Making of an American Nazi|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/the-making-of-an-american-nazi/544119/|accessdate=November 20, 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, after posting on ''Outlaw Journalism'' that the only way for humanity to survive was to return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, Anglin began traveling around [[Southeast Asia]], eventually ending up in [[Davao City]], in the [[Philippines]]. In 2011, he spent several weeks with a [[Tboli people|Tboli]] village in southern [[Mindanao]], where he initially intended to stay permanently, selling some of his possessions to raise money for a dowry to marry two local Muslim women.&lt;ref name="o'brien"/&gt; In 2012, Anglin wrote that he found the locals to be "a civilized, non-aggressive and industrious people" but he eventually came to consider them too "primitive", became lonely and only wanted to associate with members of his own [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and "By the Grace of God, I found Adolf Hitler".&lt;ref name=alive/&gt;

In 2012, Anglin launched another website, Adventure Quest 2012, which discussed conspiracy theories such as the existence of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian humanoids]]. He described the aim of the site as seeking to "mend the wounds produced by modern society ... and [help] the reader transcend these physical bonds and reach total ascendancy. To mend these wounds, the world must learn to embrace diversity and color."&lt;ref name=alive/&gt; In 2014, he stated that although he agreed with the central tenets of [[Nazism]], he had reservations over reintroducing all aspects of Hitler's regime.&lt;ref name=vocativ/&gt; A self-proclaimed "troll", Anglin stated that he was introduced to Nazism on [[4chan]].&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=Eye of the Stormer|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/eye-stormer|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=February 9, 2017|quote="I had always been into 4chan as I am at heart a troll...This is about the time /new/ [a particular 4chan board] was going full Nazi, and so I got into Hitler..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2012, he launched his first neo-Nazi website, ''Total Fascism''.&lt;ref name=vocativ /&gt; Feeling that ''Total Fascism'' was not appealing to a younger demographic and had articles that were too long, Anglin launched ''The Daily Stormer'' on July 4, 2013, with shorter articles and a more provocative style.&lt;ref name=vocativ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dixon Kavanaugh|first1=Shane|title=The Man Bringing Back the Nazi Movement in America|url=http://www.vocativ.com/usa/race/man-bringing-back-nazi-movement-america/|publisher=[[Vocativ]]|date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglin said in March 2014 he spends 70 hours a week writing for the website.&lt;ref name=vocativ/&gt;

Anglin's location is not known. An investigative article by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' in November 2016 analyzed his social media and FBI sources, and concluded that he was living in Germany. Rumors have also claimed that he is residing in Russia.&lt;ref name=alive/&gt; In July 2017, Anglin told [[CNN]] he was residing in [[Lagos]], Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Mallory|last2=Sidner|first2=Sara|title=This mom became the target of a neo-Nazi troll storm|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/10/us/avalanche-of-hate-daily-stormer-lawsuit/index.html|accessdate=August 6, 2017|work=CNN|date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) lists the site as being headquartered in [[Worthington, Ohio]], with activity in several other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Map|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=November 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/amana-clear-creek/2017/08/28/splc-removes-amana-hate-group-map/610471001/|title=SPLC removes Amana from hate group map|author=Brian Rathjen|date=August 28, 2017|publisher=Iowa City Press-Citizen (USA Today Group)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is registered in the name of Anglin's father Greg, who runs a Christian-inspired counseling service in Worthington.&lt;ref name=splc/&gt;

=== Finances ===
''The Daily Stormer'' is primarily funded through donations which Anglin solicits regularly from site visitors.&lt;ref name=splc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beirich|first1=Heidi|title=Blog Wars: ''The Daily Stormer'' and its Racist Frenemies|url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2015/03/11/blog-wars-the-daily-stormer-and-its-racist-frenemies/|accessdate=April 21, 2015|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was protested against by [[Anti-Racist Action]] for receiving donations from the site's readers to pass on to his son.&lt;ref name=alive/&gt; In February 2017, the website announced a corporate sponsor—Smerff Electrical, owned by Simon Hickey of [[Brisbane]], Australia,&lt;ref name=alive/&gt; whose website contains images of alt-right meme [[Pepe the Frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notorious Neo-Nazis Claim They Have A ‘Corporate Sponsor’|url=http://www.vocativ.com/399501/neo-nazis-corporate-sponsor/|accessdate=February 23, 2017|publisher=Vocativ|date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglin told [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']] that he received donations from [[Silicon Valley]], and that [[Santa Clara County, California]] was the largest source of traffic to his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harkinson|first1=Josh|title=Meet Silicon Valley's Secretive Alt-Right Followers|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/silicon-valley-tech-alt-right-racism-misogyny|accessdate=March 26, 2017|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is believed to have received over $200,000 in [[Bitcoin]] contributions since it began accepting the cryptocurrency in 2014.&lt;ref name=Memoria&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/114574-2/|title=This Twitter Bot Monitors Neo-Nazi Bitcoin Donations|author=Francisco Memoria|date=August 30, 2017|publisher=Cryptocoins News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A current [[cryptocurrency wallet]] has consistently kept approximately $80,000 in Bitcoin on hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/neo-nazi-bitcoin-transactions-made-public-by-twitter-bot|publisher=The Coin Telegraph|author= Jon Buck|title=Neo-Nazi Bitcoin Transactions Made Public by Twitter Bot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blockchain.info/address/16JAUnuvxQ6BdfX4DwsEVTWgd3a8oitu8h?sort=0|title=Bitcoin address}} (Crytocoins News and Coin Telegraph link to this Bitcoin wallet)&lt;/ref&gt; Money entering and being spent by the accounts is publicly tracked by a Twitter bot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/paax7z/this-twitter-bot-tracks-neo-nazi-bitcoin-transactions|title=This Twitter Bot Tracks Neo-Nazi Bitcoin Transactions|publisher=Motherboard|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Twitter account for the ''Stormer'' announced that [[Coinbase]] was deleting accounts of persons attempting to send Bitcoin to them;&lt;ref name=Memoria /&gt; Coinbase stated in general terms that it "prohibits use of an account which would abuse, harass, threaten, or promote violence against others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbbb5y/can-the-bitcoin-community-stop-neo-nazis-from-using-the-digital-currency|title=Can the Bitcoin Community Stop Neo-Nazis From Using the Digital Currency?|date=August 18, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2017, for example, Anglin received a donation of 14.88 bitcoin (a reference to [[Fourteen Words]]). At the time, it was worth $60,000, but had Anglin kept the entire amount it would have been worth about $235,000 by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/bitcoins-boom-is-a-boon-for-extremist-groups/2017/12/26/9ca9c124-e59b-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html |title=Bitcoin’s boom is a boon for extremist groups |first=Craig |last=Timberg |date=December 26, 2017 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Stormer'' is run through a company called Moonbase Holdings, with Anglin saying that he chose the name so that donors could avoid scrutiny from their credit card companies. The company made $3,400 per month on the alt-right crowdfunding website [[Hatreon]], which ceased operations in February 2017. In his defamation lawsuit against Anglin, Muslim American radio personality [[Dean Obeidallah]] requested that Moonbase Holdings be scrutinized to find any other individuals related with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrouquere|first1=Brett|title=Show me the money: Lawyers in libel lawsuit seek to examine finances of Andrew Anglin’s company and Daily Stormer|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/29/show-me-money-lawyers-libel-lawsuit-seek-examine-finances-andrew-anglin%E2%80%99s-company-and-daily|accessdate=April 2, 2018|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and reception==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, "Stürmerkasten".jpg|thumb|''The Daily Stormer'' is named for the Nazi tabloid ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', known for its antisemitic caricatures.

''The Daily Stormer'' takes its name from the [[Nazi Party]]'s tabloid newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'',&lt;ref name=mill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Christina|title=Google Image, The Daily Stormer And Anti-Semitism|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-image-the-daily-stormer-and-anti-semitism_us_5844815ce4b0b93e10f8e352|accessdate=December 24, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for its virulently [[antisemitic]] caricatures of Jews.&lt;ref name=iceland/&gt; Its publisher, [[Julius Streicher]], was executed after the Second World War for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref name=iceland/&gt;

The SPLC described the site as "the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web", which "has in the last six months [up to March 2015] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web, [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]], in terms of [[Reach (advertising)|reach]] and [[page view]]s, based on [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] data".&lt;ref name="splc" /&gt; Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website's traffic had doubled over the last six months, peaking at 120,000 daily visitors.&lt;ref name=secret/&gt; The website is part of the [[alt-right]] movement, and it calls itself "The World’s Most Visited Alt-Right Website". As the movement made headlines in mid-2016, "bolstered in part by the unexpected rise of [[Donald Trump]] and [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Britain's decision to leave the European Union]]", Anglin declared: "We won the meme war; now we've taken over the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]], and we did this very, very quickly."&lt;ref name=voice/&gt; Unlike other figures such as [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: "The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=Whose Alt-Right Is It Anyway?|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/25/whose-alt-right-it-anyway|accessdate=September 18, 2016|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglin officially endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to "vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests".&lt;ref name=crystal/&gt; The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed "Heil Donald Trump – ''The Ultimate Savior''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaplan|first1=Rebecca|title=Donald Trump's endorsers still with him after proposed Muslim entry ban|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-endorsers-still-with-him-after-proposed-muslim-ban/|accessdate=December 24, 2015|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Troup Buchanan|first1=Rose|title=Donald Trump gets support from neo-Nazi group after call to ban Muslims entering US|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-backed-by-neo-nazi-group-after-calls-to-ban-muslims-entering-us-a6764426.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and ''The Daily Stormer'' were mentioned by [[Lacy Clay]], Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director [[James Comey]] was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democratic congressman hijacks hearing to ask FBI director about Trump retweeting white supremacists|url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/james-comey-donald-trump-white-genocide-2016-7|accessdate=July 8, 2016|publisher=Business Insider|date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This was the first website mentioned specifically in congress since the [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]].--&gt; Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=Trump draws rebuke for his tweet with an image of Clinton and a Star of David|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-clinton-star-of-david-20160703-story.html|accessdate=July 4, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader [[David Duke]] believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.&lt;ref name=secret&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schulberg|first1=Jessica|title=Trump’s Neo-Nazi And Jewish Backers Are Both Convinced He’s Secretly On Their Side|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-neo-nazis-jews_us_5747397be4b0dacf7ad4480e|accessdate=June 24, 2016|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Trump supporter Crystal Wright wrote that the candidate needed to separate himself from white nationalists such as ''The Daily Stormer'', who were endorsing him ahead of other politicians they deemed "[[cuckservative]]s" for holding more liberal positions.&lt;ref name=crystal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Crystal|title=The white supremacists flocking to Donald Trump|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/11890531/The-white-supremacists-and-racists-flocking-to-Donald-Trump.html|accessdate=September 28, 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Conor Friedersdorf theorized that modern academia's focus on race rather than "[[Color blindness (race) in the United States|color-blind]]" individualism was causing divisions and allowing white nationalist sites such as ''The Daily Stormer'' to gain an audience, and therefore become a "tiny but nevertheless alarming portion" of Trump's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friesendorf|first1=Conor|title=The Left's Attack on Color-Blindness Goes Too Far|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-lefts-attack-on-color-blindness-goes-too-far/403477/|accessdate=September 28, 2015|work=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]|date=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera]] writer Malcolm Harris analyzed the endorsement and predicted that a Trump presidency would strengthen organized racist groups and lead to civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump’s immigration plan is a recipe for civil war|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/9/trumps-immigration-plan-is-a-recipe-for-civil-war.html|accessdate=September 30, 2015|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Anglin called on the site's readers to use non-violent intimidation to make "brown people" feel unwelcome in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickerson|first1=Caitlin|title=Reports of Bias-Based Attacks Tick Upward After Election|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/us/reports-of-bias-based-attacks-tick-upward-after-election.html?_r=0|accessdate=November 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to goad disappointed supporters of Clinton into committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawkins|first1=Derek|title=‘Get some of them to kill themselves’: Popular neo-Nazi site urges readers to troll liberals into suicide|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/11/get-some-of-them-to-kill-themselves-popular-neo-nazi-site-urges-readers-to-troll-liberals-into-suicide/|accessdate=November 13, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the bombing of the Syrian government's [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|Shayrat Airbase in 2017]], ''The Daily Stormer'' was one of several alt-right outlets that criticized Trump. While Anglin alleged the president could be under control of a purportedly Jewish [[deep state]], weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his past actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kestenbaum|first1=Sam|title=The ‘Alt-Right’ Is Blaming The Jews For Trump’s Syria Airstrike|url=http://forward.com/news/368605/the-alt-right-is-blaming-the-jews-for-trumps-syria-airstrike/|accessdate=May 1, 2017|work=[[The Forward]]|date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction from white nationalists===
[[File:2008 Jared Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jared Taylor criticized the tone of ''The Daily Stormer''.|alt=Photographic portrait of a smiling man outside]]
White nationalist websites such as Stormfront and Counter-Currents have taken issue with what they see as [[low culture|lowbrow]] coverage on ''The Daily Stormer'', as well as Anglin's defense of Christianity and denunciation of the white supremacist group [[Christian Identity]].&lt;ref name=splc/&gt; Kyle Rogers of the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] has also criticized the website for reprinting its material.&lt;ref name=splc/&gt; Anglin has also been criticized for his relationships with non-white women in the Philippines, and for his insults towards white women on his website.&lt;ref name=alive/&gt;

Colin Liddell of [[AlternativeRight.com]] has criticized Anglin's beliefs and tone. Liddell, who believes that stopping migration and encouraging higher birthrates is more important for preserving the [[white race]], condemned Anglin for writing that it was impossible for the race to survive without adopting his views on Jews, Hitler and the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Liddell considered that Anglin was attracting [[poor white]]s with his provocative online persona in the same manner as [[monster trucks]] and [[professional wrestling]], writing that "it is hard not to conclude that Anglin is a paid [[shill]] and [[agent provocateur]], whose purpose is simply to infest and discredit White nationalism".&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearce|first1=Matt|title=What happens when a millennial goes fascist?

Others, such as the [[Traditionalist Youth Network]], have praised ''The Daily Stormer'' for its reach and influence.&lt;ref name=splc/&gt; Anglin's extreme tone has led some white nationalists to suspect that he is an undercover Jew, an accusation he finds analogous to believing that Jewish [[LGBT]] activist [[Allen Ginsberg]] was an undercover Nazi.&lt;ref name=ncrm/&gt;

The "Troll Army" has also attacked right-wing conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] for having a Jewish wife and not being anti-Semitic.&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; In November 2015, they took part in "Operation: Kikebart", targeting conservative news website [[Breitbart News]] for opening an office in Israel.

=== Distribution of propaganda ===
In 2016, ''The Daily Stormer'' and the hacker weev jointly took credit for sending copies of a racist, anti-Semitic flier to thousands of publicly accessible, Internet-connected printers throughout the country, many of them at universities. The flier urged the reader to visit the website and accompany it "in the struggle for global white supremacy".&lt;ref name="hacking"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/03/26/breaking-after-hack-neo-nazi-group-anti-semitic-fliers-appear-campus-printers|title=After Hack by Neo-Nazi Group, Anti-Semitic Fliers Appear on Campus Printers|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|date=March 26, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weevfly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2016/03/breaking-hacker-claims-responsibility-for-anti-semitic-messages-around-u-alleges-presence-of-white-supremacist-group-on-campus/|title=Hacker, white supremacist website claim responsibility for anti-Semitic messages around U|work=[[Daily Princetonian]]|date=March 25, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016|first=Amber|last=Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglin credited weev for the printer exploit, while one of ''The Daily Stormer'' crew composed the flier's text.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://storify.com/weev/a-small-experiment-in|title=A brief experiment in printing.|publisher=storify.com|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20 that year, Hitler's birthday, university printers in Germany were hacked to publish Nazi propaganda tracts including the website's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smale|first1=Alison|title=Printers at German Universities Mysteriously Churn Out Anti-Semitic Fliers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/world/europe/germany-anti-semitic-leaflets.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 26, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ''The Daily Stormer'' expanded its activities to establish 31 "clubs".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Potok, [https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/year-hate-and-extremism The Year in Hate and Extremism: 2017 Spring Issue], ''Intelligence Report'', Southern Poverty Law Center (February 15, 2017): "The Daily Stormer, the website whose chief came up with the term 'Our Glorious Leader' for Trump, expanded into real-world activism by starting 31 'clubs'."&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Stormer'' capitalized on the popularity of the [[augmented reality]] video game ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' in mid-2016 to distribute racist flyers to children congregating in public to play the game, with Anglin explaining that "I have long thought that we needed to get pre-teens involved in the movement.

''The Daily Stormer'' helped organize the [[Unite the Right rally]], a far-right rally in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] on August 11 and 12, 2017, in which a counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed in [[Charlottesville car attack|a vehicular ramming]].&lt;ref name=funeral&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worley|first1=Will|title=Neo-Nazi website asks readers to target funeral of Heather Heyer who died in Charlottesville violence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/america-top-neo-nazi-website-daily-stormer-orders-followers-harass-funeral-heather-heyer-victim-a7895496.html|accessdate=August 17, 2017|work=The Independent|date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weev also called for readers of ''The Daily Stormer'' to locate and attend Heyer's funeral, calling her a "fat skank".&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt; Both Anglin and weev deny that Heyer died from vehicular impact, claiming instead that she was killed by a weight-related heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaplan|first1=Alex|title=Fringe media are furiously trying to absolve the white nationalist who allegedly killed Heather Heyer|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/09/08/Fringe-media-are-furiously-trying-to-absolve-the-white-nationalist-who-allegedly-killed-He/217886|accessdate=October 7, 2017|publisher=Media Matters for America|date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domain blocking by Internet providers has raised questions regarding the implications of domain registrants policing the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/08/the_one_big_problem_with_godaddy_dropping_the_daily_stormer.html|title=GoDaddy Joins the Resistance|first=Will|last=Oremus|date=August 16, 2017|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|archivedate=August 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170818193342/http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/08/the_one_big_problem_with_godaddy_dropping_the_daily_stormer.html|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haroldfurchtgottroth/2017/08/16/daily-stormer-shows-up-hypocrisy-of-network-neutrality/|title=Daily Stormer Shows Us Hypocrisy Of Network Neutrality|first=Harold|last=Furchtgott-Roth|date=August 16, 2017|website=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/fighting-neo-nazis-future-free-expression|title=Fighting Neo-Nazis and the Future of Free Expression|date=August 17, 2017|website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|archivedate=August 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170818215148/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/fighting-neo-nazis-future-free-expression|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-aug21"&gt;{{cite web|first=Adi|last=Robertson|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/21/16180614/charlottesville-daily-stormer-alt-right-internet-domain|title=Why the alt-right can’t build an alt-internet|date=August 21, 2017|website=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The August 21 cancellation of [[The Rebel Media]]'s registration on 24 hours notice was compared to that of ''The Daily Stormer'', as both had provided coverage sympathetic to Charlottesville protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-rebel-disrupted-as-it-loses-its-domain-provider/wcm/a35f68b6-b18e-4e66-b2bd-143412d56195|title=The Rebel disrupted as it loses its domain provider|publisher=National Post|date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] acknowledged that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with ''The Daily Stormer'', but that the move set a dangerous precedent in which other political views including left-wing ones could be denied legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/fighting-neo-nazis-future-free-expression|title=Fighting Neo-Nazis and the Future of Free Expression|date=August 17, 2017|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|archivedate=August 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170818215148/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/fighting-neo-nazis-future-free-expression|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/08/18/blocking-neo-nazi-site-dangerous-warns-digital-rights-group-eff/580463001/|title=Blocking neo-Nazi site is 'dangerous,' warns digital rights group EFF|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several news outlets also published editorials discussing the free speech implications of the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/08/the_one_big_problem_with_godaddy_dropping_the_daily_stormer.html|title=GoDaddy Joins the Resistance - Activists got domain registries to pull the plug on the Daily Stormer.

As of August 17, ''The Daily Stormer'' had returned to the dark web on the Tor network. This prompted an announcement from the Tor project team that they were "disgusted" by the website—but that they were powerless to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-tor-project-refuses-censor-neo-nazi-websites-child-porn-drug-dealing-1635605|title=Why the Tor Project refuses to censor neo-Nazi websites, child porn and drug dealing|first=Jason|last=Murdock|date=August 18, 2017|website=[[International Business Times]]|archivedate=August 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170818195310/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-tor-project-refuses-censor-neo-nazi-websites-child-porn-drug-dealing-1635605|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-tor-project-is-disgusted-by-the-daily-stormer-but-cant-censor-it-2017-8|title=The Tor Project is 'disgusted' by the Daily Stormer – but can't censor it|first=Shona|last=Ghosh|date=August 18, 2017|website=[[Business Insider]]|archivedate=August 19, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170819015015/http://nordic.businessinsider.com/the-tor-project-is-disgusted-by-the-daily-stormer-but-cant-censor-it-2017-8?r=US&amp;IR=T|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vice News]]'' noted that [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] remained a client of Cloudflare; also (as echoed in commentary from a new blog by Andrew Anglin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andrewanglinblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/on-the-current-status-of-the-daily-stormer-and-the-weird-events-surrounding-it/|title=On the current status of the Daily Stormer and the weird events surrounding it|date=August 25, 2017|author=Andrew Anglin|publisher=Wordpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that GoDaddy remains a registrar for [[Celeb Jihad]], which features leaked or hacked sexual videos of celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gyywax/hacked-celebrity-nudes-show-freedom-of-speech-is-arbitrarily-defined-by-internet-corporations|title=Hacked celebrity nudes show freedom of speech is arbitrarily defined by internet corporations|publisher=Vice|date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Stormfront's domain name was seized by [[Network Solutions]], enforcing terms of service against "bigotry, discrimination or hatred". Prompted by correspondence from the [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law]], the action prevented the site, which had operated for 20 years, from reemerging under a different registrar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/08/26/white-supremacist-forum-site-stormfront-seized-domain-hosts/604902001/|title=White supremacist forum site Stormfront seized by domain hosts|author=Brittany Crocker|publisher=Knoxville News-Sentinel|date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Economic Observer''''' ({{zh|s=经济观察报|t= 經濟觀察報|p=jīngjìguānchá bào}}) is an independent,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} weekly simplified-character Chinese newspaper published in the [[People's Republic of China]] since April 2001. The newspaper is considered by many people to be one of the top three economic-focused newspapers in China&lt;ref name="danwei1"&gt;[http://www.danwei.org/media_guide/newspapers/the_economic_observer.php "The Economic Observer"], ''Danwei'', Retrieved on 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and is well regarded for its in-depth special features and commentary.&lt;ref name="danwei1"/&gt;

Inspired by the British ''[[Financial Times]]'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} as of September 2001, the Economic Observer has also been printed on salmon/peach-colored paper. Although the newspaper's editorial offices are based in Beijing, the newspaper is actually registered in Ji'nan, the capital of Shandong province.

The Economic Observer Online was relaunched in March 2007 and offers subscribers access to all the newspaper's content. However, most of the articles from each week's newspaper also appear on the website at no charge, along with web-only content, which includes commentary and op-ed pieces from guest columnists.

The newspaper's English-language website, features select translations from the weekly newspaper and the website; it also publishes original reporting and interviews.

==Overview==
The paper is distributed on Saturday mornings but the official publication date is printed as the following Monday.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Each issue is 56 pages and sells for 5 Chinese yuan or 10 Hong Kong dollars.

The newspaper's slogan is "rationality and constructiveness" ({{zh|c= 理性，建设性|p=lǐxìng, jiànshèxìng}}).

==History==
Founded in August 2000, the Economic Observer began as a small news publication dedicated to supporting China's market liberalization and reporting on socioeconomic and political events with a stated commitment to journalistic integrity. The first issue was published in April 2001 and was 24 pages. By December 2006, the newspaper had expanded to the current 56 pages.

===Sections===
The Economic Observer features seven regular sections: News, Nation, Market, Corporation, Automobile/Property, Observer, Lifestyle/Business Review.

===Style===
The Economic Observer is considered to take a noticeably independent approach to reporting the news in China.&lt;ref&gt;French, Howard W. [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-next-empire/8018/ "The Next Empire"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', May 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper also has a reputation for being "pro-business" and in favor of the continuation of market reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Garnaut, John. [http://www.theage.com.au/business/billionaire-who-bribed-rio-exec-unlikely-to-be-charged-20100330-rbmj.html "Billionaire Who Bribed Rio Executive Unlikely to be Charged"], ''[[The Age]]'', Melbourne, 30 March 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joint Copenhagen Editorial====

On December 7, 2009, The Economic Observer was one of only two Chinese newspapers to publish a common editorial with 55 other newspaper around the world calling for action from the world leaders gathering in Copenhagen for the UN's climate change summit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/06/papers-copenhagen-leader "The papers that will carry the Copenhagen editorial"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', London, 6 December 2009. Retrieved on 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for a common editorial was hatched by the British newspaper The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Ian. [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/06/climate-change-leader-editorial "How the climate change global editorial project came about"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', London, 6 December 2009. Retrieved on 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hukou Editorial====
In March 2010, The Economic Observer published an editorial calling on representatives of China's legislature to adopt reforms to the country’s household registration system. In an unprecedented move, the editorial was also simultaneously published by 13 other Chinese newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Branigan, Tania. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/01/chinese-newspapers-migrant-workers-rights "Chinese newspapers in joint call to end curb on migrant workers"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', London, 1 March 2010. Retrieved on 2010-6-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The editorial was headlined, “''Request for Representatives at the Two Meetings to Hasten Reform of the Household Registration System''”

A report in the ''New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;Lafraniere, Sharon and Ansfield, Jonathan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/world/asia/10china.html "Editor Is Fired After Criticizing Chinese Registration System"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Beijing, 9 March 2010. Retrieved on 2010-6-16.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316041421/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/world/asia/10china.html |date=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; said that one of the editors involved, Deputy Editor of the Economic Observer Online Zhang Hong, was removed from his position as punishment for his role in the publishing the editorial.

According to an article on the Wall Street Journal's ''China Real Time Blog'', Zhang Hong hatched the plan to publish an editorial in collaboration with other media outlets after taking part in the Guardian's "Copenhagen" editorial the previous year (see above).&lt;ref&gt;Canaves, Sky. [https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2010/03/09/i-am-a-moderate-adviser/ "I'm a moderate Observer"], ''China Real Time Report'', Beijing, 9 March 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wenzhou Train Crash ====
On July 30, 2011, a week after 40 people were killed in a [[Wenzhou train collision|high speed train collision]] near Wenzhou, the newspaper ignored a government censorship directive&lt;ref&gt;“A Letter to Yiyi: Chinese Newspaper’s Defiant Commentary on Train Collision” The Wall Street Journal’s China Real Time Report, 2011/7/31, Retrieved 2011/8/17 https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/07/31/a-letter-to-yiyi-chinese-newspapers-defiant-commentary-on-train-collision/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Chinese newspapers defy ban to report on train tragedy” The Guardian, 2011/8/2, Retrieved 2011/8/17 http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/aug/02/press-freedom-china&lt;/ref&gt; to publish an eight-page feature&lt;ref&gt;“Feature: Wenzhou Train Disaster” 2011/7/31, Retrieved 2011/8/17. http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/2011/0801/207710.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; on the crash. The front page story was presented as a letter to 2-year old survivor Xiang Weiyi, whose parents were killed. It described two images of China, “one blossoming in the midst of the people, the other hidden in officialdom,” and pledged “to advocate and act” for the people’s rights.

====Reforming the Ministry of Railways ====
The newspaper was fined and issued a warning over an inaccurate report published in June 2012 that said the Railway Ministry may be reformed. Authorities revoked the press pass of the reporter who wrote the story. The article claimed that the ministry may lose control of investment, construction and railway operations. It said the ministry would establish and inject assets into three new companies, which would be overseen by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.&lt;ref&gt;“Chinese Newspaper Fined for False Report About Railway Ministry” Bloomberg, 2012/8/31, Retrieved 2012/8/31 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/chinese-newspaper-fined-for-false-report-about-railway-ministry.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The original investment for the newspaper came from the Sanlian Group, a diversified state-invested company based in Shandong province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanlian.com.cn/Content.Asp?ID=2911 "Company Website"], ''Sanlian Group''. Retrieved on 2010-06-16.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116081509/http://www.sanlian.com.cn/Content.Asp?ID=2911 |date=January 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Xinhua Sports and Entertainment Limited sold the advertising rights and the distribution rights of the paper to private buyer [[Lu Zhiqiang]], a real estate billionaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stock.jrj.com.cn/invest/2010/05/2602217526839.shtml "卢志强或将全面接盘《经济观察报》"] (Chinese). Retrieved on 2010-09-16.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707020818/http://stock.jrj.com.cn/invest/2010/05/2602217526839.shtml |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lu Zhiqiang currently has full control of the Economic Observer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''''The First Emperor''''' is an [[opera]] in two acts with music by [[Tan Dun]] and a [[libretto]] written in [[English language|English]] by Tan Dun and [[Ha Jin]]. The opera received its world premiere at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]] on 21 December 2006, conducted by the composer with [[Plácido Domingo]] in the title role. It was broadcast live to hundreds of cinemas around the world on 13 January 2007 as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|Met Live in HD]] season. The following year, [[EMI]] released this movie broadcast on DVD. The opera was a co-production between the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[Los Angeles Opera]] and was described to be the most elaborate Metropolitan opera production since ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/production.aspx?id=8798|title=The First Emperor|publisher=The [[Metropolitan Opera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The protagonist is the real-life emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], who unified [[History of China|China]] with force, erected part of the [[Great Wall]], and was buried with his [[terracotta army]]. The story of the opera is based on the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by [[Sima Qian]] (c.145 – 90 BC) and the screenplay of ''The Emperor’s Shadow'' by [[Wei Lu]].

Tan Dun was first approached by the Met in 1996 to write an opera. After seeing the film ''[[The Emperor's Shadow]]'', he settled on the theme of the First Emperor. [[Zhang Yimou]], the production's stage director, had worked with Tan Dun on the movie ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' that also deals with emperor Qin, albeit at an earlier time. The world premiere production was estimated to cost in excess of US$2 million.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[http://tandunonline.com/files/NYT_First%20Emperor.pdf  Lois Morris and Robert Lipsyte, "The Met's Way Out-of-Town Tryout", ''New York Times'', 14 May 2006, (accessed 7 December 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation, Met staff was instructed in Chinese, and workshops in the development of the opera were held in [[Shanghai]], in part as a cost-saving measure. Eagerly anticipated, the opera has been described as "a high-stakes, cross-cultural gamble".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Tan Dun noted in regard to working in the operatic form: 
:“Opera will no longer be a Western form, as it is no longer an Italian form.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://tandunonline.com/files/firstemperor_article.pdf Statement by Tan Dun]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act 1=== 
''Scene 1''

The traditional music at the court displeases the Emperor; he envisions a new anthem that glorifies his rule. He believes that his childhood friend, the composer Gao Jianli, should be the person to compose the anthem. Jianli lives in [[Yan State|Yan]], a state that the emperor has not yet conquered, and he orders his General to subjugate Yan and to get Jianli. As a reward for a victory, the Emperor promises his crippled daughter, Princess Yueyang, to the General.

''Scene 2''

The General is successful, and Jianli is brought before the Emperor. Although the Emperor greets Jianli with friendship, Jianli is enraged and rejects him: his village was destroyed, and his mother was killed. He would rather die than compose an anthem for the emperor. Princess Yueyang admires his bravery.

''Scene 3''

The Princess convinces the Emperor to hand Jianli over to her if she is able to convince him to live on and write the anthem. Jianli refuses to eat, but when the Princess feeds him from her own mouth, his resistance is broken. They make love and she loses her virginity. The Princess cries he is hurting her legs and she realises she is no longer paralysed and can walk normally. The Emperor, who is overjoyed to see her cured and calls Jianli a miracle worker, soon recognizes the cause. He wants to kill Jianli for violating his daughter, but hesitates at this point to get his anthem.

===Act 2===
''Scene 1''

As Jianli instructs Princess Yueyang in music, he hears the slaves sing while they build the Great Wall. The Emperor appears and demands that his daughter honor his promise of marriage to General [[Wang Bi]]. Yueyang refuses; she would rather kill herself. The Emperor schemes asking Jianli to give her up temporarily. He expects the General to be killed in battle, and Jianli would be free afterwards to have his daughter. Jianli agrees and will complete the anthem.

''Scene 2''

At the imperial inauguration the Emperor encounters the ghost of Yueyang: she had committed suicide as she could not sacrifice her love for the benefit of the country. Next he meets the ghost of General Wang Bi telling him that he was poisoned by Jianli and warning him of Jianli’s vengeance. As the Emperor ascends towards his throne, Jianli emerges. Insane with grief about his lover’s death, he bites off his tongue and spits it out at the Emperor. The Emperor strikes him down to spare him a slow death. He moves on to his throne and now hears the anthem for the first time. It is the slaves’ song. He realizes that this is Jianli's revenge.

==First performances and reviews==
The stage director of the first production was Chinese [[film director]] [[Zhang Yimou]]. The sets were designed by [[Fan Yue]], with choreography devised by [[Dou Dou Huang]] and costumes created by [[Emi Wada]].

Upon its premiere, the opera has received mixed reviews&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/arts/music/23empe.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Anthony Tommasini, "A Majestic Imperial Chinese Saga Has Its Premiere at the Met", ''New York Times'', 12 December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/ Alex Ross, "Stone Opera: Tan Dun’s ''The First Emperor'' at the Met", ''The New Yorker'', 8 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/45704?page_no=1 Jay Nordlinger, "A ‘First Emperor' With Lessons To Learn" ''The Sun'' (New York), 26 December 2006 (accessed 3 January 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/arts/classicaldance/classical/reviews/26012/ Peter G.

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote "everything is excellent apart from the music and the words...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.guardian.co.uk/classical/comment/story/0,,1989153,00.html James Fenton, "Featherlight opera".

One article has suggested revisions to the opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-ffmus5047444jan14,0,2592915.story Justin Davidson, "Can the 'Emperor' strike back?".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">'''The Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing''' is a series of “wine and music pairings,” created by noted restaurateur and viticulturist [[Joe Bastianich]] and writer-musician [[Mike Edison]],  along with writer and wine expert [[David Lynch (wine)|David Lynch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/newyork/articles/led-zeppelin-wine-tasting,27655 Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting - A.V. Club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25997634-14440,00.html Whole lotta Joe - TheAustralian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/rock_wine_6eepZtkURHTX9Pg55vlcAO Rock 'N' Wine - NewYorkPost]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042009/entertainment/food/its_a_red_zeppelin_157977.htm It's a Red Zeppelin - NewYorkPost]&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianich and Lynch are both recipients of the [[James Beard Award.]]

The idea was formed when Bastianich and Edison were pondering how to pair the songs of [[Led Zeppelin]] with various wines.

"Our passion for wine is only rivaled by our passion for Zeppelin,” said Bastianich, and encouraged attendees to "taste with their ears and listen with their mouths."&lt;ref name="nym09"&gt;New York Metromix, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison, in an interview with publishing blog Galley Cat, said, "Either you see this as a hyper-intellectual exercise in promoting the lexicon of oenology as a valid critical system while simultaneously subverting it and subjecting it to ridicule—or you think it is just some dudes who want to drink some really good wine and listen to Led Zeppelin. No matter what, it is still going be the best salon since [[Dorothy Parker]] made that crack about horticulture.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleycat.com/ Galleycat.com], March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why Led Zeppelin? ==
Edison has explained that “Zep is the perfect band to pair with wine—maybe the only band. They have all the right qualities: They can be earthy and intense, or dark and mellow, or just insanely huge. They've got some very real, edgy twang, and some rich, complex textures. They embrace both the Old World and the New. I can't think of any other band that shows so much depth and development, both within individual songs and across entire records,” adding, that the wine pairings were both “freakishly sophisticated and patently absurd.”&lt;ref name="nym09"/&gt;

==History==
The first Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing was held at [[Becco]] restaurant in New York City on March 17, 2009,  and received excellent reviews and widespread media attention. The New York Post reported, “Guests at Tuesday night's first-ever Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting were an odd combo of wine fans and Zep heads but it didn't take many samplings for everyone to start feeling a whole lotta love.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The menu, created by chef [[Billy Gallagher (chef)|Billy Gallagher]], featured six courses, each paired with wine and select Led Zeppelin songs, as follows:

'''~Antipasto~'''

“[[The Song Remains the Same (song)|The Song Remains the Same]]”

Grilled Calamari &amp; Dandelion Salad with Hard-Boiled Egg

Champagne 1er Cru Vertus NV, Guy Larmandier (France)
Gruner Veltliner Smaragd Terrassen 2007,
Domane Wachan (Austria)

'''~Primi~'''

Pinot Noir Knox Alexander 2006, Au Bon Climat (California)

“[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]”

Black Spaghetti Arribiata with Sautéed Shrimp

Malbec 2005, Tritono (Argentina)

'''~Secondi~'''

“[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]”, “[[Whole Lotta Love]]”

Bistecca alla Becco

Black Angus Rib-Eye Steak grilled Medium-Rare  with Garlic Mashed Potatoes &amp; Sauteed Broccoli Rabe

Barolo Vigne Rionda 2000, Oddero   (Italy)

'''~Dolci~'''

“[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]”

Farm Fresh Tangerines

Moscato d’Asti 2008, Vietti (Italy)

“[[Custard Pie (song)|Custard Pie]]”

Vanilla Custard Pie &amp; Led Zeppolini

The second Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting was held at City Winery in [[New York City]] and featured the Led Zeppelin Tribute band [[Six Foot Nurse]] performing live with special guest [[Scott Ian]] from the band [[Anthrax.]] More events are expected, including one in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in May 2010. &lt;-- did this take place? --&gt;

== Quotes ==
'''Joe Bastianich:''' “I think because of the sheer complexity and the deep roots of the music—where the music comes from, and how profound it is— Led Zeppelin's music can only really be paralleled with the kind of evolution, importance and complexity of wine, as both a cultural thing as well as a beverage.”&lt;ref&gt;''New York Metromix, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike Edison:''' “Back when I was in seminary school, attempting to pair [[Boones Farm]] apple wine with "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" and having disastrous results, I stumbled upon this little theory: "[[Led Zeppelin IV]]" is the record that when you're stoned and listening to it really loud you think the phone is ringing when it's really not. ’[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]’ is like a fully fucking awesome motherfucker—this is when they got really heavy.”&lt;ref name="nym09" /&gt;

'''[[David Lynch (wine)|David Lynch]]''' (referring to the “Black Dog” pairing): We're bringing the thunder. We're bringing the tannin. We're bringing the viscosity. We're coming at you with guns blazing, with a [[Malbec]] from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="nym09" /&gt;

'''Thomas Herndon''' is an Assistant Professor of [[Economics]] at Loyola Marymount University, who, as a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts, became known for critiquing "[[Growth in a Time of Debt]]", a widely cited academic paper by [[Carmen Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff]] supporting the [[austerity]] policies implemented by governments in Europe and North America in the early 21st century. His research concluded that these measures may not have been necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22197958|title=Doubt cast on research supporting austerity|work=BBC News|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=19 April 2013|quote=The new research suggests that austerity measures may not have been necessary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herndon proved the paper contained multiple errors, provoking widespread international interest and embarrassment for austerity policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/how-thomas-herndon-a-student-took-on-harvard-economists-and-won/386213-2.html|title=How Thomas Herndon, a student, took on Harvard economists and won|work=IBN Live|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ruth|last=Alexander|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22223190|title=Reinhart, Rogoff... and Herndon: The student who caught out the profs of austerity|work=BBC News|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reinhart-Rogoff paper was frequently cited during the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pete|last=Evans|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2013/04/17/business-austerity-rogoff-reinhart.html|title=Key pro-austerity study based on incorrect math: Holes poked in analysis that claims high debt loads cause economies to shrink|work=CBC News|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also frequently cited among policymakers in congress, including in the drafting of the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform|Bowles-Simpson report]]. However, there are differing views on the actual impact the original paper may have had on policy making.&lt;ref name="Trotter 2013" /&gt;

The findings have been described as "shocking" and as having rocked the economics world. Publications such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have for several years taken the conclusions of the Reinhart-Rogoff paper as an "economic consensus view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Konczal|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/thomas-herndon-michael-ash-and-robert-pollin-on-reinhart-and-rogoff-2013-4|title=Shocking Paper Claims That Microsoft Excel Coding Error Is Behind The Reinhart-Rogoff Study On Debt|work=Businessinsider|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Parnass|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/home/5775445-95/umass-graduate-student-thomas-herndon-rocks-economics-world-with-class-project-on-debt-growth|title=UMass graduate student Thomas Herndon rocks economics world with class project on debt, growth|work=Gazettenet|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine wrote that Herndon "just used part of his spring semester to shake the intellectual foundation of the global austerity movement."&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Roose|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/04/grad-student-who-shook-global-austerity-movement.html|title=Meet the 28-Year-Old Grad Student Who Just Shook the Global Austerity Movement|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of flaws in ''Growth in a Time of Debt''==

During his graduate studies in a class with Professor Michael Ash, Herndon was assigned to pick an economics paper and try to replicate the results. He chose "Growth in a Time of Debt", and throughout the semester his attempts to replicate the results proved unsuccessful. After further consultation with his professors Michael Ash and [[Robert Pollin]], Herndon was encouraged to contact the authors Reinhart and Rogoff at Harvard. They provided him with the actual working [[spreadsheet]] they had used to obtain their results. Herndon looked into the detail of the original spreadsheet and found several issues:&lt;ref name="Ruth Alexander 2013" /&gt;

*The authors had accidentally only included 15 of the 20 countries under analysis in their key calculation (having excluded Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark);&lt;ref name="Ruth Alexander 2013" /&gt;
*For some countries, some data was missing;&lt;ref name="Ruth Alexander 2013" /&gt;
*The methodology to average out performance of countries of different sizes was called into question. For example, one bad year for New Zealand, was weighted equally with the United Kingdom, a major global economy with nearly 20 years of high [[public debt]].&lt;ref name="Ruth Alexander 2013" /&gt; Reinhart and Rogoff have defended the high weight given to New Zealand's economy in 1951, but even granting this point fully, grave doubts are still placed on the major Reinhart-Rogoff results.

The basic conclusion that countries with indebtedness rates above 90% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] have lower growth rates still held, but the most spectacular results disappeared, the relationship was much gentler and there were numerous exceptions to the rule. These results were published on 15 April 2013 as a draft working paper, and in 2014 in the [[peer-review]]ed [[Cambridge Journal of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Trotter 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruth Alexander 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11239">The '''1972 UK miners' strike''' was a major strike involving a dispute between the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) and the Conservative [[Edward Heath]] government over pay. It began on 9 January 1972 and ended on 28 February 1972, when the miners returned to work. The strike was called by the National Executive Committee of the NUM and ended when the miners accepted an improved pay offer in a ballot. It was the first time since 1926 that British miners had been on official strike, but there had been a widespread [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike in 1969]].

==Background== 
The strike occurred after wage negotiations between the NUM and the [[National Coal Board]] had broken down. It was the first time since 1926 that British miners had officially gone on strike (although there had been unofficial strikes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agor.org.uk/cwm/themes/events/1972_1974_strikes.asp|title=1972 and 1974 Miners' Strikes|website=www.agor.org.uk|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was caused by the issue of pay. In 1960, according to one study, "miners, of whom there were still half a million in 1960, enjoyed historically unprecedented standards of living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AtYj5rI0MvUC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=britain+miners+affluent+workers+consumer+goods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7hIeujpbMAhUGaRQKHfzUCF8Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=britain+miners+affluent+workers+consumer+goods&amp;f=false|title=The Labour Governments 1964-70, Volume 1: Labour and Cultural Change|first=Steven|last=Fielding|date=9 July 2018|publisher=Manchester University Press|accessdate=9 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another study, while the real net income of an average miner in 1957 with a wife and two children was approximately 22% above that of his male counterpart in manufacturing, that fell to approximately 2% below the manufacturing figure in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zxU9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=wales+miners+high+wages+1957&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitm5_Dn_3LAhWGZQ8KHfQuCNoQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wales+miners+high+wages+1957&amp;f=false|title=Wages Policy in the British Coalmining Industry: A Study of National Wage Bargaining|first=L. J.|last=Handy|date=26 March 1981|publisher=CUP Archive|accessdate=9 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, the wages of miners went up from a prewar position of 84th to near the top in the league table of the wages earned by industrial workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/charlton/1973/03/miners.htm|title=John Charlton: The Miners Since Nationalisation (March 1973)|first=John|last=Charlton|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1960, miners' wages were 7.4% above the average pay of workers in manufacturing industries. During the 1960s, however, pay fell behind other workers, and by 1970 were earning 3.1% less than the average worker in manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1985/patterns/part3.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Patterns of mass strike (Part 3)|first=Tony|last=Cliff|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike==
During a parliamentary debate on the strike in its second week, both Labour and Conservative MPs praised the miners for the forbearance shown during the mass pit closures in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=R65&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Scargill: the unauthorized biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |page=65 |isbn=0-00-638077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers]] did not strike. Following some confrontations with NUM pickets, the National Coal Board adopted a policy of giving leave on full pay to any members of NACODS who faced aggressive intimidation on the way to work.&lt;ref name=STimes161162&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |pages=161–162 |isbn=0-340-38445-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike was characterised by the use of [[flying picket]]s sent to other industrial sites to persuade other workers to strike in solidarity with the miners, which led to railway workers' refusing to transport coal and power station workers' refusing to handle coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss without limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |pages=15–16 |isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power shortages emerged, and a [[state of emergency]] was declared on 9 February, after the weather had turned cold unexpectedly and voltage had been reduced across the entire national grid.&lt;ref name=R66&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Scargill: the unauthorized biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |page=66 |isbn=0-00-638077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A miner from [[Hatfield, South Yorkshire|Hatfield]] Colliery, near [[Doncaster]], Freddie Matthews, was killed by a lorry while he was picketing on 3 February 1972, which led to a huge crowd at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/end-of-an-era-for-num-branch-1-529472|author=David Jones | title=	
END OF AN ERA FOR NUM BRANCH | publisher=Doncaster Free Press| accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nonunionised lorry driver had mounted the pavement to pass the picket line and struck Matthews in the process.&lt;ref name=R6667&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Scargill: the unauthorized biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |pages=66–67 |isbn=0-00-638077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the death, the picketing in the Doncaster area became more violent, with clashes reported with the NACODS members at Markham Main and [[Kilnhurst]].&lt;ref name=R6667/&gt; That led [[Tom Swain]], Labour MP to [[North East Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Derbyshire North East]], to remark, "This could be the start of another [[Ulster]] in the Yorkshire coalfield."&lt;ref name=R6667/&gt;  He threatened to "advocate violence" if an immediate statement were not made on Matthews's death.&lt;ref name=R6667/&gt;

The strike lasted seven weeks and ended after miners agreed to a pay offer on 19 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/9/newsid_2515000/2515917.stm | title=	
1972: Miners strike against government | publisher=BBC | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer came after the [[Battle of Saltley Gate]], when around 2000 NUM pickets descended on a coke works in [[Birmingham]] and were later joined by thousands of workers from other industries in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9694000/9694645.stm|title=The Battle of Saltley Gate recalled|date=10 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was characterised as a "victory for violence" by the Conservative Cabinet at the time in reference to some clashes between miners and police and to some throwing of stones and bottles at lorries trying to pass the pickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Robert  | title =Re-examining the Battle of Saltley Gate: interpretations of leadership, violence and legacy | publisher =[[University of Bristol]] | date =2010 | page = 20  | url =http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/media/docs/ug-dissertations/2010kellaway.pdf | accessdate = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned strikebreaking force==
A volunteer force was planned in Scotland to break the miners' pickets during the strike. It has emerged, under the [[thirty-year rule]], that [[civil servants]], police, local authorities and other organisations worked on a secret project to gather hundreds of drivers to supply the country's power stations.&lt;ref name="Volunteer"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2617565.stm |publisher= [[BBC Scotland]]|title= Striking miners faced 'volunteer force' |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Royal Air Force]] base was to be used for the unit.&lt;ref name="Volunteer"/&gt; They were to have between 400 and 600 trucks and drivers.&lt;ref name="Volunteer"/&gt; [[Fire brigades]] were also contacted to provide off-duty staff and volunteer groups to cater for the coal convoys.&lt;ref name="Volunteer"/&gt; The role of the volunteers was to drive in convoys to break the picketlines blocking the supply of coal to the Scottish power plants.&lt;ref name="Volunteer"/&gt; The plans were never put into the place because the dispute was brought to a close.&lt;ref name="Volunteer"/&gt;

==Creation of COBRA==
The inadequacy of the Government's response to the strike provoked re-evaluation of emergency planning.  The [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room]] (known as COBR) was created to coordinate responses to national and regional crises, and is still used in British Government today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=145 |isbn=9780719025488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25458">'''Mass evacuation''', '''forced displacement''', '''expulsion''', '''and deportation''' of millions of people took place across most countries involved in [[World War II]]. A number of these phenomena were categorised as violations of fundamental human values and norms by the [[Nuremberg Tribunal]] after the war ended. The mass movement of people – most of them refugees – has either been caused by the hostilities, or enforced by the former Axis and the Allied powers based on ideologies of race and ethnicity, culminating in the postwar border changes enacted by the international settlements. The refugee crisis created across formerly occupied territories in World War II provided the context for much of the new international [[refugee]] and global [[human rights]] architecture existing today.&lt;ref name="Durkin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Neil Durkin, [[Amnesty International]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/12/98/50th_anniversary_declaration_of_human_rights/231204.stm |title=Our century's greatest achievement |work=On the 50th Anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=BBC News |date=9 December 1998 |accessdate=30 November 2015 |via=Internet Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111114857/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/12/98/50th_anniversary_declaration_of_human_rights/231204.stm |archivedate=November 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belligerents on both sides engaged in forms of expulsion of people perceived as being associated with the enemy. The major location for the wartime displacements was the East-Central and Eastern Europe, although Japanese people were expelled during and after the war by Allied powers from locations in Asia including India. The [[Holocaust]] also involved deportations and expulsions of Jews aside from the subsequent genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany under the auspices of [[Aktion Reinhard]].&lt;ref name="Durkin"/&gt;

== World War II deportations, expulsions and displacements ==
Following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 which marked the beginning of World War II, the campaign of ethnic "cleansing" became the goal of military operations for the first time since the end of World War I.

===Aftermath of the invasion of Poland===
{{main|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union}} 
* 1939 to 1945: The Nazis planned to ethnically cleanse [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|the whole Polish population]] apparently  to a [[germanisation]] Master Plan called ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm Janusz  Gumkowski and Kazimierz Leszczynski, Poland Under Nazi Occupation, (Warsaw, Polonia Publishing House, 1961) pp. 7-33, 164-178.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413024247/http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |date=2012-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Consequences of German Nazism|in the course of Nazi occupation]] up to 1.6 to 2 million [[Poles]] were expelled, not counting [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|millions of slave labourers]] deported from Poland to the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544 Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1939 to 1940: Expulsions of 680,000&lt;ref name="Zwangsumsiedlung 2009"&gt;"Zwangsumsiedlung, Flucht und Vertreibung 1939 - 1959 : Atlas zur Geschichte Ostmitteleuropas", Witold Sienkiewicz, Grzegorz Hryciuk, Bonn 2009, {{ISBN|978-83-7427-391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poles from German occupied [[Wielkopolska]] (German -[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]). From the city of [[Poznań]] Germans expelled to [[General Government]] 70,000 Poles. By 1945, half a million ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' Germans from [[Soviet Union]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Romania]], and the [[Baltic Germans]] had been resettled during action "[[Heim ins Reich]]" by German organisations like ''[[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]]'' and "Resettlement departament" of [[RKFDV]] ''(Stabshauptamt Reichkomissar für die Festigung deutsches Volkstums)'' from [[Eastern Europe]].
* 1939 to 1940: Expulsions of 121,765 Poles&lt;ref name="Zwangsumsiedlung 2009"/&gt; from German occupied [[Pomerania]]. On Polish places 130,000 ''Volksdeutsche'' was settled including 57,000 Germans from East Europe countries: [[Soviet Union]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Romania]] and the [[Baltic states]]. Deportation was a part of German "[[Lebensraum]]" policy ordered by German organisations like ''Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle'' and "Resettlement departament" of RKFDV.
* 1939 to 1940: The first [[evacuation of Finnish Karelia]] was the resettlement of the population of [[Finnish Karelia]] and other territories ceded by Finland to the [[Soviet Union]] after and during the [[Winter War]] into the remaining parts of [[Finland]]. Some of the territories were evacuated during the war or before it, as part of the course of the war. Most of the territory was evacuated after the Soviet Union gained it as a part of the [[Moscow peace treaty]]. In total, 410,000 people were transferred.

*[[Aliyah Bet]] was the code-name for illegal immigration of Jews to the [[Levant]] in the 1930s and 1940s, while the [[Holocaust]] was occurring, and the existence of numerous [[displaced person|displaced people]], of Jewish identity, was a major reason for the birth of the state of [[Israel]]. Those migrants were helped by an underground group called [[Bricha]]. After Israel was born, European Jewish migration to Israel continued, contributing to Israel's population growth. The [[Kielce pogrom]] and other anti-Semitic incidents were contributing factors. (This migration could be seen as an expulsion, given the conditions faced by European Jews at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}})

==Establishment of refugee organisations==
The [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] was set up in 1943, to provide humanitarian relief to the huge numbers of potential and existing refugees in areas facing Allied liberation. UNRRA provided billions of US dollars of rehabilitation aid, and helped about 8 million refugees. It ceased operations in Europe in 1947, and in Asia in 1949, upon which it ceased to exist. It was replaced in 1947 by the [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO), which in turn evolved into [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) in 1950.
