      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4684">The '''1979 Ba'ath Party Purge''' was a public [[purge]] of the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]] orchestrated on July 22, 1979 by then-president [[Saddam Hussein]].

== Background ==
Earlier in 1979, Iraqi president and chairman of the [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Revolutionary Command Council (RCC)]] [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] had begun to make treaties with [[Syria]], also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to the unification of the two countries. Syrian [[president of Syria|president]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] would become deputy leader of the union, and this would drive Saddam Hussein into obscurity.  Hussein acted to secure his grip on power.  The ailing al-Bakr resigned on July 16 under the threat of force, and formally transferred the presidency and chairmanship of the RCC to the "cherished comrade Saddam Hussein".  RCC secretary [[Muhyi Abdel-Hussein]] objected to the transfer of power.

Hussein hurriedly convened an assembly of party leaders on July 22. During the assembly, which he ordered videotaped,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|VHBF8EKt-zc|A Documentary on Saddam Hussein 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed to have uncovered a fifth column within the party.  Abdel-Hussein, broken after days of physical torture and under the threat of his family's execution, confessed to taking a leading role in a Syrian-backed plot against the Iraqi government and gave the names of 68 alleged co-conspirators.  These were removed from the room one by one as their names were called and taken into custody.  After the list was read, Hussein congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty.  Those arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of treason.  Twenty-two  men, including five members of the Revolutionary Command Council,&lt;ref name="SJ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq executes coup plotters |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19551595/iraq_executes_coup_plotters/|newspaper= [[The Salina Journal]]|date=August 8, 1979|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = April 25, 2018 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; were sentenced to execution.  Those spared were given weapons and directed to execute their comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Bay Fang. "[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040719/19iraq.htm When Saddam ruled the day]."

== Aftermath ==
By August 1, hundreds of high-ranking Ba'ath Party members had been executed. On August 8, the [[Iraqi News Agency]] announced that twenty-one of the twenty-two Iraqis were executed by firing squad for "their part in a plot to overthrow Iraq's new president". The twenty-second man was condemned to death in absentia because he was "nowhere to be found", the agency said.&lt;ref name="SJ" /&gt;  A tape of the assembly and of the executions was distributed throughout the country. "On an August afternoon in 1979, his face tense and somber, Saddam Hussein from the balcony of the presidential palace in Baghdad "informed a chanting crowd of 50,000 supporters "that he had just witnessed the punishment the state court had ordered for 21 of those men: They had been executed by a firing squad. The crowd cheered".&lt;ref&gt;''BEHIND IRAQ'S BOLD BID'', by Claudia Wright, 26 October 1980, The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essayist [[Christopher Hitchens]] argues that the purge was the watershed moment in which Hussein became absolute master of Iraq, comparable to the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in [[Nazi Germany]] or the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]], culminating in the [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]].

The '''Act of Proscription''' (19 Geo. 2, c. 39) was an [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which came into effect in [[Scotland]] on 1 August 1746. It was part of a series of efforts to assimilate the [[Scottish Highlands]], ending their ability to revolt, and the first of the 'King's laws' which sought to crush the [[Scottish clan|Clan system]] in the aftermath of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. These laws were finally repealed on 1 July 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkes-peerage.net/articles/scotland/tdinternational.aspx |title=International Tartan Day |publisher=Burke's Peerage and Gentry |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121222130/http://www.burkes-peerage.net/articles/scotland/tdinternational.aspx |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[United Kingdom|British]] forces under the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] had been brutal in putting down any hint of Jacobite resistance among Highlanders, and the Act can be seen as Parliament asserting the supremacy of the Civil Courts over unconstitutional military coercion.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Penalties==
It was mainly a restatement of the earlier [[Disarming Act]], but with more severe punishments which this time were rigorously enforced. Punishments started with fines, with jail until payment and possible forced [[conscription]] for late payment. Repeat offenders were "liable to be [[penal transportation|transported]] to any of his Majesty's plantations beyond the seas, there to remain for the space of seven years", effectively [[indentured servitude]].

The penalties for wearing "[[kilt|highland clothing]]" as stated in the [[Dress Act 1746]] were "imprisonment, without bail, during the space of six months, and no longer; and being convicted for a second offence before a [[court of justiciary]] or at the circuits, shall be liable to be transported..." No lesser penalties were allowed for.&lt;ref name="electricscotland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/proscription_1747.htm |title=Act of Proscription 1747 |publisher=Electric Scotland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical Coverage==
The elements of the act relating to the proscription of arms applied to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands of Scotland]], i.e. the counties of [[Dunbartonshire|Dunbarton]], on the north side of the [[River_Leven,_Dunbartonshire|water of Leven]], [[Stirling]] on the north side of the river of [[River Forth|Forth]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Kincardine]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]], [[Cromarty]], [[Argyll]], [[Forfar]], [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]], [[Sutherland]], [[Caithness]], [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]].&lt;ref name="electricscotland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/proscription_1747.htm |title=Act of Proscription 1747 |publisher=Electric Scotland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dress Act applied to the whole of Scotland.&lt;ref name="electricscotland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/proscription_1747.htm |title=Act of Proscription 1747 |publisher=Electric Scotland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comment==
Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] commented that "the last law by which the Highlanders are deprived of their arms, has operated with efficacy beyond expectations ... the arms were collected with such rigour, that every house was despoiled of its defence".

==Sections of the Act==
A new section, which became known as the [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act]], banned wearing of "the Highland Dress". Provision was also included to protect those involved in putting down the rebellion from lawsuits. Measures to prevent children from being "educated in disaffected or rebellious principles" included a requirement for [[school prayer]]s for the King and Royal family.

The most severe penalties, at a minimum six months' incarceration and transportation to a penal colony for a second offence, made these the most severe portion of this act.

==Following Act==
The Act of Proscription was followed by the [[Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746]] which removed the [[Feudalism|feudal]] authority the Clan Chieftains had enjoyed. Scottish heritable sheriffdoms reverted to the Crown, and other heritable jurisdictions, including [[regality|regalities]], came under the power of the courts.

The '''Alaska political corruption probe''' refers to a 2003 to 2010 widespread investigation by the [[Public Integrity Section]] of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] into [[political corruption]] of nine then-current or former Alaskan state lawmakers, as well as Republican US Representative [[Don Young]] and then-US Senator, Republican [[Ted Stevens]]. Sometimes referred to as "The Corrupt Bastard's Club" or the "Operation Polar Pen", the investigation focused on the [[oil industry]], [[fisheries]] and [[for-profit prison]] industries.

By the spring of 2006, the FBI set up in a Baranof hotel suite just three blocks away from the capitol building in Juneau. From their position in the hotel suite, they gathered evidence, such as a videotape of [[VECO]]'s CEO [[Bill Allen (corporate CEO)|Bill Allen]] arranging paper money for legislators, and made other observations By August 2008, the investigation resulted in indictments against six sitting or former Alaska Republican state legislators on corruption charges. In August 2008 US Senator [[Ted Stevens]] was indicted and, by October, he was convicted in Washington, D.C. on seven felony counts of failure to disclose gifts. The convictions, eight days before the November 2008 election, resulted in his narrow loss, after 40 years in the U.S. Senate, to Democrat [[Mark Begich]]. His convictions were later [[Set aside conviction|set aside]] because of [[prosecutorial misconduct]] and the [[United States Department of Justice]] ended further prosecution.

In addition to the conviction of US Senator Stevens, two executives of the [[VECO Corporation]], an oilfield services contractor, pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service. Alaska businessmen/lobbyists Bill Weimar (former for-profit halfway house owner) and Bill Bobrick, as well as [[Jim Clark (Alaska)|Jim Clark]], the former governor's chief of staff, also were indicted and convicted. Clark's guilty plea and sentence were later vacated before he was ordered to report to custody. That was followed by ex-Alaska State Rep. [[Bruce Weyhrauch]]'s Supreme Court challenge to the [[Honest services fraud]] statute. His case was decided on June 24, 2010, in association with the [[Skilling v. United States]] and [[Conrad Black]] case decisions. While the Court overturned the Skilling conviction, stating that the [[Honest services fraud]] statute was not applicable to private citizens,  the Court upheld, but narrowed the application of the Honest services fraud statute by stating that it was applicable to public officials only, and remanding  Weyhrauch's conviction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Federal prosecutors later agreed not to retry Weyhrauch on felony charges in exchange for  Weyhrauch's agreement to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor in an Alaska State Court. An Alaska State Court Judge then gave Weyhrauch a three-month suspended jail sentence, and a $1,000 fine.

==History==
The probe began in 2004 or earlier. By 2006 the name "Corrupt Bastards Club" (alternatively "Corrupt Bastards Caucus") began being used to designate Alaska legislators implicated in the federal corruption (a.k.a., "Polar Pen") investigation. The nickname originated in the spring of 2006 as a barroom joke among Alaska legislators after a guest article by Lori Backes, executive director of All Alaska Alliance, that ran in Alaska's three largest newspapers named 11 lawmakers who had received large campaign contributions from executives of the oilfield services company VECO Corporation, which had a long history of making large campaign contributions to Alaska politicians. The article also named Senate President [[Ben Stevens]] as having received large consulting fees from VECO.&lt;ref name="backes-followmoney"&gt;Backes, Lori. (March 3, 2006).

The figures were based on reports to the [http://doa.alaska.gov/apoc/ Alaska Public Offices Commission]

Additionally, Backes noted the consulting contract Senate President Ben Stevens (R-Anchorage) had with VECO Corporation and financial relationships other lawmakers had with other companies active in the oil and gas industry, including [[Conoco Phillips]] and ASCG Incorporated, the latter a subsidiary of [[Arctic Slope Regional Corporation]] which is heavily involved in oilfield business in Alaska.&lt;ref name="backes-followmoney"/&gt;

According to Chenault, one of the lawmakers named in the article: "Somebody walked up [in the bar] and said, 'You corrupt bastards,' and that name stuck." Hats with the label "CBC," standing for "Corrupt Bastards Club" or "Corrupt Bastards Caucus," were later printed up, but according to Chenault "that was the extent of the CBC deal."&lt;ref name="volz-barroom"/&gt;

In the first week of August 2006, an ill Representative Carl Moses returned to Juneau from receiving treatment in Anchorage, to cast a critical vote that insured passage of a bill giving tax breaks to the oil industry. The vote took place, shortly after Moses received campaign contributions from [[Bill Allen (corporate CEO)|Bill Allen]] and five other VECO executives, the only Democrat to receive any from that source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://juneauempire.com/stories/091206/sta_20060912006.shtml#.WSz_oGjyvSE Moses given cash before casting vote], ''[[Juneau Empire]]'', Matt Volz (AP), September 12, 2006. Retrieved 30 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI had set up in a Baranof hotel suite just three blocks away from the capitol building in Juneau. There they videotaped [[VECO]]'s CEO [[Bill Allen (corporate CEO)|Bill Allen]], peeling off bills for legislators to stuff in their pockets. According to the Juneau Empire, [[Ray Metcalfe]] said he had spoken with FBI agents about the case, but didn't know how the feds first got interested in Alaska."I think the jury is still out on what started this," said Metcalfe. Juneau Mayor [[Bruce Botelho]], the longest serving attorney general in the state's history over two administrations, said it looked like those state agencies responsible for ensuring ethical government failed to do their jobs, but it is too soon to tell for sure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://juneauempire.com/stories/070107/loc_probe001.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management of corruption investigation===
It later emerged that the investigation of [[political corruption]] in [[Alaska]] was being managed not by the Alaska U.S. Attorney's office, but rather by the [[Public Integrity Section]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], with FBI agents working out of the [[FBI]] building in downtown Anchorage acting as lead investigators. The FBI raids on legislative offices on August 31 and September 1 involved dozens of extra FBI agents brought up from the [[Lower 48]], but sent home after the initial round of searches and interviews. Other agencies, including the [[Internal Revenue Service]], were also involved.&lt;ref name="mauer-probeledby"&gt;Mauer, Richard. (September 11, 2006).

===Investigation widens===

====Fisheries====
The FBI conducted a second search on the legislative office of Republican State Senator [[Ben Stevens]] on September 18, 2006, seizing among other items documents related to the proposed natural gas pipeline and the oil and gas tax law which had been discussed in the [[Alaska Legislature]] during the regular and two special legislative sessions in 2006, as well as items related to his work on the Senate Ethics Committee and documents related to fisheries. Stevens disclosed to the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that the FBI seized items during both searches of his office related to the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board (AFMB), created under legislation by Ben Steven's father, U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]], to distribute federal grants to promote Alaska seafood.&lt;ref name="mauer-demer-stevensB"&gt;Mauer, Richard and Lisa Demer.

====Private corrections====
In October 2006, Rep. Vic Kohring's attorney, [[Wayne Anthony Ross]], provided the ''Anchorage Daily News'' with a copy of the search warrant that had been served on Kohring on August 31, as well as a list of items seized. The warrant showed that federal investigators were also interested in information related to developer Marc Marlow and correspondence between Kohring and the [[Alaska Department of Corrections]]. Ross told the ''Anchorage Daily News'' that his client had been questioned by the FBI about Cornell Companies' (now owned by [[GEO Group]]) effort in cooperation with VECO Corporation to build a [[private prison]] in [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], an effort which failed due to gubernatorial and bipartisan legislative opposition. The ''Daily News'' observed, "Those documents, though lacking detail or context, suggest that the probe is wide-ranging and not focused on any one company, issue or individual."&lt;ref name="demer-morethanveco"&gt;Demer, Lisa.

===Tom Anderson arrested on federal bribery and extortion charges===
{{Main article|Tom Anderson (politician)}}
The observation by the ''Anchorage Daily News'' and other news organizations that the probe had a wider focus than legislators' ties to VECO Corporation was confirmed on December 7, 2006, when Representative [[Tom Anderson (politician)|Tom Anderson]] - whose offices had not been targeted by the August and September FBI raids — was arrested on allegations of [[extortion]], [[bribery]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and [[money laundering]] involving his support of a private corrections company. Anderson was accused of accepting money from a private corrections company through a shell corporation set up by a lobbyist, identified in Anderson's charging documents as "Lobbyist A" and later identified as prominent Anchorage lobbyist Bill Bobrick, to disguise the source of payments. Unbeknownst to Anderson or Bobrick, their contact with the private corrections company was a confidential source of the FBI working undercover. According to federal prosecutors, the private corrections company — unidentified in the court documents but widely believed to be Cornell Companies — was not implicated in the plot, and had been unaware of the FBI investigation until Anderson's indictment and arrest. The confidential informant in the case was [[Frank Prewitt]], a former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections who later took jobs first with [[halfway house]] entrepreneur Bill Weimar, and subsequently with Cornell Companies, which bought out Weimar to establish its Alaska operations.&lt;ref name="mauer-demer-kizzia-andersonindicted"&gt;Mauer, Richard, Lisa Demer, and Tom Kizzia.

===Indictment, arrest of Kott, Kohring and Weyhrauch===
On May 4, 2007, former Representatives [[Pete Kott]] (R-Eagle River) and [[Bruce Weyhrauch]] (R-Juneau) were arrested and charged with bribery, extortion wire and mail fraud. Then-Representative [[Vic Kohring]] (R-Wasilla) later turned himself in and was similarly charged. All three were arraigned in Juneau. Charges against the three involved allegations of soliciting and receiving money and favors from VECO chief executive officer Bill Allen and chief lobbyist and V.P. Rick Smith in return for their votes on an oil tax law favored by the VECO that was the subject of vigorous debate during the 2006 legislative session and two special sessions in 2006.&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;Burke, Jill.

Of the original seven lawmakers who had their legislative offices searched, only State Senator Don Olson (D-Nome) was not implicated in the scandal.

===VECO executives indicted, plead guilty===
[[File:CH2anchorage.JPG|thumb|right|In the wake of the scandal VECO was broken up and most of its assets, including its former Alaska headquarters in Anchorage, were purchased by [[CH2M HILL]].]]
On May 7, 2007, VECO CEO [[Bill Allen (corporate CEO)|Bill Allen]] and Vice President for Community &amp; Government Affairs Rick Smith pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Anchorage to charges of extortion, bribery, and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service.

In addition to the three politicians arraigned on May 4, the new court filings mention illegal payments made to a former state senator, named as "Senator B" in court documents, who received over $240,000 from VECO Corp. over several years, income which Senator B reported as "consulting fees." In the May 7 guilty pleas by Allen and Smith, they admit that the only work done by Senator B in exchange for the funds was advancing VECO's agenda in the state legislature. The only former state senator who matches the information contained in court documents about Senator B is former Senator [[Ben Stevens]] (R-Anchorage), son of U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]] (R-Alaska). Ben Stevens was not indicted.&lt;ref name="demertoomey"&gt;Demer, Lisa and Toomey, Sheila. (May 7, 2007).

Allen's daughter Tammy Kerrigan replaced him as chairman of the board; a new CEO had not yet been chosen. At the same meeting, Rick Smith resigned from his position as vice president of community and government affairs.

===Lobbyist Bill Bobrick charged, pleads guilty in Tom Anderson bribery probe===
On May 14, 2007, William (Bill) Bobrick, a prominent municipal lobbyist in Anchorage, was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, bribery, and money laundering in the same scheme for which Rep.

Bobrick was the creator of the shell corporation, Pacific Publishing, through which money was allegedly funneled to Anderson.

===US Senator Ted Stevens investigated, charged, convicted and verdict vacated===
[[File:Ted Stevens mug shot.jpg|thumb|right|Mug shot of Ted Stevens, taken by the [[United States Marshals Service]] in July 2008]]
[[Ted Stevens]] was also investigated by both the FBI and IRS. Authorities investigated an extensive remodeling project done at the Stevens "chalet" in the small town of [[Girdwood, Alaska]]. Unusual aspects of this remodeling project that were investigated were that the project was supervised by VECO, and invoices for the work on the residence were first sent to VECO before being sent to the senator. Some of the issues investigated were the extent of work done on the home, exactly whom had paid the invoices from the construction contractors and their subcontractors, and the purpose and extent of VECO's involvement.

On the morning of July 30, 2007, agents from the FBI and the IRS raided the residence in Girdwood. Photographs and video of the inside and outside of the residence were taken. Wine bottles in the home were photographed as objects of interest. The raid continued well into the evening. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/9179115p-9095789c.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817064920/http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/9179115p-9095789c.html |archive-date=August 17, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2008, just a day short of the anniversary of the Girdwood raids, Stevens was charged with seven counts of false statements on financial disclosures involving VECO, the oil services company in Alaska, and the renovations done on his home.

On October 27, 2008, U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]] was successfully prosecuted in the District of Columbia. He was found guilty by a jury of all seven felonies against him.  The case had been prosecuted by Principal Deputy Chief Brenda K. Morris, Trial Attorneys Nicholas A. Marsh and Edward P. Sullivan of the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division's]] Public Integrity Section, headed by Chief William M. Welch II, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph W. Bottini and James A. Goeke from the District of Alaska. Eight days after the verdict, Stevens narrowly lost re-election to Anchorage's Democratic then-Mayor [[Mark Begich]]. [http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/18/alaska.senate.race/?iref=mpstoryview] He had held his seat since December 24, 1968.

On February 13, 2009, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan cited William M. Welch II, Brenda K. Morris, Patty Merkamp Stemler (Chief of the Justice Department Criminal Appeals Section), and another Justice Department attorney for contempt of court.  Judge Sullivan amended the contempt citation on February 14, 2009 to remove the fourth attorney.  The contempt citation was for failing to turn over to defense counsel for former Senator Stevens documents relating to a complaint by Chad Joy, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, alleging misconduct by prosecutors in the Stevens case. Judge Sullivan had ordered, on February 3, 2009, that the documents in question be given to defense counsel. In the contempt citation, Judge Sullivan described the conduct of the Justice Department's lawyers as "outrageous."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/article/20090213/stevens-prosecutors-comply-order Stevens prosecutors comply with order; Prosecution attorneys are held in contempt of court], ''[[Alaska Dispatch News|Anchorage Daily News]]'', Erika Bolstad, February 13, 2009.

On February 16, 2009, the Justice Department stated in a court filing that it had removed six attorneys from "litigation relating to allegations of misconduct in (the case against former Senator Stevens)." The six attorneys were William M. Welch II, Brenda K. Morris, Nicholas A. Marsh, Edward P. Sullivan, Joseph W. Bottini, and  James A. Goeke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/article/20090217/prosecutors-ted-stevens-trial-replaced Stevens' prosecutors replaced], ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'', Richard Mauer, February 17, 2009, Retrieved 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2009 Attorney General Eric Holder decided to drop all charges against Stevens after a review of the case turned up alleged evidence of [[prosecutorial misconduct]], including failure to fully disclose potentially [[exculpatory evidence]] in response to a [[Brady v. Maryland|''Brady'' motion]] by Stevens' attorneys. Since Stevens had not yet been sentenced, Holder's action effectively vacated Stevens' conviction. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/us/politics/02stevens.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutor Marsh, although he had been removed as the team leader of the Alaska probe's prosecution, well prior to the Stevens debacle, had become episodically depressed as a result of the extreme length of the investigation into the conduct of the team involved in the Senator's case. This was exacerbated by his consequent reassignment to less favorable international duties, pending resolution of the inquiry, though he had anticipated complete exoneration. On September 26, 2010, not long after he returned from a trip to Europe, he hung himself in the basement of his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/03/casualties-of-justice Annals of Law: Casualties of Justice], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Jeffrey Toobin, January 3, 2011. Retrieved 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens meanwhile, 17 months after leaving office, died in a corporate executive airplane crash on August 9, 2010. He had been en route to a remote hunting lodge in western Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktuu.com/Global/story.asp?S=12952729 |title=Stevens killed in crash near Dillingham - KTUU.com |publisher=KTUU.com |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003444/http://www.ktuu.com/Global/story.asp?S=12952729 |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US drops Jim Clark corruption conviction===
In 2008, Clark admitted that he was aware that Veco Corp had paid $10,000 for a political poll to gauge the popularity of then-incumbent Governor Murkowski, and was charged with "[[honest services fraud]]". Before he was sentenced, the US Supreme Court ruled that the statute was drafted with unconstitutional vagueness and henceforth will only cover "fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who ha[s] not been deceived." Since Clark was guilty of neither bribes nor kickbacks, all charges were voided.

===Bill Weimar pleads guilty to making illegal campaign contributions===
On August 11, 2008, the ''Anchorage Daily News'' reported that Bill Weimar, a former operator of halfway houses for inmates in Alaska was indicted and charged with two felony counts alleging campaign finance violations. Weimar funneled money to an unnamed consultant for an unnamed state legislative candidate in 2004. Weimar agreed to plead guilty to the charges, and in exchange prosecutors will ask for a reduced sentence, a nonbinding agreement that the judge is free to modify. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/490296.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813130914/http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/490296.html |archive-date=August 13, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weimar subsequently pleaded guilty in federal court in Anchorage.

Ward allegedly convinced a witness in the trial against Senator Ted Stevens to lie about an immunity deal in court to ensure that he was included in it and would therefore not be prosecuted. According to federal prosecutors, Ward had been under investigation for some time over his relationship with Bill Weimar, who was convicted of two felony counts in the matter and sentenced to prison. While he was presumed to be under continued investigation, Ward was not charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/624288.html |title=Story |access-date=December 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217064501/http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/624288.html |archive-date=December 17, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his plea agreement, Cowdery did not have to testify against other defendants in the case. No sentencing parameters were agreed upon as a result of this agreement. Cowdery subsequently pleaded guilty in federal court on December 19, 2008. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskapublic.org/2008/12/19/alaska-senator-john-cowdery-pleads-guilty-to-conspiracy/ John Cowdery pleads guilty to conspiracy], ''[[Alaska Public Radio]]'', December 19, 2008.

===Beverly Masek pleads guilty===
On March 13, 2009, the ''Anchorage Daily News'' reported that former Alaska state representative [[Beverly Masek]] had pleaded guilty to soliciting and accepting at least $4,000 in bribes from [[VECO Corp]]. Masek, who originally rose to fame by competing in the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] while still known by her maiden name of Beverly Jerue, was first elected to the House in 1994. Masek represented a district consisting of the northern and western reaches of the [[Matanuska-Susitna Borough]] in the House from 1995 to 2005 before being defeated by [[Mark Neuman]] in the 2004 primary election.

The '''American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association''' (commonly referred to as ARCSA) is an American non-profit association founded by Dr. Hari Krishna in 1994,&lt;ref name=envex /&gt; focused on [[rainwater]] awareness and to promote sustainable [[rainwater harvesting]] (RWH) practices in the [[United States]] and around the world.

ARCSA's efforts include: creating a favorable regulatory atmosphere, creating a resource pool and educating professionals and the general public regarding safe rainwater harvesting design, installation and maintenance practices. It has more than 1,500 members consisting of both manufacturers as well as dealers/distributors of equipment.

In 2014, ARCSA created a [[White House]] petition to stimulate the rainwater-harvesting industry.&lt;ref name=petition /&gt; While the petition didn't receive the 100,000 votes in 3 months needed to move to the next stage, ARCSA used this as a platform to begin a petition with [[Change.org]] to create an International Rainwater Harvesting Day.

In 2015, ARCSA merged with the Canadian Association of Rainwater Management (CANARM) and will continue as a North American association.

'''Animal Welfare Party''' ('''AWP''') is a minor [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]] campaigning on an animal welfare, environment and health platform.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Animal Welfare Party website: [http://www.animalwelfareparty.org/vision/ Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was founded in December 2006 by Jasmijn de Boo, a Dutch national, of Kennington, London, and Shaun Rutherford of Milford Haven, Wales, as Animals Count!.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6204262.stm "Activists welcome animal rights party"], ''BBC News'', 3 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The party was registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 22 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Electoral Commission: [http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP616l Animal Welfare Party registration] (Reference PP616l)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vanessa Hudson lg -5498 Image Courtesy Jamie Smith.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Vanessa Hudson (2010)]]In October 2010, the party elected a new leader, Vanessa Hudson, whose aims are to increase awareness of the party and to expand its membership. In 2013, the party changed its name from Animals Count! to the Animal Welfare Party.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Welfare Party website: [http://www.animalwelfareparty.org/about/ About]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Hudson joined leaders from other animal protection parties from across Europe in a meeting in [[The Hague]] organised by the Animal Politics Foundation of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Partij voor de Dieren, [http://www.partyfortheanimals.nl/index.php/2013/06/10/worldlog-week-24-2013/ Worldlog week 24 – 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034937/http://www.partyfortheanimals.nl/index.php/2013/06/10/worldlog-week-24-2013/ |date=April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting the animal protection parties of the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Turkey and the UK discussed ways in which they could work together more effectively. Later that month, Hudson announced that the Animal Welfare Party would stand in the London region in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament elections]].

The party says it was one of seven European animal protection parties contesting the 2014 European Parliament elections with the aim of returning dedicated representatives for animals to the EU Parliament for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Welfare Party website: [http://www.animalwelfareparty.org/previous-elections/2014-eu-elections/ 2014 EU Elections]&lt;/ref&gt; This European group of parties has become known informally as the EuroAnimal7 and includes PvdD of The Netherlands, PACMA of Spain, [[People-Animals-Nature|PAN]] of Portugal, Partei Mensch Umwelt Tierschutz of Germany, Djurens Parti of Sweden and Animal Party Cyprus.

In September 2017, the party gained its first elected representative after [[Alsager]] Town Councillor Jane Smith defected from the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] to the AWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/animal-welfare-party-first-uk-political-representation-jane-smith_uk_59ad2ef1e4b0dfaafcf17abf|title=Animal Welfare Party Gains First UK Political Representation After Jane Smith Defects From Green Party|publisher=''HuffingtonPost.com''|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
AWP's policies for Europe include:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Re-directing EU subsidies (currently averaging 50 billion euros per year) away from livestock and fisheries farming and into plant-based agriculture 
*Promoting healthy, plant-based lifestyle initiatives through public health and education campaigns
*Opposing the production and import of genetically manipulated crops anywhere in Europe 
*Labelling all products clearly with information which allows consumers to make informed choices in line with their own principles on the environment, health, animal welfare and the social circumstances in which a product is produced
*Phasing out farming practices and systems with poor welfare consequences for animals 
*Ending live animal export 
*Reducing journey times for animals travelling to slaughter and further 'fattening' 
*Phasing out animal experimentation with binding targets for reduction combined with funding and real support for alternatives 
*Ending cultural traditions that involve cruelty to animals, such as bullfighting and foie gras production
*A ban on the production and sale of fur within Europe 
*Ending EU subsidy of rearing bulls for bullfighting (currently estimated to be 129.6 million euros per year) 
*Halting EU funding of Romania's 'Rabies Eradication Programme' until the stray animal 'Catch and Kill' policy is replaced by 'Spay and Neuter' 
*Ensuring proper enforcement of existing animal welfare legislation across all EU member states

The party sponsored an electoral list of eight candidates for the 2014 European Parliament election in the London region, receiving 21,092 votes (0.96%). None were elected. Four AWP candidates contested the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. None were elected. They stood in the [[London Assembly election, 2016|2016 London Assembly elections]], receiving 1% of the vote and not having any candidates elected.

[[File:Franc Kavčič - Dekle reši Aristomena iz ujetništva.jpg|thumbnail|''A girl saves Aristomenes'' by [[Franc Kavčič]]]]
'''Aristomenes''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀριστομένης}}) was a king of [[Messenia]], celebrated for his struggle with the [[Sparta]]ns in the [[Second Messenian War]] (685–668 BC), and his resistance to them on [[Mount Eira]] for 11 years. At length the mountain fell to the enemy, while he escaped and, according to legend, was snatched up by the gods; in fact he died at [[Rhodes]].

==Life==
Aristomenes was a member of the [[Aepytus|Aepytid]] family, the son of Nicomedes (or, according to another version, of Pyrrhus) and Nicoteleia, and took a prominent part in stirring up the revolt against Sparta and securing the co-operation of [[Argos]] and [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]. He showed such heroism in the first encounter, at [[Derae]], that the crown was offered to him, but he would accept only the title of commander-in-chief. His daring is illustrated by the story that he came by night to the temple of [[Athene]] "of the Brazen House" at Sparta, and there set up his shield with the inscription "Dedicated to the goddess by Aristomenes from the Spartans."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aristomenes|volume=2|page=498|first=Marcus Niebuhr|last=Tod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His prowess contributed largely to the Messenian victory over the Spartan and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] forces at "The Boar's Barrow" in the plain of [[Stenyclarus]], but in the following year the treachery of the Arcadian king [[Aristocrates]] caused the Messenians to suffer a crushing defeat at "The Great Trench." Aristomenes and the survivors retired to the mountain stronghold of Eira, where they defied the Spartans for eleven years. On one of his raids he and fifty of his companions were captured and thrown into the [[Caeadas]], the chasm on Mount Taygetus into which criminals were cast. Aristomenes alone was saved, and soon reappeared at Eira: legend told how he was upheld in his fall by an eagle and escaped by grasping the tail of a fox, which led him to the hole by which it had entered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

On another occasion he was captured during a truce by some [[History of Crete|Cretan]] auxiliaries of the Spartans, and was released only by the devotion of a Messenian girl who afterwards became his daughter-in-law. At length Eira was betrayed to the Spartans (668&amp;nbsp;BC according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), and after a heroic resistance Aristomenes and his followers had to evacuate Messenia and seek a temporary refuge with their Arcadian allies. A desperate plan to seize Sparta itself was foiled by Aristocrates, who paid with his life for his treachery. Aristomenes retired to [[Ialysus]] on [[Rhodes]], where [[Damagetus]], his son-in-law, was king, and died there while planning a journey to [[Sardis]] and [[Ecbatana]] to seek aid from the [[Lydia]]n and [[Medes|Median]] sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias iv. 14-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Other narratives==
Another tradition represents him as captured and slain by the Spartans during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Nat. Hist.'' xi. 187; Val. Maximus i. 8, 15; Steph. Byzant. s.v. Ἀνδανία&lt;/ref&gt; Though there seems to be no conclusive reason for doubting the existence of Aristomenes, his history, as related by Pausanias, following mainly the Messeniaca of the Cretan epic poet [[Rhianus]] (about 230&amp;nbsp;BC), is evidently largely interwoven with fictions. These probably arose after the foundation of Messene in 369&amp;nbsp;BC. Aristomenes's statue was set up in the stadium there: his bones were fetched from Rhodes and placed in a tomb surmounted by a column,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanius iv. 32. 3, 6&lt;/ref&gt; and more than five centuries later heroic honours were still paid to him, and his exploits were a popular subject of song.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanius iv. 14. 7; 16. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

According to explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]], one story about Aristomenes, in which he had been thrown into a pit and had to escape{{mdash}}being set free by [[Archidameia]]{{mdash}}is the principal inspiration for one of the voyages of [[Sinbad the Sailor]] in the [[Arabian Nights]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The '''Assembly of Confessing Congregations''' (ACC) is an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] or conservative Christian group, an expression of the [[Confessing Movement]], within the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] (UCA) that formed after the 11th Assembly, on 13–14 October 2006 following a joint summit on 12 July 2006 between the Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU) and the Reforming Alliance within the Uniting Church in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.confessingcongregations.com/assembly/about/history/|title=History of Assembly of Confessing Congregations within the Uniting Church in Australia|last=Assembly of Confessing Congregations|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also includes a number of UCA congregations drawing their membership from various [[Pacific Islands]] nations, as well as Chinese, Korean and Aboriginal congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

=== Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU) ===
EMU (previously known as ''Evangelical Ministers of the UCA'') was strongest in [[South Australia]] where [[Methodism]] was the strongest strand coming into the UCA. EMU had gained prominence as a result of their opposition to gay ordination in the lead up to the 1997 Assembly, however while gay ordination was the catalyst in forming this group, EMU focused on the issue of [[Biblical authority]].

The purpose of EMU was stated to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confessingcongregations.com/emusite/All%20about%20Emu.htm |title=EMU the REALITY |accessdate=2017-09-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106004712/http://www.confessingcongregations.com/emusite/All%20about%20Emu.htm |archivedate=6 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Preserve the unity of the Uniting Church,
*Provide a fellowship of support and encouragement for evangelical believers, enabling them to continue within the life of the UCA.
*Provide a fellowship which works for justice and respect for evangelical believers, encouraging them to make a distinctive, vital and faithful contribution to the church, and
*Encourage and nurture that evangelical faith upon which the Uniting Church is founded.

=== The Reforming Alliance within the Uniting Church (RA) ===
The RA within the Uniting Church was established in 2003 in response to the 10th Assembly's decision not to ban outright the [[ordination]] of practicing [[homosexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nat.uca.org.au/ASC/commqa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050621171804/http://nat.uca.org.au/ASC/commqa.htm |archivedate=21 June 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Assembly of Confessing Congregations within the Uniting Church in Australia (ACC) ===
The Assembly of Confessing Congregations within the Uniting Church in Australia (ACC) formed in response to the 11th's Assembly decision to pass a resolution which they believed brought the church closer to accepting ordained ministers in same gender relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 108&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated on the 13–14 October 2006 at [[Wesley Mission]], [[Sydney, New South Wales]] 71 congregations formed the ACC at that time. They promulgated a statement on sexuality in response to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.confessingcongregations.com/uploads/acc027_sexuality_a5_new_cov_lr.pdf|title=Assembly of Confessing Congregations Statement on Sexuality|last=Assembly of Confessing Congregations|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They declared that the Uniting Church had been "[[apostate]]" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.confessingcongregations.com/uploads/acc027_charter_a5_new_cov_lr.pdf|title=The Charter for the Assembly of Confessing Congregations|last=Assembly of Confessing Congregations|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their decision making in regards to sexuality and leadership within the Uniting Church, with some Uniting Church members felt that the ACC was a church within a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Burmese Resistance Movement of 1885–1895''' occurred almost immediately after the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|fall of Mandalay]]. Due to the rapidity of British advancement up the [[Irrawaddy River]], the bulk of the [[Royal Burmese Armed Forces|Burmese army]] suffered few casualties. Many had not experienced actual fighting. Nevertheless, the issue of the [[Hluttaw]]’s order to surrender on 27 November 1885 meant that Burmese garrisons south of [[Mandalay]] had to disarm without putting up a fight. Soon widespread resistance started to break out in [[Upper Burma]], [[Lower Burma]], the [[Shan Hills]], [[Kachin Hills]] and [[Chin Hills]] which did not die out until 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myint|first=Ni Ni|title=Burma's Struggle Against British Imperialism|year=1983|publisher=The Universities Press Rangoon|location=Burma|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maung|first=Htin Aung|title=The Stricken Peacock|year=1965|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|location=The Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance in Upper Burma ==
[[File:Execution of Burmese rebel.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A Burmese rebel being executed at Shwebo, Upper Burma, by [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]].]]

=== Myinzaing Prince ===
Fighting first broke out in Upper Burma when between 18 and 25 December 1885, 200 [[Shan people|Shans]] under the leadership of the [[Myinzaing]] Prince’s lieutenants Bo Manga, Myedu Myosa and Mg Lat positioned themselves along the course of the [[Myitnge River]] between [[Patheingyi Township|Shwesayan]] and Maungtaw villages. On the night of 31 December 1885, the men attacked [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports of Disturbances in the City and Suburbs of Mandalay|year=1886|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=File 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Myinzaing and his followers then attacked a group of British at Paleit and Htonbo in early January 1886. Following British suppression in 1886, Myinzaing was forced to move southwards, reestablishing himself at Yakhainggyi, 23 miles southeast of [[Kyaukse]]. He continued to harass the British around Kyaukse and Mandalay. The police station southeast of Mandalay was attacked on 18 April and on 30 April a great fire was started in Mandalay which killed Lt. Forbes and injured seven sepoys. Yakhainggyi continued to be the main base of operations for Myinzaing until May 1886, while the rest of his army remained at Kywetnapha and Hngetkyithaik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1886|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|title=File NP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myinzaing hatched a plan to capture Mandalay by launching a full-scale attack on the city in May 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wetmasut Wundak neizin hmattan|year=1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  300 swordsmen and 100 musketeers would attack the police station and destroy the telegraph wires. Anaukwindawhmu U Paung would lead 200 swordsmen and 1500 Shan and Burmese musketeers to attack the city directly and slaughter Burmese ministers and officials who had capitulated under the British. Maung Gyi, Myinzaing’s maternal uncle, will take on [[Mandalay Hill]] and the northern suburbs with 100 swordsmen and 700 Shan and Burmese musketeers. Mongnai [[Sawbwa]] would invade the eastern suburbs and capture Yankin Hill with 300 swordsmen and 1000 Shan and [[Bamar people|Burmese]] musketeers. Lawksawk Sawbwa would invade [[Amarapura]] with 250 swordsmen and 700 Shan and Burmese musketeers. Myaukdawebo Maung Gale would then administer the oath of allegiance to all Sawbwas and [[Myosas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=File No. NP 1887|year=1887|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Myinzaing’s plan could not be carried out as the British were able to uncover the activities of Myinzaing’s lieutenants, putting a stop to the plan. Four other monks namely [[U Dipa]], U Ottama, [[U Nandiya]] and [[U Rewata]] were also arrested and detained at [[Akyab]] and [[Rangoon]]. In the end, Myinzaing was forced to retreat into the Myelat State of Ywangan. He contracted fever there in August 1886 and died soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Duffferin Papers|year=1886|publisher=MIC 22/Reel48|location=Burma|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaunggwa Prince ===
Meanwhile, as troops of the Myinzaing Prince wreaked havoc in Mandalay, the [[Chaunggwa]] Princes along with the support of a local leader, Bo Shwe Yan, stationed themselves in Kabo with 300 to 500 men recruited from the villages of Chaunggwa, Kabo, Thetpan, Ngazinyaing, Lawagai, Oktwingan, Gyogya-U, Ingan, Zigyaung and Kokkogan. Earlier in April, Bo Shwe Yan attacked Shwedaung along with Bo Muang Gale and Bo Nga Nyein. In May, there was an attempt by the Chaunggwa Princes to combine forces with Myinzaing Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The report of the Deputy Commissioner of Ava to the Secretary to the CHief Commissioner of Burma|date=1 April 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their forces arrived at Gye village, 12 miles southwest of Kyaukse with 600 men to meet up with Myinzaing’s army at Natteik pass. This united front however did not materialize because of British retaliation. Bo Shwe Yan finally escaped into the jungles near Panlaung while the princes retreated back into Mandalay by 1887.

A plot was hatched in 1887 in Mandalay to put Saw Yan Naing on the throne. Nevertheless, the plan was foiled once again by the British who arrested the ringleaders while Saw Yan Naing was dispatched to Rangoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burma Proceedings, Proceeding No. 2|year=1887|publisher=Foreign Department|location=Upper Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then tried to moved to [[Hsenwi]] in the northern Shan States and then to the border region between [[Tawngpeng]] and [[Mongmit Township|Mongmit]] to establish a new base for further resistance, He were killed during fought with the British forces along the route.

=== Kanaung Prince ===
Also, during the same period in December 1885 two brother princes Hteiktin Hmat and Hteiktin Thein, sons of [[Mindon Min|Min]]don’s brother the [[Kanaung Mintha|Kanaung Prince]], attacked and captured [[Shwebo]] from Shwebo Myowun. On 23 December, after skirmishes with two companies of the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]], they gave up Shwebo but continue to harass the British forces. After a major battle at Kadu Kunitywa, the princes were defeated. Hteiktin Thein died later in January 1886 but his brother Hteiktin continued the resistance. He then established alliances with local resistance leaders Bo Hla U and [[Singu]] Myowun Bo Pyan Gyi. After continual harass and strong British retaliation, Hteiktin Hmat retreated to the north. He attacked and captured Taze with 3500 men recruited from [[Myedu]], [[Wuntho]] and Indauktha. However, the tough jungle life was unbearable to him and like Myinzaing Prince, he died of fever in August 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U B Home (Misc Dept)|date=October 1886|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shwegyobyu Prince ===
The [[Shwegyobyu]] Prince, whose claim to royalty was probably questionable, rose up and mobilized his forces of resistance at Kanle in the southern part of the [[Chindwin]] district in the treacherous hills of the Pondaung range. His influence included Pagyi and Pakhangyi area as well with prominent followers such as [[Myingyan]] (Tayokmyo) Myowun U Kyaw Gaung under him. By 1887, he had extended his resistance activities into the Yaw country and then the [[Chin Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burma Home Proceeding|date=July 1886|publisher=Crosthwaithe Pacification}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of the raids within the Pagyi region, Bo Sawba attacked and carried off the body of U Po O, a nephew of [[Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung|Kinwun Mingyi]], who had surrendered his allegiance to the British. U Tha Gyi, another local man of influence defected from the British and joined in the resistance.

=== Bayingan Prince ===
At the same time of the Shwegyobyu Prince attacks, the [[Bayingan]] (Viceroy) Prince also arose along with resistance movements that started in Mandalay and eventually moving north into [[Sagaing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Administration of Burma|year=1887–88|publisher=Gazetteer of Upper Burma|location=Upper Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1887 he moved into the Pagyi region, establishing contacts with Shwegyobyu Prince and in particular, [[U Tha Gyi]]. The combined forces of both princes became a serious threat to the British. On 8 October 1887, the British then sent a force of 21 mounted Military Police and a detachment of the 2nd Hyderabad Contingent Infantry to surprise and suppress U Tha Gyi and the Bayingan Prince. U Thai Gyi and the Bayingan Prince managed to escape to Chinbyit where a second British force attacked from Kyadet on 12 October. Eventually U Thai Gyi and Bayingan were killed but not without also taking the lives of Major Kennedy, commander of the British Force, and Captain Beville, assistant commander of [[Chindwin]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crosthwaite|publisher=Pacification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kyimyindaing Prince ===
In early 1886, the [[Kyimyindaing]] Prince started off his resistance movement in [[Ava, Burma|Ava]] district before establishing himself in the area around [[Mahlaing Township|Mahlaing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U B Home (Misc Dept)|date=October 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1886, his forces took on British troops marching from [[Pagan]] to [[Yamethin]] via Mahlaing and [[Meiktila]]. He then combined forces with leaders like Yamethin Lewun, Theingon Thugyi, Buddhayaza and Thihaya when he moved south. Their forces managed to disrupt the communications of the British in [[Pyinmana]]. However, the British moved swiftly against the Prince and his forces, attacking his camp on 12 November 1886. The Kyimyindaing Prince was forced to withdraw but not without killing a British officer, Lieutenant Eckersley of the Somersetshire Regiment. British counter-attacks forced the Prince to retreat to Ywangan state where he and his men fought their last battle stoically till the last man standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maung|first=Tha Aung|author2=Maung Mya Din|title=Pacification of Upper Burma: A Vernacular History|journal=Journal of Burma Research Society|year=XXXI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Setkya Prince ===
Initially starting his resistance movement from his base in [[Mandalay]] District, he moved to Maw, the Myelat state on the southeast border of [[Kyaukse]] at the end of 1887. This was followed by attacks from the British with the support of the Maw Ngwegunhmu. The [[Setkya]] prince was forced to withdraw east in 1888, establish a large following and making incursions into Kyauke district. He did some damage to the Military Police but was eventually captured by the Sawbwa of [[Lawksawk]] who handed him over to the British to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on Administration of Burma, 1888 -1889|date=4 October 1889|publisher=Gazetteer of Upper Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bo Swe ===
Although in his fifties by the time of annexation, [[Bo Swe]], the hereditary [[Thugyi]] of Mindat continued to fight against the British. He established his power in the region west of Minbu, between the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] and [[Arakan State|Arakan]] hills. By December 1885, Bo Swe and his forces attacked a police station on the west frontier and subsequently moving into Malun township in 1886. Over there, he encountered the forces of Captain Rolland and 25 men from the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]. After which, Bo Swe retreated into the Arakan Yomas.

He emerged once again in May 1886 to attack Kani with 150 men. The British then came in from Pyilongyaw on 17 May and Bo Swe was forced to withdraw again to Yaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=File No. 50 I|year=1886|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this time the retreat was for tactical purposes so that he could organize his men more effectively. The British, at that time, set a bounty of Rs. 1,000 for the head of Bo Swe, which increased to Rs. 5,000 towards the end of 1887. Nevertheless, Bo Swe was unfazed. When in June 1886, the British attacked Bo Swe’s position at Padein with a force of 50 Military Police; Bo Swe was able to repel the attacks with reinforcement. The British commander Phayre was shot and killed in the skirmish and Bo Swe managed to hold his position at Padein. To salvage the loss of their commander, the British then sent reinforcements from [[Bagan|Pagan]] led by Major Gordan with 95 rifles of the 2nd Bengal Infantry, 50 rifles of the Liverpool Regiment and 2 artillery pieces. On 19 July, Major Gordon’s forces clashed with BoSwe’s at a position near Ngape. Bo Swe eventually withdrew but not without inflicting losses of 8 killed and 26 wounded on the British side. Finding their strength rather deficient at [[Ngape]], the British withdrew in July 1886, allowing Bo Swe to once again regroup and reconsolidate his forces in the region.

After the Ngape incident, the British decoded to change tactics. They tried to win Bo Swe over to their side with the promise that he would be appointed Extra Assistant Commissioner 5th Grade at Ngape should he give himself up with his men and capture U Ottama. There was a further proviso that he would not be charged for the murder of Phayre. Nevertheless, Bo Swe refused. Incensed, the British increased their cavalry and mounted infantry forces at Ngape, systematically rooting out Bo Swe’s resistance base. Finally, Bo Swe made a last ditched effort at repelling the British forces in a ravine near Milangon in Thayetmyo district. He died a valiant death of fighting with only 10 of his men as compared to the more numerous mounted [[South Wales Borderers]] led by Major Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=File No. 466 UB|year=1886|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bo Ya Nyun ===
[[Bo Ya Nyun]] was the chief horseman of Welaung in Myingyan district. This district was well known for the high caliber of its cavalry. Due to his official position and his natural leadership ability, Bo Ya Nyun was able to gather a large following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tawthagyi: Bo Ya Nyun i zatiman|year=1934|publisher=Pyinnya Totetkyipwaye Press|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years 1887 and 1888, Bo Ya Ngun would carry out guerilla tactics on the British. Whenever the enemy forces were too great, he would retreat into the jungles around [[Mount Popa|Popa]]. By 1889 Bo Ya Ngun had reconsolidated enough strength to establish himself formally at [[Welaung]], launching attacks on the British from there. The British used the same tactics of offering amnesty in order to co-opt him but Bo Ya Nyun refused. However, some troops under him were taken in by the British offer. By 1890, Bo Ya Ngun’s resistance eventually crumbled and he surrendered to the British on 30 May 1890.

=== U Ottama ===
In 1886, upon receiving orders from the [[Myinzaing]] Prince, U Ottama together with U Thaung collected man and arms on both sides of the Man Creek to prepare for battle with the British. Several [[thugyis]], including 600 to 700 mean joined their resistance forces. On 17 February, their forces attacked and took over Sagu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=File No. 50 I|year=1886|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the British attacked back, pushing into Sagu and further into Pyilongyaw, rading U Ottama’s monastery. By this time both U Ottama and U Thaung had escaped to [[Pauk Township|Pauk]]. The British then requested for their surrender at [[Salin Township|Salin]] before 14 April. They refused and with 40–50 men from Pyilongyaw and 500–600 men under [[Bo Shwe Tha]] of Warabyin and [[Bo Lu Gyi]] of Kan, together with the thugyis of Ngakwe, Kawton and Thechaung villages, they conducted an active campaign in the Salin and Sale districts. Fighting broke out on 13 March with a British force under Captain Dunsford at Kyaukpon, after which U Ottama retreated back again towards Pauk. By then, U Ottama’s strength had increased considerably after he had managed to enter into a successful communication with the forces under [[Bo Swe]].

On 12 June 1886, the British started an attack near U Ottama’s position at Salin. U Ottama’s men killed Captain Dunsford and then besieging the British forces at Salin. The siege was broken by a relieving British force but only after the Burmese had killed its commander again, Captain Atkinson. Riding on his success, U Ottama reconsolidated his forces in the Minbu region. He then assumed the title of Mingyi and appointed five lieutenants – [[Bo Yaw Baw]], [[Bo Kan Thi]], [[U Ottara]], [[Bo Kin]] and [[Bo Byaing Gyi]] – to take over villages under his domain. Theirs was a successful stronghold with the British not being able to make any progress infiltrating without U Ottama knowing their movements well in advance. The British then resorted to means of persuading and even buying over U Ottama’s followers, at the same time imposing severe penalties for those villagers who aided or abetted the resistance leaders. Gradually, these tactics succeeded and 1,204 of U Ottama’s men surrendered to the British. U Ottama himself was finally captured by the British near Legaing in June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BHP (Police)|date=8 November 1889|publisher=Crosthwaite, Pacification|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance in Lower Burma ==
=== Mayanchaung Pongyi ===
[[File:Officers of Mogaung Expedition, 1886 Wellcome L0051201.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Officers of the 1886 Mogaung Expedition.]]
A [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Mayanchaung]] [[Pongyi]] was first appointed by [[King Thibaw]] to increase the intensity of revolt in Lower Burma before the outbreak of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BHP|date=February 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently roped in the help of Kyaukkalat, Pekkaleit and Shwehle Pongyis to stir up revolt in the region. After the fall of Mandalay, Mayanchaung Pongyis’ men made a simultaneous attack on [[Sittang]], Winbadaw and Karawe on 15 December 1885. The very next day, the group proceeded to cut the telegraph lines at Thayethamein while another, led by a pongyi, captured [[Bilin, Mon State|Bilin]]. Another force also attacked [[Kyaikhto]] while a force of 300–500 mean attack on Shwegyin, the district headquarters. The attack was repulsed by British reinforments from [[Toungoo]]. Nevertheless, another of wave attack began again at Kyaikkaw, breaching the Abya embankment and destroyed the lock gates at Myitkyo.

By then, [[Symes]] had already posted a reward of Rs. 5,000 for the capture of Mayanchaung Pongyi. The British also started to reinforcement their strength at Shwegyin with an officer and 45 men of the [[Royal Scot Fusiliers]] and an officer and 100 of the [[1st Bombay Grenadiers]], while at Sittang there were 3 officers and 73 men of the Royal Scot Fusiliers, 2 officers and 65 men of the 1st Bombay Grenadiers and an officer and 50 men of the [[5th Madras Infantry]]. There was also a [[Moulmein]] column with one officer and 175 men of the 9th Madras Infantry. Meanwhile, Mayanchaung Pongyi had established contact with [[U Po Min]] and [[U Min]], sons of the old [[Kyaukkyi Mingyi]], while appointing U Po Min Myowun and U Min thugyi of Kyaukki. Resistance then broke out in several places all at once in Kyaukkyi. Mayanchaung Pongyi by then had fled north to Yathaung, 30 miles northeast of Sittang, gathering a force as many as 300 to 800. From there, the main body moved on to Binban near Bilin while another detachment, estimated at 100 to 400, established themselves at Taungthalezeik, a betel depot 17 to 20 miles southeast of Shwegyin. On 11 January 1886, Major Robinson and 70 men advanced to meet with Mayanchaung Pongyi but were ambushed. Major Robinson was wounded badly while some of his men were killed. The British then increased their forces and Mayanchaung Pongyi was forced to retreat into the hills of [[Toungoo]]. Eventually, he was captured on 10 March 1886 and publicly hanged in front of Kyaikto police station.

== Resistance in the Shan Hills ==
=== The Limbin Confederacy ===
The [[Limbin Confederacy]], a union of Shan Sawbas and Myosas, had its origins before British annexation of Upper Burma when the Shan States refused to submit under the authority of [[King Thibaw]], plotting to replace him with another suzerain who would repeal the [[Thathameda tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upper Burma Proceedings (Foreign Department), Proceeding No. 3 Enclosure 2 (3)|date=14 October 1886|location=Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They selected a disenfranchised prince of the house of [[Alaungpaya]], also known as the [[Limbin prince]] to be their representative. However, the formation of the confederacy was still in its infancy when Mandalay had fallen to the British. Nevertheless, the immediate confrontation of the Limbin Confederacy was not with the British but with the chiefs against the recalcitrant Sawbas to [[Kengtung]]. The British managed to exploit this local feud to reinstate their control over the Shan hills. A few of the Shan Sawbas resisted while many defected to the British side. One by one, townships within the Shan states fell into British hands. Stubborn resistance fighters such as the Sawbas of [[Lawksawk]] and [[Mongnai]] put up a valiant fight, however they too crumbled under British guile and force. The break-up of the Limbin Confederacy eventually forced the Limbin Prince to submit. He was then taken to [[Calcutta]] where he stayed until 1912. He returned to [[Rangoon]] permanently in 1921, living in a house there free of charge and given a monthly grant of 16 pounds. He died in 1933.

== Resistance in the Kachin Hills ==
=== U Po Saw ===
Formerly the descendent of a family of local influence in the [[Mogaung]] area, [[U Po Saw]] launched an attack on the British garrison along with widespread [[Kachin people|Kachin]] support. He met with strong British resistance consisting of 50 rifles of the Cheshire Regiment, 101 rifles of the Kalati Ghilzai Regiment, 500 rifles of the [[Bhamo Military Police]], 25 Mounted Infantry and 2 mountain guns led by Captain Triscott whom had previously settled in on 14 January 1888. After a series of small-scale skirmishes, U Po Saw assembled over 400 men, mostly [[Shan people|Shans]] of Kamaing, Mogaung and Uyu Seywa on the night of 20 May 1888, occupying the town of Mogaung. In this engagement, they lost 49 men but had also inflicted a loss of 8 men killed and 15 wounded on the British side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burma Proceedings 1888, Proceeding No. 3|date=15 June 1888|publisher=Home Department Proceedings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With that loss of the British, they regrouped swiftly. In October 1888, a sanction was given to increase the size of the Moguang garrison with 200 men from [[Bhamo]] and two more mountain guns. At the same time, letters of ultimatum were sent to the Sama and Panga Duwas requiring them to make a formal submission and to surrender [[U Po Saw]] and his lieutenant, [[Bo Ti]]. The British then mounted a military offensive in three successive expeditions in the years 1888–89 with a column of 51 rifles of the Hampshire Regiment, 320 of the Mogaung Levy and two mountain guns under Captain O’Donnell. The British then occupied Kamaing on 11 January 1889, then Sama and finally Muklon. The resistance movement of U Po Saw was finally routed by 1889 with the [[Kachins]] offering stiff resistance throughout.

=== Wuntho Sawbas ===
The [[Wuntho]] [[sawbas]] consisted of a father and son team. The father, [[U Shwe Tha]], was made Sawba of Wuntho previously in 1866 until he relinquished his position in favor of his son in 1881, [[U Aung Myat]]. Both father and son were brought up in the Burmese court and had pledged their loyalties to the Konbaung monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maung|first=Myanma Alin Soe|title=Wuntho Sawbwagyi, Bama sheipyei tawhlanyei thamagyi|year=1956|publisher=Thamameikta Press|location=Rangoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the British occupied [[Mandalay]], U Aung Myat thus refused to surrender. A column of 400 men was hence sent in January 1887 to Tatlwin Pass captured both U Aung Myat and U Shwe Tha. After prolonged negotiation, U Aung Myat submitted but it was merely a façade. U Aung Myat’s men still resisted and by January 1891, skirmishes broke out formerly again. Havoc broke out in the towns of [[Kawlin]] and Kyaukpintha. By this time, U Shwe Tha had retreated to [[Mansi, Burma|Mansi]]. However, the overwhelming force of the British forced both father and son to find refuge in Tsanta in [[Yunnan]] province. With that, the Wuntho uprising was finally suppressed.

== Resistance in the Chin Hills ==
=== The Chin Tribes ===
The [[Tashons]] were a powerful and influential tribe among the [[Kuki people|Chins]]. Previously on 1 January 1887, the British had started to assert their control over Chin territory by deposing [[U Yit]] as [[Sawbwa]] of [[Kale]] and installing [[U Pa Gyi]] in his stead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chin Hills Gazetteer I}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They then ventured into Tashon country with the objective of negotiating a trade route to India through the [[China Hills]] as well as displaying their military dominance and prowess to [[U Tok San]], [[U Tha Dun]] and the [[Shwegyobyu Prince]], they launched an offensive against the British by raiding Indin on 4 May 1888. This was followed by incursions into the plain in which the towns [[Sihuang]] and [[Homalin]] were targeted. By this time, the [[Siyins]], another Chin tribe, had joined in the resistance, with them attacking [[Chitpauk]] on 17 October and [[Kantha]] on 22 September. Other tribes like the [[Soktes]] and [[Kamhaus]] also took the opportunity to attack the Kabaw valley, destroying [[Khamput]] in their wake.

Facing the growing threat from the chin tribes, a military expedition was launched into the Hills led by Brigadier-General [[Faunce]], who established his headquarters at Kanpale on 3 December 1888 and assembled a force of 1,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodman|title=The Making of Burma|year=1962|publisher=[[Cresset Press]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, attacks from the Tashons and Siyins continued unabated. The main British strategy however was to undermine China solidarity by driving a wedge into the Chins. They would only attack the Siyins and the Kamhaus, while the Tashons would be left alone. The very first objective was the occupation of [[Khuasak]], the main Siyin village. They then continued their advanceon Khausak with a force of 517 rifles and two mountain guns. Fierce fighting ensued whereby many villages of the Siyins and Kamhaus were destroyed. Having done that, the British then turned their attention to the Tashons.

With peaceful negotiations breaking down between the Tashons and British, the British decided to take on the offensive. Another military expedition was planned for 1889–90, which was divided into two columns. The Northern Column was led by a [[Colonel Skene]] who positioned his forces at Fort White with 1,622 men. The Southern Column, consisting of 1,869 mean under [[Brigadier-General Symons]], established themselves at Kan on 9 December 1889. These two columns would come to subdue the [[Tashons]], [[Siyins]], [[Hakha]] and [[Zokhuas]]. Fighting stretched all the way into 1891 when the Kamhaus finally submitted under superior British firepower. Sporadic outbreaks of resistance still occurred with the minority tribes with stubborn attacks by Siyin and other smaller tribes. The Siyins persisted to the last but was eventually subdued. [[Khup Pau]], the Siyin chief and his son [[Khai Kam]], finally surrendered on 16 May 1894. Still, the Chins were perceived to be the fiercest and strongest foe to the British advancement, having lasted for more than seven years.

== Aftermath ==
The resistance movement was not a unified one. It was the outcome of the sudden and humiliating fall of the [[Konbaung]] dynasty to the British. Many of the resistance were small-scale affairs - scattered, disorganized and without an eventual goal in sight except to struggle against a foreign enemy that was seen to be encroaching upon their land, religion and king. There were also many who have defected over to the side of the British. After almost ten years since 1885, the resistance movement was subdued.
This was due primarily to four factors: 1) Better tactics of co-optation from the British; 2) More experienced and battle-hardened commanders were sent to reinforce the occupying British; 3) Superior weapons and war machinery of the British; 4) purported ruthlessness and show-trials by the British. There was an exception however: there were still periodic resistances from the Kachins which lasted until 1914-15.

The '''Caux Palace Hotel''' is a former palace hotel located in [[Caux, Switzerland|Caux]], above [[Montreux]] in the [[Vaud]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]], in [[Switzerland]].

Built on the Caux Mount by the Swiss architect Eugène Jost, it was inaugurated on 7 July 1902. The building rests on a 400-meter long terrace and is decorated with an abundance of towers and turrets with coloured tiles, which make it a remarkable feature of the Montreux landscape, visible from the whole [[Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut District|Montreux Riviera region]]. It soon became an international venue first in the early 20th century as a luxury hotel, then from 1946 on as an international conference centre dedicated to the rebuilding of Europe under the leadership of the Swiss [[Initiatives of Change]] team. It is now also the seat of the [[Swiss Hotel Management School]] (SHMS) which uses the premises during the school semesters while Initiatives of Change keeps organising summer conferences there each year. The Caux-Palace Hotel is listed as a [[List of cultural property of national significance in Switzerland: Vaud|cultural property of national significance in Switzerland]].

==History==

===Caux before the palace hotel===
Until 1875, the area around Caux was only sparsely populated. The "Caux mountains" had always been used as a [[pasture]] for local farmers while the road to the Jaman pass was the shortest route towards the Sarine and Simmental valleys. In 1875 taking into account the rapid development of tourism on the lakeside where the first hotels had opened in 1837 in [[Montreux]] and in 1841 in [[Territet]], Emile Monnier decided to transform his chalet on the Caux Mountain into an inn with a view to welcome the ramblers who started to explore the mountainside. This development had first affected the village of [[Glion]], halfway between [[Montreux]] and Caux: a road to [[Glion]] was opened in 1850 and a cable-car service was opened between Territet and Glion in 1883.

About the same time local entrepreneurs became aware of the potential of Caux, almost 1000 meters above Glion. Philippe Faucherre, born in 1844 and his wife Louise Vauthier, both from hotel management background, were among them. In 1890 Faucherre bought a stone career in the area and built the Caux Grand Hotel in three years, all the needed material being brought to the construction site by [[mule]]s for lack of other means of transportation.

The railway from Glion to Caux and to the [[Rochers-de-Naye]] summit was built at the same time and inaugurated in 1892 after only 15 months of works, a technical tour-de-force realized under the famous railway engineer Laubi. The extension of this railway between Montreux and Glion would wait 27 more years. The road to Caux was also opened at the same time by public works contractor Pierre Botelli.

The immediate success of the Grand Hotel, which attracted many prominent people to Caux, led other entrepreneurs to conceive the Caux Palace Hotel.&lt;ref name = Mottu&gt;The informations in this section are drawn from Philippe Mottu’s historic book: Caux from Belle Epoque to Moral Rearmament, published by La Baconnière, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The  construction of the Caux palace hotel===
[[File:Caux Palace 1902.jpg|thumb|Newspaper announcing the inauguration of the Caux Place Hotel in 1902.|alt=Une reproduction de la une d'un journal professionnel suisse relatant l'ouverture du Caux-Palace en 1902.]]
Five years after the Grand Hotel opening, [[Ami Chessex]], who was the owner of the lakeside Territet Grand Hotel, decided to build a new hotel on a piece of land he owned at Caux, just under the Caux Grand Hotel – although the area was rather sloppy. Early in 1899 a joint venture company was founded by Chessex and Faucherre with a capital of 2.5 million Swiss Francs. At the start of 1900 this company issued 3 million worth of bonds (and issued 500,000 francs more in 1903).

The first round of works consisted of an additional floor on top of the Grand Hotel, which immediately increased its capacity by 80 beds. Then in 1900 the construction works of the Caux Palace started. The main requirement was to make it the most advanced, most luxurious and biggest hotel ever built in Switzerland. As imagined by chief architect [[Eugène Jost]], the construction started by a 400-meter long supporting wall along the hotel’s site, allowing for the creation of a nice garden at the foot of the future hotel and for a promenade along this belvedere from which future Caux Palace Hotel customers would enjoy a unique sight on the grand landscape of [[Lake Geneva]] and of the [[Alps]].

Alfred Daulte, one of Jost’s deputies, was to lead the works on site. It was difficult job given that there were up to 800 workers on site and that the progress of the construction was under close personal scrutiny from Ami Chessex, who used to walk up from Territet twice a week and did not hesitate to issue orders contradicting Daulte’s. Nevertheless, the building and decoration works were completed in a little over two years, and on 7 July 1902, the Caux Palace Hotel was officially inaugurated in presence of the president of the Canton’s executive, Mr Cossy, and of the whole [[Vaud]] government. The books of the ''Société immobilière de Caux'' showed a total cost of construction of 2,555,949 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The Belle Epoque===
Like its predecessor, the Caux Grand Hotel, the Caux Palace Hotel was blessed with instant success. Visitors included celebrities such as [[Sacha Guitry]], [[Paul Morand]], [[Romain Rolland]], [[Edgar Wallace]], prince [[Ibn Saud]], future king of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[John D. Rockefeller]] and the [[maharajah of Baroda]]. The latter stayed frequently in Caux, using most of the fourth floor. His personal room at the south-west angle of the building enjoyed an outstanding view and was furbished in lemon-tree wood furniture, especially designed for the maharajah. This exceptional furniture and the initial decoration of this room have been preserved to this day.

Two to three weeks of waiting time were sometimes necessary before the privilege of staying at the Caux Palace Hotel could be granted to the customers. Several smaller hotels were therefore built in Caux in the wake of the opening of the Caux Palace Hotel, such as the “Pavillon des Fougères” (later “Hotel Alpina”) or the “Hotel Maria”. A school was opened in Caux in 1905, an Anglican chapel was built in 1906 and a Catholic one in 1907. Many private chalets were also built around the same years. Winter sport facilities included ski and sledge slopes, three ice rinks for skating and a bobsleigh track. The world [[bobsleigh]] federation and the world [[ice hockey]] federation were be created in Caux.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The dark years===
1 August 1914 spelt the end of the golden years of luxury tourism in Switzerland. In a matter of a few days most of the customers had left the hotels, which would remain empty for the next five years. On 10 August, the few remaining Grand Hotel customers were transferred to the Caux Place Hotel and the Grand Hotel was then closed down. In 1917, Ami Chessex passed away after having struggled for three years to keep the company afloat. The cumulated loss at the end of the war would be of 1 million.

In 1919, war had at last stopped and everything could have returned to normal, but exchange rates were high for the Swiss Francs and the Caux hotels did not completely correspond with the new expectations of the customers. Therefore, in spite of a financial restructuration of the company in 1919, business remained disappointing. In 1925, the Grand Hotel was renovated and renamed Hotel Regina, in memory of [[Empress Sissi]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] who had resided there in 1898 just before being assassinated in Geneva.

The years 1927 and 1928 brought at last sizeable improvement for the Caux hotels. A second financial restructuration took place in 1929 in order to raise 1 million francs to renovate the Caux Palace Hotel. The bobsleigh world cup was organised in Caux in 1930. Unfortunately, the years 1930 to 1935 were most difficult as a result of the worldwide financial crisis. The value of the individual share of the ''Société immobilière de Caux'' had sunk from around 200 francs in 1900 to 1 francs in 1936. A fourth financial restructuration was insufficient to mend the situation and the board put the hotels up for sale as the losses piled up.

In 1938 the railway was converted from steam to electricity and the ski fashion reignited interest for Caux. The Caux Palace Hotel was renamed Hotel Esplanade and now targeted a less exclusive audience. However, in 1939 it had to stop all activities for good.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===World War II===
After the Caux Palace Hotel, most other hotels also had to gradually close down. In 1941, Hotel Regina was declared bankrupt and sold twice in a row. The Caux Palace Hotel reopened in May 1944 as a detention centre for [[RAF|English]] and [[American Air Force]] pilots escaped from Italian prisoner's camps. Then from November 1944 to July 1945 they were replaced by Italian civilian refugees and from December 1944 by [[Jewish]] Hungarian refugees. This last group consisted of 1670 people coming from the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] where they had been briefly detained by the SS administration in spite of the payment of a handsome ransom for their freedom. This episode is known as the [[Kasztner train]] story, by the name of the main Jewish negotiator for this evacuation. Last minute negotiations on the background of an impending German defeat allowed the train to be finally redirected to Switzerland as initially planned and to save its passengers from an almost certain death. Orthodox Jews were put up at the Regina Hotel and all other in the former Caux Palace Hotel. An oak tree was planted on the Caux terrace in memory of this convoy and a plaque was inaugurated there in 1999. It reads: “In memory of the Jewish refugees accommodated here during WWII, and in memory of those who were driven back by the Swiss borders. We shall not forget them.”&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journaldesidonie.blogspot.com/ the diary of a Hungarian refugee from the Kasztner train], [http://www.musee-cauxexpo.ch/en/krise.php the historic exhibition in the Caux bookshop] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830203056/http://www.musee-cauxexpo.ch/en/krise.php# |date=2011-08-30 }} and the [http://www.caux.iofc.org/fr/refugies document on refugees on the CAUX-Initiatives of Change website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045549/http://www.caux.iofc.org/fr/refugies |date=2014-04-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These various visitors of Caux degraded the buildings a lot. Everything that could have a market value like door knobs, locks, taps, etc. was dismantled and sold. This completed the ruin of the creators of the Caux Palace Hotel. Apart from the ground and of the building’s shell, nothing was left of the 9 to 10 million Swiss Francs which had been invested there since 1890. It later turned out, however, that the caretaker of the Caux Palace Hotel, Robert Auberson, had been able to hide and store a lot of valuable pieces of furniture, as well as crockery and cutlery.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The salvage of the Caux Palace Hotel===
In 1946, the derelict Caux Palace Hotel as well as the former Grand Hotel and other smaller hotel buildings in Caux looked like near their end. The bankrupt ''Société Immobilière de Caux'' had fallen into the hands of its main banker, ''Banque populaire de Montreux'', who were looking for a quick way out and had put the whole lot on the market at a very low price. The most likely outcome was the demolition of the building in order to reuse its material.

But in an unexpected move, [[Geneva]]-born diplomat [[Philippe Mottu]] bid for the building with a small group of Swiss people. A graduate in theology and political science from Geneva university, Philippe Mottu had been associated with [[Frank Buchman]] and the [[Oxford Group]] since the mid-1930s and in 1943 he had had the recurring thought: "If Switzerland is spared by war, our task will be to put at the disposal of Frank Buchman a place where Europeans, torn apart by hatred, suffering and resentment, will be able to meet each other. Caux is the place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=588526 Story of the birth of the conference centre in Caux, by Philippe Mottu, 1997, in Cantonal Archives index, Lausanne, Vaud]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bankers as well as the [[Montreux|city of Montreux]] [[Mayor (Switzerland)|mayor]] understood full well the positives of having an international conference centre in the area of Montreux and offered a "discount" price of 1.050.000 Swiss francs, giving [[Moral Rearmament]] a priority over other bidders. The ''Caux Foundation'', which would administer the Caux Palace Hotel in the coming decades, being not yet in place, the sale contract was signed on 25 May 1946 by Philippe Mottu and Robert Hahnloser in their own name. It would take 95 individual Swiss donors to be able to reach the 450,000 Francs amount requested as first [[down payment]] on 1 July 1946. In-kind donations such as furniture, carpets also converged from all over Switzerland to help refurbish the former palace.

During six weeks, a team of international volunteers toiled day and night under the guidance of Swiss engineer Robert Hahnloser and his deputy, Dutch architect Jap de Boer, in order to repair the inside of the house. On 9 July 1946 the first meal cooked in the just enabled new kitchen was served to 150 guests. During that 1946 summer, 3000 people visited the new Caux conference centre. Dormitories were installed and some of the participants had to be allocated in nearby hotels. In 1946 and 1947 a series of needed transformations were performed in order to adapt the building to its new destiny: conversation of the ball room into a theater, new, larger entrance hall, etc. Lacking the adequate number of beds, the ''Caux Foundation'' bought the Grand Hotel and the Maria Hotel in 1947 and the Alpina Hotel in 1949, plus various smaller buildings.

===The Caux Conference Centre===
In the course of the next 50 years, the Caux Palace Hotel did not undergo any other significant modifications. Its history is marked by a long string of meetings organised by [[Moral Re-Armament|MRA]], which in certain cases had political repercussions.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the more recent years, see the presentation by the Caux Foundation’s president on 8 July 2012, inaugurating the 5th Caux Forum for Human Security with the participation of former Swiss President Mrs [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] {{cite web |url=http://www.caux.iofc.org/sites/all/files/Official%20Day%202012_Jaulmes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108223944/http://www.caux.iofc.org/sites/all/files/Official%20Day%202012_Jaulmes.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1946–1950: numerous meetings associating [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] participants, among whom the future protagonists of the [[Coal and Steel Community]] agreements, who found a mutual trust relationship through Caux.

==Architecture and Style==
The Caux-Palace Hotel building surprises the observer both by its size and by its eclectic style.&lt;ref name = Lüthi&gt;Dave Lüthi, Eugène Jost, architecte du passé retrouvé, Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes, Lausanne, 2001, pp. 52-54, {{ISBN|2880744563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General style===
The [[Architectural style|building’s style]] is often considered as [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medieval]] and has earned the Caux Palace Hotel the nickname of "[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]", whereas

:"in reality it is by no means an archeological reconstruction. Architect Eugène Jost used only some elements with a medieval resemblance – possibly inspired by nearby [[Château de Chillon|Chillon Castle]], a castle which Jost knew well, having restored it: [[bartizan]]s, [[machicolation]]s and the two towers supported by [[corbel]]s which punctuate the apartments building … Their style is barely medieval: granted, it includes a few [[hood mould]]s and a few [[ogee]] arches, but also Florentine neo-Renaissance semi-circular arches with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s, dual colours in French [[Louis XIII style]], adding to that pieces of carved wood and coloured glazed tiles which belong as much to [[seaside resort]] style as to Victorian 'Heimatstil' … Therefore, you could say that the Caux Palace Hotel is not neo-medieval but 'post-neomedieval'. Its architect quoted freely Middle Ages models (castles) which he couldn’t really imitate because they were too distant from his own typology. He reused a few details only, bringing to life a whole medieval or even neomedieval imagery."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

===Enlivenment of the façade===
Studying the façades of all hotels built by Eugène Jost, Professor Dave Lüthi from the [[University of Lausanne]] observed that, in order to avoid the hotel to look like barracks as could result from long rows of aligned hotel rooms windows, Jost contrived to counterbalance the horizontal deployment of the façades by an almost brutal articulation of vertical volumes and by the use of a few ornate bays which create a dynamic in the various sections of the façades (accentuation of [[dormer]]s and roofs, contrasting with angles left free of any decoration).

In the case of the Caux Palace Hotel, which can probably be regarded as Jost’s masterpiece,&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt; the South façade, which contains 271 windows, is ingeniously split in five parts and patterned by numerous protruding elements such as [[balconies]], [[bow window]]s or a [[corbel]]ing gallery on the last floor. In contrast to this part of the building, the common areas rooms is equipped with very large [[bay window]]s which somewhat blur the visitor’s perception of the building from the gardens: these brutal scale changes are typical of [[eclectic architecture]]; they indicate the function of each part of the building and by bringing them together, oppose them, so as to warn the visitor about his own subjectivity: big or small are relative values.

Seen close by, the Caux Palace Hotel is an imposing sight because of its monumental size (which may be its main similarity with its so-called medieval models), yet it nevers "crushes" the observer; seen from afar only its [[cornice]], roof and [[turret]]s can be seen: the Caux Palace Hotel, like a [[diadem]] set on top of the Caux Mount, becomes the giant advertisement for the site.&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt; The Caux Palace Hotel is therefore quite representative of the new trend launched by Eugène Jost:

:"Playing with various loose elements such as balconies, loggias, carved decors, the architect assembles them in a composition which breaks with the academic approach of classic styles. Giving up gradually classic structures built around [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]], [[cornice]]s and [[pilaster]]s which characterise most of the production at the time, Jost gave this hotel a façade which in 1900 belonged only to this type of architecture."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

===Functionality===
In the case of the Caux Palace Hotel as in his other hotel projects, Eugène Jost foremost concentrated on the general layout and on the façades. He unfolded his monumental buildings beyond the point where dimension became detrimental to usage.

:"The customer must then cope with a long walk between the hotel’s entrance and his room (in difference with traditional hotels) but he is led to many discoveries on the way. The dimensions of the spaces he walks across, the diversity of the light sources, the luxury of the decors are as many surprises. Although room distribution may not be 'rational' in the sense which a [[Viollet-le-Duc]] or a [[Julien Guadet|Guadet]] would have had it, it is thought through as an architectural stroll around which the parallel world of services and servants revolves."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

==Renovations==
The Caux Foundation made several renovations in the course of the years, the most spectacular being in the course of the 1980s the complete renovation of the roofs; appropriate coloured glazed tiles could only be found in the region of [[Dijon]] ([[France]]) and they were bought with the financial assistance of the French [[Initiatives of Change]] association. The dining room had been redone in 1959 and a fresco by [[Finland|Finnish]] painter [[Lennart Segerstråle]] was then added.

The arrival of the [[Swiss Hotel Management School]] (SHMS) in 1995 as a tenant outside the conference season has allowed the Caux Foundation to do more to maintain and improve the ageing building and its surroundings. In some cases it was a matter of compliance with more demanding new regulations: there was a revamping of the kitchen in line with the most advanced professional norms, the installation of required fire detector systems and fireproof doors at strategic locations, the installation of separate collection and evacuation systems for wastewater and rainwater, etc. Another key work is the gradual renovation of over 200 bathrooms which had more or less remained early 20th century bathrooms. In other instances, there was a need to adapt to the requirements of the teaching activity of SHMS: creation of classrooms and of a new amphitheater, addition of an internet café. Some structures, such as the ground floor [[pergola]], also received needed renovations.

However, from the cultural heritage viewpoint, the most interesting piece of work was the renovation of the great hall and of some historic rooms in 2007 and 2008 with support from Foundation Pro Patria, Loterie Romande and JP Morgan Chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.propatria.ch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=29&amp;sobi2Id=651&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=fr# |title=Brief note in Pro Patria site (in French) |access-date=2015-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082411/http://www.propatria.ch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=29&amp;sobi2Id=651&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=fr# |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Batir&gt;See detailed article in the Swiss professional periodical "Bâtir", journal romand de la construction suisse, novembre 2007, pages 17 to 22. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was to clean up and to restore the wall and ceiling frescoes of the great hall which had been created by [[Bern]]ese painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Haberer|fr}} in 1902. The ceiling was particularly important as one of the largest ever painted in Switzerland and as the only one still in its original state. It is also unique by its decoration in Swiss [[Art deco]] style and by its [[cupola]] shape. The restoration works of the [[frescoes]] allowed reducing the visual impact of the various alterations they endured in time, to keep in place as much as possible the initial decorations’ substance and to bring to light two additional frescoes adorning the great Hall’s decorative [[fireplace mantel]]s.&lt;ref name = Batir/&gt;

These renovation works were led by specialists Olivier Guyot et Julian James and supervised by the “Monuments and Sites” section of the Vaud state, as well as by Swiss architect Eric Jaeger for the Caux Foundation.&lt;ref name = Batir/&gt;

At the end of 2015, the CAUX-Initiatives of Change Foundation had the heating system replaced, moving from oil to (local) wood heating. [[Fossil fuel]]'s [[CO2]] emissions were lowered by 590 tons per year as a result. The fuel oil boilers and tanks had been installed in the early 1960s to replace the original 1902 six coal firing boilers&lt;ref&gt;Le Caux-Palace change ses grandes chaudières, article in the [[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 heures]] daily newspaper [https://www.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/riviera-chablais/cauxpalace-change-grandes-chaudieres/story/18626281]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the [[early modern period]], a '''court Jew''', or '''court factor''' ({{lang-de|Hofjude, Hoffaktor}}), was a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[banker]] who handled the finances of, or lent money to, [[Europe]]an royalty and nobility. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including in some cases being [[Ennoblement|granted noble status]]. Court Jews were needed because prohibitions against [[usury]] applied to Christians but did not apply to Jews.

Examples of what would be later called court Jews emerged in the [[High Middle Ages]] when the royalty, the nobility, and the church borrowed money from [[money changer]]s or employed them as financiers. Among the most notable of these were [[Aaron of Lincoln]] and [[Vivelin of Strasbourg]]. Jewish financiers could use their family connections to provide their sponsors with finance, food, [[Medieval weapons|arms]], ammunition, [[gold]], and precious metals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The rise of the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] in Central Europe brought many Jews, mostly of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi origin]], into the position of negotiating loans for the various courts. They could amass personal fortunes and gain political and social influence.  However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through the Christian nobility and church. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution. The most famous example of this occurred in [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]] when, after the death of his sponsor [[Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg|Charles Alexander]] in 1737, [[Joseph Süß Oppenheimer]] was put on trial and finally executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tegel |first=Susan |title=The Jew Süss : His Life and Afterlife in Legend, Literature and Film |location=London |publisher=Continuum |year=2011 |isbn=9781847250179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to avoid such fate, some court bankers in the late 18th century—such as [[Samuel Bleichröder]], [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]], or [[Aron Elias Seligmann]]—successfully detached their businesses from these courts and established what eventually developed into full-fledged banks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Background ==
{{See also|Jews in the Middle Ages}}
Prohibited from nearly every other trade, some Jews began to occupy an economic niche as moneylenders in the Middle Ages. Only they were allowed to take interest on loans, since—while the [[Catholic Church|Church]] condemned [[usury]] universally—[[canon law]] was only applied to Christians and not to Jews. Eventually, a sizable sector of the European Jewish community were engaged in financial occupations, and the community was a financially highly successful part of the medieval economy.&lt;ref name="Arkin, 1975"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Arkin |editor-first=Marcus |year=1975 |title=Aspects of Jewish Economic History |publisher=The Jewish Publication Society of America |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0827600674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben-Sasson, 1976, p. 401"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ben-Sasson |editor-first=H. |year=1976 |title=A History of the Jewish People |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |page=401 |quote=Western Europe suffered virtual famine for many years in the tenth and eleventh centuries, there is no hint or echo of this in the Jewish sources of the region in this period. They lived at an aristocratic level, as befitted international merchants and honored local financiers. |isbn=0674397304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious restrictions on moneylending had inadvertently created a source of [[monopoly rent]]s, causing profits associated with moneylending to be higher than they otherwise would have been.&lt;ref name="Koyama2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koyama |first=Mark |year=2010 |title=The Political Economy of Expulsion: The Regulation of Jewish Moneylending in Medieval England |journal=Constitutional Political Economy |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=374–406 |doi=10.1007/s10602-010-9087-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By most parameters, the standard of living of the Jewish community in Early Medieval period was at least equal to that of the lower nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=N. |year=2002 |title=Medieval Jewish Civilization: An Encyclopedia |series=Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages |volume=7 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages= |isbn=0415937124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this economic prosperity, the community was not safe: religious hostility increased to the extent that it manifested itself in the form of massacres and expulsions, culminating in the repetitive expulsion of all Jews from various parts of Western Europe in the late medieval period.

Although the phenomenon of "Court Jewry" did not occur until the early 17th century, examples of what would be later called court Jews can be found earlier in Jewish moneylenders who accumulated enough capital to finance the royalty and the nobility. Among them was [[Josce of Gloucester]], the Jewish financier who funded [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]'s conquest of Ireland in 1170,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hillaby |first=Joe |title=Testimony from the margin: the Gloucester Jewry and its neighbours, c. 1159–1290 |journal=[[Jewish Historical Studies]] |volume=37 |year=2001 |pages=41–112 |jstor=29780029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aaron of Lincoln]], presumably the wealthiest individual in 12th-century Britain, who left an estate of about £100,000.&lt;ref name="Koyama2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom, 1000-1500 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |first=Robert |last=Chazan |page=159 |isbn=0-521-84666-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also notable was [[Vivelin of Strasbourg]], one of the wealthiest persons in Europe in the early 14th century, who lent 340,000 [[florin]]s to [[Edward III of England]] on the eve of the [[Hundred Years' War]], in 1339.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shatzmiller |first=Joseph |title=Cultural Exchange: Jews, Christians, and Art in the Medieval Marketplace |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2013 |isbn=1400846099 |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, Jewish financiers became increasingly connected to rulers and courts. [[Josef Goldschmidt]] (d. 1572) of [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], also known as "Jud Joseph zum Goldenen Schwan", became the most important Jewish businessman of his era, trading not only with the [[Fugger]]s and [[Imhoff family|Imhoffs]], but also with the nobility and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judengasse.de/dhtml/P014.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 17th century the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] employed the services of [[Jacob Bassevi]] of Prague, [[Joseph Pincherle]] of [[Gorizia]], and [[Moses Marburger|Moses]] and [[Jacob Marburger]] of [[Gradisca]].

At the dawn of [[Mercantilism]], while most [[Sephardi Jews]] were primarily active in the west in maritime and colonial trade, the Ashkenazi Jews in the service of the emperor and princes tended toward domestic trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graetz |first=Michael |chapter=Court Jews in Economics and Politics |title=From Court Jews to the Rothschilds: Art, Patronage, and Power 1600–1800 |editor1-first=Vivian B. |editor1-last=Mann |editor2-first=Richard I. |editor2-last=Cohen |location=New York |publisher=Prestel |pages=27–43 |isbn=3-7913-1624-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not always on account of their learning or their force of character did these Jews rise to positions close to the rulers: they were mostly wealthy businessmen, distinguished above their co-religionists by their commercial instincts and their adaptability. Court Jews frequently suffered through the denunciation of their envious rivals and co-religionists, and were often the objects of hatred of the people and the courtiers. They were of service to their fellow Jews only during the periods, often short, of their influence with the rulers; and as they themselves often came to a tragic end, their co-religionists were in consequence of their fall all the more harassed.

The court Jews, as the agents of the rulers, and in times of war as the [[purveyors]] and the [[treasurers]] of the state, enjoyed special privileges. They were under the jurisdiction of the [[court marshal]], and were not compelled to wear the [[Yellow badge|Jews' badge]]. They were permitted to stay wherever the [[emperor]] held his court, and to live anywhere in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], even in places where no other Jews were allowed. Wherever they settled they could buy houses, slaughter meat according to the [[Shechita|Jewish ritual]], and maintain a [[rabbi]]. They could sell their goods [[wholesale]] and [[retail]], and could not be taxed or assessed higher than the [[Christian]]s.
[[File:15 Hofjude Lämmle Seeligmann.JPG|thumb|Lämmle Seeligmann, the court Jew]]
Jews were sometimes assigned the role of local [[tax]] collectors. These roles built up a long-standing enmity between Jews and Christians, the results of which had far-reaching consequences in the [[history of European Jews]].

== At the Austrian court ==
The [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]] kept a considerable number of court Jews. Among those of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] are mentioned the following: [[Solomon Mayer|Solomon]] and [[Ber Mayer]], who furnished for the wedding of the emperor and [[Eleonora Gonzaga (1598–1655)|Eleonora of Mantua]] the cloth for four squadrons of cavalry; [[Joseph Pincherle]] of [[Görz]]; Moses and [[Joseph Marburger]] ([[Joseph Morpurgo|Morpurgo]]) of [[Gradisca d'Isonzo|Gradisca]]; [[Ventura Pariente]] of [[Trieste]]; the physician [[Elijah Chalfon]] of [[Vienna]]; [[Samuel zum Drachen]], [[Samuel zum Straussen]], and [[Samuel zum Weissen Drachen]] of [[Frankfurt am Main]]; and [[Mordecai Meisel]], of [[Prague]]. A specially favored court Jew was [[Jacob Bassevi]], the first Jew to be ennobled, with the title "''von Treuenberg''".

Important as court Jews were also [[Samuel Oppenheimer]], who went from [[Heidelberg]] to [[Vienna]], and [[Samson Wertheimer]] (Wertheimher) from [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Oppenheimer, who was appointed chief court factor, together with his two sons Emanuel and Wolf, and [[Wertheimer]], who was at first associated with him, devoted their time and talents to the service of Austria and the House of Habsburg: during the Rhenish, French, Turkish, and Spanish wars they loaned millions of florins for provisions, munitions, etc. Wertheimer, who, by title at least, was also chief court factor to the [[Prince-elector|elector]]s of [[Mainz]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], and [[Treves]], received from the emperor a chain of honor with his miniature.

Samson Wertheimer was succeeded as court factor by his son Wolf. Contemporaneous with him was [[Leffmann Behrends]], of [[Hanover]], court factor and agent of the elector [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]] and of the duke [[Rudolf August of Brunswick]]. He also had relationships with several other rulers and high dignitaries. Behrends' two sons, [[Mordecai Gumpel]] and Isaac, received the same titles as he, chief court factors and agents. Isaac Cohen's father-in-law, [[Behrend Lehman]], called also ''Bärmann Halberstadt'', was a court factor of [[Saxony]], with the title of "''Resident''"; and his son Lehman Behrend was called to [[Dresden]] as court factor by King [[Augustus the Strong]]. [[Moses Bonaventura]] of Prague was also court Jew of Saxony in 1679.

== Intrigues of court Jews ==
The Models were court Jews of the [[margrave]]s of [[Ansbach]] about the middle of the seventeenth century. Especially influential was [[Marx Model]], who had the largest business in the whole principality and extensively supplied the court and the army. He fell into disgrace through the intrigues of the court Jew [[Elkan Fränkel]], member of a family that had been driven from Vienna. Fränkel, a [[wikt:circumspect|circumspect]], energetic, and proud man, possessed the confidence of the margrave to such a degree that his advice was sought in the most important affairs of the state. Denounced by a certain [[Isaiah Fränkel]], however, who desired to be baptized, an accusation was brought against Elkan Fränkel; and the latter was [[Pillory|pilloried]], [[scourge]]d, and sent to the [[Würzburg]] for life imprisonment on November 2, 1712. He died there in 1720.

[[David Rost]], [[Gabriel Fränkel]], and, in 1730, Isaac Nathan (Ischerlein) were court Jews together with Elkan Fränkel; Ischerlein, through the intrigues of the Fränkels, suffered the same fate as Elkan Fränkel. Nevertheless, Nathan's son-in-law, [[Dessauer]], became court Jew. Other court Jews of the princes of Ansbach were Michael Simon and [[Löw Israel]] (1743), Meyer Berlin, and [[Amson Solomon Seligmann]] (1763).

== The Great Elector ==
The Great Elector, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], also kept a court Jew at Berlin, Israel Aaron (1670), who by his influence tried to prevent the influx of foreign Jews into the Prussian capital. Other court Jews of the elector were Gumpertz (died 1672), [[Berend Wulff]] (1675), and [[Solomon Fränkel]] (1678). More influential than any of these was Jost Liebmann. Through his marriage with the widow of the above-named Israel Aaron, he succeeded to the latter's position, and was highly esteemed by the elector. He had continual quarrels with the court Jew of the crown prince, [[Markus Magnus]]. After his death, his influential position fell to his widow, the well-known Liebmannin, who was so well received by [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] (from 1701 King Frederick I of [[Prussia]]) that she could go unannounced into his cabinet.

There were court Jews at all the petty German courts; e.g., [[Zacharias Seligmann]] (1694) in the service of the Prince of [[Hesse-Homburg]], and others in the service of the dukes of [[Mecklenburg]]. Others mentioned toward the end of the seventeenth century are: Bendix and [[Ruben Goldschmidt]] of Homburg; [[Michael Hinrichsen]] of [[Glückstadt]], who soon associated himself with [[Moses Israel Fürst]], and whose son, [[Reuben Hinrichsen]], in 1750 had a fixed salary as court agent. About this time the court agent Wolf lived at the court of Frederick III of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Disputes with the court Jews often led to protracted lawsuits.
[[File:Itzig Daniel Medal 1793.JPG|thumb|Medal for [[Daniel Itzig]]'s Seventieth Birthday.]]
The last actual court Jews were [[Israel Jacobson]], court agent of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], and [[Wolf Breidenbach]], factor to the [[Elector of Hesse]], both of whom occupy honorable positions in the history of the Jews.

The case originated with an attempt by [[Tomekichi Homma]], a Japanese immigrant and naturalized Canadian, to register to vote in 1900. The registrar of voters, Thomas Cunningham, rejected Homma's application. Homma took the British Columbia government to court over the issue.

Homma was successful at the County Court and the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]]&lt;ref name=RichmondNews&gt;{{cite news |title= Steveston pioneer helped define Canada's democratic values with epic court battle |author= Graeme Wood |newspaper= Richmond News |location= Richmond, B.C. |date= 2018-01-04 |page= |url= http://www.richmond-news.com/news/steveston-pioneer-helped-define-canada-s-democratic-values-with-epic-court-battle-1.23135921 |accessdate=2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GeorgiaStraight&gt;{{cite news |title= Remembering B.C. civil rights leader Tomekichi Homma |author1= John Price |author2= Grace Eiko Thomson |newspaper= The Georgia Straight |location= Vancouver, B.C. |date= 2017-12-08 |page=  |url= https://www.straight.com/news/1006111/john-price-and-grace-eiko-thomson-remembering-bc-civil-rights-leader-tomekichi-homma |accessdate=2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case ultimately made its way to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], which at that time was the highest court in the Canadian legal system. In ''Cunningham v Homma'', the Privy Council ruled against Homma.&lt;ref name = RichmondNews/&gt;&lt;ref name = GeorgiaStraight/&gt; The court determined that while the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over the naturalization of citizens, the provinces had the right to legislate who could vote in provincial and municipal elections. There was no inherent right to vote for naturalized citizens. Provinces and their municipalities could determine who could vote, which meant they could bar any naturalized ethic group they chose.&lt;ref name = RichmondNews/&gt;&lt;ref name = GeorgiaStraight/&gt; [[Parks Canada]] has designated this case as being of National Historical Significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | vauthors =  | title = Cunningham v.

'''Danilo Türk''' ({{IPA-sl|daˈníːlɔ ˈtýɾk|pron}}; born 19 February 1952) is a Slovenian diplomat, professor of international law, human rights expert, and political figure who served as [[President of Slovenia]] from 2007 to 2012. Türk was the first Slovene ambassador to the United Nations, from 1992 to 2000, and was the UN Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs from 2000 to 2005.

He is a visiting professor of international law at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], a professor emeritus at the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Ljubljana]], and non-resident senior fellow of Chongyang Institute for Financial studies at [[Renmin University of China]] in Beijing. Türk is the founder of the Danilo Türk Foundation, devoted mostly to the rehabilitation of child victims of armed conflict. He is also the chairman of the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace and the chairman of the board of the [http://www.globalfairness.org/ Global Fairness Initiative], a Washington-based NGO dedicated to economic and social development in developing nations.

In 2016, Türk was an unsuccessful candidate for the post of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]].

== Early life ==
Türk was born in a lower-middle-class family in [[Maribor]], Slovenia (then part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]). He attended Maribor Grammar School No. 2 (''II. gimnazija Maribor''). In 1971 he enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he studied law. After graduation (1975) he served as the secretary of the commission for minority and expatriate affairs at the Socialist Alliance of Working People (SZDL), an organisation sponsored by Yugoslav Communist Party. In December 1979 he became the chairman of that commission and a member of the executive committee of the SZDL. At the same time he continued his studies. He obtained an MA with a thesis on minority rights from the [[Faculty of Law, University of Belgrade|University of Belgrade's]] Law School. In 1978, he became a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Law in [[Ljubljana]]. In 1982, he obtained his PhD with a dissertation on the principle of non-intervention in international law at the University in Ljubljana and received a full-time job as an assistant professor at the University in Ljubljana's Faculty of Law. In 1983, he became the director of the University of Ljubljana's Institute for International Law. In the following years, he worked on human and minority rights. In the mid-1980s, he collaborated with [[Amnesty International]] to report on human rights issues in Yugoslavia.

Between 1986 and 1992, he served in a personal capacity as a member the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and was the UN Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Together with Louis Joinet (France), he was also the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression. In 1987 he initiated the establishment of the Council for Human Rights in Slovenia and served until 1992 as the council’s vice-chairman. In 1990/91 he coauthored the human rights chapter in Slovenia's constitution.

==Diplomatic and academic career==
From 1992 to 2000, Türk was the first Slovene Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations]]. During this time, he secured the election of Slovenia to the UN Security Council (1998–1999) and was president of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in August 1998 and November 1999.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Between 1996 and 1998, he was a member of the [[UN Human Rights Committee]]. From 2000 to 2005, he served as UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs under Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]]. In 2005 he returned to Slovenia and became a professor of international law; from May 2006 to December 2007 he served as the vice dean of student affairs at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Law. Türk has published over 100 articles in various law journals and three books. He authored the first Slovene book on international law, titled ''Temelji mednarodnega prava'' (Foundations of International Law, 2007, revised 2015).

==Presidency==

[[File:Harald V and Sonja of Norway in Slovenia in 2011 (4).jpg|thumb|Danilo Türk and his wife Barbara with King [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]] and Queen [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Sonja of Norway]] in 2011]]
In June 2007, Türk ran in the Slovene presidential election. As an "independent" candidate, he was backed by a broad coalition of left-wing parties, composed of the opposition [[Zares]] party and [[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|Social Democrats]], the [[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia]], and the extra-parliamentary Christian Socialist Party and [[Democratic Party of Slovenia|Democratic Party]]. In the first round of the presidential elections, held on 21 October 2007, he placed second with 24.54% of the votes, which brought him into the runoff against the centre right candidate [[Lojze Peterle]] (who received 28.50% of the popular vote). He won the runoff on 11 November 2007 with 68.2% of the votes,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; becoming the third president of Slovenia on December 23, 2007.  Türk ran for reelection in 2012, but lost the election to [[Borut Pahor]] in a second round of voting, held on 2 December 2012.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; He received roughly one-third of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/predsedniske-volitve-2012/dvk-pahor-67-08-odstotka-tuerk-32-92-odstotka/297155 |title=Pahor : Türk 67,44% : 32,56%.

==Health==
In March 2011, Danilo Türk successfully underwent [[robotic surgery|robot-assisted]] [[prostate cancer]] surgery at the [[Urology Institute, Innsbruck|Urology Institute]] in [[Innsbruck]], Austria.

== UN Secretary-General candidature ==
{{See also|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 2016}}
In December 2013 Türk announced that he was planning to run for [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]]. He was soon supported by Prime Minister [[Alenka Bratušek]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Karl Erjavec|Karel Erjavec]]. In January 2014 the Slovene government endorsed Türk as its candidate for UN Secretary-General. He was later also supported by Prime Minister [[Miro Cerar]] and President [[Borut Pahor]], as well as by [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Slovenia]] [[Milan Brglez]] (also a professor at the University of Ljubljana). In accordance with the UN procedure, the government of Slovenia nominated Danilo Türk as candidate for UN Secretary-General on 8 February 2016.

Türk is an experienced member of the United Nations community. He served as the first Permanent Representative of the Republic of Slovenia to the UN and remained in New York as ambassador for eight years, from 1992 until 2000. As Slovenian representative he also presided over the [[United Nations Security Council]] twice. His work was recognised by Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], who chose Türk as one of his close advisors and appointed him Assistant Secretary-General in 2000. He served in this position until 2005, when he returned to Slovenia to teach international law at the University of Ljubljana.

Türk has long been recognised as an expert and global advocate for human rights and his work has been connected with human rights and the fight for equality for more than 40 years.

One element of human rights that Turk has been questioned about is the UN's role in the [[2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak|Haiti cholera outbreak]] that has been widely discussed and criticized. There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haiti's water stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/advocacies/our-work/cholera-advocacy/|title=Advocacy Cholera Accountability|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the New York Times, Türk was asked if cholera victims should receive compensation. He responded by saying he hopes the UN would "provide the victims with a fair process and an effective remedy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/un-secretary-general-candidates-ban-ki-moon.html|title=U.N. Strives for Transparency in Picking New Secretary General|date=5 April 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Vincent followed this up during the UN informal dialogues by asking Mr. Türk how he would place the pursuit of an effective remedy on his list of priorities. Türk's response was that though the UN enjoys immunity from prosecution, "there are other ways of establishing fair process and effectiveness". He also stated "current discussions that I know exist within the Secretariat and between the Secretariat and member states will produce such effectiveness and fairness."&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webtv.un.org/search/danilo-t%C3%BCrk-slovenia-informal-dialogue-for-the-position-of-the-next-un-secretary-general/4844251525001?term=informal%20dialogue&amp;languages=&amp;sort=date|title=Danilo Türk (Slovenia) - Informal dialogue for the position of the next UN Secretary-General|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following-up at the media stakeout, [[Inner City Press]] questioned Türk about his statement that there may be some process going on behind the scenes to pay compensation. Türk responded by saying that there have been informal conversations about the Haitian situation, and though he does not have full knowledge, he can say that "this story is not closed." &lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; He admits that he values the importance of legal regulation including UN immunity, but he also believes in remedies and fair processes.

37 human rights organizations recently signed onto a UN Secretary General accountability pledge. This pledge asks the candidates to take action on two human rights violations that have tarnished the United Nations' image: failing to provide remedies for victims of cholera in Haiti, and sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codebluecampaign.com/press-releases/2016/7/27|title=UN Accountability Pledge|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Türk issued a statement responding to Aids Free World and the [[Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti]], expressing his support for the organizations' efforts.&lt;ref name="fundacija-danilaturka.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.fundacija-danilaturka.org/danilo_turk/news/article?aid=100|title=www.en.fundacija-danilaturka.org - Improving accountability of the United Nations|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledges that he has "clearly expressed [his] commitment to fairness towards the victims of cholera in Haiti and for substantial, credible and speedy investigations of the cases of sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers", he cannot undertake formal pledges.&lt;ref name="fundacija-danilaturka.org"/&gt; Nevertheless, he reaffirms his commitment to better UN accountability and says "it is abundantly clear where my heart is."&lt;ref name="fundacija-danilaturka.org"/&gt;

==Biography==
David Lloyd Jones was born  on 10 May 1942 to Hester née Ritchie and Richard Lloyd Jones at Busbridge England in the rented gardener's cottage of [[Munstead Wood]], the former home of [[Gertrude Jekyll]] designed by her protégé, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]. Shortly thereafter, at the end of World War 2, the family moved to nearby Catteshall Rough, his maternal grandmother's house, and then two years later to Springwood, a much extended Tudor farmhouse on the outskirts of the Surrey town of [[Godalming]].  The family lived here throughout his early boyhood moving back up the hill to Munstead in 1960.  At the age of eight Lloyd Jones attended [[Edgeborough School]] as a border and then went on to [[Bradfield College]] in Berkshire.  He left there in 1960 having gained a place at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in [[Bloomsbury]], London.

Lloyd Jones studied architecture for five years at the AA, taking a year out in 1965 during which he worked for [[Stillman &amp; Eastwick-Field Partnership]], and secured a travel scholarship allowing him to spend six months visiting architectural practices in the USA to obtain material for inclusion in the ''[[Architects Journal|Architects' Journal]]''.  Tutors and teachers at the AA included Michael (John) Lloyd, John Winter, Patrick de Saulles, [[Cedric Price]], [[Paul Oliver]], Sir [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], [[Leon Krier]], [[Charles Jencks]], Robert Maxwell, Alan Colquhoun, and Alvin Boyarski. In 1966 David Lloyd Jones was awarded a Diploma in Architecture and took time off to travel through France and Italy on his [[Lambretta]], subsidising his limited funds by working as a film extra.

The same year he joined the National Building Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.ie/en/default.asp |title=National Building Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120014206/http://www.nba.ie/en/default.asp |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in London, a multi-disciplinary organisation established by the Wilson Government as a Semi-State body in 1960, under the directorship of Cleeve Barr, to provide services to both public and private sector clients and undertake specific tasks in support of radical new policies of Government in housing, urban renewal, and other construction related activities. Lloyd Jones worked on teams developing new concepts of government funded housing, including, high density, low rise housing schemes in the new towns of [[Crawley]] and [[Harlow]], and published guides and handbooks covering housing design based on the newly introduced metric system of measurement.

While working at the NBA he was co-opted onto the [[London Borough of Camden]] Council's Arts Committee where, as member of the Festival Sub-Committee, he was charged with organising rock concerts in the Borough.  To do so he teamed up with Michael Alfandary and [[Harvey Goldsmith]] to produce the first free open-air concert-on [[Parliament Hill, London]]-and in the Roundhouse (a converted steam engine maintenance building). Sets included [[It's a Beautiful Day]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[The Pretty Things]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Procol Harum]], [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]].  While serving on the Arts Committee David Lloyd Jones was asked to expend Camden's annual sum allocated to building up their public art collection.  In doing so he bought from [[Derek Jarman]], [[David Hockney]], [[John Lifton]] and other up and coming artists. He was also, through support from the Borough, instrumental in setting up and fostering The [[Institute for Research in Art and Technology]] (London New [[Arts Lab]]), a newly conceived and popular forum for disseminating a spectrum of arts under a single roof. At the same time David Lloyd Jones had taken on the position of Honorary Treasurer to PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism), now incorporated into the [[Tory Reform Group]], formed to put pressure on the [[Alec Douglas-Home]] government to introduce more relevant, egalitarian government policies. Colleagues in the pressure group included [[Michael Spicer, Baron Spicer]] of Cropthorne, Jeremy Baker and Sir [[Simon Jenkins]].

David Lloyd Jones and Linda Stewart married in 1971. Linda Lloyd Jones' career has been in arts administration. She has been Head of Exhibitions and Loans at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] since 1988. She previously worked for [[Penguin Books]], the London Festival Ballet (now [[English National Ballet]]) and the ICA ([[Institute of Contemporary Arts]]).

Lloyd Jones moved to the multi-disciplinary RMJM ([[Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall]] and Partners) in 1972 to take up the position of project architect for the Reading Cultural Centre. Other projects on which he took key roles were: project architect for the development of facilities outside [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia for pilgrims attending the annual [[Hajj]]; deputy director of the [[Nigerian Universities Commission]] university development programme involving the setting of space and design standards, and funding mechanisms for seven new and existing university campuses located throughout Nigeria and carried out by seven international consortia; and project architect for the [[Royal Mint]] site development; and the introduction of barristers chambers into The Walks at [[Gray's Inn]], London.  In 1978 he led the design team for a new headquarters for [[NFU Mutual]] at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].  The RMJM team included building physicist, Dr William Bordass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrustlive.co.uk/|title=Carbon Trust Live Webcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and architect, Walter Nageli. This building was acclaimed for its architecture with Colin Amery describing it as a "modern masterpiece" in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and for being one of the first UK buildings to adopt a rigorous approach to environmental sustainability. It broke with the then current deep plan, air conditioned office template and became a touchstone for future commercial development, featuring in government sponsored guides for improved environmental performance. His designs for public exhibitions included "50 Penguin Years" at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] for [[Penguin Books]]; and "HRH Prince of Wales' ([[Charles, Prince of Wales]]) Vision of Britain" at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].  In 1986 Lloyd Jones became a director of RMJM London and chairman of the Design Group.

In 1991 David Lloyd Jones left RMJM to set up his own practice, David Lloyd Jones Associates, develop his work as a researcher and practitioner in the field of sustainable architecture and to travel; and, in 1994, he founded, with Cezary Bednarski and Andrzej Kuszell, Studio E Architects, now Studio E LLP, where he is currently a partner with Andrzej Kuszell and Garry Stewart.

Studio E is involved in building and urban projects as well as research and development and assisting in formulating government policy and regulations for sustainable building practice and construction. David Lloyd Jones has been responsible for a succession of building projects including: The Solar Office, [[Doxford International Business Park]] (1998); The Treasures of St. Cuthbert, [[Durham Cathedral]] (1998); [[BBC]] 21st Century Classroom (2002); Beaufort Court Zero Emissions Head Office for Renewable Energy Systems, Kings Langley (2003);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beaufortcourt.com/|title=Beaufort Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grange Park Opera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grangeparkopera.co.uk/|title=Grange Park Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt; House, [[The Grange, Northington]] (2003); Theatre, Sports Hall and Science Laboratories for [[Townley Grammar School for Girls]], Bexley Heath (2005); Burgess Park Community Sports Centre (2006); [[City of London Freemen's School]] masterplan (2011); Highgrove Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre, Hillingdon (2012), and Heston Leisure Centre (2014).  R&amp;D projects have been carried out for International, European, National and commercial organisations and include: IEA PVPS Task 7: Photovoltaic Power in the Built Environment; EU Framework 5: RES Integrated Renewable Energy Systems Development Programme; EU REFRAME High Insulation Windows Programme;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eu-reframe.net |title=REFRAME – New Window Framing Technologies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123071849/http://www.eu-reframe.net/ |archivedate=23 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Orange at Home for [[Orange (telecommunications)]] Plc, and the Classroom of the Future at St Frances of Assisi Primary School for the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]].

The '''Edict of Versailles''', commonly known as the '''Edict of Tolerance''', was an official act that gave non-Catholics in [[France]] the right to openly practice their religions as well as legal and civil status, which included the right to contract marriages without having to convert to the Catholic faith. The edict was signed by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] on 7 November 1787, and registered in the [[Parlement|Parlement of Paris]] of the [[Ancien Régime]] on 29 January 1788. Its successful enactment was due to persuasive arguments by prominent French philosophers and literary personalities of the day, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], by Americans such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], and especially by the joint work of [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes]], minister to Louis XVI, and [[Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne]], spokesman for the Protestant community in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''], downloaded 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry IV of France]] (1589–1610) had initially granted [[Huguenot]]s a significant amount of freedom to practice their faith when he signed the [[Edict of Nantes]] (13 April 1598). These rights were revoked by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (18 October 1685). Enforcement of the revocation relaxed under the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], but it remained law for a century. Under the Edict of Versailles, [[Roman Catholicism]] continued as the state religion of the Kingdom of France, but relief was offered to non-Catholic worshippers – [[Calvinist]] [[Huguenot]]s, [[Lutheran]]s, and [[Jew]]s alike. Considering the long-standing dominance of this religion, restrictions were still placed on non-Catholics around the country, keeping the outliers of the time behind the scenes at the workplace and in educational settings, so as not to misrepresent the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/276/|title=Edict of Toleration, November 1787|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable example of these restrictions was in [[Metz]], where actions by the Parlement of Metz explicitly excluded certain rights for Jews within its domain, such as drafting of lists of grievances, that did not apply to coreligionists elsewhere. 

While the Edict of Versailles did not proclaim freedom of religion across France, which would occur with the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]], it was an important step in pacifying religious tensions and officially ended religious persecution in France.

'''Edward Mazria''' is an American [[architect]], author and educator. He is a graduate of Lafayette High School, played basketball in high school and in college at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and was drafted by the New York Knickerbockers in 1962. After receiving his Bachelor of Architecture Degree from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1963 he spent two years as an architect in the [[Peace Corps]] in [[Arequipa, Perú]].  He later worked with the firm of [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]] in New York before completing his master's degree and beginning a teaching and research career at the [[University of New Mexico]] in 1973.

His architecture and [[renewable energy]] research at both UNM and the [[University of Oregon]] established his leadership in the field of resource conservation and passive heating, cooling and daylighting design.  His design methodology, developed at that time and presented in The [[Passive Solar]] Energy Book, is currently in use worldwide.

Since forming the architecture and planning firm Mazria Associates, Inc. in 1978, he has completed award winning architecture and planning projects from the day-lit Mt. Airy Public Library in [[Mount Airy, North Carolina|North Carolina]] to the [[Rio Grande Botanic Garden]] Conservatory in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echostudiochicago.com/learn/mt-airy-public-library Article about Mt. Airy Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/02/the_th_intervie_32.php Interview with Mr. Mazria&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Mazria closed his architecture practice in 2006 and is currently the Founder and CEO of Architecture 2030,&lt;ref&gt;http://architecture2030.org/&lt;/ref&gt; a think tank developing real-world solutions for 21st century problems including the AIA+2030 Professional Education Series,&lt;ref&gt;http://aiaplus2030.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 2030 Palette, China Accord, and the 2030 Districts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.2030districts.org/&lt;/ref&gt; movement in North American cities. He developed the “Roadmap to Zero Emissions”&lt;ref&gt;http://architecture2030.org/initiatives/roadmap-to-zero/&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently working with cities across the U.S. to develop pathways for “zero” to “80%” greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2050.

==Published work==
His published material includes technical papers, articles for professional magazines, and a number of published works including the following:
*The Passive Solar Energy Book, Rodale Press 1979
*It’s the Architecture Stupid!, [[American Solar Energy Society#SOLAR TODAY|Solar Today]] Magazine, May/June 2003
*Turning Down the Global Thermostat, [[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]], October 2003
*Blueprint for Disaster, On Earth Magazine, Summer 2005

His building designs have been published in [[Architecture (magazine)|Architecture]], Progressive Architecture, Metropolis, [[Architectural Record]], [[Landscape Architecture (magazine)|Landscape Architecture]], [[Architectural Digest]], Process, Kenchiku Bunka, Public Garden, Solar Today, [[ArchitectureWeek]], Texas Architect, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Recent work==
Most recently Mazria has reshaped the national and international dialogue on [[global warming]] to incorporate building design and the “Building Sector”. His research includes U.S. and global building sector analysis and [[greenhouse gas]] [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] strategies.

He is the architect of both the AIA’s position statement and the [[United States Conference of Mayors|U.S. Conference of Mayor]]’s Resolution #50 adopting the “2030 Challenge” as a means of dramatically reducing building sector greenhouse gas emissions. His report, "Roadmap to Zero Emissions" submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, outlines his strategy for addressing what he believes is today’s most pressing global challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalofcommerce.com/article/id32377 Article about Mr. Mazria&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of Architecture 2030,&lt;ref&gt;http://architecture2030.org/&lt;/ref&gt; a climate change organization. He currently speaks nationally and internationally on the subject of climate change and the built environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">ELRA (European Land Registry Association) is an International association without lucrative purpose (AISBL: Association internationale sans but lucratif) which mission and primary purpose is  “the development and understanding of the role of land registration in real property and capital markets”.&lt;ref name="ELRA web"&gt;[http://www.elra.eu/ ELRA web]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The European Land Registry Association was born on 2004 to defend the interest of Land Registries in the [[European Union]]. Initially it started off with 12 members and it now has 30 organizations representing the land registries of 22 Member States.&lt;ref name="ELRA web" /&gt;

== History ==

{{Empty section|date=November 2014}}

== ELRA Board of Director ==
ELRA’s internal organisation includes the following organs:&lt;ref name="ELRA web" /&gt;
* General Assembly
* President
* Secretary General
* Treasurer

== Projects ==

=== CROBECO ===

=== IMOLA ===
The project aims to produce a model for standardised [[Land Registry|land registry]] output, connected to explanatory material in different languages, and to provide training to improve understanding of the different legal systems involved. The European Land Registry Association (ELRA) will work closely with other associations and networks working in this area. It will use the resources of ELRA’s [[European Land Registry Network]](ELRN) and build on the experience gained from [[EULIS]]’s Project LINE (a project which aims to facilitate compliance with the requirements of the e-Justice programme in the area of land registration).&lt;br /&gt;
The objective is to increase the accessibility and transparency of land registry information and to facilitate the registration of cross-border documents. Varied legislation and practices of [[Land Registry|Land Registries]] hamper the exchange of information between them and the registration of cross border documents. Any standard model has to take into account fundamental differences in national organisation. However, common points offer the possibility of defining a structure of key information shared by the majority of [[Land Registration|Land Registry systems]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8577">[[File:Cristina Fernandez, Gran Cuñado.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Martín Bossi]] parodies the Argentine president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], next to TV host [[Marcelo Tinelli]].]]
'''Gran Cuñado''' (in Spanish, "Big Brother-in-law") was a segment of the TV program from Argentina [[Showmatch]], hosted by [[Marcelo Tinelli]]. It had 19 participants, began broadcasting on 11 May 2009 with a 31.9 rating and a peak of 46 points. The program consisted of a series of comedians characterized as Argentina's [[Politics of Argentina|most prominent politicians]], including parodies of various clichés. With those imitators they made a parody of the reality show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', especially the stay of participants in a "house" where he pretended to live, and a regular nomination process through which one participant was eliminated at a time. The triumph belonged to the imitation of [[Francisco de Narváez]], by Roberto Peña.

The program was broadcast for much of the electoral campaign for the [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|legislative elections in Argentina in 2009]] and given its huge success several media suggested that it influenced to some degree its development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html El efecto de Gran Cuñado sobre la intención de voto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627112321/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html |date=2009-06-27 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the parodied political made statements on the program, and some even visited it in person.

==Description==
The imitations of politicians were made by various comedians of the program, disguised in ways that grotesquely mimicked the look of major Argentine politicians of the time. The scripts were written by cartoonist [[Cristian Dzwonik]], known as "Nik". Their dialogues and behaviors were based on clichés made from well-known events or quotes of them. For example, the imitation of former president [[Néstor Kirchner]] frequently used the phrase "¿Qué te pasa Clarín, estás nervioso?!" ("What's wrong Clarin, you're nervous?!"), reflecting the conflict between the Argentine government and [[Grupo Clarín]]. The specific phrase was used several times by Kirchner during a ceremony in the town of [[Tres de Febrero Partido|Tres de Febrero]], shortly after his defeat in the elections at [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/03/10/elpais/p-01874162.htm Molesto por el impacto electoral, Kirchner apuntó contra la prensa] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodecuyo.com.ar/home/new_noticia.php?noticia_id=331481 Kirchner, contra Clarín tras comicios adversos] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example, one of the first commercials by [[Francisco de Narváez]] used the slogan "votame, votate" ("Vote me, vote yourself") which prompted his imitator to use other verbs in verbal forms like, or even the phrase "Alica, Alicate" that sounds similar in Spanish.

The imitations were developed in two main contexts, the "house" and nominations; both parodies of similar procedures performed in the reality show ''Big Brother''. The house showed politicians in a simulated environment of everyday life, where all of them would live together. There were discussions taking place, parties, jokes among politicians, etc. The house was also the place where it was announced which politics were nominated out of it and which ones were not, which was used to show various reactions.

Groups of participants were nominated for eviction and viewer could vote by phone to decide who should "leave the house" and cease to be part of the program.

One of the drawbacks of the format of the program was that some politicians (like [[Cristina Fernandez]] and [[Mauricio Macri|Macri]]) were played by the same comedian, which prevented both being used simultaneously. This was resolved by not nominating politicians in this situation at the same time (the composition of the groups nominated was not controllable by the public), and using an extra actor in the house without speech lines assigned.

The group of politicians elected in the beginning did not include [[Gabriela Michetti]] or [[Fernando Solanas|Pino Solanas]], who achieved notoriety soon after. The program office decided to include imitation by Anita Martinez and Toti Ciliberto respectively, but only for scenes in the house without incorporating them into the system of nominations. It was also included an imitation of Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], the only non-Argentine politician parodied in the program.

==Political opinions==
"Gran Cuñado" generated a stir in the real political world, and several leaders expressed positive or negative opinions about the program. Minister [[Anibal Fernandez]] criticized the parody of President Cristina Fernandez, arguing that "In some ways I think there were excesses, should be regulated because it is the President, and other things, was very successful: we must be fair to those things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1127534-gran-cunado-sigue-desvelando-a-los-politicos|title= "Gran Cuñado" sigue desvelando a los políticos|trans-title="Gran Cuñado stills concerns the politicians|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 13, 2009|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after he recanted on the use of the word "regulate", but insisted that the presidential parody should be removed from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1128516-anibal-fernandez-sugirio-sacar-a-la-presidenta-del-programa-de-tinelli|title= Aníbal Fernández sugirió sacar a la Presidenta del programa de Tinelli|trans-title=Aníbal Fernández suggested to remove the president from Tinelli's program|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 15, 2009|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vice President, [[Julio Cobos]], was also uncomfortable with his respective parody, considering that it portrays him as indecisive or hesitant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1127870 La imitación que irrita a Cobos] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Néstor Kirchner had no opinion on the program, arguing that he never saw it.&lt;ref name="reacciones"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1127258 Los dirigentes se divirtieron con las imitaciones de los cómicos] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, opposition leaders De Narvaez, Elisa Carrio and Macri took the program with humor.&lt;ref name="reacciones"/&gt;

Other criticisms leveled against the program did not target the program itself but its impact on society, criticizing that in an election campaign imitations in Gran Cuñado were an issue of debate more discussed than the political projects of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1141009 La sátira que desnuda un vacío de ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706081607/http://m.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1141009 |date=2011-07-06 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invited politicians===
[[File:De Narvaez at Gran Cuñado.jpg|thumb|Real [[Francisco de Narváez]] dancing with his imitator.]]
In the early days of the start of the program Francisco de Narvaez met his imitator on the program "Intrusos". The success of that meeting led to a new variant that was added to the program: the "Right of Reply", in which politicians wishing to do so could be invited to attend and interact with their imitators or imitations of the other politicians.

The first politician to appear on the agenda was, again, de Narvaez, on June 4. He was followed four days later by the rural leader [[Alfredo de Angeli]], along with his brother. On 11 and 15 June were presented Kirchner politicians [[Sergio Massa]] and [[Daniel Scioli]]. On 16, 18 and 22 was the turn of "Unión PRO" politicians Felipe Sola, Gabriela Michetti and Mauricio Macri, who played a song of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. The last one was [[Carlos Alberto Reutemann]] on 23 June. Until the electoral ban began at midnight June 25, it was speculated that Néstor Kirchner would perform in the program, but there was only a phone call.

There were no appearances of politicians after the election, but telephone contact. De Narvaez, Macri and Sola were contacted on 29 June after his victory, and the last day of the program.

The '''Imperial Diet''' ({{lang-la|Dieta Imperii/Comitium Imperiale}}; {{lang-de|Reichstag}}) was the deliberative body of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It was not a [[legislative body]] in the contemporary sense; its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe siècle'', Honoré Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Its members were the [[Imperial Estate]]s, divided into three colleges. The [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] as a permanent, regularized institution evolved from the ''[[Hoftag]]e'' (court assemblies) of the [[Middle Ages]]. From 1663 until the end of the empire in 1806, it was in [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|permanent session]] at [[Regensburg]].

The Imperial Estates had, according to [[Feudalism|feudal law]], no authority above them besides the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (or emperor-elect) himself. The holding of an Imperial Estate entitled one to a vote in the diet. Thus, an individual member might have multiple votes and votes in different colleges. In general, members did not attend the permanent diet at Regensburg, but sent representatives instead. The late imperial diet was in effect a permanent meeting of ambassadors between the Estates.

== History ==
The precise role and function of the Imperial Diet changed over the centuries, as did the Empire itself, in that the estates and separate territories gained more and more control of their own affairs at the expense of imperial power. Initially, there was neither a fixed time nor location for the Diet. It started as a convention of the [[duke]]s of the old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes that formed the [[Francia|Frankish kingdom]] when important decisions had to be made, and was probably based on the old Germanic law whereby each leader relied on the support of his leading men. For example, already under Emperor [[Charlemagne]] during the [[Saxon Wars]], the Diet, according to the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], met at [[Paderborn]] in 777 and officially determined laws concerning the subdued [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxons]] and other tribes. In 803, the Frankish emperor issued the final version of the [[Lex Saxonum]].

At the Diet of 919 in [[Fritzlar]] the dukes elected the first [[List of German monarchs|King of the Germans]], who was a Saxon, [[Henry the Fowler]], thus overcoming the longstanding rivalry between Franks and Saxons and laying the foundation for the German realm. After the conquest of [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]], the 1158 [[Diet of Roncaglia]] finalized four laws that would significantly alter the (never formally written) [[constitution]] of the Empire, marking the beginning of the steady decline of the central power in favour of the local dukes. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] cemented the concept of "territorial rule" (''Landesherrschaft''), the largely independent rule of the dukes over their respective territories, and also limited the number of electors to seven. The Pope, contrary to modern myth, was never involved in the electoral process but only in the process of ratification and coronation of whomever the Prince-Electors chose.

[[File:Luther (Wislicenus).jpg|thumb|300px|"Here I stand": [[Martin Luther]] at the [[Diet of Worms]], 1521&lt;br&gt;19th-century painting by [[Hermann Wislicenus]]]]
However, until the late 15th century, the Diet was not actually formalized as an institution. Instead, the dukes and other princes would irregularly convene at the court of the Emperor; these assemblies were usually referred to as ''[[Hoftag]]e'' (from German ''Hof'' "court"). Only beginning in 1489 was the Diet called the ''Reichstag'', and it was formally divided into several ''collegia'' ("colleges"). Initially, the two colleges were that of the [[prince-elector]]s and that of the other dukes and princes. Later, the [[free imperial city|imperial cities]], that is, cities that had [[Imperial immediacy]] and were oligarchic republics independent of a local ruler that were subject only to the Emperor himself, managed to be accepted as a third party.

Several attempts to reform the Empire and end its slow disintegration, notably starting with the [[Diet of 1495]], did not have much effect. In contrast, this process was only hastened with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, which formally bound the Emperor to accept all decisions made by the Diet, in effect depriving him of his few remaining powers. From then to its end in 1806, the Empire was not much more than a collection of largely independent states.

Probably the most famous Diets were those held in [[Diet of Worms|Worms]] in 1495, where the [[Imperial Reform]] was enacted, and [[Diet of Worms|1521]], where [[Martin Luther]] was banned (see [[Edict of Worms]]), the Diets of [[Speyer]] [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|1526]] and [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|1529]] (see  [[Protestation at Speyer]]), and several in [[Nuremberg]] ([[Diet of Nuremberg]]). Only with the introduction of the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]] in 1663 did the Diet permanently convene in a fixed location.

The Imperial Diet of Constance opened on 27 April 1507;&lt;ref&gt;History of the Reformation in Germany, page 70, by Leopold von Ranke.&lt;/ref&gt; it recognized the unity of the Holy Roman Empire and founded the Imperial Chamber, the empire’s supreme court.

== Participants ==
Since 1489, the Diet comprised three colleges:

=== Electors ===
[[File:Wapen 1545 Kaiserwappen des Heiligen Römischen Reichs Polychromie.jpg|thumb|200px|Coats of arms of prince electors surround the Holy Roman Emperor's; from flags book of [[Jacob Köbel]] (1545).]]
The [[Electoral college]] (''Kurfürstenrat''), led by the [[Electorate of Mainz|Prince-Archbishop of Mainz]] in his capacity as [[Archchancellor]] of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The seven Prince-electors were designated by the Golden Bull of 1356:
* three ecclesiastical [[Prince-Bishop]]s,
** the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz as Archchancellor of Germany
** the [[Electorate of Cologne|Prince-Archbishop of Cologne]] as Archchancellor of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]
** the [[Electorate of Trier|Prince-Archbishop of Trier]] as Archchancellor of [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]]
*four secular Princes,
** the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] as [[Cup-bearer|Archcupbearer]]
** the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Elector of the Palatinate]] as [[Steward (office)|Archsteward]] (''Erztruchsess'')
** the [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] as [[Marshal|Archmarshal]]
** the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]] as [[Chamberlain (office)|Archchamberlain]]

The number increased to eight, when in 1623 the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]] took over the electoral dignity of the Count Palatine, who himself received a separate vote in the electoral college according to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] (''Causa Palatina''), including the high office of an [[Treasurer|Archtreasurer]]. In 1692 the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (Hannover) became the ninth Prince-elector as Archbannerbearer during the [[Nine Years' War]].

In the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]], the electoral dignities of the Palatinate and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] were merged, approved by the 1779 [[Treaty of Teschen]]. The [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 entailed the dissolution of the Cologne and Trier Prince-archbishoprics, the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz and German Archchancellor received—as compensation for his lost territory occupied by [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]]—the newly established [[Principality of Regensburg]]. In turn, four secular princes were elevated to prince-electors:
* the [[Electorate of Salzburg|Duke of Salzburg]]
* the [[Electorate of Württemberg|Duke of Württemberg]]
* the [[Electorate of Baden|Margrave of Baden]]
* the [[Electorate of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]]
These changes however had little effect, as with the abdication of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] as Holy Roman Emperor the Empire was dissolved only three years later.

=== Princes ===
The college of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Princes]] (''Reichsfürstenrat'' or ''Fürstenbank'') incorporated the [[Imperial Count]]s as well as [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] lords, [[Prince-Bishop]]s and [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbots]]. Strong in members, though often discordant, the second college tried to preserve its interests against the dominance of the Prince-electors.

The House of Princes was again subdivided into an ecclesiastical and a secular bench. Remarkably, the ecclesiastical bench was headed by the—secular—[[Archduchy of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] and the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] duke of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] (held by [[Habsburg Spain]] from 1556). As the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]] had failed to assume the leadership of the secular bench, they received the guidance over the ecclesiastical princes instead. The first ecclesiastical prince was the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as ''[[Primas Germaniae]]''; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besançon|Prince-Archbishop of Besançon]], though officially a member until the 1678 [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], did not attend the Diet's meetings.

The ecclesiastical bench also comprised the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] and ''Deutschmeister'' of the [[Teutonic Knights]], as well as the [[Prior|Grand Prior]] of the Monastic State of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] at [[Heitersheim]]. The [[Bishopric of Lübeck|Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck]] remained an ecclesiastical member even after it had turned [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]], ruled by [[diocesan administrator]]s from the [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|House of Holstein-Gottorp]] from 1586. The [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück]], according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia was under alternating rule of a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] bishop and a Lutheran bishop from the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

Each member of the Princes' College held either a single vote (''Virilstimme'') or a collective vote (''Kuriatstimme''). Due to the Princes, their single vote from 1582 strictly depended on their immediate fiefs; this principle led to an accumulation of votes, when one ruler held several territories in [[personal union]]. Counts and Lords only were entitled to collective votes, they therefore formed separate colleges like the [[Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts]] and mergers within the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian]], the [[Franconian Circle|Franconian]] and the [[Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle]]s. Likewise, on the ecclesiastical bench, the Imperial abbots joined a Swabian or [[Rhine|Rhenish]] college.

In the German Mediatisation of 1803, numerous ecclesiastical territories were annexed by secular estates. A reform of the Princes' college was however not carried out until the Empire's dissolution in 1806.

=== Cities ===
The college of [[Free imperial city|Imperial Cities]] (''Reichsstädtekollegium'') evolved from 1489 onwards, it contributed greatly to the development of the Imperial Diets as a political institution. Nevertheless, the collective vote of the cities initially was of inferior importance until a 1582 [[Recess (Holy Roman Empire)|Recess]] of the [[Diet of Augsburg|Augsburg Diet]]. The college was led by the city council of the actual venue; with the implementation of the Perpetual Diet in 1663, the chair passed to [[Regensburg]].

The Imperial cities also divided into a Swabian and Rhenish bench. The Swabian cities were led by [[Nuremberg]], [[Augsburg]] and Regensburg, the Rhenish cities by [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]] and [[Frankfurt]].

For a complete list of members of the Imperial Diet from 1792, near the end of the Empire, see [[List of Reichstag participants (1792)]].

== Religious bodies ==

After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], religious matters could no longer be decided by a majority vote of the colleges.  Instead, the Reichstag would separate into Catholic and Protestant bodies, which would discuss the matter separately and then negotiate an agreement with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace Treaties of Westphalia (October 14/24, 1648)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/87.%20PeaceWestphalia_en.pdf|website=German History in Documents and Images|quote=In religious and all other affairs in which the estates cannot be considered as one body, and when the Catholic estates and those of the Augsburg Confession are divided into two parties, the dispute is to be decided by amicable agreement alone, and neither side is to be bound by a majority vote.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Catholic body, or ''corpus catholicum'', was headed by the Archbishop-Elector of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]].&lt;ref name="kalipke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalipke|first=Andreas|chapter=The Corpus Evangelicorum|title=The Holy Roman Empire, Reconsidered|year=2010|publisher=Berghahn|pages=228–247|editors=Coy, Marschke, and Sabean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant body, or ''[[corpus evangelicorum]]'', was headed by the Elector of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]].  At meetings of the Protestant body, Saxony would introduce each topic of discussion, after which [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Electorate of Brunswick-Luneburg|Hanover]] would speak, followed by the remaining states in order of size.  When all the states had spoken, Saxony would weigh the votes and announce a consensus.

[[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony]] converted to Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland, but the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant and retained the directorship of the Protestant body.  When [[Augustus III of Poland|the Elector's son]] also converted to Catholicism, Prussia and Hanover attempted to take over the directorship in 1717–1720, but without success.  The Electors of Saxony would head the Protestant body until the end of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="kalipke"/&gt;

== Collection of records ==
After the formation of the new [[German Empire]] in 1871, the Historical Commission of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]] started to collect imperial records (''Reichsakten'') and imperial diet records (''Reichstagsakten''). In 1893 the commission published the first volume. At present the years 1524–1527 and years up to 1544 are being collected and researched. A volume dealing with the 1532 Diet of Regensburg, including the peace negotiations with the [[Protestants]] in [[Schweinfurt]] and [[Nuremberg]], by [[Rosemarie Aulinger]] of [[Vienna]] was published in 1992.

{{Antisemitism}}
'''Jewish Bolshevism''', also '''Judeo–Bolshevism''', is an [[anti-communist]] and [[antisemitic canard]], which alleges that the [[Jews]] were the originators of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and that they held the primary power among the [[Bolsheviks]]. Similarly, the conspiracy theory of '''Jewish Communism'''  implies that Jews have dominated the [[Communist movement]]s in the world, and is related to [[The Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory]] (ZOG), which asserts that Jews control world politics.{{sfn|Alderman|1983}} 

In 1917, after the October revolution, the catchword was the title of the pamphlet, ''The Jewish Bolshevism'', which featured in the racist propaganda of the anti-communist [[White movement]] forces during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–22). The [[Nazi Party]] in Germany and the [[German-American Bund]] in the United States propagated the anti-Semitic theory to their followers, sympathisers, and [[fellow traveller]]s during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher and Geaves, Ron. (2007). “Antisemitism, Conspiracy Culture, Christianity, and Islam: The History and Contemporary Religious Significance of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, ''The Invention of Sacred Tradition'', James R.

The expressions Jewish Bolshevism, Jewish Communism, and the ZOG conspiracy are used as [[far-right]] catchwords for the false assertions that [[Communism]] is a Jewish conspiracy. In Poland, "Judeo-Bolshevism", known as "[[Żydokomuna]]", was an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Krzysztof Szwagrzyk, "Żydzi w kierownictwie UB. Stereotyp czy rzeczywistość?", ''Biuletyn IPN'' (11/2005), pp. 37-42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:WhiteArmyPropagandaPosterOfTrotsky.jpg|thumb|White movement propaganda poster from the [[Russian Civil War]] era (1919), a caricature of [[Leon Trotsky]], who was viewed as a symbol of Jewish Bolshevism.&lt;ref name="Plokhy2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Serhii Plokhy|title=The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm0uCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223%C2%B7|date=1 December 2015|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-07394-8|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The conflation of Jews and revolution emerged in the atmosphere of destruction of [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russia during World War I]]. When the [[October Revolution|revolutions of 1917]] crippled Russia's war effort, conspiracy theories developed far from Berlin and Petrograd. Many Britons for example ascribed the Russian Revolution to an "apparent conjunction of Bolsheviks, Germans and Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin (2009) pp. 247-248.&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
The worldwide spread of the concept in the 1920s is associated with the publication and circulation of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', a fraudulent document that purported to describe a secret Jewish conspiracy aimed at world domination. The expression made an issue out of the Jewishness of some leading Bolsheviks (such as [[Leon Trotsky]]) during and after the October Revolution. [[Daniel Pipes]] said that "primarily through ''the Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', the [[White movement|Whites]] spread these charges to an international audience."{{sfn|Pipes|1997|p=93}} [[James Webb (historian)|James Webb]] wrote that it is rare to find an antisemitic source after 1917 that "does not stand in debt to the [[White Emigre|White Russian]] analysis of the Revolution."{{sfn|Webb|1976|p=295}}

==Jewish involvement in Russian Communism==

{{Main article|History of the Jews in Russia|History of the Jews in the Soviet Union}}
[[Antisemitism in the Russian Empire]] existed both culturally and institutionally. The Jews were restricted to live within the [[Pale of Settlement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who could live outside the Pale of Settlement?|url=http://jewishfamilysearch.com/pale-of-settlement/|website=Jewish Family Search|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  suffered [[pogrom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Jewish History: Pogroms|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/pogroms.html|website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] (The Gale Group)|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Triumph of Survival: The Story of the Jews in the Modern Era 1650-1990|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=11f9xBbOBBEC|publisher = Mesorah Publications|date = 1990-09-01|isbn = 9780899064987|first = Berel|last = Wein|page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1881 and 1920, more than two million Jews left Russia.&lt;ref name="FP_PAE"&gt;[http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/english/39.html Political Activity and Emigration.] Beyond the Pale. The History of Jews in Russia. (Exhibition by Joke Kniesmeyer and Daniel Cil Brecher)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many Jews supported gradual or revolutionary changes within the [[Russian Empire]]. Those movements ranged from the far left ([[Jewish Anarchism]],&lt;ref&gt;Goncharok, Moshe. ''Century of Will: Russian Anarchism and Jews (XIX-XX Centuries)''. Jerusalem: Mishmeret Shalom, 1996. http://makhno.ru/lit/vek_voli/3.php {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Bundists]], [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]], [[Mensheviks]]{{sfn|Levin|1988|p=13}}) to moderate left ([[Trudoviks]]{{sfn|Ascher|1992|p=148}}) and constitutionalist ([[Constitutional Democratic Party|Constitutional Democrats]]{{sfn|Witte|24 March 1907}}) parties. On the eve of the [[February Revolution]] in 1917, of about 23,000 members of the [[Bolshevik]] party, 364 (about 1.6%) were known to be ethnic Jews.&lt;ref name="FP_PAE"/&gt; According to the 1922 Bolshevik party census, there were 19,564 Jewish Bolsheviks, comprising 5.21% of the total, and in the 1920s of the 417 members of the Central Executive Committee, the party Central Committee, the Presidium of the Executive of the Soviets of the USSR and the Russian Republic, the People's Commissars, 6% were ethnic Jews.{{sfn|Herf|2008|p=96}} Between 1936 and 1940, during the [[Great Purge]], [[Yezhovshchina]] and after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|rapprochement with Nazi Germany]], Stalin had largely eliminated Jews from senior party, government, diplomatic, security and military positions.{{sfn|Levin|1988|pp=318-325}}

Some scholars have grossly exaggerated Jewish presence in the Soviet Communist Party. For example, British journalist [[David Aaronovitch]] quotes [[Alfred Jensen (slavist)|Alfred Jensen]] as saying that in the 1920s "75 per cent of the leading Bolsheviks" were "of Jewish origin".{{Better source|Info = Let's use a direct quote from works of Alfred Jensen instead.|date=November 2015}} According to Aaronovitch, "a cursory examination of membership of the top committees shows this figure to be an absurd exaggeration".&lt;ref name=past&gt;{{cite web|last=Aaronovitch|first=David|title=Our Jewish Communist past|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/columnists/55272/our-jewish-communist-past|work=September 23, 2011|publisher=RSS     Twitter     Facebook     Archives     Subscribe     S &amp; P     About  THE JEWISH CHRONICLE ONLINE|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
[[File:1.2 The Jewish Bolshevism Image.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Karl Radek]], [[Julius Martov]], and [[Emma Goldman]]. Caricatures of [[Bolshevik]] leaders from [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]'']]
[[Walter Laqueur]] traces the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory to Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]], for whom Bolshevism was "the revolt of the Jewish, Slavic and [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] against the German ([[Aryan]]) element in Russia". Germans, according to Rosenberg, had been responsible for Russia's historic achievements and had been sidelined by the Bolsheviks, who did not represent the interests of the Russian people, but instead those of its ethnic Jewish and Chinese population.{{sfn|Laqueur|1990|pp=33-34}}

Michael Kellogg in his Ph.D. thesis argues that the racist ideology of Nazis was to a significant extent influenced by [[White emigre]]s in Germany, many of whom, while being former subjects of the Russian Empire, were of non-Russian descent: ethnic Germans, residents of Baltic lands, including Baltic Germans, and Ukrainians. Of particular role was their ''Aufbau'' organization (Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung für den Osten (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organization for the East). For example, its leader was instrumental in making the ''Protocols of The Elders of Zion'' available in German language. He argues that early Hitler was rather [[philosemitic]], and became rabidly anti-Semitic since 1919 under the influence of the White emigre convictions about the conspiracy of the Jews, an unseen unity from financial capitalists to Bolsheviks, to conquer the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kellogg, ''The Russian Roots of Nazism - White Émigrés and the Making of National Socialism, 1917–1945'', New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. xiv + 327 pp., {{ISBN|978-0-521-84512-0}} ([http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511079498&amp;ss=exc Introduction])&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, his conclusion is that White emigres were at the source of the Nazi concept of Jewish Bolshevism. Annemarie Sammartino argues that this view is contestable. While there is no doubt that White emigres were instrumental in reinforcing the idea of 'Jewish Bolshevism' among Nazis, the concept is also found in many German early post–World War I documents. Also, Germany had its own share of Jewish Communists "to provide fodder for the paranoid fantasies of German antisemites" without Russian Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12282 "A review by Annemarie Sammartino "] of Michael Kellogg's  ''The Russian Roots of Nazism''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, Hitler declared that the mission of the Nazi movement was to destroy "Jewish Bolshevism".{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=257}} Hitler asserted that the "three vices" of "Jewish Marxism" were democracy, pacifism and internationalism,{{sfn|1999|p=303}} and that the Jews were behind Bolshevism, communism and Marxism.{{sfn|1999|p=259}}

In [[Nazi Germany]], this concept of Jewish Bolshevism reflected a common perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led movement seeking world domination from its origin. The term was popularized in print in German journalist [[Dietrich Eckhart]]'s 1924 pamphlet "Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin" ("Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin") which depicted [[Moses]] and Lenin as both being Communists and Jews. This was followed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s 1923 edition of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925, which saw Bolshevism as "Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself."

According to French spymaster and writer [[Henri Rollin]], "Hitlerism" was based on "anti-Soviet counter-revolution" promoting the "myth of a mysterious Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik plot", entailing that the [[First World War]] had been instigated by a vast Jewish-Masonic conspiracy to topple the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires and implement Bolshevism by fomenting liberal ideas.{{sfn|Kellogg|2008}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}

A major source for [[propaganda]] about Jewish Bolshevism in the 1930s and early 1940s was the pro-Nazi and antisemitic international ''Welt-Dienst'' news agency founded in 1933 by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].

Within the German Army, a tendency to see Soviet Communism as a Jewish conspiracy had grown since the First World War, something that became officialized under the Nazis. A 1932 pamphlet by [[Ewald Banse]] of the Government-financed German National Association for the Military Sciences described the Soviet leadership as mostly Jewish, dominating an apathetic and mindless Russian population.{{sfn|Förster|2005|p=119}}

[[File:German antisemitic and anti-Soviet poster.JPG|thumb|upright|German propaganda antisemitic and anti-Soviet poster, written in Polish language. The text reads “Death! to Jewish-Bolshevik pestilence of murdering!"]]
Propaganda produced in 1935 by the psychological war laboratory of the German War Ministry described Soviet officials as "mostly filthy Jews" and called on [[Red Army]] soldiers to rise up and kill their "Jewish commissars". This material was not used at the time, but served as a basis for propaganda in the 1940s.{{sfn|Förster|2005|pp=122-127}}

Members of the SS were encouraged to fight against the "Jewish Bolshevik sub-humans". In the pamphlet ''The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization'', published in 1936, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] wrote:

{{quote|We shall take care that never again in Germany, the heart of Europe, will the Jewish-Bolshevistic revolution of subhumans be able to be kindled either from within or through emissaries from without.{{sfn|Himmler|1936|p=8}}}}

In his speech to the ''Reichstag'' justifying [[Operation Barbarossa]] in 1941, Hitler said:

{{quote|For more than two decades the Jewish Bolshevik regime in Moscow had tried to set fire not merely to Germany but to all of Europe…The Jewish Bolshevik rulers in Moscow have unswervingly undertaken to force their domination upon us and the other European nations and that is not merely spiritually, but also in terms of military power…Now the time has come to confront the plot of the Anglo-Saxon Jewish war-mongers and the equally Jewish rulers of the Bolshevik centre in Moscow!{{sfn|Hillgruber|1987}}}}

Field-Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] gave an order on 12 September 1941 which declared: "the struggle against Bolshevism demands ruthless and energetic, rigorous action above all against the Jews, the main carriers of Bolshevism.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=465}}

Historian [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that Wehrmacht officers regarded the Russians as "sub-human", and were from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939 telling their troops the war was caused by "Jewish vermin", explaining to the troops that the war against the Soviet Union was a war to wipe out what were variously described as "Jewish Bolshevik subhumans", the "Mongol hordes", the "Asiatic flood" and the "red beast", language clearly intended to produce war crimes by reducing the enemy to something less than human.{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=59-60}}

[[Joseph Goebbels]] published an article in 1942 called "the so-called Russian soul" in which he claimed that Bolshevism was exploiting the [[Slavs]] and that the battle of the Soviet Union determined whether Europe would become under complete control by international Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/goeb11.htm|title=Goebbels on the Soviet Union (July, 1942)|author=|date=|work=calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi propaganda presented Barbarossa as an ideological-racial war between German National Socialism and "Judeo-Bolshevism", dehumanising the Soviet enemy as a force of Slavic ''[[Untermensch]]'' (sub-humans) and "Asiatic" savages engaging in "barbaric Asiatic fighting methods" commanded by evil Jewish commissars whom German troops were to grant no mercy.{{sfn|Förster|2005|p=126}} The vast majority of the Wehrmacht officers and soldiers tended to regard the war in Nazi terms, seeing their Soviet opponents as sub-human.{{sfn|Förster|2005|p=127}}

==Outside Nazi Germany==

===Great Britain, 1920s===

In the early 1920s, a leading British antisemite, [[Henry Hamilton Beamish]], stated that Bolshevism was the same thing as Judaism.{{sfn|Webb|1976|p=130}} In the same decade, future wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] penned an editorial entitled "Zionism versus Bolshevism," which was published in the ''[[Illustrated Sunday Herald]]''. In the article, which asserted that [[Zionism]] and Bolshevism were engaged in a "struggle for the soul of the Jewish people", he called on Jews to repudiate "the Bolshevik conspiracy" and make clear that "the Bolshevik movement is not a Jewish movement" but stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bolshevism] among the Jews is nothing new. From the days of [[Adam Weishaupt|Spartacus-Weishaupt]] to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), [[Bela Kun]] (Hungary), [[Rosa Luxemburg]] (Germany), and [[Emma Goldman]] (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing.{{sfn|Churchill|8 February 1920}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author [[Gisela C. Lebzelter]] noted that Churchill's analysis failed to analyze the role that Russian oppression of Jews had played in their joining various revolutionary movements, but instead "to inherent inclinations rooted in Jewish character and religion."{{sfn|Lebzelter|1978|p=181}}

==Works propagating the Jewish Bolshevism canard==

===''The Jewish Bolshevism''===
''The Jewish Bolshevism'' is a 31- or 32-page [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] pamphlet published in London in 1922 and 1923 by the [[Britons Publishing Society]]. It included a foreword by the German [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] who promulgated the concept of "Jewish Bolshevism".

This relatively obscure publication embodies the Nazi doctrine that "[[Jews|Jewishness]]" and [[Bolshevism]] are the same; or that Bolshevism is Jewish, whether everything Jewish is included within Bolshevism. The methodology used consists of identifying Bolsheviks as Jews; by birth, or by name or by [[demographics]].

According to Singerman, ''The Jewish Bolshevism'', which he dubs as item "0121" in his Bibliography, is "Identical in content to item "0120", the pamphlet ''The Grave Diggers of Russia'', which was published in 1921 in Germany, by Dr. [[E. Boepple]].  In 1922, historian [[Gisela C. Lebzelter]] wrote: "The Britons published a brochure entitled Jewish Bolshevism, which featured drawings of Russian leaders supplemented by brief comments on their Jewish descent and affiliation.

==Criticism of the Jewish Bolshevism canard==
Researchers in the field, such as Polish philosopher [[Stanisław Krajewski]]&lt;ref name="Jews, Communists and Jewish Communists, in Poland, Europe and Beyond"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krajewski|first=Stanislaw|authorlink=Stanisław Krajewski|title=Jews, Communists and Jewish Communists, in Poland, Europe and Beyond|url=http://covenant.idc.ac.il/en/vol1/issue3/Jews-Communists-and-Jewish-Communists.html|accessdate=October 2007|journal=Covenant|volume=1|issue=3|date=October 2007}}, originally in a CEU annual Jewish Studies at the Central European University, ed. by Andras Kovacs, co-editor Eszter Andor, CEU 2000, 119-133&lt;/ref&gt; or André Gerrits,{{sfn|Gerrits|2009|p=195}} denounce the concept of Jewish Bolshevism as a prejudice. Law professor [[Ilya Somin]] agrees, and compares Jewish involvement in other communist countries. "Overrepresentation of a group in a political movement does not prove either that the movement was "dominated" by that group or that it primarily serves that group’s interests. The idea that communist oppression was somehow Jewish in nature is belied by the record of communist regimes in countries like [[China]], [[North Korea]], and [[Cambodia]], where the Jewish presence was and is minuscule."&lt;ref name="Communism and the Jews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Somin|first=Ilya|title=Communism and the Jews|url=http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/29/communism-and-the-jews/|newspaper=The Volokh Conspiracy|date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kanak Socialist Liberation''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Libération Kanak Socialiste}}, LKS) is a [[Kanak people|Kanak]] [[Secession|pro-independence]] and socialist political party in [[New Caledonia]], led by [[Nidoïsh Naisseline]].

==History==
The LKS was founded by a split in the [[Party of Kanak Liberation]] (Palika) in 1981. The most radical members of Palika, which had been the base of the party since its creation, walked out criticizing the Palika's increasing moderation and increasing links with the metropolitan [[French Socialist Party]] (PS). Led by Nidoïsh Naisseline, a [[Marxist]], it also refused to support [[Rock Pidjot]] of the [[Caledonian Union]] in the 1981 elections. However, the LKS moderated and it did not participate in the [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front|FLNKS]]-led electoral boycotts in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the party even started co-operating with the anti-independence [[Rally for Caledonia in the Republic]] (RPCR) in the [[Loyalty Islands]]. Thanks to this alliance, Nidoïsh Naisseline was president of the islands between 1995 and 1999. During this time, the LKS adopted a platform in favour of [[Associated state|independence-association]] and started early negotiations with the loyalists while the FLNKS refused talks until a mining dispute in the [[North Province, New Caledonia|North]] had been settled. The alliance with the RPCR ended in 2004, but the LKS has remained close to anti-independence parties, notably [[Future Together]]. In fact, Christiane Gambey, a member of Future Together, is also a member of the LKS.  {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Platform==
The LKS supports the [[Nouméa Accord]] but wishes to renegotiate certain parts of it, such as replacing the collegial government (which is in practice a perpetual [[grand coalition]] between loyalists and nationalists) by a fixed government pulling its support from a fixed majority in Congress. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Electoral results==
In the latest [[New Caledonian legislative election, 2009|legislative elections]] of 9 May 2009, it won 1.92% of the popular vote, and 1 out of 54 seats in the [[Congress of New Caledonia]]. It has two seats in the [[Loyalty Islands]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1864">The '''Labour Leader's Office Fund''' was a [[blind trust]] established and run by [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Lord Levy]] to finance [[Tony Blair]]'s work in opposition before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]]. Contributors to it included the [[millionaire]]s [[Trevor Chinn|Sir Trevor Chinn]], [[Emmanuel Kaye|Sir Emmanuel Kaye]], [[Alex Bernstein]] and [[Bob Gavron]], the latter two of whom later received [[peerage]]s.

==Quotes about the fund==

* "While it does not necessarily follow that the scheme was anything other than the model of probity, there is at least an argument that [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] knew its father." —[[David Osler]], author of ''Labour Party PLC: New Labour as a Party of Business''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article351916.ece Michael Levy: Lord Cashpoint - People, News - Independent.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414145609/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article351916.ece |date=2006-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lloyd George was infamous for selling honours in the early 20th century.)&lt;ref&gt;For details see Pinto-Duschinsky, Michael: ''British Political Finance, 1830-1980'', Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1981, pp. 44, 54-58, 86-88, 116-119&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LGBT rights}}

'''Libertarian perspectives on LGBT rights''' illustrate how [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] individuals and [[political party|political parties]] have applied the libertarian philosophy to the subject of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) rights.

== By country ==

=== France ===

====Liberal Alternative====
The [[Liberal Alternative]] party states: "We wish to make marriage a private affair, whether religious or not, composed simply of two consenting adults, without regard for sex, and with no further obligation beyond going to the local magistrate/city hall to notify the state about the union. This form of civil union would replace the [[Pacte civil de solidarité|PACS]] symbolically. Recognition of marriage is, of course, possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternative-liberale.fr/index.php/index.php/programme/libertes-individuelles.html Libertés individuelles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608080329/http://www.alternative-liberale.fr/index.php/index.php/programme/libertes-individuelles.html |date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===

====Libertarians====
[[Libertarianz]]&lt;!--sic--&gt; stated in their platform that the party "fully supports the concept of a civil union and would also support allowing marriages between same sex couples, and indeed polygamous marriages or marriages between people who are already related—in all cases as long as all parties are adults and consenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertarianz.org.nz/?policy=civil_unions|title=Civil Unions|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization ceased to exist in February 2014.

===Russia===

====Libertarian Party of Russia====
The [[Libertarian Party of Russia]] has been one of the most active vocal opponent of the [[LGBT rights in Russia#Bans on "homosexual propaganda"|2013 Russian law banning propaganda of homosexuality among minors]].  Libertarian Party activists have participated in a demonstrations in front of the [[Moscow City Duma]] against the adoption of the law. At a 2012 picket, the Libertarian Party announced its opposition to homophobic laws restricting people's right to freedom of speech.

===United States===
====Anarcho-capitalists====

[[Anarcho-capitalists]] believe in [[stateless society|stateless]] [[voluntary society]], thus oppose any law supporting or opposing LGBT rights. The issue of LGBT rights would be left up individually for people to decide whether to support or oppose LGBT rights. [[Adam Kokesh]] argues LGBT people should be anarcho-capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDwFHppdEHM Why Gays Should Be Libertarian ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libertarian Party====
In 1972 [[John Hospers]], who was widely believed to be gay (although not openly so)&lt;ref&gt;"the Party's first presidential candidate, John Hospers, was gay, though not openly so in a modern sense." (Brian Doherty, [http://reason.com/blog/2013/12/30/slate-wonders-why-libertarian-party-insi ''Reason'', Dec. 30, 2013]).  Retrieved 26 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ran for president of the United States as the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party's]]  first presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Grady|first1=Jane|title=John Hospers obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/13/john-hospers-obituary|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 August 2016|date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/blog/2011/06/13/john-hospers-rip John Hospers, RIP]. Reason. Retrieved 2013-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Ralph Raico]] helped to create the "Libertarian For [[Gay Rights]]" caucus within the party, and subsequently published "Gay Rights: A Libertarian Approach".

The second LGBT rights organization to operate from a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective was the Libertarians for Gay and Lesbian Concerns.  The organization held its first national convention in 1985, and sought to promote libertarianism to LGBT Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap212.htm|title=Walter Wheeler|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Outright Libertarians]] was formed. Outright Libertarians are also affiliated with the Libertarian Party of the United States and takes many of the same position that the Libertarians for Gay and Lesbian Concerns did in the 1980s.

In 2009, the Libertarian Party came out against [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act#House|H.R. 1913]], a purposed [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime bill]] that would add to the federal hate crime [[statute]] the categories of [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], and [[disability]]. The reason the Libertarian Party opposed the purposed hate crimes bill was because it would violate equal justice under the law by creating different classes of victims for the same crime. The Libertarian Party also accused legislators of attempting to buy the support of the LGBT community while still opposing same-sex marriage and repealing [[Don't ask, don't tell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarians-press-congress-on-doma-%E2%80%98don%E2%80%99t%E2%80%99-ask-don%E2%80%99t-tell%E2%80%99 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903023538/http://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarians-press-congress-on-doma-%E2%80%98don%E2%80%99t%E2%80%99-ask-don%E2%80%99t-tell%E2%80%99 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 3, 2009 |title=Libertarians press Congress on DOMA, 'don't' ask, don't tell' |date=August 17, 2009 |accessdate=2013-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Libertarian Party applauded the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision, ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', to strike down Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) as unconstitutional. The Libertarian Party has supported same-sex marriage since its founding in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-applauds-doma-strikedown |title=Libertarian Party applauds DOMA strikedown |publisher=Libertarian Party |date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] of the United States takes the following positions relevant to LGBT rights:&lt;ref name="Platform of the Libertarian Party"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform|work=Libertarian Party|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 1.2 "Expression and Communication":
** We support full freedom of expression and oppose government censorship, regulation or control of communications media and technology. We favor the freedom to engage in or abstain from any religious activities that do not violate the rights of others. We oppose government actions which either aid or attack any religion.
* Section 1.3 "Personal Relationships":
** Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws. Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict personal relationships. Consenting adults should be free to choose their own sexual practices and personal relationships.
* 1.6 Parental Rights":
** Parents, or other guardians, have the right to raise their children according to their own standards and beliefs. This statement shall not be construed to condone child abuse or neglect.
* Section 3.5 "Rights and Discrimination":
** Libertarians embrace the concept that all people are born with certain inherent rights. We reject the idea that a natural right can ever impose an obligation upon others to fulfill that “right.” We condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant. Government should neither deny nor abridge any individual's human right based upon sex, wealth, ethnicity, creed, age, national origin, personal habits, political preference or sexual orientation. Members of private organizations retain their rights to set whatever standards of association they deem appropriate, and individuals are free to respond with ostracism, boycotts and other free-market solutions.
* Section 4.0 "Omissions":
** Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval.

{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}
The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], otherwise known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] ALEC, is a non-profit [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)]] political organization established in 1973 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alec.org/about-alec/history/ American Legislative Exchange Council website]&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative members are state and federal legislators. It is a forum to allow the members to write model laws and discuss legislative language with other members. ALEC meetings are an opportunity for the corporate and non-profit leaders to meet and provide feedback to legislators.  Member legislators can then use these model bills as templates for their own bills.

ALEC's vision statement is "A nonpartisan membership association for conservative state lawmakers who shared a common belief in limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty. Their vision and initiative resulted in the creation of a voluntary membership association for people who believed that government closest to the people was fundamentally more effective, more just, and a better guarantor of freedom than the distant, bloated federal government in Washington, D.C."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALEC.org|url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC keeps its membership, activities and communications confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambert |first=Brian |url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2013/08/alec-declares-itself-exempt-public-disclosure-laws-and-challenged |title=ALEC declares itself exempt from public-disclosure laws, and is challenged |publisher=MinnPost |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This list includes members whose identity primarily has become known through internal documents revealed to [[Common Cause]] and by research by members of the press.

==Task force members==

ALEC presently has 9 task forces to "commission research, publish papers, convene workshops, issue alerts, and serve as clearinghouses of information on free market policies in the states." Each task force is co-chaired by one state legislator (termed "public") and one corporate representative(termed "private"), but Private Co-Chairs have veto power over final decisions of their task force. The primary goal of these task forces is to develop model policies for the country. "The centerpiece to the Task Forces is ALEC's model legislation. To date, ALEC has considered, written, and approved hundreds of model bills, resolutions, and policy statements."&lt;ref name="Task Forces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alec.org/task-forces/ |title=Task Forces; &amp;#124; ALEC – American Legislative Exchange Council |publisher=Alec.org, copyright 2013 |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902101217/http://www.alec.org/task-forces/ |archivedate=September 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article provides a summary of results for the '''[[general election]]s''' to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of '''[[New Brunswick]]''''s [[unicameral]] [[Legislature|legislative body]], the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]]. Prior to 1892, New Brunswick had a [[bicameral]] legislature, but its [[Upper House]] – the [[Legislative Council]] – was not elected. The number of seats has varied over time – from 41 at the time of Canadian Confederation, to a high of fifty-eight from 1967 through 1991, to the current level of 55 since the 1995 election.

Beginning with the [[New Brunswick general election, 2010|37th New Brunswick general election]] in 2010, elections in New Brunswick are – in general – held on fixed dates on the fourth Monday of September every four years. The date may be varied by one week earlier or later in cases of the fourth Monday of September being a date of cultural or religious significance and may be varied one month earlier or later in cases of a [[List of Canadian federal general elections|federal election]] being held during the same period. The [[Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick]] also has the power to call an election on another date in the event of a [[motion of no confidence|loss of confidence]] in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.gnb.ca/legis/bill/editform-e.asp?ID=555&amp;legi=56&amp;num=1|title=Status of Legislation|author=|date=|website=www1.gnb.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart on the upper right shows the information graphically, with the most recent elections towards the right. It shows that New Brunswick has effectively a [[two-party system]] – the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberals]] (red) and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Conservatives]] (blue); along with the one-off success of the [[New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party|Confederation of Regions party]] (green) in 1991. It also shows the Liberal party's clean sweep of seats in 1987, one of the few instances in history when a party won all the seats in a national or sub-national legislature. Since provincial parties were officially recognised, the Liberal party have won eleven out of twenty elections.

[[Image:New Brunswick general election results, 1939-2006 1.0.png|thumb|right|350px|Electoral results by parties as a percentage of total Legislative Assembly seats from 1939 to 2006.]]

This article only covers elections since the province became part of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. Prior to becoming part of Canada, New Brunswick was a British colony; and the New Brunswick House of Assembly was first formed in 1784 – when New Brunswick separated from [[Nova Scotia]].

==1866–1934==
New Brunswick joined the [[Canadian confederation]] in 1867. Between 1917 and 1935, party lines had developed, but were not recognized by electoral law. Before this, only "Government" and "Opposition" were used. The results are listed below.

==1935–present==
Between 1935 and 1974, some ridings were [[Plurality-at-large voting|multi member]] seats – i.e., more than one [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] was elected from certain ridings. [[political party|Political parties]] were officially recognized and registered beginning in 1935. Since 1974, each [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] (electoral district) has elected only [[First-past-the-post|one member]] to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]].

The '''Livermore Sector''' of the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] was dismantled in 2004.  This was part of a shift of Border Patrol enforcement away from the interior and to the border.

The Livermore Sector's focus from 1950s - 1986 was on ranch and farm patrol, as these industries hired a high proportion of illegal aliens.  In 1986, Congress placed restrictions on ranch and farm enforcement operations by the Border Patrol.  Instead, the Border Patrol focused on worksite enforcement (also known as "employer sanctions") such as compliance with I-9 reporting requirements.  The Border Patrol's Livermore Sector also focused on responding to local police calls for assistance and transportation checks at bus and rail terminals.  The Border Patrol also checked county jail bookings for illegal aliens.

The Livermore Sector's stations were defined in 8 CFR 100.4 as follows: 

*Livermore - Located inside [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area]] in Dublin, CA (Closed); Duties transferred to San Francisco ICE/DRO.
*Stockton - Located on [[Rough and Ready Island]] and still used by ICE/DRO.
*Sacramento - 7000 Franklin Blvd, Ste 575, Sacramento CA 95823 (Closed); Duties transferred to Sacramento ICE/DRO located in downtown Sacramento.
*Fresno - 4343 N Golden State Blvd, Fresno CA 93722 (Closed); Duties transferred to Fresno ICE/DRO at a location near Downtown Fresno.
*Bakersfield - 4430 Easton Dr, Bakersfield CA 93309 (Closed); Duties transferred to Bakersfield ICE/DRO.
*Salinas - Located on Harris Road 3/4 miles east of US 101, Salinas CA (Closed); Duties transferred to San Jose ICE/DRO.
*Oxnard - Located at Camarillo Airport in Oxnard AFB Building 206 (Closed); Duties transferred to Ventura ICE/DRO.
*San Luis Obispo - 1170 Calle Joaquin, San Luis Obispo CA 93405 (Closed); Duties transferred to Lompoc ICE/DRO.

The Livermore Sector also had an anti-smuggling unit (ASU) that comprised Special Agents from the Border Patrol.  

Today, many of the duties previously handled by the Border Patrol's Livermore Sector are now handled by the Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) branch of [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE).

==Livermore Sector Border Patrol Agent killed in the line of duty==
On September 6, 1989, at 1:45 a.m., Anti-Smuggling Agent Keith Connelly was shot by [[human trafficking|alien smugglers]] in the city of [[Fresno, California]], where he died shortly thereafter. Agent Connelly was working an undercover operation accompanied by his partner, Ted Jordan, who was also shot but survived the ordeal. The Fresno, California Police Department responded to the emergency assistance call and apprehended the suspects who were turned over to the FBI for prosecution.   The [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC) for years had a [[Marksman]] Award that was named in honor of Agent Keith Connelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_officer_memorial/alpha_listing_agents/a_g/connelly_k.xml| title = Keith Connelly - CBP.gov| accessdate = December 2, 2006| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =| date =| year =| month =| format = xml| work =U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection Alphabetical Listing of Agents Killed in the Line of Duty| publisher= CBP.gov| pages = | archiveurl = | archivedate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Black Hebrews}}
'''The Nation of Yahweh''' is a predominantly [[African American]] group that is the most controversial offshoot of the [[Black Hebrew Israelites]] religious movement. It has often been labeled a [[hate group]] and was founded in 1979 in [[Miami]] by Hulon Mitchell Jr., who went by the name [[Yahweh ben Yahweh]]. Its goal is to move African Americans, whom they see as the original [[Israelites]], to [[Israel]]. The group departs from mainstream [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] by accepting Yahweh ben Yahweh as the Son of God. In this way, its beliefs are unique and distinct from that of other known Black Hebrew Israelite groups.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Religious Movements Experience in America |last=Gallagher |first=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Gallagher |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location= |isbn=0-313-32807-2 |page=149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=811 |title=Rebirth of A Nation |accessdate=2008-01-20 |format= |work= |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group has engendered controversy due to legal issues surrounding its founder and has also faced accusations of being a [[black supremacist]] [[cult]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=808 |title=Margins to the Mainstream
 |accessdate=2008-01-20 |last=Potok |first=Mark |coauthors= |date=Fall 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/photos/4069358.htm|title=Staff's work has won 17 Pulitzer Prizes: 1991 |website=[[Miami.com]] |date =September 15, 2002 |accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407113257/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/photos/4069358.htm | archivedate=April 7, 2004 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization describes itself as: "In 1979, Yahweh Ben Yahweh came to Miami and became the Spiritual Leader and Founder of The Nation of Yahweh. Although He took a vow of poverty, in seven years He guided The Nation to amass a $250,000,000 empire. Under His direction, The Nation has grown to encompass disciples, followers, and supporters in over 1,300 cities within the U.S. and 16 foreign countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yahwehbenyahweh.com|title=Yahweh Ben Yahweh|website=www.yahwehbenyahweh.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The SPLC has criticized the beliefs of the Nation of Yahweh as racist, stating that the group believed that blacks are the true Israelites and that whites were devils. The SPLC also claims that the group believed that Yahweh ben Yahweh had a Messianic mission to vanquish whites and that it held views similar to those of the [[Christian Identity]] movement, which believes "[[Aryan|Aryans]]" to be the true Israelites and that non-whites are devils. The SPLC quotes [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] of [[White Aryan Resistance]] as saying, "[Groups like the Nation of Yahweh are] the Black counterpart of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/miami-based-nation-yahweh-leader-appeals-parole|title=Miami-Based Nation of Yahweh Leader Appeals Parole|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has criticized the Nation of Yahweh and some other Black Hebrew sects, stating, "In 1987, ADL reported on Black sects holding these views [arguing that today's Jews are not the "chosen people" described in the Bible, ... instead that the label applies to people of African descent], such as the Yahwehs and the Original African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem. Today, this form of Black supremacy is promoted on the Web by the ''12 Tribes of Israel'' site, which cites hundreds of Biblical passages to prove that Blacks are the children of Israel and that whites are the Satanic offspring of [[Esau]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/black_bigots.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020921123758/http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/black_bigots.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-09-21 |title=African-American Anti-Semitism |accessdate=2007-10-18 |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Yahweh controlled the clothing, food and sex lives of the people in his group. Twice married and divorced earlier in life, he took many of his young female followers to his bed.

"We may be rabbis and nuns here," he told ''[[The New York Times]]'' with a wide smile, "but we don't believe in celibacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Yahweh Ben  Yahweh; Led Violent Cult|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/09/AR2007050902629.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2007-05-10|access-date = 2016-02-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Matt|last = Schudel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most followers were men, the main elders were men as well. Yahweh ben Yahweh’s wife, Linda Gaines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top Yahweh Follower Gets 16-year Term In Conspiracy|url = http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-08-21/news/9201160860_1_yahweh-trudy-novicki-linda-gaines|website = tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Judith Israel) became a significant helper and leader. Gaines collected money, handled finances and the possessions of full-time workers. She had a body guard and was high up in the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FindLaw's United States Eleventh Circuit case and opinions |url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1344526.html|website = [[FindLaw]]|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==
Despite the death of their leader [[Yahweh ben Yahweh]] in 2007, the Nation of Yahweh is still active. Its members also claim to have abandoned their past racism and the leader's daughter has apparently stated that all people are children of God.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} An attorney who is also a member of the group, Wendelyn Rush, insists that their current war with the U.S. government is a non-violent verbal battle. The group is currently spread throughout the US and is no longer concentrated in one location (formerly Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA).  They claim that their present literature downplays and has nearly erased all past racism.

The Nation of Yahweh is perhaps best known nationally for its purchase of [[infomercial]] time. The Nation airs a weekly half-hour program on stations across the United States, usually on weekends during little-watched early morning hours, that combines Biblical study along with discussion of the Nation itself.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

The Yahweh ben Yahweh group appeared in the news again in 2012 after "[[Michael the Black Man]]" (real name Maurice Woodside), a former member of the group who is now a conservative activist, was invited to speak at a rally for [[Rick Santorum]]'s campaign during which he said that Democrats were akin to Nazis. Woodside has been accused of several murders and other violent crimes over the years but has never been convicted.&lt;ref name="santorum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2012/01/rick_santorum_invites_ex-yahwe.php|title=Rick Santorum Invites Ex-Yahweh Member Michael The Black Man To Open Rally}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodside has since become a vocal [[Donald Trump]] supporter, but continues to defend Yahweh ben Yahweh and the Nation's beliefs.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/the-strange-story-of-that-%E2%80%98blacks-for-trump%E2%80%99-guy-standing-behind-potus-at-his-phoenix-rally/ar-AAqzQon?li=BBmkt5R&amp;ocid=spartandhp|title=The strange story of that ‘Blacks for Trump’ guy standing behind POTUS at his Phoenix rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11978">In the study of [[international relations]], '''neoliberalism''' refers to a school of thought which believes that [[State (polity)|states]] are, or at least should be, concerned first and foremost with [[Absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gains]] rather than [[Relative gain (international relations)|relative gains]] to other states. Neoliberalism is a revised version of [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberalism]].

Alongside [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], neoliberalism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives have dominated international relations theory for the last three decades.&lt;ref name="Powell 1994 313"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|1994|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities of the international system==
Neoliberal international relations thinkers often employ [[game theory]] to explain why states do or do not cooperate;&lt;ref&gt;KEOHANE, Robert O. - ''After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy'', Princeton, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; since their approach tends to emphasize the possibility of mutual wins, they are interested in institutions which can arrange jointly profitable arrangements and compromises.

Neoliberalism is a response to [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]]; while not denying the [[anarchy|anarchic]] nature of the international system, neoliberals argue that its importance and effect has been exaggerated. The neoliberal argument is focused on neorealists' alleged underestimation of "the varieties of cooperative behavior possible within ... a decentralized system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations|first=Graham|last=Evans|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories, however, consider the state and its interests as the central subject of analysis; neoliberalism may have a wider conception of what those interests ''are''.

Neoliberalism argues that even in an anarchic system of autonomous rational states, cooperation can emerge through the cultivation of mutual trust and the building of norms, regimes and institutions.

In terms of the scope of [[international relations theory]] and [[foreign interventionism]], the debate between Neoliberalism and Neorealism is an intra-paradigm one, as both theories are [[positivist]] and focus mainly on the state system as the primary unit of analysis.

==Development==
[[Robert Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye]] have been considered the founders of the neoliberal school of thought; Keohane's book ''[[After Hegemony]]'' is a classic of the genre. Other major influences are the [[hegemonic stability theory]] of [[Stephen Krasner]] and the work of [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], among others.

==Contentions==

===Keohane and Nye===
[[Robert O. Keohane]] and [[Joseph S. Nye]], in response to neorealism, develop an opposing theory they dub "[[Complex interdependence]]." Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explain, "... complex interdependence sometimes comes closer to reality than does realism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keohane|first=Robert and Joseph Nye|title=Power and Interdependence: World Politics in Transition|year=1989|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Power_and_interdependence.html?id=RmvuAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In explaining this, Keohane and Nye cover the three assumptions in realist thought: First, states are coherent units and are the dominant actors in international relations; second, force is a usable and effective instrument of policy; and finally, the assumption that there is a [[hierarchy]] in international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keohane|first=Robert and Joseph Nye|title=Power and Interdependence: World Politics in Transition|year=1989|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|pages=23–24|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Power_and_interdependence.html?id=RmvuAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart of Keohane and Nye's argument is that in international politics there are, in fact, multiple channels that connect societies exceeding the conventional [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]] system of states. This manifests itself in many forms ranging from informal governmental ties to [[multinational corporations]] and organizations. Here they define their terminology; interstate relations are those channels assumed by realists; ''transgovernmental'' relations occur when one relaxes the realist assumption that states act coherently as units; ''transnational'' applies when one removes the assumption that states are the only units. It is through these channels that political exchange occurs, not through the limited interstate channel as championed by realists.

Secondly, Keohane and Nye argue that there is not, in fact, a hierarchy among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state's agenda, but that there are a multitude of different agendas that come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations.

Finally, the use of military force is not exercised when complex interdependence prevails. The idea is developed that between countries in which a complex interdependence exists, the role of the military in resolving disputes is negated. However, Keohane and Nye go on to state that the role of the military is in fact important in that "alliance's political and military relations with a rival bloc."

===Lebow===
[[Richard Lebow|Richard Ned Lebow]] states that the failure of neorealism lies in its "institutionalist" ontology, whereas the neorealist thinker [[Kenneth Waltz]] states, "the creators [of the system] become the creatures of the market that their activity gave rise to." This critical failure, according to Lebow, is due to the realists' inability "to escape from the predicament of anarchy." Or rather, the assumption that states do not adapt and will respond similarly to similar constraints and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Waltz, 90; quoted in Richard Ned Lebow, "The long peace, the end of the cold war, and the failure of realism," ''International Organization'', 48, 2 (Spring 1994), 273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mearsheimer===
[[Norman Angell]], a classical [[London School of Economics]] liberal, had held: "We cannot ensure the stability of the present system by the political or military preponderance of our nation or alliance by imposing its will on a rival."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Angell, ''The Great Illusion'', (1909) cited from 1933 ed. (New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons),p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane and Lisa L. Martin expound upon these ideas in the mid 1990s as a response to [[John Mearsheimer|John J. Mearsheimer]]'s "The False Promise of International Institutions," where Mearsheimer purports that, "institutions cannot get states to stop behaving as short-term power maximizers."&lt;ref name="Keohane IS Promise"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keohane|first=Robert and Lisa Martin|title=The Promise of Institutionalist Theory|journal=International Security|date=Summer 1995|volume=20|issue=1|page=47|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2539214?uid=3739696&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102097105141|accessdate=25 April 2013|doi=10.2307/2539214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Mearsheimer's article is a direct response to the liberal-institutionalist movement created in response to neo-realism. The central point in Keohane and Martin's idea is that neo-realism insists that, "institutions have only marginal effects ... [which] leaves [neo-realism] without a plausible account of the investments that states have made in such international institutions as the [[European Union|EU]], [[NATO]], [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]], and regional trading organizations."&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane and Lisa L. Martin, "The Promise of Institutionalist Theory," ''International Security'' 20, no. 1 (Summer 1995), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is in keeping with the notion of [[complex interdependence]]. Moreover, Keohane and Martin argue that the fact that international institutions are created in response to state interests, that the real empirical question is "knowing how to distinguish the effects of underlying conditions from those of the institutions themselves."&lt;ref name="Keohane IS Promise"/&gt; The debate between the institutionalists and Mearsheimer is about whether institutions have an independent effect on state behavior, or whether they reflect great power interests that said powers employ to advance their respective interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mearsheimer|first=John|title=A Realist Reply|journal=International Security|date=Summer 1995|volume=20|issue=1|pages=82–83|url=http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0022.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2013|doi=10.2307/2539218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mearsheimer is concerned with 'inner-directed' institutions, which he states, "seek to cause peace by influencing the behavior of the member states." In doing so he dismisses Keohane and Martin's NATO argument in favor of the example of the [[European Community]] and the [[International Energy Agency]]. According to Mearsheimer, NATO is an alliance that is interested in "an outside state, or coalition of states, which the alliance aims to deter, coerce, or defeat in war." Mearsheimer reasons that since NATO is an alliance it has special concerns. He concedes this point to Keohane and Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Mearsheimer, 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mearsheimer reasons, "to the extent that alliances cause peace, they do so by deterrence, which is straightforward realist behavior."&lt;ref name="Mearsheimer 83"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mearsheimer|first=John|title=A Realist Reply|journal=International Security|date=Summer 1995|volume=20|issue=1|page=83|url=http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0022.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2013|doi=10.2307/2539218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, Mearsheimer believes that Keohane and Martin "are shifting the terms of the debate, and making realist claims under the guise of institutionalism.&lt;ref name="Mearsheimer 83"/&gt;

Mearsheimer criticizes Martin's argument that the [[European Community]] (EC) enhances the prospects of cooperation, particularly in the case of Great Britain's sanctioning of Argentina during the [[Falklands war]], where it was able to secure the cooperation of other European states by linking the issues at hand to the EC. Mearsheimer purports that the United States was not a member of the EC and yet the US and Britain managed to cooperate on sanctions, creating an ad hoc alliance which effected change. "... Issue linkage was a commonplace practice in world politics well before institutions came on the scene; moreover, Britain and other European states could have used other diplomatic tactics to solve the problem. After all, Britain and America managed to cooperate on sanctions even though the United States was not a member of the EC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mearsheimer|first=John|title=A Realist Reply|journal=International Security|date=Summer 1995|volume=20|issue=1|page=87|url=http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0022.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2013|doi=10.2307/2539218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ploughshares Fund''' is a public [[grantmaking]] [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] that supports initiatives to prevent the spread and use of [[nuclear weapons]], and to prevent conflicts that could lead to their use. Ploughshares Fund is a 501(c)(3) foundation that pools contributions from individuals, families and foundations. Ploughshares Fund enables individual contributors to pool resources and provide support for initiatives to prevent the spread and use of [[nuclear weapons]]. With over $100 million awarded in grants since its founding in 1981, Ploughshares Fund is the largest US philanthropic foundation focused exclusively on nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbwJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT254&amp;dq=%22Ploughshares+Fund%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ehq9UoPEAsrSsATc4oDIDQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ploughshares%20Fund%22&amp;f=false Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late]'', Joseph Cirincione, Appendix F&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Concerned about the world’s burgeoning nuclear arsenals, San Francisco [[philanthropist]] and activist [[Sally Lilienthal]] founded the organization in 1981. Since it was founded, Ploughshares has made grants totaling nearly $100 million to hundreds of people and organizations around the world.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oO6pwt8016QC&amp;pg=SL265-PA19&amp;dq=%22Ploughshares+Fund%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oSe9UubQJLLNsASgtYHADA&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ploughshares%20Fund%22&amp;f=false Nuclear Shadowboxing: Cold War Redux],  A. DeVolpi.&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Lilienthal died in October 2006, at the age of 87, while still serving as Ploughshares Fund's president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ploughshares.org/who-we-are/history/sally-lilienthal Sally Lilienthal]&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the Board of Directors appointed [[Joseph Cirincione]] as Ploughshares Fund's president, the same year that the organization opened an office in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aworldthatjustmightwork.com/2009/04/qa-joseph-cirincione-president-of-ploughshares-fund-and-author/ Q&amp;A: JOSEPH CIRINCIONE, President of PLOUGHSHARES FUND and Author]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ploughshares.org/sites/default/files/resources/PSF_Newsletter_Spring_08.pdf Spring 2008 Newsletter]'', Ploughshares Fund &lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue areas==
Ploughshares Fund’s grantmaking is focused on the following issues:
* Promoting the reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons
* Preventing the emergence of new nuclear states
* Building regional peace and security&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ploughshares.org/what-we-fund What We Fund]'', Ploughshares Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public Security Police Force''' ({{zh |t = 治安警察局 }}; {{lang-pt|Corpo de Policia de Segurança Pública de Macau}}, [[abbreviated]] '''{{lang|pt|CPSP}}''') is the non-criminal police department of [[Macau]] and a branch of the [[Macau Security Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722221430/http://www.fsm.gov.mo/por/direction/direction.aspx |url = http://www.fsm.gov.mo/por/direction/direction.aspx |title=Formalidades |language = pt |accessdate=2010-06-28|trans-title=Formalities |publisher=[[Macau Security Force]] |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known at first as the '''Macau Police''' ({{lang-pt|Polícia de Macau}}), the force went through several name changes before taking on its current name. The PSP celebrates its foundation on March 14, 1691.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702173917/http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/por/psp_org_2.html |url = http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/por/psp_org_2.html |title=História |trans-title=History |accessdate=2010-06-28 |archivedate=2011-07-02 |publisher=Public Security Police Force of Macau |language = pt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[one country, two systems]] perspective, the [[Mainland China|mainland]] authorities may not interfere Macau's local law enforcement affairs. CPSPM is completely independent from the jurisdiction of [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|the mainland's Public Security Ministry]].

== History ==
[[File:8661 Procissão em Macau em 1 de Maio de 2010.JPG|thumb|left|250px|PSPFM officers restrain a protestor during May 1, 2010 protests in Macau.]]

Law enforcement was first taken by the military stationed in Portuguese Macau, with [[Portuguese Navy]] troops at first before the [[Portuguese Army]] stepped in to take over internal security duties on March 14, 1691.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; A small garrison was raised to conduct police work at first, but had the majority of its duties taken over by [[Portuguese India]]-based soldiers in 1784. On May 13, 1810, the Prince Regent Battalion was created to be the colony's police force, consisting of four companies of 400 men. Two companies were based at the Customs House while the other two was based at [[Fortaleza do Monte]] (Mount Fortress).

On March 3, 1841, a royal decree had approved the creation of a permanent police force, which was staffed by Macanese citizens who were not part of the battalion.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; A group of night watchmen called the Guard's Bazar was created by Bernardino de Senna Fernandes with some assistance from local Macanese Chinese to patrol residential areas at night, which was recognized as a legal law enforcement body by the Portuguese Macau government. With an initial count of 50 men, it was soon raised with 100 men. In 1861, the governor passed an ordinance that renamed the force from '''Macau Police''' to the '''Macau Police Force''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''CPM'''; {{lang-pt|Corpo de Polícia de Macau}}).&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In 1862, the CPM was given the power to patrol the colony's waters through Ordinance No. 56, November 18, 1862 under 1868 when the role was assigned to the '''Macau Port Police''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''PPM'''; {{lang-pt|Polícia do Porto de Macau}}).&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Moors were recruited into the ranks in 1873 with a Moor section established on August 9, 1874.

Governor Eugenio Carlos Correa da Silva dissolved the CPM on January 18, 1879, replacing it with the '''Macau Police Guard''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''GPM'''; {{lang-pt|Guarda de Polícia de Macau}}).&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; They were based at the [[S. Francisco Garden|Barracks San Francisco]] as part of the GPM's establishment. In 1912, Provincial Ordinance no. 106, June 10, 1912 had called for the GPM to be led by a county administrator, being assisted by both staff and police officers alike. Daniel Ferreira, the county administrator in 1914, created the police force's civil branch with a strength of 300 officers. A security police branch was established in 1916, with a strength of 304 officers paid with a salary of 7,810 [[Macanese pataca|MOP]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The post of Police Commissioner of Public Security in Macau was made separate from the colony administrator under Executive Order 533 in 1937, with the creation of the PSP (modelled after the [[Public Security Police|Portuguese Homeland PSP]]) at first under the command of a captain or a lieutenant in the Portuguese Army.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The PSP's police band was created in 1951 under Luis Augusto de Matos Paletti to serve as the force's ceremonial unit in official events. A social recovery center was created in 1961 to help take care of troubled people such as orphans, homeless or foreign nationals living in Macau without any permanent residence. By May 1968, the PSP served as a military organization under the Portuguese colonial government. Female officers were first recruited by the PSP on October 7, 1974 when 42 candidates were accepted into service. Decree-Law No. 705/75 of December 27, 1975 placed the PSP under the Security Forces of Macau alongside the Marine Police, Fiscal Police and the [[Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau|Fire Department]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

Further restructuring of the PSP took place in 1981 when Decree No. 37/81/M was passed to amend the earlier Decree No. 22/77/M. It established the PSP's divisions consisting of Command, Division of Police Macau Police Division of the Isles, Police Tactical Intervention Unit, Division of Transit Services, Migration and Identity, Music Band, Center for Recovery and Social Welfare.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The PSP's Police School was created on July 18, 1982 with Portuguese officers serving as the institution's first instructors. Another round of restructuring took place on February 8, 1986 with the passing of Decree-Law No. 13/86/M, which created additional PSP divisions, consisting of Command, General Staff and Command organs, Divisions of Police and General Support, Organs Support Services and Education.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In 1995, the PSP went through a third phrase of restructuring through the passing of Decree-Law No. 3/95/M, defining its overall structure consisting of Command and Control Bodies, Department of Resource Management, Department Information, Operations Department, Migration Service, Transit Department, Macau Police Department, Islands Police Departments, Police Tactical Intervention Unit, Training Command, Police Academy and the Music Band.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Portuguese-born PSP officers began leaving their posts also at the same year, being replaced by Macanese-born PSP officers.

In 1999, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel António Meireles de Carvalho passed on command of the PSP to its new commander, Superintendent General Jose Proença Branco. With the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|transfer of sovereignty]] on December 20 of that year, the PSP changed its emblem, replacing the former Portuguese coat of arms with that of the [[Emblem of Macau]].

The PSP's Police School moved its location from its old headquarters at the Center for Social Recovery and began work on the Academy of Security Forces at Coloane after the [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison]] was created in Macau in May 2000.

Superintendent General Jose Proenca Branco was replaced by Superintendent Law Siu Peng after former Macau Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah on September 17, 2001 passed Decree No. 66/2001.

===Controverseries===
The PSPFM's credibility suffered in the [[2007 Macau labour protest]] when a bystander was injured from a bullet fired by PSPM officers as warning shots to break up protests.&lt;ref name="atimes1"&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/II05Cb01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSPFM announced that several of its officers, including a retired officer, arrested during an anti-extortion operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1901284/macau-police-officers-detained-over-major-probe-casino&lt;/ref&gt;

The insignia for basic ranks consist in silver chevrons: two for constable, three for constable first class and four for principal constable. The insignia for sub-chief consists in a silver stripe. The insignia for chiefs and commissioners consist of a laurel branch and a number of PSP stars (six points silver stars with the "SP" monogram in the center): one for chief, two for sub-commissioner and three (in inverted triangle) for commissioner. The insignia for intendents and superintendents consist of two crossed batons surrounded by [[laurel wreath]]s and a number of PSP stars: two for sub-intendent, three (in inverted triangle) for intendent and superintendent and four for superintendent general.

== Firearms ==
The standard issue sidearm for regular Macau patrolmen is the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10]] revolver.

Detectives are armed with the shorter [[Colt Detective Special]] and policemen who work for special units such as Police Intervention Tactical Unit (UTIP) or the Special Operation Group (GOE) are issued with the [[Glock 19]] semi-auto pistol. The GOE may also equip with [[SIG Sauer P226]] and [[SIG Sauer P228]] if meet certain requirements.

For long arms, the standard sub-machine guns of Macau Police are [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], [[Brügger &amp; Thomet MP9]], [[Remington 870]] shotguns along with [[Federal M201-Z]] [[Tear_gas|tear gas]] launchers are also one of the regular equipment.

The UTIP and GOE would use small arms unique to the Portuguese  FBP m/948, such as the [[SIG SG 550|SIG SG 552]] short assault rifle、[[Franchi SPAS-15]] semi-automatic shotgun and the [[SIG-Sauer SSG 3000]] sniper rifle. They also use [[Smith &amp; Wesson]]-made 37&amp;nbsp;mm gas launchers, [[Baton (law enforcement)|long batons]] and [[Flash-ball]] and [[taser]] for less-than-lethal to control riots.

'''Rape during the [[liberation of France]]''' is documented both during and after the advance of [[United States forces]] across [[France]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in later stages of [[World War II]].

==Background==
The [[invasion of Normandy]] in June and [[Operation Dragoon|a second invasion]] in the south in August, put over two million front line and support troops of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] into France in 1944.

The [[Liberation of Paris]] followed on 25 August. Except for German forces penned in the south-west (e.g., around [[Bordeaux]]) or in ports, the majority of German troops were pushed back to the [[Siegfried Line]] by the end of 1944. After the war, the repatriation for demobilisation of the troops took time. Even in 1946, months after VE-day there were still about 1.5 million troops in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Levenstein p90&lt;/ref&gt; The housing and management of the thousands of troops awaiting embarkation on a ship for home was a problem.

[[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] reported the widespread view among American troops of France as "a tremendous brothel inhabited by 40 million hedonists who spent all their time eating, drinking, making love and in general having a hell of a good time".&lt;ref name="Levenstein2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey Levenstein|title=We'll Always Have Paris: American Tourists in France since 1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36xgYf4G8JoC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=15 March 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-47380-2|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc1945"&gt;{{cite book|author=Time Inc|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ukgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=10 December 1945|publisher=Time Inc|pages=20–|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French complaints==
[[File:Normandía.PNG|thumb|Normandy region]]

By the late summer of 1944, soon after the invasion of Normandy, women in Normandy began to complain about [[rape]]s by American soldiers.&lt;ref name=s20130529/&gt; Hundreds of cases were reported.&lt;ref name=afp20130526&gt;{{cite news|first=Fabienne |last=Faur |title=GI's were liberators yes, but also trouble in Normandy |date=2013-05-26 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hY3cUraWo4fVJqWbA34Fd2IeTFOQ?docId=CNG.26cca045d911d64d66269c72328f270e.b11 |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303160004/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hY3cUraWo4fVJqWbA34Fd2IeTFOQ?docId=CNG.26cca045d911d64d66269c72328f270e.b11 |archivedate=March 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, after the end of the war in Europe, Le Havre was filled with American servicemen awaiting return to the States. A Le Havre citizen wrote to the mayor that the people of Le Havre were "attacked, robbed, run over both on the street and in our houses" and "This is a regime of terror, imposed by bandits in uniform."&lt;ref name=s20130529&gt;{{cite news | author= Mathieu von Rohr  | title='Bandits in Uniform': The Dark Side of GIs in Liberated France| date=May 29, 2013 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]] | url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/new-book-reveals-dark-side-of-american-soldiers-in-liberated-france-a-902266.html | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coffeehouse owner from Le Havre testified "We expected friends who would not make us ashamed of our defeat.

One resident stated that "With the Germans, the men had to camouflage themselves—but with the Americans, we had to hide the women."&lt;ref name=afp20130526/&gt;

U.S. troops committed 208 rapes and about 30 murders in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Manche]].&lt;ref name="Wieviorka329"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wieviorka |first= Olivier |title= Normandy: From the Landings to the Liberation of Paris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwCmJiSaREwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=Rape+during+the+liberation+of+France&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8r2sUbTVM4fPkQXb4oGYBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= [[Belknap Press of Harvard University Press]] |date=2010 |ISBN= 0674047478 |page= 329}}&lt;/ref&gt; French men also raped women perceived as [[collaboration|collaborators]] with the Germans.&lt;ref name="Virgili194"&gt;{{cite book |last= Virgili |first= Fabrice |title= Shorn Women: Gender and Punishment in Liberation France |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIWksyfmHf8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Shorn+Women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ly6zUb6GEorK0wH1r4G4Dw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=collaborators&amp;f=false |publisher= [[Berg Publishers]] |date=2002 |ISBN= 1859735843 |page= 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. military response==

A brothel, Blue and Gray Corral, was set up near the village of St. Renan in September 1944 by Maj. Gen. [[Charles H. Gerhardt]], commander of the infantry division that landed at Omaha Beach, partly to counter a wave of rape accusations against G.I.s. (It was shut down after a mere five hours in order to prevent civilians in the United States from finding out about a military run brothel). &lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Dark Side of Liberation| date=May 20, 2013| publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/books/rape-by-american-soldiers-in-world-war-ii-france.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0/ | accessdate = September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Free French Forces]] high command sent a letter of complaint to the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force]] General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name=cbs20130602/&gt; He gave his commanders orders to take action against all allegations of murder, rape, assault, robbery and other crimes.&lt;ref name=cbs20130602&gt;{{cite news | title=When some liberators were criminals| date=June 2, 2013| publisher=[[CBS News]] | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57587207/when-the-liberators-were-criminals/ | accessdate = June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1945, Pierre Voisin, mayor of [[Le Havre]] urged [[Colonel]] Thomas Weed, U.S. commander in the region, to set up [[brothel]]s outside [[Le Havre]].&lt;ref name=afp20130526/&gt; However, U.S. commanders refused.&lt;ref name=afp20130526/&gt;

==Historical and criminological studies==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
According to [[Alice Kaplan]], an American historian of France and chair of the Department of French at [[Yale University]], the U.S. military tolerated rape of French women less than that of German women. She argued that the number of rapes is well documented and is less than that of some other armies during that era, writing that "Nine hundred and four American soldiers were tried for rape in Europe, and even if the actual numbers were much higher, they do not compare with a terrible legacy of World War II-era rapes" committed, for example, by the Japanese in Nanking, by Germans in the German-occupied areas, by the French-Moroccans in Italy and by the Soviet soldiers across Eastern Europe and Germany.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2005,154-"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alice Kaplan]]|title=The Interpreter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXosaqz_iUgC&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=30 August 2005|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-7481-4|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Robert Lilly, Regents professor of sociology and criminology at [[Northern Kentucky University]], reported in ''[[Taken by Force (book)|Taken by Force: Rape and American GIs in Europe in World War II]]'' his estimate that 14,000 rapes were committed by U.S. soldiers in France, Germany and the United Kingdom between 1942 and 1945.&lt;ref name="TBF"&gt;Lilly, J.

A '''''ratusz''''' ({{IPA-pl|'ratuʂ}}) ({{lang-de|Rathaus}}; {{lang-uk|Ратуша}}, ''Ratusha'') is a historic administrative building in countries that adopted the [[Magdeburg rights]] such as the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and others. It was distinguished with a [[bell tower]] ([[Fire lookout tower|lookout]] or a [[clock tower]]). Unlike a regular [[city hall]] which may or may not have any specific architectural compositions, ratusz (rathaus) always consisted of a building with a tower.

Rathaus was primarily designated as a [[city hall]], traditionally built in the centre of a [[town]] or in the middle of a [[town square]] or more common [[market square]] (freedom of trade as the main goal of [[Magdeburg rights]]). Although the old ratusz can still maintain the function of a [[seat of local government]], frequently it is separated from the contemporary city government, the administrative building housing the town council, and often serves as a museum of local history (for example in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] and [[Tarnów]] among many others).&lt;ref name="Wykaz"/&gt;

==History==
Prominent examples of a historic ratusz can be found in at least 82 Polish cities.&lt;ref name="Rosikon"/&gt; Some of them date back to the mid-13th century, like the ratusz in [[Kalisz]].&lt;ref name="Rosikon"&gt;Janusz Rosikoń, [http://www.rosikonpress.com/dzial_48/towar_karta_4/Ratusze_w_Polsce.html Ratusze w Polsce] Rosikon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jaktrafic"&gt;[http://www.jaktrafic.org/ratusze/regulamin_ratusze.pdf Szlakiem Rynków i Ratuszy w Polsce] [[PTTK]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gosciniec"&gt;Elżbieta Zagłoba-Zygler, [http://gosciniec.pttk.pl/16_2004/index.php?co=061 20 lat rajdu motorowego PTTK "Ratusze w Polsce"] "Gosciniec" Polskiego Towarzystwa Turystyczno-Krajoznawczego, PTTK&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest tower still standing was erected in 1274 in [[Toruń]] while the actual building with 365 windows comes from the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Toruń"&gt;Douglas Stallings, [https://books.google.com/books?id=41WbJp82ZeYC&amp;q=%22Built+in+1274%2C+the+town+hall%27s+tower+is+the+oldest+in+Poland%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Built%20in%201274%2C%20the%20town%20hall's%20tower%20is%20the%20oldest%20in%20Poland%22&amp;f=false Ratusz (town hall) in Toruń] ''Fodor's Poland''. Random House, 2007. {{ISBN|1400017513}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ratusz in [[Zamość]], built during the [[Renaissance in Poland]], is one of the highest achievements of Renaissance architecture anywhere in the country. It was intentionally placed in the corner of the town square not to outshine the nearby [[House of Zamoyski|Zamoyski]] Palace of the city's owners, which it did anyway, once the imposing [[Baroque in Poland|Baroque staircase]] was added in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Zamość"&gt;Douglas Stallings, [https://books.google.com/books?id=41WbJp82ZeYC&amp;q=%22distinctive+staircase%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22distinctive%20staircase%22&amp;f=false Ratusz (town hall) in Zamość] ''Fodor's Poland'', p. 238. Random House, 2007. {{ISBN|1400017513}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratusz in [[Poznań]], dating from the mid-16th century, has a clock with billy goats butting heads, which attracts hundreds of spectators every day in tourist season.&lt;ref name="Poznań"&gt;Douglas Stallings, [https://books.google.com/books?id=41WbJp82ZeYC&amp;q=%22two+billy+goats%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22two%20billy%20goats%22&amp;f=false Ratusz (town hall) in Poznań] ''Fodor's Poland'', p. 131. Random House, 2007. {{ISBN|1400017513}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the centuries many Polish town halls have been damaged in foreign invasions, such as the ratusz in [[Sandomierz]], with city rights since 1286, meticulously renovated before being turned into a museum.&lt;ref name="Wykaz"&gt;[http://www.jaktrafic.org/Wykaz.aspx?typ=7&amp;kraj=5&amp;nwojlista=1,5,6,8,9,12,15 Wykaz ratuszy z Polski (Compendium of Poland's ratuszes)] History and photographs. JakTrafic.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In the royal city of [[Kraków]], the [[Kraków Town Hall|historic ratusz]], built of brick and mortar in the [[Main Square, Kraków|centre of Main Square]], originally in 1316, has been torn down not [[Austrian Partition|by the occupiers]], but by the Cracovians themselves in 1820 because it was not considered pretty enough. What remains of it is the massive [[Town Hall Tower, Kraków|town-hall tower]], a prominent example of [[Polish Gothic architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamil Janicki, [http://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2012/01/19/co-sie-stalo-z-krakowskim-ratuszem/ Co się stało z krakowskim ratuszem?] Ciekawostki turystyczne.&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable number of heritage city halls became historical museums in the 20th century, including the ratusz in Toruń ([[Toruń Regional Museum]] or ''Muzeum Okręgowe'' in Polish), with stained glass and gingerbread divisions, in [[Poznań]] (''Muzeum Okręgowe''), with a [[Chopin]] division, in [[Lublin]] (''Muzeum Okręgowe''), [[Siedlce]] (''Muzeum Okręgowe''), [[Białystok]] (''Muzeum Podlaskie''), [[Gdańsk]] (''Muzeum Historii Miasta''), [[Sandomierz]] (''Muzeum Okręgowe''), and [[Szczecin]] (''Muzeum Historii Miasta Szczecina''). Others still serve as seats of local government, and sometimes also as civil wedding halls and art galleries, restaurants, and cultural centres. These include [[Zamość]], [[Kielce]], [[Zielona Góra]] (also a civil wedding hall, restaurant, and winery), [[Kętrzyn]] (also a wedding hall and cultural centre), and [[Kołobrzeg]] (also a wedding hall, cultural centre, and gallery of modern art).&lt;ref name="Wykaz"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The Polish word ''ratusz'' to describe a city hall was most likely derived from the German ''[[rathaus]]'' (council house) sometime during the [[Middle Ages]]. The influence also serves as a [[metonym]] for the [[burmistrz]] ([[burgomaster]], or mayor), derived from the German ''bürgermeister''.

Since 1980, the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society ([[PTTK]]) offers a badge for tourists interested in organizing group excursions across the country with the aim of visiting the maximum number of ratusz towns and cities. The PTTK hands out a special booklet where stamps can be collected for the gold badge awarded for visiting a minimum of twenty ratusz outlets.&lt;ref name="jaktrafic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gosciniec"/&gt;

'''Samuel Mann''' is a New Zealand computer scientist, with interests in computer science education and sustainability. He is a full Professor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Otago Daily Times|title=Polytechnic appoints professors|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/otago-polytechnic/204496/polytechnic-appoints-professors|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at [[Otago Polytechnic]]. He has published widely on sustainable practice, both in computing and more generally to apply to any discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Otago Polytechnic|title=Samuel Mann|url=http://www.op.ac.nz/enterprise/search/Form?Type=2&amp;Keyword=&amp;Department=0&amp;Person=249&amp;action_searchResults=Search|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mann was educated at the [[University of Otago]] where he studied botany and geography, before completing a PhD in Information Science.

== Sustainable Practitioner ==
Mann developed the term "sustainable practitioner". In 2007 under Mann's guidance, Otago Polytechnic committed to the strategy that "every graduate may think and act as a sustainable practitioner".  Initiatives have included a Living Campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Otago Daily Times|title=Live campus taking root|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/on-campus/otago-polytechnic/41438/live-campus-taking-root|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=31 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sustainable Community Enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Otago Daily Times|title=Polytech, Port Chalmers winners with Wi-Fi|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/otago-polytechnic/229147/polytech-port-chalmers-winners-wi-fi|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann is building an oral archive of conversations with sustainable practitioners. This is also broadcast on [[Otago Access Radio]] and podcast as [[Sustainable Lens]]. The goal is to create a searchable archive of conversations with people from many different fields who are applying their skills to a sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sustainable Lens|title=Sustainable Lens: Resilience on Radio|url=http://sustainablelens.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CITRENZ ==
Since 2011 Mann has served as Chair of Computing and Information Technology Information and Education and Research NZ (CITRENZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CITRENZ|title=CITRENZ Board Committee Membership|url=http://www.citrenz.ac.nz/?page_id=140|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that role he oversaw the development of a new suite of computing programmes for all New Zealand polytechnics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CITRENZ|title=CITRENZ newsletter|url=http://www.citrenz.ac.nz/?page_id=979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In 2009 Mann was awarded the Beeby Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Otago Daily Times|title=Green guide for all educators|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/on-campus/otago-polytechnic/43267/green-guide-all-educators|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=14 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Beeby Fellowship is a joint initiative between the New Zealand Council for Educational Research and the New Zealand National Commission for UNESCO.

'''Scientists and Engineers for America''' (SEA) was an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government, and supporting candidates who understand science and its applications. SEA was formed on September 27, 2006, and describes itself as non-partisan.

----
''SEA appears to have ceased active operations in October 2011.  The following note was posted on SEA's Facebook page on October 28, 2011, by former SEA Program Director Brie Welzer:'' {{quote|"Hi All. Sadly, SEA has paused its active programming. There are many budding science and tech outreach organizations in the making, and if anyone is interested in helping with a new start-up, please let me know any time."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Scientists-and-Engineers-for-America/38948082501 SEA Facebook page], retrieved August 23 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The remainder of this page describes SEA when it was still active.''
----

SEA is organized as a [[501(c)(3)]] organization, and represents a reorganization of Scientists and Engineers for Change, an organization founded in 2004 to support the election of [[John Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/10/science_2006.php ''Science 2006''], [[Seed Magazine]], October 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Its current executive director is [[Tom Price (American politician)|Tom Price]].  SEA operates a [[wiki]] site called the Science, Health And Related Policies (SHARP) Network, which allows members to track and contribute information on Congressional representatives, candidates, and science policy issues. SEA is associated with a [[501(c)(4)]] organization known as the SEA Action Fund,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sefora.org SEA Action Fund], March 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; whose president is geneticist [[Michael Stebbins]].

==Political positions==

===Bill of Rights for Scientists and Engineers===
A bill of rights which outlines the principles of the organization states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharp.sefora.org/bill-of-rights/ ''Bill of Rights for Scientists and Engineers''], SEA Website, February 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|
# Public policy shall be made using the best available scientific, technical, and engineering knowledge.
# No government organization shall knowingly distribute false or misleading information.
# Government funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education shall only be used for evidence-based curricula.
# No one should fear reprisals or intimidation because of the results of his or her research.
# Scientists, technologists, and engineers conducting research or analysis with public funding shall be free of unreasonable restrictions in discussing and publishing their work, and the results of governmentally-funded research and analysis shall be made open to the public without unreasonable delay.
# A clear, public, and transparent process shall be used to make decisions about restricting public access to information for reasons of national security. There shall be a process for challenging decisions, and remedial measures to correct mistakes and abuses of the classification system.
# Employees exposing what they believe to be manipulation of research and analysis for political or ideological reasons shall be protected from intimidation, retribution, or adverse personnel action resulting from the decision to speak out.
# Appointments to publicly funded advisory committees shall be based on professional and academic qualifications, not political affiliation or ideology.
}}

===Mission statement===
The organization's mission statement states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharp.sefora.org/mission/ ''SEA Mission Statement''], SEA Website, February 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''We envision a future where wise science and technology policy can help every American live in a safe and clean environment, enjoy good health and education, and benefit from a strong system of national defense.  Scientists and Engineers for America is the only national organization dedicated exclusively to advancing these goals through the electoral process.

''SEA works to promote evidence-based decision making in politics and at all levels of government by:

*Raising the level of debate on science and policy in elections and beyond;
*Encouraging people with training in science and engineering to run for office;
*Facilitating the participation of scientists and engineers in politics and civic life; and
*Providing timely information on the science policy positions of elected officials and candidates for elected office.
SEA is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, educational organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.''}}

==Programs==

===SHARP Network===
The Science, Health and Related Policies Network is a [[wiki]] to track congressional representatives, senators, and candidates as well as presidential candidates.

===Innovation &amp; the Elections 2008===
Scientists and Engineers for America organized a coalition of 19 science organizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharp.sefora.org/innovation2008/ Innovation &amp; the Elections 2008], 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to submit a set of 7 questions to all the candidates for [[United States Congress]]. The coalition includes groups such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and [[Science Debate 2008]].

===Campaign Education and Training===
The Campaign Education and Training project is a workshop aimed at training science-oriented professionals to run for public office.
Along with the workshop, SEA also hosts an online advice column called Campaign Lab for scientists to ask political experts on different aspects of running for political office.

===SEA chapters===
SEA chapters provide a way for students and members of the scientific community to influence the interface between science and politics. These chapters develop the means for both current and future scientists and engineers to influence the policy arena and expand the forum through which SEA involves scientists and engineers in the political and civic process.

==Board of Advisers==
Among others, the SEA Board of Advisers includes noted [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureates]] such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharp.sefora.org/board-of-advisors/ Board of Advisors], SEA Website. March 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Soon after its foundation, the organization was accused of partisanship by several conservative media outlets. An editorial in [[The Wall Street Journal]] criticised the organization for seeming to stifle [[scientific dissent]]: {{cquote|''That is one reason why it is always dismaying when scientists -- of all people -- suggest that on some subjects there must be no questioning because debate is closed. And on one level, at least, this would seem to be the implicit message of the newly formed [[527 organization|527 political organization]] called Scientists and Engineers for America, or SEA.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116009290301984390 ''Under the Microscope''], [[The Wall Street Journal]], October 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a rebuttal posted on the SEA website, founding executive director Michael Brown stated: {{cquote|''Nothing could be further from the truth. As one who is familiar with SEA and its mission, I must confess that I had to read the editorial three or four times before I had any idea what it was talking about. In fact, it was not until I re-read the Weekly Standard article that I understood the “debate” we were allegedly closing. This is the debate about whether scientists and engineers should engage in public policy and actively address the misuse and politicization of science or whether they should remain silent when their voices are censured, their findings are misused, and scientific integrity itself is attacked. This is a debate that is open, ongoing---and that we join with enthusiasm.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116045258/http://www.sefora.org/serendipity/index.php?%2Farchives%2F8-Look-whos-talking.html ''Look who's talking''], SEA Website, January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Students Union of Bhutan''' (''&lt;small&gt;[[Dzongkha]]:་ཨེ་ཤི་ཡ་ལུ་ཆགས་ཏིའབྲུག་ཡུལ་་&lt;/small&gt;'') is a political [[human rights]] organization formed by [[Bhutan]]ese students, founded on March 23, 1988.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/sub_bhutan/introduction.htm Student Union of Bhutan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the organisation is to increase the participation of students in [[Bhutan]]ese society, and to promote the ideals of democracy and freedom of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/sub_bhutan/profile.htm Student Union of Bhutan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The union was formed at a time for when it was unlawful to form any kind of association or union within the kingdom. The Students Union of Bhutan was forced to operate from outside of the country following government crackdowns and arrest of some of its activists in late 1989,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; however since the  [[democratization]] of the country spearheaded by [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]], the union's profile has been diminished.

The Students Union of Bhutan's origins grew from the ''Nepali Literary Society'', the organisation was considered informal and underground, and had a membership of 25 activists. Upon founding in 1988, the society distributed pamphlets and other printed articles highlighting state-sponsored discrimination and atrocities in regards to [[Bhutanese refugees]]. The union keeps close contact with other human rights organisations in Bhutan, and has established schools for refugees of [[People of Nepal|Nepali]] origin residing in [[Bhutan]]. Since 1990, a monthly printed publication entitled ''Bhutan Focus'' has been distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rDxx_ibIwZ0C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=students+union+of+bhutan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B-uNVsGY9J&amp;sig=DldZGtYCZuIG1rDO8gO1HRR4pws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ob2oUYK-KYXEPc_sgPAG&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=students%20union%20of%20bhutan&amp;f=false Himalayan Kingdom Bhutan: Tradition, Transition, and Transformation - A.

"'''The Triple Revolution'''" was an [[Open letter|open memorandum]] sent to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and other government figures on March 22, 1964. Drafted under the auspices of the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], it was signed by an array of noted [[social activist]]s, professors, and technologists who identified themselves as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution. The chief initiator of the proposal was [[Wilbur H. Ferry|W. H. "Ping" Ferry]], at that time a vice-president of CSDI, basing it in large part on the ideas of the futurist [[Robert Theobald]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'' (Basic Books, 2008), p.462n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The statement identified three [[revolution]]s underway in the world: the ''cybernation revolution'' of increasing [[automation]]; the ''weaponry revolution'' of [[mutually assured destruction]]; and the ''[[human rights]] revolution''. It discussed primarily the cybernation revolution. The committee claimed that machines would usher in "a system of almost unlimited productive capacity" while continually reducing the number of [[manual labor]]ers needed, and increasing the skill needed to work, thereby producing increasing levels of [[unemployment]]. It proposed that the government should ease this transformation through large-scale [[public works]], [[affordable housing|low-cost housing]], [[public transit]], [[electric power|electrical power]] development, [[income redistribution]], union representation for the unemployed, and government restraint on technology deployment.

==Legacy==

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s final Sunday sermon, "Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution," delivered days before [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|his assassination]], explicitly references the thesis of "The Triple Revolution":&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of the Robots |last=Ford |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Ford (author) |isbn=0465059996 |pages=29–30 |date=May 5, 2015 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sermon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/article/remaining_awake_through_a_great_revolution/ |title=Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |date=March 31, 1968 |publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There can be no gainsaying of the fact that a great revolution is taking place in the world today. In a sense it is a triple revolution: that is, a technological revolution, with the impact of automation and cybernation; then there is a revolution in weaponry, with the emergence of atomic and nuclear weapons of warfare; then there is a human rights revolution, with the freedom explosion that is taking place all over the world. Yes, we do live in a period where changes are taking place. And there is still the voice crying through the vista of time saying, "Behold, I make all things new; former things are passed away."|Martin Luther King, Jr.|Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution}}

In [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1967 anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'', [[Philip José Farmer]]'s story "[[Riders of the Purple Wage]]" uses the Triple Revolution document as the premise of a future society, in which the "purple wage" of the title is a [[guaranteed income]] dole on which most of the population lives. At the 1968 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in San Francisco, Farmer delivered a lengthy Guest of Honor speech in which he called for the founding of a grassroots activist organization called REAP which would work for implementation of the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendations.

Looking back on the proposal in his 2008 book,&lt;ref name="Bell_2008"/&gt; [[Daniel Bell]] wrote: {{quote|"the cybernetic revolution quickly proved to be illusory.  There were no spectacular jumps in productivity. &lt;...&gt;  Cybernation had proved to be one more instance of the penchant for overdramatizing a momentary innovation and blowing it up far out of proportion to its actuality. &lt;...&gt; The image of a completely automated production economy—with an endless capacity to turn out goods—was simply a social-science fiction of the early 1960s. Paradoxically, the vision of Utopia was suddenly replaced by the spectre of Doomsday. In place of the early-sixties theme of endless plenty, the picture by the end of the decade was one of a fragile planet of limited resources whose finite stocks were being rapidly depleted, and whose wastes from soaring industrial production were polluting the air and waters."&lt;ref name="Bell_2008"&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'' (Basic Books, 2008), p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his 2015 book ''Rise of the Robots'',&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] claims The Triple Revolution's predictions of steady decline in future employment were not wrong, but rather premature. He cites "Seven Deadly Trends" that began in the 1970s-1980s and by the mid 2010s appeared set to continue:
# Stagnation in [[real wages]] [[File:US productivity and real wages.jpg|thumb|U.S. productivity and average real earnings, 1947–2008]]
# Decline in labor's share of national income in many countries (breakdown of [[Bowley's law]]), while corporate profits increased
# Declining [[Unemployment#Labor force participation rate|labor force participation]]
# Diminishing job creation, lengthening [[Jobless recovery|jobless recoveries]], and soaring [[Unemployment#Long-term unemployment|long-term unemployment]]
# [[Economic inequality|Rising inequality]]
# Declining incomes, and [[underemployment]] for recent college graduates
# [[Polarization_(economics)|Polarization]] and part-time jobs (middle-class jobs are disappearing, to be replaced by a small number of high-paying jobs and large number of low-paying jobs)
According to Ford, the 1960s were part of what in retrospect seems like a golden age for labor in the United States, when productivity and wages rose together in near lockstep, and unemployment was low. But after about 1980, wages began stagnating while productivity continued to rise. Labor's share of the economic output began to decline. Ford describes the role that automation and information technology play in these trends, and how new technologies including [[Weak AI|narrow AI]] threaten to destroy jobs faster than displaced workers can be retrained for new jobs, before automation takes the new jobs as well. This includes many job categories, such as in [[Autonomous car|transportation]], that were never threatened by automation before. According to a 2013 study, about 47% of US jobs are susceptible to automation.&lt;ref name="MyUser_FreyOsborneOxford"&gt;{{cite web

==Overview==
In 2015, URSB was awarded "global recognition for improved service delivery, client satisfaction, innovation and leadership", by [[Otherways Management Association Club]], a France-based organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=30 March 2016 | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Registration-services-bureau-scoops-global-award/-/688322/2981678/-/2irmnaz/-/index.html | date=3 December 2015|

One of the priority areas that URSB is working on is establishing a national registry of movable assets, also known as a "chattels registry", to enable micro, small, and medium businesses to borrow from the formal banking sector, which requires collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=30 March 2016 | url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Respite-for-Uganda-SMEs-moveable-assets-listed-for-loan-access/-/2560/2994324/-/item/0/-/mxndk0z/-/index.html | date=12 December 2015 | title=Moveable assets to be listed for loan access in Uganda | first=Dicta | last=Asiimwe | newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]] | location=Nairobu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, URSB signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Directorate of Public Prosecutions and the [[Uganda Financial Intelligence Authority]]. The MoU was intended to ease the sharing of information between the three government agencies and reduce government bureaucracy. The ultimate goal is to cut down on the concealment of assets and illegal [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=30 March 2016 | date=17 February 2016 | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/DPP-joins-fight-against-money-laundering/-/688322/3079936/-/jirnya/-/index.html | title=DPP joins fight against money laundering | first=and Jonathan Adengo | last=Athony Wesaka | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Unicameral Youth Legislature''', formerly the '''Unicameral Youth Conference''' is a four-day legislative simulation in Nebraska, US in which high school students take on the role of [[lawmakers]]. Student senators sponsor bills, conduct committee hearings, debate [[legislation]] and discover the unique process of the nation's only [[Unicameralism|unicameral]].

The Unicameral Youth Legislature gives behind-the-scenes access to students who have an interest in public office, government, politics, law, public policy, debate or public speaking. Students will learn about the inner workings of the [[Nebraska Legislature|Legislature]] directly from senators, staff and lobbyists. Bill topics are based on legislation considered during the most recent legislative session. From driving laws to the death penalty, topics selected for the legislature are diverse and engaging.

Legislative activities are conducted at the [[Nebraska State Capitol Building]] in the historic Warner Chamber, which was home to the Nebraska Senate until the state consolidated to a one-house legislature in 1937.

The youth legislature is organized by the Nebraska State 4-H Office and the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] Extension Office youth development program. The Clerk of the Nebraska Legislature, through the Unicameral Information Office, serves as a technical consultant for the Unicameral Youth Legislature.

The '''United States Institute of Peace''' ('''USIP''') is an American [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] institution tasked with promoting conflict resolution and prevention worldwide. It provides research, analysis, and training to individuals in diplomacy, mediation, and other peace-building measures. 

Following years of proposals for a national "peace academy", the USIP was established in 1984 by Congressional legislation signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. It is officially nonpartisan and independent, receiving funding only through congressional appropriation to prevent outside influence. The Institute is governed by a bipartisan Board of Directors with fifteen members——which must include the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the President of the National Defense University——who are appointed by the [[United States President|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. 

The Institute's [[United States Institute of Peace Headquarters|headquarters]] is in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], situated at the northwest corner of the [[National Mall]] near the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. It currently employs around 300 personnel and has trained more than 65,000 professionals since its inception.

==Mission==
The United States Institute of Peace Act, passed in 1984, calls for the Institute to "serve the people and the
Government through the widest possible range of education and training, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence".&lt;ref name="United States Institute of Peace Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title22/chapter56&amp;edition=prelim| publisher=U.S. House of Representatives | title=United States Institute of Peace Act (22 USC Ch 56, sect. 4601-4611) |

==History==
[[File:Nancy Lindborg, president, United States Institute of Peace.jpg|thumb|Nancy Lindborg, current president of USIP]]
President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the United States Institute of Peace Act in 1984.&lt;ref name="United States Institute of Peace Act"/&gt;

Spurred by a [[grassroots]] movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Senator [[Jennings Randolph]] joined Senators [[Mark Hatfield]] and [[Spark Matsunaga]] and Rep. [[Dan Glickman]] in an effort to form a national peace academy akin to the national [[US Service academies|military academies]].&lt;ref name="Below the Radar: A Federal Peace Agency"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/below-the-radar-a-federal-peace-agency/ | work=The New York Times | title=Below the Radar: A Federal Peace Agency | date=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 act creating USIP followed from a 1981 recommendation of a commission formed to examine the peace academy issue appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] and chaired by Matsunaga.

Robert F. Turner was the Institute's first president and CEO, holding that position from 1986 to 1987. He was followed by Ambassador [[Samuel W. Lewis]] (1987–1992), Ambassador [[Richard H. Solomon]], (1992–2012), and former Congressman [[Jim Marshall (Georgia politician)|Jim Marshall]] (2012–2013). Kristin Lord served as acting President (2013–2014). Nancy Lindborg was sworn in as president on February 2, 2015. In its early years, the Institute first sought to build the field of international conflict management and peacebuilding. In a 2011 letter of support for USIP, the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs noted that this analytical work has "helped to build the conflict management and resolution field, both as an area of study and as an applied science".&lt;ref name="APSIA Letter of Support"/&gt;

Under Solomon's leadership, the Institute expanded its operations in conflict zones and its training programs, initially in the Balkans and, after September 11, 2001, in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref name=Leon&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1691| title = Leon Panetta Dean Acheson Lecture: "Building Partnership in the 21st Century"| date = 28 June 2012| accessdate = 28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became the home of several congressionally mandated blue-ribbon commissions, including the Iraq Study Group, the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, and the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel. Today, the Institute conducts active programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, South Sudan, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Peace-Building That Pays Off"/&gt;

In 1996, Congress authorized the [[US Navy|Navy]] to transfer jurisdiction of the federal land—a portion of its Potomac Annex facility on what has been known as [[Old Naval Observatory|Navy Hill]]—to become the site of the permanent USIP headquarters, across the street from the National Mall at 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW, in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/entertainment/MI51121/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130209135333/http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/entertainment/MI51121/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-02-09 | work = Associated Press | title = Peace institute approved to begin construction on National Mall | date = 2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its construction, the Institute leased office space in downtown Washington. Construction of the headquarters building concluded in 2011.

==Budget==
[[File:U4u at USIP.jpg|thumb|A USIP event]]
USIP is funded annually by the U.S. Congress. For fiscal year 2012 Congress provided $39 million.&lt;ref name="H.R.2055 -- Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.2055.enr: | title = H.R.2055 -- Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 | date = 23 December 2011 | accessdate = 28 November 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, USIP receives funds transferred from government agencies, such as the Department of State, [[USAID]], and the Department of Defense. By law, USIP is prohibited from receiving private gifts and contributions for its program activities. The restriction on private fundraising was lifted for the public-private partnership to construct the USIP headquarters.

===Budget debate===
An op-ed in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on February 16, 2011, by Republican congressman [[Jason Chaffetz]] of Utah and former Democratic congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] of New York, attacked funding for USIP as part of the broader debate about federal spending. "The USIP is a case study in how government waste thrives", they wrote. "The idea began during the Cold War as a modest proposal with $4 million in seed money. But the organization received government funding year after year essentially because it had been funded the year before—and because it had important allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703703804576144723935786138 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Jason | last1=Chaffetz | first2=Anthony | last2=Weiner | title=Small Budget Cuts Add Up | date=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[U.S. Central Command]] Commander [[Anthony Zinni]] wrote an  op-ed, published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on March 7, 2011, in support of USIP. "Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does more with less. The institute's entire budget would not pay for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of a fighter plane, and wouldn't sustain even 40 American troops in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building is financed as part of national security programs, and is recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense spending and diplomacy. The institute's share of the proposed international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the State Department's budget, and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Pentagon's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/opinion/08zinni.html | work=The New York Times | first=Anthony C. | last=Zinni | title=Why Congress Should Keep Financing the U.S. Institute of Peace | date=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2011, the House of Representatives for the 112th [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] voted to eliminate all funding for the U.S. Institute of Peace in FY 2011 continuing resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/02/17/house-votes-to-cut-all-funding-for-us-institute-of-peace/ | work=The Raw Story | title=House votes to cut all funding for US Institute of Peace | first=Eric| last=Dolan| date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_131/ornstein_institute_peace_target_spending_war-206090-1.html?zkMobileView=false | work=Roll Call | title=U.S. Institute of Peace is Target in Spending War | first=Norman| last=Ornstein| date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the Institute was eventually restored by both the House and Senate on April 14, 2011, through the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011.&lt;ref name="H.R.1473 -- Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1473.enr:| title = H.R.1473 -- Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011| date = 14 April 2011| accessdate = 28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and leadership==

==Projects==
[[File:Education Alliance Symposium.jpg|thumb|Education Alliance Symposium]]
===Peace Tech Lab===
The Peace Tech Lab is a 501(C)3 spun out of United States Institute of Peace in 2014. It created the Lab as a separate entity to further advance its core mission to prevent, mitigate, and reduce violent conflict around the world. The Lab continues USIP's work developing technology and media tools for peacebuilding. In real terms, the Lab brings together engineers, technologists, and data scientists from industry and academia, along with experts in peacebuilding from USIP, other government agencies, NGOs and the conflict zones. These experts collaborate to design, develop, and deploy new and existing technology tools for conflict management and peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peace Tech Lab: Areas of Focus|url=http://www.peacetechlab.org/areas-of-focus/|access-date=2015-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224102605/http://www.peacetechlab.org/areas-of-focus|archive-date=2014-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convened tribes in Iraq===
In Iraq in 2007, USIP helped broker the initial peace agreement that is seen as the turning point in the war there. USIP experts were asked to assist the U.S. Army's [[10th Mountain Division]] in the reconciliation effort in [[Mahmoudiyah, Iraq|Mahmoudiya]], located in what was known as "the Triangle of Death" in Iraq's western [[Anbar Province]]. USIP was seen{{By whom|date=August 2017}} as a neutral player that was able to convene Sunni tribal leaders, Iraq's Shiite government leaders, and senior members of the U.S. military. Soon after the meeting, attacks and casualties declined significantly. The agreement led to a reduction of the U.S. military presence there from a brigade-level unit of about 3,500 soldiers to a battalion-level unit of about 650. General [[David Petraeus]], the senior commander in Iraq, noted that the turnabout was "striking". Petraeus also said that USIP "is a great asset in developing stronger [[unity of effort]] between civilian and military elements of government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1673698,00.html | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| title=A Local Peace Accord: Cause for Hope? | first=Darrin | last=Mortenson | date=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq Study Group===
{{Main|Iraq Study Group}}
The U.S. government used USIP to help convene the bipartisan Iraq Study Group in 2006 that studied the conflict in Iraq and recommended ways forward. USIP facilitated the group's trip to Iraq and hosted several meetings of the group. According to USIP, the group's political neutrality made it an appropriate entity to host the group's sensitive deliberations. The effort was undertaken at the urging of several members of Congress with agreement of the White House. A final report was released to Congress, the White House, and the public on December 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/programs/initiatives/iraq-study-group | work=U.S. Institute of Peace| title=The Iraq Study Group | accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--SECONDARY SOURCE NEEDED HERE.--&gt;

===Genocide Prevention Task Force===
In Fall 2008, U.S. Institute of Peace, the U.S. [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]], and the [[American Academy of Diplomacy]] jointly convened the [[Genocide Prevention Task Force]] to "spotlight genocide prevention as a national priority and to develop practical policy recommendations to enhance the capacity of the U.S. government to respond to emerging threats of genocide and mass atrocities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/programs/initiatives/genocide-prevention-task-force | work=U.S. Institute of Peace| title=Genocide Prevention Task Force | accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14-member task force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/genocide-prevention-task-force/members | work=U.S. Institute of Peace| title=Genocide Prevention Task Force | accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-chaired by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] and former Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]], outlined "a national blueprint to prevent genocide and mass atrocities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/opinion/21albright.html | work=The New York Times | title=Never again, for real | date=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, the task force released its report "Preventing Genocide: A Blueprint for U.S. Policymakers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://media.usip.org/reports/genocide_taskforce_report.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Genocide Prevention Task Force |work=Genocide |date=December 8, 2008 |page= |accessdate=2011-08-03 |title=Preventing Genocide: A Blueprint for U.S. Policymakers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911040022/http://media.usip.org/reports/genocide_taskforce_report.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing its recommendations and guidelines.

On August 4, 2011, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced a proclamation suspending U.S. entry to individuals active in "serious human rights and humanitarian law violations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

===Preventing electoral violence in Sudan===
Ahead of [[Sudan]]'s April 2010 [[Sudanese general election, 2010|national elections]] (the first since 1986) and the January 2011 [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|South Sudanese independence referendum]], USIP staff traveled to some of the more unstable regions to help prepare people for the elections. Amid heightened tensions, USIP experts focused on improving cultural awareness, citizenship skills, and training Sudanese on electoral violence triggers—all critical steps to ensure that the polls did not turn violent. The elections and referendum were held with relatively no bloodshed and were widely deemed a success. Building upon USIP's successful electoral violence prevention training, USIP is implementing a series of violence prevention workshops throughout the country post-election and post-referendum.

===Publication of ''The Iran Primer''===
''The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy'' "offers a comprehensive but concise overview of [[Iran]]'s politics, economy, military, foreign policy, and nuclear program". It convenes 50 experts to discuss Iran's evolving relationship with the West and "chronicles [[Iran–United States relations|U.S.-Iran relations]] under six American presidents and probes five options for dealing with Iran". ''The Iran Primer'' is edited by USIP staff member [[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/publications/the-iran-primer ''The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy''].

{{Main|United States Institute of Peace Headquarters}}
In March 2011, USIP moved into its [[United States Institute of Peace Headquarters|permanent headquarters]] facility at the northwest corner of the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C. Designed by [[Moshe Safdie]] Architects and [[Buro Happold]], the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building aims to serve as symbol of America's commitment to peacebuilding. The building houses offices and staff support facilities, a library, a conference center, auditorium, classrooms, and a public education center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/at-us-institute-of-peace-buildings-provocative-design-doesnt-entirely-succeed/2012/02/21/gIQADOxOYR_story.html | work=The Washington Post | title=At U.S. Institute of Peace, building's provocative design doesn't entirely succeed | first=Roger | last=Lewis | date=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials broke ground for the new headquarters in June 2008 at a ceremony that included President [[George W.

==Criticism==
{{Outdated|section|date=November 2018}}
Sarah Diamond and Richard Hatch, writing in the July/August 1990 issue of [[Left-wing politics in the United States|leftist]] publication ''[[Z Magazine]]'', stated that the supposed peace research "looks more like the study of new and potential means of aggression," through trade embargoes, austerity programs, and electoral intervention. When it was established in 1984, its board looked like a "'who's who' of right-wing ideologues from academia and the Pentagon," and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency may assign officers and employees to the Institute. Nearly half its board played a role in Iran-contra operations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The first president was Robert F. Turner, who worked for the State Department arguing for increased aid to the Nicaraguan contras.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Sarah; Hatch, Richard (July/August 1990).

Linguist and political critic [[Noam Chomsky]] described the USIP's decision to release the [[Trump administration]]’s 2018 [[National Military Strategy|National Defense Strategy]] on its website as a case where "lacking a sense of irony, the bureaucracy is quite happy to caricature Orwell."&lt;ref name="Polychroniou2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Polychroniou |first1=CJ |title=Noam Chomsky: Moral Depravity Defines US Politics |url=https://truthout.org/articles/noam-chomsky-moral-depravity-defines-us-politics/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=[[Truthout]] |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China''''' is a 1933 non-fiction book by [[Ralph Townsend]] which presents Townsend's observations on the state of then-contemporary China. The book is considered an [[Sinophobia|anti-Chinese]] polemic.

A harsh critique of Chinese society and culture, ''Ways That Are Dark'' was written at a time when China was in the grip of considerable civil strife. Townsend claimed that the source of China's problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people. Although the book was a bestseller in the United States, it met with highly polarized reactions from its supporters and detractors. Though praised by some periodicals, it was denounced by missionaries and sinologists, including [[Owen Lattimore]] who condemned it as "a general indictment of a whole race". It was banned by the government of China.

After World War II, the book fell into obscurity. It was reprinted in 1997 by the white nationalist publisher [[Barnes Review]] and subsequently gained renewed popularity in Japan in 2004 when a Japanese translation was published.

==Background==
''Ways That Are Dark'' is based on its author's experience of living in China for more than one year.{{vague|reason = "more than One year" should mean at least two years, but if it does, the number of years should be specified. Failure to so specify suggests that what was intended is this: a time that exceeds the year by several months. The existing wording is unacceptable in either case, and if the cited source turns out to fail to provide meaningful precision, we should stop trying to report on duration|date=May 2018}} Townsend had worked as a journalist and educator in New York before joining the [[United States Foreign Service]] on 16 December 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Martell et al., ''Who Was Who Among English and European Authors, 1931-1949'' (Detroit: Gale Research Co., 1978), 1411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="service list"&gt;The Department of State, ''Foreign Service List 1932'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1932), 62, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a vice-consul in Shanghai between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932 and then in Fuzhou until 1 March 1933.&lt;ref name="service list"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Consulates Will Close," ''New York Times'', 5 February 1933, N1.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on 10 November 1933 by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]].&lt;ref name="new york"/&gt;

==Summary of contents==
In his introduction, Townsend describes the book as "an honest attempt to present the facts as they are, however unpleasant" and a counterbalance to the "maudlin sentiment" and "misinformation" of other writers on China who have made "fatuous attempts to sprinkle bright hopes over dark facts."{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=ii-xiv}} He notes that while China's virtues will speak for themselves, "in appraising a stranger with whom we are to deal, it is important to know his shortcomings".{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=ii-xiv}}

[[File:Shanghai 1928 Bund Cenotaph.jpeg|thumb|right|A 1928 photograph of the Bund of Shanghai where Townsend starts his story]]In the first two chapters he describes the atrocious conditions he witnessed in China. Shanghai is depicted as a squalid, noisy, and polluted den of crime, poverty, and disease, and yet still comparatively wealthy compared to the rest of the country.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=3-11}} The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure, is mostly unsafe for travel, and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=41-43}}

Townsend had asserted in chapter one that the cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=26}} and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own".{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=88}} Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another".{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=90-100}} The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their "indifference to fellow suffering".{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=51-52}} Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only people in the world who are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=53-59}} Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice,  lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=73-80, 102-115}} Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=57, 81, 87}} He concludes that the "outstanding characteristics" of the Chinese people "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves."{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=82}}

In chapters five and six Townsend discusses US-funded charitable organizations in China, especially missions. He points out that although the United States had given at least $160 million in philanthropy to China,{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=192}} these charities in China, even secular hospitals and schools, are generally preyed upon by the very Chinese people who the charitable workers seek to help.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=149-150}} These charities are subject to rampant looting, arson, and murderous mob violence by Chinese people who their government refuses to prosecute.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=169-180}} Much of this violence is incited by the anti-foreigner propaganda of the [[Kuomintang|KMT]], a party described as being "worse than the Ku Klux Klan at its most degenerate stage", and through US aid to China Townsend suggests that America is actually bankrolling propaganda against itself.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=167-168}} Though the missionaries are sincere and hard-working, Townsend finds that they suffer from extreme delusion over the ultimate futility of their goal of reforming the Chinese.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=131-147}} The missionaries, he states, have willfully ignored overwhelming evidence that no degree of care or education can uproot the intrinsic sickness of Chinese culture.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=190-196}} He calls for an end to all missionary and charitable work in China.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=197-198}}

[[File:Opium field in Fuzhou.jpg|thumb|right|Opium field photographed in 1932 not far from Townsend's home in Fuzhou]]In chapter seven Townsend details the sheer horror of China's ongoing civil war. Among the factions competing for power in China, Townsend believes that none of them, neither the leaders nor their men, have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=199-202, 208}} With every man only out for himself and "China's microscopically few good men... too weak to be felt",{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=224}} Townsend predicts no end to the chaos.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=244}} Much of the violence, Townsend explains in chapter eight, is fuelled by opium, the addiction of one out of every eight Chinese.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=249-250, 255-256}} Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies, to such an extent that many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food, and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=251-254, 265-267}} In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords, in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China. The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal, brave, reliable, honest, and cleanly people, and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=271-274}} Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the [[Shanghai Incident]] of 1932, which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression,{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=291-295}} and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the "foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese" waged by [[Zhang Xueliang]].{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=279-280}} Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] as "a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there" which has achieved "stability and well-being for millions".{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=303}} Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan's role in dealing with an unruly China.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=287}}

Finally, in chapter ten Townsend affirms that the "backward Chinese" are America’s "only legitimate problem in Asia"{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=322}} and asks what can be done to deal with a nation that spends aid money corruptly, does not respect its loans, mistreats and attacks foreigners, ignores international drug laws, will not protect foreign investment, and does not engage in productive diplomacy with other nations.{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=311, 317, 331}} He warns Americans that the Chinese see kindness only as weakness and thus can never respond to any type of [[positive reinforcement]]. "For every Chinese, from highest to lowest," he argues, "all the acts of life are concentrated upon extracting, from those who mean nothing to him, what he can for the benefit of himself and his clan."{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=315}} By contrast, he believes that the Chinese do understand force and respect strength. Therefore, he advocates that the United States forgo naive "sentimentalist" thinking and adopt a policy of "stern insistence upon our rights without cruel abuse of our strength",{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=307-309}} including withholding further loans without strict conditions and holding on to [[Concessions in China|foreign concessions]] and [[extraterritoriality]].{{sfn|Townsend|1933|pages=310, 323-327}}

==Reception==
''Ways That Are Dark'' hit the bestsellers list in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"Best Sellers Here and Elsewhere," ''New York Times'', 3 September 1934, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="banned"&gt;"American's Book Banned in China," ''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', 26 January 1935, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Robesonian]]'' noted that the book "was given lavish praise and bitter abuse by some of the leading newspapers in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0bk_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SFcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5311%2C6648277 "Native of Robeson Well Known Author, Lecturer,"] ''The Robesonian'', 1 February 1934, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was advertised as doing "for China what [[Katherine Mayo]] did for [[Mother India (book)|Mother India]]",&lt;ref name="new york"&gt;''New York Times'', 10 November 1933, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine described it as "a sensationally unorthodox and unvarnished picture of the Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, "Some Recent Books on International Relations," ''Foreign Affairs'', April 1934, 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise===
[[File:Owen Lattimore.jpg|thumb|right|Owen Lattimore denounced the book as "a general indictment of a whole race"]]E. Francis Brown, writing for ''Current History'', approved of the book's comprehensive and frank discussion of conditions within China. Though the book takes a strongly negative stance towards China, Brown argued that "this very unfriendliness makes the book a welcome antidote to much that has been written in recent years and some of its conclusions might be well pondered by those who shape America's Far Eastern Policy."&lt;ref&gt;E. Francis Brown, "Books of the Month: National and International Problems - The Truth About China," ''Current History'', January 1934, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willis J. Abbot]] of the ''Christian Science Monitor'' especially praised Townsend's study of the social life and customs of the Chinese and claimed that "Any capable observer with a few weeks at his disposal in China will corroborate much that appears in this volume."&lt;ref&gt;Willis J. Abbot, "Ways That Are Oriental," ''Christian Science Monitor'', 16 December 1933, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; His praise was echoed by [[Douglas Francis Jerrold|Douglas Jerrold]] of ''[[The English Review]]'' who found the work "brilliant and outspoken".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Jerrold, "Current Comments," ''The English Review'', September 1934, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative criticism===
By contrast, Lewis S. Gannett of ''[[The Nation]]'' criticized Townsend for writing an "apology for Japan" and painting the Chinese as "all alike, all generically different from Japanese and Westerners".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis S. Gannett, "The 'Truth' About China," ''The Nation'', 20 December 1933, 715.&lt;/ref&gt; A similarly negative assessment published in ''The China Weekly Review'' observed that "A Chinese might easily write a similar book and by emphasizing the activities of the Capones and Dillingers, the bootleggers, kidnappers and racketeers, prove to his own satisfaction at least that the Americans constituted a degenerate branch of the white race."&lt;ref name="dark"&gt;"Townsend and the Ways That Are Dark," ''The China Weekly Review'', 2 June 1934, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Worst Books on China and Japan Since 1931," ''The China Weekly Review'', 13 January 1934, 266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]]'' concluded its review of the book with "Throughout the presentation of his observations runs a thread of ill-considered bias which taints his words. We must look to other... more discerning writers for the truth about China."&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese 'Ways That Are Dark'," ''The Republican'', 24 December 1933, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent sinologists were also critical of the work. In the pages of ''The New York Times'', Owen Lattimore condemned ''Ways That Are Dark'' as "a general indictment of a whole race" which lacks insight, contains factual errors, and relies on second-hand accounts. He stated that the book would "only convince people who are convinced already."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Lattimore, "A Long Way From The Whole Truth About China," ''New York Times'', 10 December 1933, BR9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel Peffer]] likewise denounced the book as "a rehash of all the old patter of the outport hotel lobbies, with all its half-truths, inaccuracies, provincialism, ignorance and sometimes crassness... [Townsend] has not managed to observe accurately the most simple and superficial things."&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Peffer, "Book Review," ''Books'', 3 December 1933, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Otway Percy Bland|JOP Bland]], though deeming Townsend's conclusions "as a whole... unconvincing", at least found the chapter on opium "particularly instructive."&lt;ref&gt;John Otway Percy Bland, "Ways That Are Dark," ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 2 August 1934, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also among the book's detractors were missionaries, whom Townsend had criticized. They reviewed the book negatively in a variety of periodicals, including ''The Chinese Recorder'', which accused Townsend of having "gathered a lot of stories and put them together in a clever, cynical and unusually warped way".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Rawlinson, "Our Book Table - Ways That Are Dark," ''The Chinese Recorder'', March 1934, 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other negative reviews appeared in ''The Missionary Review of the World'',&lt;ref&gt;"Our Missionary Bookshelf - Ways That Are Dark," ''The Missionary Review of the World'', December 1934, 603.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The China Christian Year Book'',&lt;ref&gt;National Christian Council of China, ''The China Christian Year Book 1933'' (Shanghai: Christian Literature Society, 1934), 395.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Missionary Herald at Home and Abroad''.&lt;ref&gt;"Book Chat - The Real Truth About China?!," ''The Missionary Herald at Home and Abroad'', February 1934, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ways That Are Dark'' continues to be noted for its Sinophobic viewpoint. In 1985 the historian Frank P. Mintz called it "a classic in the literature of [[Sinophobia]]."&lt;ref name="mintz"&gt;Frank P. Mintz, ''Revisionism and the Origins of [[Pearl Harbor]]'' (Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1985), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the scholar Yong Chen referred to Townsend's attitude towards the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people as being derivative of "the anti-Chinese prejudice that nineteenth-century writers had propagated."&lt;ref&gt;Yong Chen, ''Chinese San Francisco, 1850-1943: A Trans-Pacific Community'' (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2000), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the writer Gregory Clark described it as "a viciously anti-China book" that "contrasts an allegedly dirty, devious Chinese nation with the trustworthy, hardworking Japanese".&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2004/10/11/commentary/new-mindset-is-the-only-salve|title=New mindset is the only salve|author=Gregory Clark|publisher=''The Japan Times''|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the book was originally to be called "Chinese Merry-Go-Round",&lt;ref&gt;"Book Notes," ''New York Times'', 4 September 1933, BR10.&lt;/ref&gt; the title under which it was ultimately published is a quote from [[Bret Harte]]'s poem "[[The Heathen Chinee]]".&lt;ref name="jefferson"&gt;Nattie Vest, "Books," ''Jefferson Herald'', 2 July 1936, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Though "The Heathen Chinee" had been used a rallying cry by opponents of Chinese immigration to the United States, Harte had intended it as a parody of the anti-Chinese bigotry prevalent in the United States of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Scharnhorst, "'Ways That Are Dark': Appropriations of Bret Harte's 'Plain Language from Truthful James'," ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', December 1996, 377–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political responses===
The Japanese Army and Navy strongly approved of the book and several thousand copies of it were bought by the [[Ministry of War of Japan|War Ministry]] and [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Naval Ministry]] who by the beginning of 1934 were distributing the books for free to foreign journalists and officials.&lt;ref name="dark"/&gt; By contrast, the [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist Government of China]] responded by banning Townsend's book throughout China from 1935.&lt;ref name="banned"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Post Office Department, ''United States Official Postal Guide: Part II International Postal Service'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1940), 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the journalist George Moorad reported that in 1946 Chinese communists distributed contraband copies of the book to American [[China Marines]] in the hopes of disillusioning them about conditions in China.&lt;ref&gt;George Moorad, ''Lost Peace in China'' (New York: EP Dutton, 1949), 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in Japanese translation==
[[File:Ralph Townsend.jpg|thumb|right|Ralph Townsend]]''Ways That Are Dark'' was already in its fifth printing by 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Limin Chu, "China and Sino-US Relations, 1900-1930: The Overland Monthly," ''Sino-American Relations: An International Quarterly'', Summer 2001, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1942 Townsend was imprisoned for having accepted money from the [[Japanese Committee on Trade and Information]] between 1937 and 1940 without [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|registering as a foreign agent]].&lt;ref&gt;"Writer Guilty As Jap Agent," ''The Washington Post'', 28 March 1942, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was not re-printed again until the white supremacist magazine [[Barnes Review]] published a new edition in 1997.&lt;ref name="fuyo"&gt;Hideo Tanaka, "ラルフ・タウンゼントの思想が現代にうったえてくるもの," in ''暗黒大陸中国の真実'', (Tokyo: Fuyo Shobo, 2007), 307-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barnes Review edition was subsequently translated into Japanese in 2004 by a pair of Japanese translators, Hideo Tanaka and Kenkichi Sakita, and became an instant success, selling out 10 successive re-printings before 2007 when it was reissued as a mass market paperback.&lt;ref name="fuyo"/&gt; Gregory Clark noted that the Japanese edition of ''Ways That Are Dark'', which was entitled ''Ankoku Tairiku Chūgoku no Shinjitsu'' ("The Truth About the Dark Continent China"),&lt;ref name="yomiuri"/&gt; had garnered widespread popularity among members of the Japanese right-wing.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;

Tanaka, one of the translators of the book, praised Townsend in ''[[Shokun!]]'' magazine for his "penetrating insight" in reporting "starkly and vividly on the true nature of the Chinese that he had witnessed firsthand".&lt;ref&gt;Hideo Tanaka, "暗黒大陸中国の真実," ''Shokun!'', October 2004, 240-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Sakita, the other translator, likewise lauded the book in an article written for [[Nobukatsu Fujioka]]'s Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History. Sakita called the book "essential reading to understand what China really is" and argued that Townsend's ideas continue to offer important lessons in conducting Sino-Japanese relations today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiyuushikan.org/rekishi/rekishi87.html|title=中国の実態を知る必読の書|author=Kenkichi Sakita|publisher=''Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History''|year=2004|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also reviewed positively by the newspaper ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]''.&lt;ref name="yomiuri"&gt;Yoshiyuki Kasai, "外交官が見た戦前の中国," ''Yomiuri Shimbun'', 22 August 2004, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
